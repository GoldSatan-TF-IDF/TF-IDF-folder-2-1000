harry turtledove the man with the iron heart before may outskirts of prague the big green mercedes convertible bore a number plate of stark simplicity ss the reichsprotektor of bohemia and moravia sped from his country estate toward the castle of prague german soldiers in field gray and czech guards in tobacco brown would salute him when he arrived czech president hacha also had his offices in the castle but his will was as nothing when set against the reichsprotektors everyone knew itincluding hacha reinhard heydrich glanced at his watch step on it klein he said irritably were running late right sir oberscharfuhrer johannes klein answered with a silent sigh if they were late the senior noncom knew it wasnt more than thirty seconds heydrich didnt tolerate tardinessor much of anything else klein checked his own wrist not even half past ten yet like a lot of big wheels heydrich bitched for the sake of bitching he might look like the perfect aryantall and lean blond and handsome he might be a firstclass fencer and pilot and violinist he had some little old lady in him all the same they came to a corner a minute later slow down heydrich said the trolleys pulling up i see it herr reichsprotektor klein sighed out loud this time you couldnt win i see those worthless layabouts whove been hanging around the stop the past couple of days too bums to him all czechs were bums till proved otherwise they look like men with jobs heydrich said thats a new overcoat the one of them has on whats he doing with it klein asked the czech fumbled with something in an inside pocket he got hold of it and pulled it out a submachine gun an ugly brutally effective british sten he aimed it at heydrichs chest and pulled the trigger however effective stens usually were this particular tin tommy gun jammed the czech looked horrified he jerked at the cocking handle and yelled something inflammatory in his own language jesus christ heydrich yelled and then halt he stood up in the passenger side of the car and drew the pistol he wore on his belt the hammer clicked uselesslythe luger wasnt loaded heydrich said something that had to be worse than what came out of the czechs mouth oberscharfuhrer klein had to fight not to piss himselfand not to giggle like a schoolgirl nobodys weapon wanted to work was this a fight to the death or a low farce then perhaps with the instincts hed picked up flying a on the eastern front heydrich thought to check six when he looked behind him he saw the other czech whod been hanging around this corner sneaking up on the car gun it hans heydrich shouted kleins big booted foot mashed down on the accelerator the mercedes was heavy but it leaped ahead as if somebodyd goosed it the second czech threw something a bomb of some sortit had to be it burst a few meters behind the hurtling auto heydrich yelped and swore and jerked his left hand blood ran down his palm and dripped from his fingers to the mercedes rubber floor mat he tried to make a fist then yelped again and thought better of it only after klein flung the car around a couple of corners did the reichsprotektor think to ask are you all right the driver reached up to touch his left ear his gloved hand came away red just a scratch he paused a few seconds i think weve got away from the stinking bastards ja if more of them arent lying in wait for us again heydrich needed a moment to add you did well uh thanks klein sounded a little shaky heydrich supposed he did too anybody who suddenly got dropped into combat was liable to the driver went on hows your hand shall i get you to a hospital heydrich was already wrapping a handkerchief around the wound no dont bother ill live he said take me on to the castle a doctorll be on duty there or we can send for one and then he stopped in grim anticipation then what sir klein asked then we peel this pesthole of a townthis pesthole of a countryto catch the assassins heydrich answered we dont overlook wrongs from czechsnever any more than we let jews get away with anything inside the reich we dont let anybody get away with anything klein saida good enough rule for the way germany ruled heydrich nodded he tried to close his hand again no luck it hurt too much blood was soaking through the handkerchief no we dont he agreed and when somebody tries we make him pay february berlin the reich was in mourning after the fall of stalingrad taverns theaters movie housesall closed at the fuhrers order funereal music played on every radio station reinhard heydrich thought hed kick in a receiver if he heard ich hatt ein kamerad one more time oberscharfuhrer klein pulled up in front of ss headquarters here you go sir he said right heydrich got out of the mercedes convertible not a trace of the damage from the assassination attempt remained visible on the car the czech repairmen whod worked on the mercedes would have answered with their necks if any had guards stiffened to attention as heydrich approached in ss obergruppenfuhrers uniform with the sd patch on his lower left sleeve his slim athletic figure was one to conjure with state your name and business sir the young officer who made the demand knew damn well whoand whatheydrich was his voice wouldnt have wobbled if he hadnt after naming himself heydrich paused a moment for effect before continuing i am here for an appointment with the reichsfuhrerss yes sir the youngster said and his voice wobbled again if hed had an appointment with heinrich himmler he would have been in more trouble than he could imagine a parish priest was an honorable part of the catholic church but that didnt mean he expected to get an audience with the pope gathering himself the officer told off two of his men to escort heydrich to himmlers office somebody inside headquarters had a radio on sure as hell it was playing ich hatt ein kamerad heydrich fumed he couldnt do anything more not when one of the blackuniformed men walking with him said terrible thing what happened in the east yes heydrich said terrible and it was the whole sixth armygone germany was in plenty of trouble in the rest of southern russia too heydrich was still sick of that goddamn song hastily the trooper added but well lick em anyway wont we sir you could get in trouble for showing defeatism in these nervous times you could get in trouble for almost anything more guards stood in front of the door to the reichsfuhrers sanctum heydrichs escorts handed him off to them then went back toward the entrance with every sign of relief youre right on time herr obergruppenfuhrer one of himmlers guards said i should hope so heydrich was affronted if he was ever late he made whoever caused the lateness sorry that he might be late through no fault of anyone elses never crossed his mind the guards brought him into himmlers office at a nod from their chief they disappeared good day reinhard himmler said how are you he used the familiar pronoun well enough sir thanks and you heydrich used the formal pronoun he always had with himmler even if theyd worked hand in glove for years he expected he always would it was a funny business heydrich knew he could tear himmler to pieces if he wanted to himmler was on the pudgy side hed never been very hard physically the round almost chinless face behind the pincenez could have belonged to a chicken farmer or a schoolmaster to the man who led the outfit that vied with berias nkvd for deadliness it seemed unlikely but it was true and therein lay the rub himmler might not look like anything much when he spoke though people listened having listened they obeyed if they didnt they quickly departed the land of the living himmler the mildmannered bureaucrat had even bureaucratized death and because he had he could intimidate an outwardly tougher man like heydrich and himmler had another hold on the reichsprotektor there were rumors of jews in heydrichs family tree heydrichs fathers mothers second husband had been named suss hed even looked jewish though he hadnt been a private genealogist had confirmed that and the ss had accepted it further back though there was an unexplained birnbaum if himmler decided that what had been accepted should be rejected a bead of sweat trickled down heydrichs back it seemed to burn like acid he deliberately slowed his breathing to his relief his heart stopped fluttering he couldnt let himmler intimidate him not today his mission was too important not for himself but for the reich the reich think of the reich not of yourself as long as that was his lodestone hed be all right he hoped himmler steepled his fingers well reinhard what brings you up from prague today his voice was fussy and precise like a schoolmasters one more deep breath forcing his voice to steadiness heydrich asked herr reichsfuhrer what do you think of germanys war prospects in the light of recent developments himmlers right eyebrow twitchedonly a couple of millimeters but enough to notice whatever he might have expected that wasnt it he usually chose his words with care he seemed especially careful now answering in view of our ah misfortune at stalingrad this may not be the best time to ask it isnt just stalingrad herr reichsfuhrer heydrich said himmlers eyebrow twitched again he also hadnt expected himmler to persist but the reichsprotektor of bohemia and moravia did the russians are taking big bites out of our positions in the east that will stop the fuhrer has personally assured me of it himmler said yes sir heydrichs agreement was more devastating than any argument could have been after letting it hang in the air he continued our allies arent worth the paper theyre printed on hungary romania italy he snapped his fingers in vast contempt the finns can fight but there arent enough of them what are you driving at reinhard himmlers tone went silky with danger are you saying the war is lost do you dare say that yes sir heydrich repeated this time himmlers eyebrow didnt just twitch it leaped heydrich had put his lifenot only his career but his lifein the reichsfuhrers hands having done so he explained why the east is coming undone maybe we can patch it up but i dont think so and even if we canthe english and americans are going to drive us out of africa we cant supply our troops therethats been plain for a long time and after they do sicilys one short hop away italy is one more can you tell me im wrong is the castle in prague haunted you talk like a man whos seen a ghost himmler said i wish it were herr reichsfuhrer i wish i had heydrich said instead ive spent too damned much time looking at maps he paused then added the bombings getting worse too isnt it and how do you know that himmler asked quietly because now we have to talk about it in the papers and on the radio heydrich answered we cant pretend it isnt happening any more everybody knows it is wed only look like idiots if we ignored it dr goebbels is many things an idiot he is not himmler spoke with a certain regret the great lords of party and state were rivals as well as colleagues heydrich nodded i know and so herr reichsfuhrer i ask you again what do you think of our war prospects the leader of the ss didnt answer directly instead he said we cant lose this war we mustnt if we do it will make what we went through in look like a kiss on the cheek bolshevik hordes storming into germany he shuddered at the idea and i dont imagine we could get terms before the enemy crossed our western border either the way we did last time no sir i wouldnt think so heydrich agreed and if we are invaded if we are occupiedwhat do we do then i think id rather take poison than live to see the day himmler said heydrich looked atlooked throughhim he seldom held a moral advantage over the reichsfuhrerss but he did now sir wouldnt it be better to fight to keep on fighting i mean even if the armed forces get ground down i dont believe it i wont believe it himmler broke in devil of a lot of ivans devil of a lot of americans too heydrich said and the amis can bomb us and we cant bomb them too damned many englishmen with them and all the jews in washington and moscow and london will want revenge on the reich and the fuhrer you know what was decided at wannsee a year ago no one at that conference had come right out and said germany aimed to get rid of all the jews in the territory she held nobodyd needed to the high functionaries had understood what was what so did himmler of course can you imagine the circus theyd have if they took the fuhrer alive heydrich asked softly that turned out to be a keen shot keener than hed expected imagining himmler looked almost physically ill it must not happen he choked out maybe he was also imagining the circus the allies would have if they took him alive and maybeno certainlyhe had reason to heydrich had had imaginings like that more often than he liked since the czechs almost assassinated him i hope it doesnt i pray it doesnt he said now but this is warwar to the finish war to the knife shouldnt we be ready for anything even the possibility of the worst what exactly have you got in mind the reichsfuhrer asked himmlers voice was almost back to normal almost but not quite youll know sir probably better than i do how much trouble the russian partisans have given the wehrmacht heydrich said and the waffenss himmler put in several of our formations are in action behind the lines against those devils yes sir and the waffenss heydrich agreed and the soviets improvised those bands on the spur of the moment after the war broke out against them a year and a half ago how much grief could we give enemy occupiers if we started preparing now this instant setting aside weapons and training men to fight as partisans if the worst comes the more we did in advance the more ready wed be if god forbid they had to do what wed trained them for himmler didnt answer for some little while he plucked at his lower lip with thumb and forefinger that lip was oddly full oddly sensuous for the hardboiled leader of an even more hardboiled outfit at last he said this is not a plan i can deliver to the fuhrer he remains unshakably convinced we shall emerge victorious in spite of everything i hope hes right heydrich knew he couldnt very well say anything else so do i of course by the way himmler said it he wasnt optimistic no matter what he hoped but dont you think its something that needs doing heydrich persisted it might not be something we could manage to scrape together at the last minute with everything going to the devil around us if wed taken moscow the first autumn and hanged stalin in front of the kremlin what would the soviet partisan movement be worth now himmler plucked at his red lower lip again he let it spring back into place with a soft liquid plop after another pause he said if we were to go forward with these preparations it would be an ss undertaking aber naturlich herr reichsfuhrer heydrich exclaimed this is the sss proper business the wehrmacht fights ordinary battles in ordinary ways we need to be able to do that too but we also need to be able to do whatever else the state may require of us jaaaa himmler let the word stretch seen through the pincenez his stare didnt seem too dangerousif you didnt know him unfortunately heydrich did the reichsfuhrerss said since you propose this project do you expect to head it yes sir heydrich answered without the least hesitation ive been thinking about it for some timesince things ah first went wrong last fall at stalingrad and in north africa even if worse comes to worst it would give us the chance to do the enemy a great deal of harm in the end it might save the reich despite what would ordinarily be reckoned a defeat do you think so himmler looked and sounded unconvinced but heydrich nodded i do especially in the west the enemy is basically soft how much stomach will he have for occupying a country where his soldiers arent safe outside their barracksor inside them either if we can smuggle in a bomb with a time fuse hmm himmler murmured he plucked once more plopthe lip snapped back heydrich thought the mannerism disgusting but couldnt very well say so pluck plop finally the reichsfuhrer said well youve given me a good deal to think about i can hardly deny that well see what comes of it the longer we wait the more trouble well have doing it properly heydrich warned i understand that himmler said testily i have to make sure i can get it moving withoutundue difficulties though as you say sir heydrich was all obedience all subordination why not himmler played the cards close to his chest but heydrich was pretty sure hed won after i lichtenau was a little townnot much more than a villagea few miles south and west of nuremberg charlie pytlak walked down what was left of the main street a bar cradled in his arms he had the safety off and a round chambered he knew the nazis had surrendered the day before but some damnfool diehards might not have got the wordor might not care the only thing worse than getting it during the war was getting it afterwards he admired the shattered shops and houses and what had probably been a church the bright spring sun cast his shadow ahead of him wow he said with profound unoriginality we liberated the living shit out of this place didnt we bet your ass sarge said dom lombardo hed liberated a german submachine guna machine pistol the krauts called it he kicked a broken brick out of the way got any butts on you sure thing pytlak gave him a chesterfield then stuck another one in his own mouth he flicked a flame from his zippo to light both cigarettes his unshaven cheeks hollowed as he sucked in smoke he blew it out in a long stream dunno why they make me feel good but they do yeah me too lombardo agreed couldnt hardly fight a war without cigarettes and coffee i sure wouldnt want to try pytlak said i he broke off half a dozen german soldiers came around a corner a couple of them wore helmets instead of jerry field capsa sign theyd likely fought to the end one of the bastards in ragged tattered fieldgray still carried a rifle maybe he just hadnt thought to drop it or maybe hold it right there assholes pytlak barked his automatic rifle and doms schmeisser swung to cover the enemy soldiers the germans froze most of them raised their hands the guy with the mauser slowly and carefully set it down in the rubblestrewn street he straightened and reached for the sky too may was way too late to die one of the krauts jerked his chin toward the chesterfields charlie and dom were smoking he wasnt dumb enough to lower a hand to point zigarette bitte he asked plaintively his buddies nodded their eyes lighting up the past couple of years they must have been smoking hay and horseshit except for what they could take from pows i cant give em any sarge lombardo said i had to bum this one offa you fuck i dont wanna waste my smokes on these shitheads a week ago theydve tried to waste me pytlak looked the germans over they were pretty pathetic a couple of them couldnt have been more than seventeen a couple of the others were nearer fifty than forty the last twothe last two had been through the mill and then some one of them wore an iron cross first class on his left breast pocket but they were whipped too you could see it in their eyes charlie flicked the bars safety on he leaned the weapon against a wall and dug in his pocket for more cigarettes as he started toward the germans dom said ill cover you you goddamn well better ace but there was no trouble the german soldiers seemed pathetically grateful as pytlak passed around the zippo and well they might have the way things were in the ruins of the reich these days he could have got blown for half a dozen chesterfields he really was wasting them on these guys he scooped up the rifle the one guy had carried its safety was off too he took care of that then he tapped the other krauts iron cross where he asked the guy just looked at him uh wo like most gis hed picked up a few words of german ah the jerry got it kharkov he pointed east russland right charlie said tightly if you listened to the germans all of them had done all their fighting on the eastern front trouble with that was uncle joes boys fought back a hell of a lot harder than the nazis figured they would as the war wound down all the germans wanted to do was get away from the red army so they could hand themselves over to americans or englishmen well these guys had made it charlie carried the rifle back to dom and handed it to him here you can handle this and your grease gun ive gotta lug the bar around thanks a bunch dom said slinging the mauser but charlie knew he was right the schmeisser didnt weigh even half as much as a browning automatic rifle and he was a sergeant and dom nothing but a pfc what point to rank if you couldnt use it they marched the germans out of lichtenau there was a camp of sorts a couple of miles outside of town a big barbedwire cage in a field now rapidly filling up with jerries if the surrendered soldiers had to sleep out in the open and eat us army rations for a whilewell too goddamn bad a trucks carcass lay by the side of the road it wasnt a big snorting gmc model from the states but some shitty little german machine it must have been machinegunned from the air and then burned like a son of a bitch later a tank or a bulldozer shoved it to one side so it wouldnt block traffic a german in civvies was fiddling around in the wreckage wonder what hes up to charlie said scrap metalwaddaya wanna bet dom returned fucking scavengers are gonna be everywhere for months years probably yeah i guess charlie laughed we turned this whole stinking country into scrap metal and garbage just what the assholes deserved too i aint arguing dom said the pow camp looked to be getting more organized by the minute charlie had to sign a paper saying hed brought in six krauts the corporal who manned a typewriter actually gave him a receipt for them the fuckm i supposed to do with this pytlak asked i feel like i just got into the slavetrading business hang on to it the typist said we need to ask you anything about these guys now we can hot damn charlie said and then jesus i gotta figure out how many points i have sooner i get out of the army happier ill be you earned discharge points for time in the service for time overseas for medals for campaign stars on theater ribbons and for kids under eighteen back home eightyfive would bring you home till now pytlak hadnt worried about them much but the war was over that still took getting used to damned if it didnt and damned if i wanna hang around on occupation duty either he thought dont get hot and bothered man the typist advised him theyre gonna ship all our asses to the pacific so we can punch hirohitos ticket for him too charlies reply was detailed and profane dom also chimed in with some relevant opinions the corporal just grinned hed got under their skins so he won the round the really evil thing was on top of that he was liable to be right finally in disgust pytlak said im gone next to this crap lichtenau looks goddamn good you with me dom oh hell yes lombardo said they were both shaking their heads as they trudged back toward the town fight the fuckin japs charlie muttered thats just what i fuckin need time they ship my butt home ill have a long white beard dom was more than ready to help him bitch dom was always ready to help a guy bitch hed been pretty handy with that schmeisser when they really needed it too before long itd be nothing but a souvenirthat or more scrap metal one charlie had heard they werent letting gis ship weapons home one more chickenshit regulation almost as bad as getting a receipt for pows he and dom came up to the corpse of the german truck the scrounger whod been messing around there was gone whos that asshole gonna sell his scrap to charlie said usyou wait and see were dumb enough to pay good money to put these mothers back on their feet now that we stomped em yeah thats like us all right dom agreed we the truck blew up next thing charlie knew he was sprawled on the ground a surprisingly long way from the road domno a piece of domlay not far away charlie tried to reach out his arm didnt want to work when he looked down at what was left of himself he understood why it didnt hurt then all at once it did his shriek bubbled through the blood filling his mouth mercifully blackness enfolded him lieutenant lou weissberg looked at the crater by the side of the road son of a bitch he said looks like a five hundredpound bomb went off here that won him the first respectful glance hed got from the ordnance sergeant already on the scene damn near sir toby benton agreed his slow texas or oklahoma drawl halfway to being a different language from lous clotted new jersey reckon some jerries snuck one of their two hundred and fiftykilo jobs into the truck an then touched the mother off blew two of our guys to hell and gone he pointed over to the corpses theyd left the gis where they lay so weissberg could look them over and use his brilliance to pull a sherlock holmes and tell everybody what was what to ordinary soldiers the counterintelligence corps did stuff like that lou belonged to the cic he wished like hell he could do stuff like that unfortunately unlike ordinary soldiers he knew better he went over anyway and trained a camera on the bodies i hate taking pictures of these poor guys you know he said snapping away anyhow but i gotta have something to bring back to nuremberg so the big shots there can see what happened you better be careful sir sergeant benton said how come is the ground mined lou stood as still as if he intended to take root right where he was and if benton nodded or said yes that would be about the safest thing he could do but the noncom shook his head nahdidnt mean that you keep talkin the way you are though peoplere liable to reckon youre a human being or somethin oh lieutenant weissberg wondered how to take that to ordinary grunts cic officers probably werent human beings if by human beings you meant those who lived the same way they did lou had fired his carbine exactly once during the war when his outfit almost got overrun during the battle of the bulge hed slept warm and eaten well unlike most mudfaces thereforethis was likely a genuine compliment he treated it as one answering thank you sergeant youre welcome sir benton said seriously i figured youd be one o them behindthelines assholesuh no offense but you dont want to be doing this shit neither you better believe it lou said somebody has to though german army surrendered unfuckingconditionally surrendered if they think they can get away with crap like this what do we do about it benton asked take hostages and shoot em if the mothers who did this dont turn themselves in thats what the jerries woulda done and you can take it to the bank i know lous voice was troubled all kinds of things the jerries wouldve done that i dont want anything to do with toby benton eyed the cic man in a way hed seen before as someone who knew the straight skinny and might be tempted into talking about it that stuff they say about those campsdachau an belsen an them allthey really that bad no lou said tightly just when benton started to breathe a sigh of relief he went on theyre worse theyre a thousand times worse maybe a million far as im concerned we should hang all the mamzrim who ran em and you know what else i think were going to if that shit is truejesus we ought to sergeant benton paused the what momsomething oh weissberg realized what hed said its yiddish means bastards and they are i aint arguin benton eyed him again this time not as a source but in another way hed seen before yiddish huh youre uh a jewish fella guilty lou said how many jews had the sergeant seen before if he came off an oklahoma farm maybe not many and was he a regular army guy or a draftee lou thought he might be career military and not many jews were you really dont like the krauts then right you might say so sergeant yeah you just might if they were all in hell screaming for water id pull up with a gasoline truck heh benton let out only a syllables worth of laughter but his eyes sparked i like thatdamned if i dont glad you do lou came back over to the crater me i dont like this if the germans think they can fuck around with us while were occupying their country his voice trailed away what exactly couldwouldthe united states do about it awful lot of guys just want to head on home an pick up their lives where they left off sergeant benton remarked hell i sure do he was a draftee then i know so do i lou said hed been teaching high school english in jersey city when the japs bombed pearl harbor nothing would make him happier than going back to diagramming sentences but he was not the master of his fate or the captain of his soul the master of his fate was back in nuremberg waiting to hear what he had to say about this he sighed what could he say that wasnt obvious bentons eyes slid to what was left of the two gis bodies those would either get buried in a military cemetery here or go back to the states in sealed coffins probably with sandbags to keep them company and make them weigh what they should lou hoped the graves registration people would plant them here the less these guys relatives knew about what had happened to them the better he walked over to the jeep that had brought him out from nuremberg benton had his own jeep a boredlooking private sat in lous machine checking out a magazine full of girls in pinup poses reluctantly the driver set down the literature take you back now sir he asked violation of the surrender terms a honking big crater and two mangled bodies he probably didnt care much about anything but he cared more about the leg art than this business and maybe he had the right attitude too yeah lets go lou said the driver started the engine jeeps were almost as reliable as zippos they fired up first time every time not much traffic on the road what there was was nearly all us military olivedrab vehicles marked with a white star usually inside a white circle lou didnt get his ass in an uproar about trucks and jeeps and halftracks that ran he didnt worry about the germans he saw either even though a lot of them still wore feldgrau and some hadnt handed in their weapons yet but he flinched whenever he rolled by crumpled metal wreckageand there was plenty of it if those nazi schmucks had boobytrapped one dead truck who could say they hadnt done it to more than one nuremberg looked as if god had jumped on it with both feet and then spent a while kicking it like a kid throwing a tantrum the town where the nazis threw their big wingdings the town where leni whatshername filmed triumph of the will was the biggest rubble field in the world or maybe not lou hadnt seen berlin yet the russians played for keeps and well they might hitlers team had come that closethat closeto doing unto them instead and they had to know it it never occurred to most americans that they might have lost the war the atlantic and pacific didnt shield the ussr from nasty neighbors fighting their way west across their own smashed and shattered country red army men could see what a narrow escape theyd had lou suddenly snickered which made the driver look at him as if hed started picking his nose he didnt care suppose that truck had been sabotaged by organized diehards who werent ready to quit maybe they thought americans were too soft to give them what they deserved maybe they were even right but he would have bet dollars to doughnuts that the surviving nazis had too much sense to piss off the russians he laughed again louder this time if the krauts didnt have that kind of sense the reds would be happyfucking delightedto pound it into them marshal ivan stepanovich koniev was about as unhappy as a jubilant man could be his first ukrainian front had done everything an army group could do to smash the last german defenses in the east it had broken into berlin and paid its share in blood to take hitlers capital away from him and throw the third reich into the coffin it deserved so far so good but stalins orders gave the most important targets in berlin to marshal zhukovs first byelorussian front yob tvoyu mat georgi konstantinovich koniev muttered no matter what he said about zhukovs mother koniev hadnt really expected anything else hoped yes expected no zhukov was stalins fairhaired boy and that was that stalin trusted zhukov not to try to overthrow him the kind of trust a dictator didnt give lightlyor sometimes at all having given it stalin could afford to be extravagant in giving zhukov anything else he fancied that zhukov was a damned good general had nothing to do with anything not so far as koniev was concerned without false modesty the commander of the first ukrainian front knew he was a damned good general himself so did zhukov and so did stalin all the same stalin had only one favorite koniev knew he wasnt it zhukov was so zhukovs men got the chancellery and the fuhrers bunker it seemed unfair it certainly did to koniev whose men broke into berlin ahead of the other marshals nichevo koniev said and it couldnt be helped not unless he felt like quarreling with stalin he might behe wasirked but he wasnt suicidal scrawny germans many still in threadbare uniforms trudged gloomily through berlins wreckagestrewn streets they got out of the way in a hurry when red army men came by if they didnt theyd pay for it the stench of death hung in the air corpses still lay in the gutters and sometimes in the middle of the street quite a few of them had got there after the surrender no surviving germans wanted to give the conquerors an excuse to add more off in the distance a woman shrieked a russian a few meters from marshal koniev chuckled one more cunt getting what she deserves he said his buddies laughed out loud koniev didnt the red army had avenged nazi atrocities inside the ussr ever since it crossed the reichs borders berlin was no exception whod wanted to say the russian and asiatic soldiers couldnt have their fun after the wars last battle they owed the germans plenty but discipline was supposed to be returning that screamand others like it koniev had heard in the ten days since the surrenderargued it still wasnt all the way back which went a long way towards explaining why almost all the germans koniev could see were men german women feared red army soldiers would drag them off and gangrape them if they showed themselves they might have been right too theyd be safe enough in a few weeks not yet a driver came up to koniev and saluted comrade marshal your car is ready the man said good koniev said very good i wont be sorry to get out of this place for a while it stinks sure does the driver didnt seem to care if youll come with me sir the car was a captured kubelwagenthe german equivalent of a us jeepwith red stars painted all over it to keep triggerhappy russians from shooting it up the driver carried a ppsh submachine gun to fight off not only stupid friends but stubborn enemies little dying spatters of resistance went on massive reprisals killed plenty of germans and would eventually snuff out the resistance tookoniev was confident of that even a couple of kilometers outside of berlin the air improved and then abruptly it got worse again the kubelwagen rattled past the bloated carcasses of a dozen cows in a cratered meadow koniev scowled at the stink and also at the waste our men should have butchered those animals he said sorry comrade marshal the driver sounded afraid koniev would think it was his fault he added i never saw the beasts till this minute all right corporal while the fighting was still going on koniev might have looked to blamesomebody anyhow with the war over he could afford to be more easygoing artillery had chewed up the woods outside of berlin too some trees still stood straight others leaned at every angle under the sun theyd been down long enough that their leaves were going from green to brown some of them would have fallen on the road from berlin to zossenthe former wehrmacht headquarters now taken over by the red army koniev wondered whether red army engineers or german pows had cleared it he would have bet his countrymen put the germans to work three or four men in fieldgray scrambled off to the side of the road when they heard the kubelwagen coming those fuckers better move the driver said they stand there knocking pears out of the trees with their dicks ill damn well run em over right marshal koniev had to fight to swallow laughter russian profanitymatwas almost a language in itself the driver might have said if they stand there goofing off or he might not have even generals sometimes felt like using mat the road bent sharply the driver slowed down something stirred among the dead trees near the asphalt alarm stirred in koniev step on it he said urgently if he turned out to have a case of the vapors the driver could tell everybody he didnt have any balls koniev wouldnt mind not one bit as the drivers foot came down on the gas somebodya man in a gray greatcoatstood up he aimed a sheetmetal tube at the kubelwagen panzerfaust the driver yelped he grabbed his submachine gun at the same time as koniev reached for the pistol on his belt too late trailing fire the bazookastyle rocket roared toward the car marshal koniev ducked that did him exactly no good the panzerfaust was made to smash tanks a softskinned vehicle like the kubelwagen was nothing but fire and scrap metaland torn charred fleshan instant after the rocket struck home faces blank as if they were so many machines soviet soldiers led out ten more germans and tied them to the execution posts some were men some women all were in the prime of life orders from moscow were that no old people or children be used to avenge marshal koniev for him the defeated enemy had to give their best the germans had to give and give and give blood puddled at the bases of those posts flies buzzed in the mild spring air the iron stink of gore made captain vladimir bokovs nose wrinkle he turned to the officer commanding the firing squads smells like an outdoor butcher shop eryes that officer didnt seem to know how to respond he was a red army major so he nominally outranked bokov but the armofservice color on his shoulder boards was an infantrymans maroon and infantry majors were a kopek a kilo bokovs shoulder boards carried four small stars each not one large one his colors though were bright blue and crimson he wore a special badge on his left upper arm a vertical sword inside a wreath no wonder a mere infantry major treated him with exaggerated cautionhe belonged to the nkvd well carry on he said very well comrade captain said the infantry officerhis name was ihor eshchenko that and his accent proclaimed him a ukrainian he gestured to the troops tying the hostages to the posts make it snappy the wave said the men blindfolded the germans eshchenko glanced at bokov but the nkvd man didnt object moscow hadnt said the executioners couldnt grant that small mercy a fresh squad of red army soldiers came out to shoot the hostages the local commanders didnt make their men kill and kill and kill in cold blood they rotated the duty whenever they could one man in each squad had a blank in his weapon too if the soldiers wanted to think they werent shooting anybody they could ready eshchenko called the soldiers brought up their rifles aim he said a couple of the germans waiting to die blubbered and moaned they might not understand russian but they knew how firing squads worked fire major eshchenko shouted mosinnagant carbines barked the germans slumped against their bonds back in pagan days a chieftain who died took a retinue with him to the next world good marxistleninists didnt believe in the next world all the same the principle here wasnt so different some officers in charge of executions armed their men with submachine guns and let them blast away at full automatic major eshchenko seemed to have too much of a feel for the military proprieties to put up with anything so sloppy vladimir bokov had watched and taken part in plenty of executions and this one was as neat as any one drawback to using rifles though two or three hostages werent killed outright eshchenko drew his pistol and gave each the coup de grace with a bullet at the nape of the neck stonefaced germans carried away the corpses once germans were dead the red army stopped caring about them nicely done major bokov said as eshchenko came back cigarette spasibo eshchenko replied accepting one he leaned forward to let bokov give him a light after taking a drag he added this american tobacco is so mild its hardly there at all i know bokov nodded better than going without though oh youd better believe it the infantry officer inhaled again he blew out a perfect smoke ringbokov was jealousand said better than the horrible crap we smoked at the start of the war too bokov sent him a hooded look though the nkvd mans eyes were blue they were narrow like an asiatics good for not showing what he was thinking all he said was da tobacco was wretched after the german invasion because the nazis overran so much fine cropland a vindictive manor even a man with a quota to fillmight construe eshchenkos remark as criticism of comrade stalin a word from bokov and the major would find out more than he ever wanted to know about soviet camps but bokov had other things on his mind today as if picking that from his thoughts major eshchenko said naturally we also seized prisoners for interrogation weve already ah questioned several of them the rest we saved for you questioned of course was a euphemism for worked over well a marshal was dead you couldnt expect the red army to stay gentle after that and the gru the military intelligence unit thought it knew as many tricks as the nkvd the two services were often rivals not here though any real leads captain bokov asked eshchenko shrugged none ive heard about but i might not bokov nodded if the infantry officer didnt need to know something nobody would tell him that was basic doctrine the nkvd man asked so where are these prisoners over there in that cow barn eshchenko pointed to a big wooden building surrounded by shiny new barbed wire and a couple of squads worth of soviet guards the major snorted damned thing is fancier than wed use for people fuck your mother if its not he was taking a chance talking like that what he wanted to say was im a regular guy and i figure you are too but if bokov decided he meant the insult personally he was dead meat again bokov had bigger worries than a major with a loose tongue all he said was ill see what i can get out of them his blue and crimson armofservice colors got him past the junior lieutenant in charge of the guards the lieutenant did give him a couple of men with submachine guns saying my orders are not to let anybody go in amongst the nazis by himself the kid spoke of them as if they were lions or bears his orders made sense too if the germans took a hostagewell it wouldnt do them any good but they might be too stupid to realize that and bokov was sure the soviets would deal with the hostagetakers without caring what happened to the man they held one of the soldiers opened the barred door the stink that wafted out said the barn didnt have much in the way of plumbing most likely it didnt have anything give the swine the works the trooper said i aim to corporal bokov said then he switched to german and shouted prisoners attention hed learned the language before the war started only luck he supposed that that hadnt made someone suspect him how the germans scrambled to form neat lines they all wore uniform and ranged in age from maybe fourteen to sixtyfive bokov found himself nodding whoeverd taken out marshal koniev had used a military weapon and used it like someone who knew how so the occupying troops would have hauled in as many men in fieldgray as they could catch bokov could see which germans had already been interrogated they were the ones who stood there with fresh bruises and scrapes the ones who had trouble standing up at all he pointed to a fellow who still wore a senior sergeants single pip on each shoulder strap you feldwebel come with me gulping the man came he hadnt been thumped yet plainly he thought he was about to be and he was right but the red army men would have shot him on the spot had he even peeped tie him to a tree bokov told the troopers do a good job of it they did from somewhere one of them produced wire instead of rope the feldwebel wouldnt be going anywhere no matter what bokov took out a pen knife he started cleaning his nails with it the german watched the point with fearful fascination casually bokov asked him what do you know about marshal konievs murder only that hes dead sir the noncom said quickly too quickly well bokov had all the time in the world to find out he slapped the german across the face forehand and backhand thats just a taste of what youll get if i decide youre lying nowlets try it again what do you know about this murder nothing on my mothers honor sir i another pair of slaps interrupted the feldwebel blood and snot ran from his nose bokov eyed him with distaste he didnt particularly enjoy this but it was part of the work if he got something useful from this poor bastard his bosses would remember unfortunately theyd also remember if he didnt with some help from the troopers he did what he needed to do the feldwebel didnt enjoy it but he wasnt supposed to bokov soon became sure he wasnt the fellow whod fired the panzerfaust that didnt mean he was a born innocent at a certain point in the proceedings he shrieked jesus christ why are you doing this to me why dont you torture the werewolves theyre the ones who really know something werewolves vladimir bokov paused to light another mild american cigarette he blew smoke in the prisoners eyes tell me more ii reinhard heydrich hardly noticed the distant putput from the generator any more he hardly noticed the faint smell of the exhaust either he hoped heor somebodywould notice if that smell got stronger the ventilation system down here was supposed to be as good as anybody knew how to make it but carbon monoxide could still get you if your luck turned sour his mouth twisted this past month germanys luck had turned sour the fuhrer dead by his own hand himmler dead too also by his own hand the whole country prostrate surrendered occupied from east and west almost all the important officials of state and party in the western allies hand or worse in the russians im on my own heydrich thought its up to me if they think weve quit then weve really lost if we think weve quit then weve really lost thinking of the western allies hands and of the russians made him glance down at his own the light from the bare bulb was harsh even so he was amazed how pale hed got this past year underground hed always been a man who rejoiced in the outdoors hed always been a man who tanned as if someone had rubbed his skin with walnut dye too when he proposed this scheme to himmler when he proposed himself to head it he hadnt grasped everything it entailed if you were going to fight a secret war a guerrilla war against enemy occupiers you had to disappear yourself and sohe had ill come out in the sun again when germany comes out in the sun again he murmured what was that herr reichsprotektor hans klein asked his onetime driver was with him still after the assassination attempt in prague heydrich knew he could count on the veteran noncom klein had loudly and profanely turned down promotion to officers rank the mere idea affronted him nothing heydrich said it again to make himself believe it nothing but it wasnt he shouldnt have let klein see what was going on inside his head even for a heartbeat the oberscharfuhrer had too much sense to push it instead he asked anything interesting in the news bulletins of course they monitored as many broadcasts as they could their own signals were few and far between to keep from leaving tracks for the hunters since the reich collapsed they had to do the best they could with enemy propaganda and the military traffic they could pick up and decipher heydrich fiddled with some papers theyve found paintings and some other art that goring salted away that made klein chuckle the fat one wasnt in it for the money but he sure was in it for what he could grab ja heydrich admitted what he couldnt very well deny but when i said he salted stuff away i meant it they took this art out of an abandoned salt mine oh scheisse hans klein might not have much book learning but he was nobodys fool does that mean theyll start poking around other mines i hope not heydrich answered we have ways to keep them from finding the entrance he sounded confident he had to to keep kleins spirits up but he knew things could go wrong anyone whod survived in germany knew that and of course one traitor was worth any number of unlucky chances he had endless escape routes and didnt want to use any of them what else is in the news klein inquired maybe he didnt want to think about everything that could go titsup either the americans say theyve almost finished conquering okinawa heydrich had needed to pull out an atlas to find out just where okinawa lay he had one to pull out when germans set out to do something they damned well did it properly his former driver only sniffed theyve been saying that for a while now the little yellow men are making them pay they are heydrich agreed and these suicide planesif you can use an airplane to sink a warship thats a good bargain not one id want to make myself klein said it all depends heydrich said in musing tones it truly does a man who expects to die is hard to defend against the russians taught us that and the japanese lesson is a different verse of the same song we have men dedicated enough to serve that way dont you think you mean it klein considered the question as a senior sergeant might well sir i expect we could as long as they saw they were taking a bunch of those other bastards with em our enemies need to understand we are in earnest heydrich said one thing to win a war quite another to win the peace afterwards they think they can turn germany into whatever they please the angloamericans go on about democracyas if we want another weimar republic and the russians ja the russians klein echoed mournfully one thing stalins men were doing in the lands theyd occupied they were proving that all the frantic warnings nazis propagandists had pumped out were understatements and who would have believed that beforehand well heydrich pulled his mind back to the business at hand we have some more planning to do and thento work bernie cobb had played baseball in high school all the same nobody would ever confuse him with ty for one thing he was no georgia peach hed grown up outside of albuquerque new mexico for another even in that light air he was no threat with the bat though he could field some he wasnt as fast as he had been then hed frozen his feet in the battle of the bulge and they still werent back to a hundred percent instead of short or center he played third in the pickup game outside of erlangen the town northwest of nuremberg had come through the war pretty well the way it looked to bernie it wasnt big enough to plaster maybe it had a few more people than albuquerquewhich ran about but that didnt make it any threat to new york city or even munich they played on a more or less mowed meadow just outside of town the pitcher on the other side claimed hed spent three years in the low minors he could throw hard but he needed a road map and a compass to find the plate maybe that was why he never got to the high minors or maybe he was talking through his hat a fastball at bernies ribs made him spin out of the box ball four take your base the ump bawled he was a first sergeant with a face like a clenched fist he wasnt much of an umpire but nobody had the nerve to tell him so tossing the bat aside bernie trotted down to first way to go man one of his teammates yelled bernie was just glad he hadnt got drilled a couple of gis clapped they werent buddies of his maybe they had money on his team along with the american soldiers were a few germans mostly kids out for candy or gum or crats or women out for whatever they could get fraternizing with them was against regulations which didnt stop it bernie hadnt come down venereal but not from lack of effort he knew half a dozen guys who had they hardly carednot the way they would have while the war was on they only wanted to go home if they couldnt do that they wanted to fuck well so did bernie why not even if you caught something pills or shots could cure you quick nowadays no more than three or four german men watched the game one was an old fart in a suit a town councillor out to see what the conquerors did in their spare time another was talking to a gi bernie knew a guy who spoke no german maybe the kraut had spent time in the states before the war strike the ump yelled bernie thought the pitch was high by six inches but what could you do the pitcher threw over to first bernie dove back to the bag you stupid asshole he thought as he picked himself up with my bad feet am i gonna run on you ball to bernie that pitch looked better than the one before if he said so the umpire would probably rip out his spleen he took a very modest lead the pitcher stared over at him anyway bernie ignored the big dumb rube there was one other german guy in the crowd he was the same age as most of the gis which meant hed likely been a soldier himself but he wore baggy nondescript civvies they werent what made bernie notice him as he pressed his way in among the soldiers back of third base the guy had the worst thousandyard stare bernied ever seen and hed seen some lulus ball the ump said and it was a ballit sent the batter staggering away from the plate like the last one to bernie a couple of minutes before blam bernie flattened out before he knew hed done it it might be july but he still had his combat reflexes an explosion made him hit the dirt faster than a high hard one at his ear what the fuck that was the first baseman sprawled a few feet away from him christ we playin on a goddamn minefield bernie cautiously raised his head he didnt have a sidearm let alone his m the war was over dammit it was sure over for some of the guys whod been watching behind third over permanently bodies and pieces of bodies lay everywhere half of somebodys left leg bled ten feet in front of the low mound other gruesome souvenirs spattered the left side of the infield screams rose from wounded american soldiers so did cries for a medic bernie ran over to do what he could for the injured men it wasnt much he didnt carry wound dressings or a morphine syrette the way he would have while the war was still cooking by the helpless looks and muffled profanity that came from the other unhurt gis neither did anybody else bernie crouched by a guy who was clutching at a bloody leg you want a tourniquet on that bernie asked him he could improvise one with a shoelace and a stick when the hell would an ambulance show up i dont think so i aint bleedin that bad the other answered in a wondering voice he added he blew himself up huh bernie said brilliantly who that fuckin kraut he blew himself to kingdom come blew half of us with him too the goddamn son of a bitch he didnt step on a mine somebody didnt step on a mine a siren warbled approaching from the direction of downtown erlangen the warble meant it was a german vehicle bernie wasnt inclined to be fussy not right now the guy with the gash in his leg went on nah not a chance look at whats left of the asshole not much was and even less between the knees and the neck bernie gulped and looked away in a hurry hed hoped he would never see shit like that again no such luck just as the ambulance pulled up the wounded gi yanked what looked like a tenpenny nail out of his leg jesus he said staring at three inches of pointed iron the mother didnt just have explosives he had his own fuckin shrapnel thats nuts bernie said who ever heard of a kamikaze nazi maybe you better put somethin around my leg the other guy said its bleeding more now that i pulled that sucker out okay bernie sacrificed a leather shoelace to the tourniquet three krauts hopped out of the ambulance they stared at the carnage in disbelief der herr jesus one of them blurted another one crossed himself then they got to work their unflustered competence made bernie guess theyd been wehrmacht medics up till a few weeks earlier one jerry spoke some english unhurt and slightly wounded men followed his orders as if he were an american officer he plainly knew what he was doing but when he started to pick up the remains of the fellow whod blown himself up the sergeant whod been doing umpire duty pushed him away leave whats left of that bastard right where hes at the noncom said warum the german asked startled out of his english he got it back a moment later why on account of our guys are gonna have to try and figure out how come the shithead went kablooie the sergeant said its a murder right you dont fuck around with the scene of a crime more to himself than to the guy from the ambulance he added the stuff you pick up from mystery stories how much of what he said did the german get enough so he didnt go near what was left of the human bomb anyhow bernie cobb understood all of it it made much more sense than he wished it did lou weissberg wanted to go back to the states he didnt want to examine any more mangled flesh he didnt want to smell the sicksweet stench of death any more either not that you could avoid it in germany not in towns where the army air force or the raf had come to calland in a lot of places the armyd gone through too that stench was mild here two days after the bombing with most of the dead meat taken away mild or not it was there and it made his stomach want to turn over toby bentons mouth twisted too hell of a thinguh sir the sergeant said you better believe it lous nod was jerky twentythree dead theyre saying now and almost twice that many wounded bad enough to need treatment shit bentons drawl almost turned it into a twosyllable word good thing the jerries didnt get so many of our guys for every one of theirs while the fighting was still going on we had more people than they didmore stuff toobut not that much more mm lou hadnt thought of it in those terms which didnt mean the ordnance sergeant was wrong if you were out to turn somebody into a walking bomb how would you go about it same way these fuckers did i reckon benton replied the nazis bite the big one but nobody ever said they couldnt handle shit like this explosivesaround the guys middle i guess so they wouldnt show so much scrap metal nails whatever the hell for shrapnel a battery a button to push and kapow yeah kapow lous echo sounded hollow even to himself what do we do about shit like this lieutenant benton asked if this asshole wasnt just your gardenvariety nut seems to me like we got ourselves some trouble the way we fight is we want to live and we want to make sure the other sons of bitches dont always figured the krauts played by the same rules but if all of a suddenlike they dont give a shit no more sure as hell makes em harder to defend against i know lou clenched his fist and pounded it against the side of his thigh he didnt notice he was doing it till it started to hurt then he quit god damn it to hell toby the war in europe is over they surrendered we can do whatever we want to their people and theyve got to know it yes sir sergeant benton agreed thats how come i hope he was a nut if theyve got waddayacallemspartisansrussians and yugoslavs gave old adolf a fuck of a lot of grief with guys like that i guess even the froggies caused him some trouble after hitting the beach on dday his opinion of france and things french could have been higher well its not my call thank god lou said i havent got the stomach for lining rows of people up against a wall and shooting em even germansexcept camp guards and mothers like that his voice went ferocious hed done latin in college before the war and remembered coming across the roman emperor who wished all mankind had one neck so he could get rid of it at a single stroke back then hed thought that was one of the most savage things hed ever heard he felt the same way about ss men himself these days shit sir it wouldnt be so bad if it was only them but all these chickenshit civilians and wehrmacht guys who swear on a stack of bibles they didnt know squat about any concentration campsno sirree not them my ass benton made as if to retch and for once the death reek had nothing to do with it uhhuh lou nodded and the real pisser is they expect us to believe that crap how dumb do they think we are he knew the answer to that your average germanyour average german with a guilty consciencethought your average american was pretty goddamn dumb by the way some us officers were willing to use nazis to help get the towns they were in charge of back on their feet maybe your average german hit the nail right on the head too you gonna talk with the town councillor who was here benton asked what the hells his handle anyway herpolsheimer lou said with a certain gloomy relish anton herpolsheimer jeez what a monicker yeah ill talk to him dont know what he wouldve seen that our gis didnt but maybe something herr herpolsheimers house stood next to the post office on the hugenottenplatz once upon a time the germans had taken in persecuted french protestants instead of clobbering them worth remembering they could do such thingslou supposed hey joe got any gum a kid maybe eight or nine years old called in pretty fair english as lou and sergeant benton neared the house benton ignored him lou shook his head he wasnt feeling sympathetic to germans even little ones right then the kid dropped back into german for an endearment stinking yankee kikes lick my ass you little shitface lou weissberg growled in the same language get the fuck out of here before i give you a noodlegerman slang for a bullet in the back of the neck he might have done it too his hand dropped toward the on his belt before he even thought the kid turned whiteno green how many uncomprehended insults had he got away with he damn well didnt get away with this one he disappeared faster than a v blasting off wow benton said admiringly what did you call him about a quarter of what he deserved lou pushed on his thin face closed tight the ordnance sergeant had the sense not to push him lou took some satisfaction in banging on anton herpolsheimers front door if the town councillor thought the american gestapo was here to grill himit wouldnt break lous heart when the door didnt open fast enough to suit him he banged some more even louder we gonna kick it down sergeant benton didnt sound bothered if we need to by then lou looked forward to it but the door swung wide then a tiny ancient woman in a black dresshousekeeper squinted up at the two americans you wish she asked in a rusty voice as politely as if they were holding teacups with extended pinkies we must see herr herpolsheimer at once lou said if she tried to stall shed be sorry and so would the councillor with the funny name but she didnt she nodded and said jawohl mein herr please wait i will bring him then she hurried away jawohl huh sergeant benton didnt know much german but he followed that the way she talks lieutenant youre one heap big honcho i should benot cause im me but cause im an american lou said we tell these german frogs to hop theyd better be on the way up before they ask how high now youre talkin benton said enthusiastically lou nudged himhere came councillor herpolsheimer nobodyd told lou that the bomber had wounded herpolsheimer but the old german walked with a limp his left arm was in a sling an almost clean bandage was wrapped around his head good day herr herpolsheimer lou said more politely than hed expected to im here to ask some questions about the ah unfortunate events of the other day unfortunate events i should say so herpolsheimer had a gray mustache and bushy gray eyebrows lou could see only one of them but the other was bound to look the same the old german added that maniac do you know who he was had you seen him before lou asked no never herpolsheimer winced a little as he shook his head maybe he had a concussion to go with his more obvious injuries he said i fought in the last war thats where i got this he used his good hand to brush his leg so hed had the limp before he went out to watch the yanks play baseball the gesture was oddly dignified almost courtly i fought in the last war he repeated no one back then would have done such a thingnot a german not a frenchman not an englishman nobody not even an american he seemed to remind himself what his interrogator was danke schon lou said dryly how about a russian well i fought in flanders so i didnt face them the town councillor replied but i never heard of them doing anything like that do you think the fellow who blew himself up was a german lou inquired until he didthat i didnt pay much attention to him herr herpolsheimer said slowly i might have paid more had i thought he was a foreigner but he didnt seem to stand out oh he looked like someone whod been through a lot but a lot of people look like that nowadays he stuck out his wattled chin as if to say and its all your fault too lou didnt think it was all the allies fault if hitler hadnt swallowed austria raped czechoslovakia invaded poland invaded denmark and norway invaded the low countries and france bombed the crap out of england sunk everything he could in the north atlantic invaded the balkans and north africa and then invaded russiadetails details lou thought but arguing politics with a jerry was a waste of time it seemed like this guy whoever he was placed himself to hurt as many americans as he could before he uh exploded himself that wasnt supposed to be a reflexive verb but nobodyd had to talk much about human bombs before herr herpolsheimer understood him which was the point of the exercise the old man nodded yes i thought so he did it with definite military effect wunderbar lou muttered if hed been speaking english he would have said terrific the same way herpolsheimer eyed him your german is quite good herr oberleutnant but i do not think i have heard an accent quite like yours before i wouldnt be surprised half the time it isnt german or isnt exactly germanits yiddish lou waited come on you old bastard lets hear the speech about how you didnt know what those wicked nazis were doing to the jews here no you had no idea at all the town councillor clicked his tongue between his teeth my niece had a jewish husband he said after a moment had lou didnt like the sound of that max hanged himself in after kristallnacht herpolsheimer said he could not get a visa to any foreign country and he could not live here in his note he said he did not wish to be a burden on luisa she did not believe he was onebut the way things went she might have come to do so what were you supposed to say after something like that lou couldnt think of anything so he got out of there as fast as he could then he had to tell sergeant benton what herpolsheimer had said which made him feel great all over again son of a bitch the ordnance sergeant said when he got done son of a bitch aint that a bastard mazeltov toby lou said that may be the understatement of the year hot damn benton said so what the hell are we going to do about this asshole who turned himself into a bomb what you said pretty muchhope hes one lone nut and theres no more like him lou answered past that i have no ideai mean none and i may be breaking security to tell you the higherups dont either but i dont think im surprising you much nope sergeant benton said i only wish to god you were the explosion had taken out most of a city block the damage wasnt so obvious in fallen berlin the lost capital of the reich had already taken more bombs and shells and rockets and smallarms fire than any town this side of stalingrad after all that what difference did one more explosion make captain vladimir bokov knew too well the difference this one explosion made the bloodstains on stillstanding walls and on the battered pavement were noticeably fresher than most in berlin and he could also make out bits and pieces of the gmc truck some clever german had packed with explosives before driving it up to some parading russian soldiers and blowing them upand himself with them you see comrade captain colonel fyodor furmanov said hed led those parading red army troops only dumb luck no flying piece of truck got him in the kidneysor in the back of the neck he had burns and scrapes and bruises nothing worseand he seemed embarrassed to remain alive while so many of his soldiers didnt oh yes i see the nkvd man said colonel furmanov flinched he knew his next stop might be a labor camp somewhere north of the arctic circle what kind of precautions did you take to keep that truck from getting close to your men furmanov flinched again bokov eyed the decorations on his chest they said the red army officer had had himself a busy war he spread his hands now comrade captain i took none the responsibility is mine i thought the war was over i thought no one would strike at us i was wrongand my poor men paid the price for my mistake you didnt expect that the fascist would be willing to blow himself up if that meant he could strike at the soviet union bokov asked no colonel furmanov said stonily if you believe what the yankees are saying the japanese fight like that but the germans dontdidnt i should say not before the surrender they didnt you must know that as well as i do comrade captain his words said the right things his tone said he doubted whether an nkvd man knew anything about what had gone on at the frontbut didnt say so blatantly enough to let bokov call him on it abstractly the captain admired the performance the only way he could respond to the challenge was by pretending not to notice it and so he simply nodded and said yes i do know well then colonel furmanov sighed hed been right to come out and accept responsibility it would have landed on him anyhow being ready for it made himlook a little better bokov lit another of his american cigarettes when he handed furmanov the pack the older officer stared in surprise before taking it furmanov leaned close to get a light from bokovs cigarette after giving it to him the nkvd man spoke slowly and deliberately it seems comrade colonelit seems i saythat some nazis have decided to continue resistance in spite of the regimes formal surrender this bomb in the truckis not an isolated incident he didnt want to admit that coming out and saying it made the ussrand maybe even more to the point the nkvdlook bad easier by far to let this officer vanish into the gulag maybe hed come out in ten years or more likely twentyfive or maybe they would use him up before he finished his sentence the way they did with so many if this were an isolated incident furmanov would be gone as things were thoughthere are reports from the american occupation zone of germans using explosives to kill us soldiersand killing themselves in the process bozhemoi the infantry colonel exclaimed in the american zone too there really is a resistance then it would seem so yes bokov said we are also trying to see whether these bombings are connected to marshal konievs assassination colonel furmanov said my god again then he cursed the nazis with a fluency peter the great might have envied and then after he ran down he asked what can we do about it he held up a hand can we do anything about it that leaves more than maybe three motherfucking germans alive that is the question bokov impersonated hamlet after a moment he added why do you care i promise you nobody in moscow will the nazis had come much too close to wiping the soviet union off the map anything to help ensure that that never happened again seemed good to the men who shaped soviet policy it seemed good to vladimir bokov too not that his opinion on such things mattered a farts worth comrade captain if we send germans up the smokestack the way the ss got rid of jews ill wave byebye to them while they burn youd best believe i will furmanov said you can see by my record that im not soft on these fuckers but if we do something that makes them desperate enough to go after my men without caring whether they live or die themselvesthat i care about because it endangers soviet troops for no good reason the germans arent doing what theyre doing because of how were treating them now bokov spoke with authority like i said theyre pulling the same damned stunts in the american zone and you know the americans go easy on themamericans and englishmen are halfway toward being fascists themselves yes thats true colonel furmanov agreed so why are they doing it then i told you why some of them dont think the war is over yet bokov said our job here will have two pieces i think one will be to hunt down the bandits and criminals who are to blame for these outrages da furmanov nodded you dont commandeer a truck and load it full of shit like that by yourself youre right comrade captainsome kind of conspiracy must lie behind it russians saw conspiracies as naturally as americans saw profits like americans chasing the dollar they often saw conspiracies that werent there not this time bokov was convinced furmanov had it straightsomebody who put a lot of explosives in a truck and set it off had to have an organization behind him then furmanov asked whats the other piece of your puzzle what youd expect bokov replied somewhere out there are germans who know about this conspiracy without being part of it we have to find out who they are and make them tell us what they know and we have to make all the germans left alive more afraid to help the bandits than anything else in the world if even one of them betrays us they all have to suffer on account of it colonel furmanov nervously clicked his tongue between his teeth this is what i was talking about before comrade captain with policies like this we risk driving germans who would stay loyalwell quiet anyhowinto the bandits arms theyll be sorry if they make that mistake for all the feeling in bokovs voice he might have been talking about the swine at a pig farm but they wont be sorry long when the hitlerites invaded the soviet union they didnt try to win the goodwill of the workers and peasants because they didnt the partisan movement against them sprang to life colonel furmanov walked a fine line here and again walked it well he didnt point out that the nazis had enjoyed plenty of goodwill when they stormed into places like the baltic republics and the ukraine that was true but pointing it out could have won him a stretch in the camps he also didnt point out that stalins policy here would be the same as hitlers there that would have been even more likely to let him learn what things were like in a cold cold climate and he didnt point out that the russian partisans got massive amounts of help from unoccupied soviet territory who would help these diehard nazis nobody captain bokov hoped not anyway instead of arguing with furmanov or even pointing out any of those things bokov said well do all we can to track down the fascists the place to start i think is with the truck how did the germans get their hands on it he hadnt expected an answer from the infantry officer but he got one so much stuff is going back to the motherland comrade captain that nobody pays much attention to any one piece maybe that truck was ours to begin with or maybe it was one the germans captured from us or from the usa if somebody told one of our sentries he was taking it somewhere on somebodys orders the sentry might not have bothered to check hed figure whod lie about something like that or do you think im wrong bokov wished he did a german with nerve could probably disappear a truck just the way furmanov described shit bokov said wearily one more thing we have to tighten up i suppose i should thank you i serve the soviet union furmanov said which was never the wrong answer we all do bokov agreed but while it wasnt the wrong answer it might not be the right one either iii when tom schmidt thought of nuremberg he thought of triumph of the will he was a reporter he knew he wasnt supposed to do stuff like that but how could you help it if youd seen the movie precision marching torchlight parades searchlights stabbing up into the air building the columns for a cathedral of light nobody then had mentioned that the searchlights were also part of the citys aircraftdefense system and hitler haranguing the faithful toms german grandparents had settled in milwaukeewell one of his grandmothers was from austria but it amounted to the same thing his own deutsch wasnt great but it was good enough hitler didnt say anything wonderful in the film but the way he said it even on the screen it made tom sit up and take notice and the shots of the people listening to it live the men in their brown or black uniforms and the boys in hitler jugend shorts stared in awe they might have been listening to the pope or to the second coming of jesus the women though were the ones who really got to him wide eyes open mouths slack ecstatic featuresthey looked as if they were on the edge of coming themselves if old adolf could do that without laying a finger on themwell it was plenty to make tom jealous so that was what he thought of when he thought of nuremberg postwar reality was a little different yeah just a little he thought with a wry chuckle it was a field of wreckage as far as the eye could see a us army information officer told him the town had suffered ninetyone percent destruction that included the vast majority of the public buildings though a couple of churches might prove salvageable about half the prewar housing was ruins now that helpful information officer said there were something like cubic meters of rubble to clear away the first big raids came in late the last in early tom wondered how many years hauling away the bricks and timber and plaster and concrete would take by the way nuremberg looked now it might take forever if it did he wouldnt be heartbroken along with the rubble todays nuremberg had something else triumph of the will didnt show fear american soldiers here as throughout the us occupation zone didnt travel in groups smaller than four they always went armed representing the milwaukee sentinel tom was officially a noncombatant that hadnt kept him from acquiring a helmet and a grease gun the ma was almost as ugly as a british sten gun but it could chew up a lot of bandits at close range since it could tom didnt sweat the aesthetics he did wish he had eyes in the back of his head when he mentioned that to a gi the dogface laughed at him then the fellow said sorry mac if i dont laugh i bang my head against a wall laughing hurts lessi guess were all as jumpy as cats in a room full of rocking chairs nice to know it isnt just me tom said but it shouldnt be like this they surrendered if they mess with us now we can treat them however we want its all in the laws of war right like i know from the laws of war the soldier wore a pfcs single stripe no he wouldnt be chewing the fat with patton or eisenhower any time soon all i know is weve shot hostages and it dont do no good fuckin krauts still shoot at us and plant mines and blow themselves up like theyre japs me i quit goin to movies on account of they go after us double when theres crowds of us like that uhhuh tom wrote that down doing without movies is a real hardship what do you do instead waddaya think i do man the gi returned i do without like you said tom wrote that down too it was a good line how do we get a handle on these german tactics hanging that heydrich item up by the ballsd make a decent start i guess the pfc answered hes the one supposed to be back of this shit right whats the reward for his worthless carcass up to half a million buckstaxfree if an american bags him tom said not exactly worthless not if youre the one who hits the jackpot you know what i mean i the soldier paused as a couple of germans mooched past one of them was in civvies the other wore a beatup wehrmacht uniform with all the trim removed the guy in the uniform glanced over at the americans as if wondering what his chances for a handout were the other man who was older kept his head down with all the stones and broken bricks and other bits of crap on the ground that wasnt the worst idea in the world and if he doesnt make eye contact and get us nervous his odds for seeing tomorrow bump up tom thought okay now theyre out of range the gi said he relaxedfractionally they wouldnt go after just two of uswould they schmidt wished hed managed to swallow the last two words but he knew what they said about wishes and horses to his relief the pfc didnt seem to think he was yellow well you wouldnt think so the man answered seriously when they blow themselves up they try to take out more than two of us at a time but you dont wanna drop your guard you know if you look like you aint payin attention who knows what one of those cocksuckersll try yeah who knows toms voice sounded gloomy even to himself ill tell you somethin man the soldier said i aint got near enough points for them to hand me a ruptured duck and ship my sorry ass homei didnt get over here till pretty late in the game but if they want to throw me on a boat and send me to fight the japs id sooner do that than this thats an honest war anyways you know who the bad guys are they get in your way you fuckin grease em thistruman said it was over when the nazis signed the surrender papers but does it look like its over to you wellit did for a little while tom said i know i figured this occupation shitd be duty you could handle standing on your head the american broke off to give another german the onceover she was young and kind of cute but that wasnt why he eyed her the way he did as she walked off he sighed and spat in the rubble standing on your goddamn head yeah sure and then you wake up have you heard of any women blowing themselves up tom asked there was one a coupla weeks ago down nearwhere the fuck was it it was in stars and stripesyou can look it up down near augsburg thats where the cunt did it tom asked one more question so if you had your druthers what would you do with the germans now beats me man the gi said way it looks to me is we either gotta kill em all or else walk away from em neither one of those is what youd call a real good answer i know tom said you got any better ones the soldier asked you can go all over the place you aint stuck yakking with guys like meyou can talk to officers and shit hell you can even talk to the krauts if you want to huh he made that sound as strange as talking to martians to him maybe it was i could yeah if i did i dont know how many folks back in milwaukeed want to read about it though tom held up a hand and before you ask me i havent run into any officers with ideas much different from yours jeez the pfc spat again mournfully we are fubard then but good soviet troops shouted ordersin russian the germans they were herding onto trains mostly didnt understand the germans werent happy to be in the train station to begin with the soviets had hauled them out of their houses and flats and shacks and tents and wherever else they were staying some germans carried a duffels worth of worldly goods more had only the clothes on their backs where are we going where are they taking us whats going on what are they doing germans called out the questions again and again hardly any of the soldiers understood nobody answered watching the chaos unfold vladimir bokov smiled the nkvd officer had no trouble following the germans worried questions in broad outline he knew the answers to them but he kept his mouth shut he was there to observe not to ease the germans minds his smile got broader what he could say wouldnt make these people feel any better a train pulled in soviet soldiers already aboard opened the cars doors an indignant german voice rose above the general din was ist hier los some of these cars are for transporting freight oror livestock not human beings he was right not that it did him any good the troops started herdingand then crammingpeople onto the train men shouted women screamed children wailed that did them no good either the nkvd colonel standing next to bokov chuckled nastily let the pricks find out what its like eh not like they didnt do it to plenty of other people thats right comrade bokov agreed no need to worry that colonel moisei shteinberg would prove disloyal to the soviet state not when it came to dealing with the hitlerites lots of jews in the old russian empire became revolutionaries because the tsars mistreated their people well what the tsars did to jews was like a kiss on the cheek compared to what the nazis gave them that angry german man protested again crying this is inhumane then a grinning soldier who doubtless understood not a word he said shoved him into a cattle car the red army men forced more and more germans in after him why are you doing this to us a woman asked the soldier who was pushing her into another car where are we going bokov would have bet rubles against rocks that the soldier didnt follow her questions the fellow had swarthy skin high cheekbones and dark slanted asian eyes he bared his teeth in a feral grin suck my cock bitch he said luckily for the woman she didnt understand him either she squawked when he put both hands on her backside to get her in there he only laughed in slow schoolboy russian a german man said for what you do i not harm you he was over sixty so he might have been telling the truth at least in the literal sense of the words maybe he hadnt carried a mauser or served a mm howitzer but even if he hadnt hed almost certainly made weapons or munitions or uniforms or something else the nazis had used against the ussr not many people here had clean hands the soldier he addressed didnt answer him in words not at first instead the red army man hit him in the side of the head with the stock of his submachine gun the german crumpled with a moan the red army man kicked him in the ribs then he shouted fuck yourself in the mouth get up you stupid ugly prick slowly the old german did he had a hand clutched to his temple blood rilled out between his fingers and ran down his cheek why have you done that he choked out not understand i ought to kill you is what i ought to do i ought to gutshoot you the soviet soldier said you didnt harm me you lying sack of shit who the fuck shot me he pointed to one arm then to the other leg who burned down the kolkhoz where i grew up who raped my sister and shot her afterwards was it the americans or was it you heil hitler bastards how much of that did the stupid old german get here for once bokov was tempted to translate the losers needed to hear stuff like this theyd see what they bought when they invaded the ussr four years ago and theyd see plenty of other things toofor as long as they lasted more and more people kept going into the cars it was almost like a comic turn in a film when it ran in reverse after the train got to wherever it was going how many people would come out alive fewer than had gone inhe was sure of that the idea didnt break his heart he turned to colonel shteinberg how well do you think this will work sir well we shook up the baltic republics as if we were stirring soup the jew answered anybody who might have been antisoviet away he went or she wentwe shipped out plenty of baltic bitches too he chuckled reminiscently maybe hed been involved in that but then the grin faded we could ship as many loyal russians back in as we neededthe baltics are legally part of the ussr now we cant do that so well here no bokov agreed germany however prostrate it was remained a separate country too bad isnt it shteinberg said so we have to depend on scaring the devil out of the fritzes we dont send to camps that will work against most people will it work against the diehards bokov asked i doubt it colonel shteinberg sounded so indifferent bokov looked at him in surprise the other nkvd man condescended to explain sooner or later well scare one of the ordinary ones enough to make him sing hell think if i sell out they wont take my daughter or they wont shoot me or whatever bothers him the most and once we get our hooks into the diehards network itll start coming to pieces they always do ah bokov thought about it yes sir youre probably right youd better believe i am shteinberg said well make every miserable german in our occupation zone sure hells not half a kilometer away from his front door some of them will decide theyd rather kiss our behinds than keep on getting it in the neck cause theyre making like tough guys he talked like a tough guy himselfactually like a zek a man whod been through the camps maybe hed been a guard at one of them or maybe he had a term in his past plenty of people who went into the gulags in or came out again after the hitlerites invaded some of them became heroes of the soviet union too which didnt mean they wouldnt go right back into a camp if they sneezed at the wrong time even men like tupolev the great aircraft designer had the camps hanging over their heads like the sword of damocles the red army men made sure the cars were shut good and tight each one boasted impressive locks and bars that hadnt been on them while they were part of the german railway systemunless the germans used them to haul people to their concentration camps similarly metal gratings and barbed wire across passengercar windows made sure nobody would leave that way smoke poured from the locomotives stack the train pulled out of the station heading east vladimir bokov wondered if any of the germans on board had the slightest idea how far east they were likely to go well if the sons of bitches didnt theyd find out pretty damn quick colonel shteinberg watched the train go with no expression at all on his face a good job eh bokov said shteinberg looked at him as coldly as hed eyed the train they could put every german ever born on trains like this and it still wouldnt be enough to pay them back for what they did he said his voice was also cool and quiet but bokov realized there were people who liked fritzes even less than he did lou weissberg was eating breakfast at the barracks in nuremberg when somebody came in waving the stars and stripes look at this the guy shouted look what we done to the goddamn japs hold the stupid thing still willya somebody else said more irritably than lou would havemaybe this fellow hadnt had his coffee yet give us a chance to see what it says oh sorry the guy with the paper did hold it stilland upside down after assorted hoots from the soldiers shoveling food into their faces he turned it right side up upside down or right side up the headline screamed about an atom bomb what the hell is that a major asked they dropped one on this uh hiroshima place and the town is gone right off the map said the man with the stars and stripes well they firebombed the living shit out of tokyo not long ago too and they pretty much burned it off the map so whats such a big deal about this the major seemed determined not to be impressedor maybe he didnt fully grasp what was going on either way the guy with the paper spelled it out for him yes sir but that was hundreds of planes and gazillions of incendiarieschrist only knows how many this hiroshima place this was one plane and one bomb one what one bomb a whole city my ass thats impossible the major said if not for the enormous headline lou would have felt the same way heres what the president said the man with the stars and stripes opened it and read from a story sixteen hours ago an american airplane dropped one bomb on hiroshima an important japanese army base that bomb had more power than tons of tnt it had more than two thousand times the power of the british grand slam which is the largest bomb ever yet used in the history of warfare the guy beside lou stubbed out his cigarette and crossed himself lou knew just how he felt the japanese began the war from the air at pearl harbor they have been repaid many fold read the fellow with the paper and the end is not yet with this bomb we have now added a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the growing power of our armed forces in their present form these bombs are now in production and even more powerful forms are in development it is an atomic bomb it is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe the force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the far east son of a bitch the skeptical major whispered that summed up what lou was feeling too before it was the accepted belief of scientists that it was theoretically possible to release atomic energy but no one knew any practical method of doing it the guy who had the stars and stripes didnt read especially well or maybe he was as flummoxed as everybody else he went on by however we knew that the germans were working feverishly to find a way to add atomic energy to the other engines of war with which they hoped to enslave the world but they failed we may be grateful to providence that the germans got the vs and vs late and in limited quantities and that they did not get the atomic bomb at all oh son of a bitch from lou it came out as more prayer than curse imagining the nazis with a bomb that could take out a city at one shot scared him worse than anything hed seen in the war which was saying a lot the battle of the laboratories held fateful risks for us as well as the battles of the air land and sea and we have now won the battle of the laboratories as we have won the other battles the soldier folded the stars and stripes shut again wow said somebody at another table i wouldnt believe a story like that if it was in superman and here it is in stars and stripes all through the mess hall heads solemnly bobbed up and down lou understood what the other american meant but he didnt nod he had to fight not to wince in fact british and french officers were amazedand politely dismayedat how many of their allies from across the atlantic read comic books right this second lou understood how they felt the major who hadnt wanted to believe in atom bombs said we ought to bring some of those mothers over here if the jerries want to keep blowing themselves up we can drop one on munich and one on frankfurt and one on this fucking place too thatd teach em not to screw around with us by god he got even more nods than the guy whod talked about superman uh sir lou said how do we make sure our own people are out of places like this before we blast em sounds like one of these things takes out about a miles worth a ground maybe more when it goes off hell wed do it that kind of stuff is just details the major was in artillery which meant hed never needed to worry about that kind of stuff everything always looked easy to somebody who didnt have to do it how many short rounds did your batteries fire somebody asked not quite quietly enough who said that goddammit the major turned the color of molten bronze he jumped to his feet who said that whoever it is can step outside if he isnt too yellow oh sit down major button your lip while youre at it a grayhaired chicken colonel said i got a purple heart and a week in the hospital from a short round that kind of thing happens more often than anybody wishes it did instead of sitting the major stormed out of the mess hall somebody snickered as he got to the door that only made his back stiffer and his ears redder lou drained his coffee before he stood up he couldnt imagine the japs staying in the war much longer not after a right to the chin like this maybe the nazis had bailed out at just the right time if the usa had had an atom bomb while the fighting was still going on it sure would have dropped one on munich or berlin nowthis wasnt a war any more not officially what it was was a running sore would we blow a city off the map because guerrillas bombed a barracks lou shook his head itd be like burning down a house with a flamethrower to kill a wasp but if you didnt kill the wasp it would keep buzzing around and it would keep stinging so how were you supposed to get rid of it there was a good question so far nobodyd found anything resembling a good answer when hans klein first heard reports about the american atom bomb he said two things the first was quatschrubbish the second was unmoglichimpossible that also pretty much summed up reinhard heydrichs reaction hed had much better connections than kleins he knew german physicists had tried to make a uranium bomb he also knew they hadnt come close to succeeding if german scientists couldnt do it odds were nobody else could either odds were only odds though sometimes snake eyes would come up four times in a row with honest dice not often but sometimes so maybe the americans really had come up with something new maybe three days after they claimed to have destroyed hiroshima they claimed to have destroyed nagasaki and less than a week after that the japanese empire surrendered unconditionally well not quite the japanese wanted to retain the emperor but close enough heydrich was astonished to say nothing of appalled hed counted on the little yellow men to bloody the americans who landed on their beaches to take their islands away from them that would help make the occupiers sick of holding germany down would have made now the german resistance would have to go it alone reluctantly klein said i guess the american pigdogs really do have these fancy bombs id say so heydrich agreed can we get our hands on one sir the oberscharfuhrer asked thatd teach the enemy a thing or three i dont think we can sneak one from america to here heydrich said klein gave back a glum nod heydrich continued if we can find out where our own scientists were working and how far they got dont you know klein seemed astonished that heydrich wouldnt but heydrich had to shake his head no i never found out much about the projectit was highly secret and of course it came to nothing so i thought it wasnt important it seems i was wrong hans klein had been through a lot with heydrich it took a lot then to surprise him but his eyebrows leaped toward his hairline now meaning no disrespect sir but i dont think i ever heard you say that before no eh heydrich smiled a thin smile the only kind apt to fit on his long lean face well maybe its because i dont make mistakes very often and maybe its because when i do make one i dont talk about it afterwardsand neither does anybody else eryes sir klein said hastily anyone in the reich who talked about heydrichs mistakeswith the sole exception of heinrich himmlerwould have counted himself lucky if he only ended up in a camp now heydrich pulled his attention back to the business at hand what can we do about this dammit i really dont know much about uranium or radioactivity can we get our hands on someone who does beats me sir klein said if you dont know much about this business well me i know less than nothing but i do wonder about something whats that heydrich snapped facing the blue glare of his attention was like standing up against a pair of lit bunsen burners gulping klein said if we piss the americans off enough will they use one of these hellish things on us one bomb one city gone he shuddered donnerwetter heydrich said softly the whole country is hostage to them his fingers drummed on the desktop this place is safe against any ordinary bombs even the big british ones but what would happen if one of those things blew up right on top of us beats me klein said how would we go about finding out he glanced up uneasily at the ceilingand at the many many meters of rock above the ceiling hed never worried about ordinary bombs either but how could you help worrying about these atom bombs especially when you didnt know exactly what they could do dryly heydrich answered well i dont want to make the experiment maybe wed live even if they did itwere a devil of a long way underground but if they dropped one of those things on us that would mean they knew where we were and the only way they could do that would be to squeeze it out of somebody who already knows what will we do when they start capturing our people klein asked they will you know if they havent by now things go wrong heydrichs fingers drummed some more he didnt worry about the laborers whod expanded this redoubttheyd all gone straight to camps after they did their work but captured fighters were indeed another story he sighed things go wrong ja if they didnt stalin would be lurking somewhere in the pripet marshes trying to keep his partisans fighting against us we wouldve worked churchill to death in a coal mine he barked laughter the british did some of that for us when they threw the bastard out of office last month and wed be getting ready to fight the amis on their side of the atlantic butthings went wrong yes sir after a moment klein ventured uh siryou didnt answer my question oh prisoners heydrich had to remind himself what his aide was talking about i dont know what we can do klein except make sure our people all have cyanide pills some wont have the chance to use them some wont have the nerve klein said not many men had the nerve to tell reinhard heydrich the unvarnished truth heydrich kept klein around not least because klein was one of those men they were useful to have hitler would have done better had he seen that heydrich recognized the truth when he heard it now one more thing hitlerd had trouble with i dont know what well do heydrich said slowly well play it by ear i suppose i dont know whether the enemy will treat our men as prisoners of war or as francstireurs or the russians wont treat us like pows klein broke in theyll jump on us like theyre squashing grapes to make wine ja heydrich scowled keeping the resistance going in the soviet zone was harder than it was in the parts of germany the western democracies held the russians played by the rules only when it suited them otherwise the nkvd was at least as ruthless as the gestapo had been and so klein was persistent this must have been on his mind for a while now weve done what we can heydrich said we work in cells the cell leaders dont know where their orders come fromonly that theyd better follow them losing men wont make the system unravel even if our government surrendered its still a war what else can i tell you nothing i suppose the oberscharfuhrer answered he didnt sound happy nothing at all heydrich said firmly it is still a war dammit we hurt the enemy as best we can sometimes he hurts us thats a part of war too as much as we wish it werent eh he wouldnt have wasted time cajoling many other peoplemaybe no one else still alivebut he and hans went back a long way ja i suppose so klein said but but what heydrich snapped even with his old driver he ran out of patience quickly he was too used to automatic obedience to be comfortable with anything less but we cant afford to get hurt much any more klein said if we do the resistance movement will fall to pieces heydrich sucked in a deep breath ready to scorch the obstreperous noncom with hot words he exhaled with klein still unscorched how could you come down on somebody who was obviously right only long habits of discipline obedience and patriotism would make a man go out and blow himself up to hurt the occupiers if the troops in the field had no one of suitable authority to obeygermany would be ruined forever they havent found us they wont find us even if they discover this place weve got others to go to heydrich realized he was bucking up his own spirits as well as kleins and why not his morale mattered too we are going to win this fight hans however long it takes well do it and the vaterland will be free again ja herr reichsprotektor klein didnt sound a hundred percent convinced but he didnt call heydrich a liar with his tone either that was something anyhow in this uncertain twilight struggle heydrich took whatever he could get george patton had the bad habit of sitting up very straight in his jeep sometimes hed even stand up behind the pintlemountedcaliber machine gun the jeep carried not for the first timenot for the twentieth eitherhis driver said general i wish to christ you wouldnt do that so much especially when the road runs through woods like this not for the first timenot for the twentieth eitherthe commander of the us third army laughed as if hed just heard the juiciest joke ever take an even strain smitty he said the huns are whipped my asssir smitty hunched low behind the jeeps wheel he had a wife and two kids in dearborn and he wanted to get home to see them againhe had just about enough points to do it too they string that piano wire between trees just above windshield level and no way in hell you can see it till it catches you in the neck i hear theyve taken two guys heads clean off sounds like bullshit to me patton said stories always get bigger in the telling do you know either of these unlucky souls can you put names to them wellno smitty admitted there you are patton said triumphantly the huns are whipped i tell you maybe a few of them dont know it yet but well keep licking them till they do i promise you that yes sir sometimes you couldnt win smittyd done all the fighting he cared to do before the germans surrendered he didnt want to keep on doing it three and a half months later but if he said so patton would go up like a bouncing betty smitty did say i sure wish youd leave that chromed helmet back in the barracks though its like youre wearing a shoot me sign yknow nonsense patton said the germans fear me and i dont fear themnot one bit dyou hear me let them see troubles heading their way he stood up again he swung the big heavy machine gun back and forth sure as hell he had plenty of firepower at his disposal but god didnt issue anybody eyes in the back of his head not to patton and not to smitty either however much the driver longed for them the jeeps rearview mirror made a pisspoor substitute smitty didnt see the man in ragged feldgrau get up on one knee in the roadside bushes and launch his panzerschreck he did see the burst of flame from the antitank rocket the panzerschreck was a german copy of the us bazooka round the germans didnt just copy it either they improved it a panzerschreck had more range and penetrated thicker armor than its american prototype this one didnt need the extra range smitty had time to go aw shit he was starting to yank the wheel hard left when the rocket hit the jeeps right rear and flipped it over pattons startled squawk cut off abruptly when a ton and a half of metal and burning gasoline came down on top of him smitty was luckierhe got thrown clear of the jeep he put his teeth through his lower lip and broke several of them when he met the road facefirst but he could crawl dazedly away from the inferno that engulfed the general hed had a grease gun beside him on the seat he couldnt find it now if the kraut with the panzerschreck came after him he was history but the german seemed content with blasting the jeephe bailed out and why not hed just scragged a fourstar general iv erlangen was shut down tighttightern a fiftybuck whores snatch one gi put itfor general pattons funeral procession sandbagged machinegun nests outside of town made sure nobody unauthorized got in mustangs and thunderbolts buzzed overhead ready to strafe infiltrators or shoot down any enemy airplanes that tried to interrupt the proceedings lou weissberg wondered how much good all that would do if the fanaticsa name for the diehard nazis the papers were using more and more oftenalready had people in town they wouldnt need to sneak in more now he wondered why nobody with a grade higher than his seemed to have thought of that no one to whom he mentioned it seemed to want to listen he also wondered why the occupation authorities were making such a show out of pattons rites as far as he was concerned old blood and guts was a blowhard a good fighter with few other virtues during the war his men worshipped and despised him in about equal numbers sinceif he could have stirred up a war with the red army he would cheerfully have rearmed the jerries and sent them into battle alongside the us army he cared not a pfennig for eisenhowers denazification orders rumor said eisenhower was about to remove him from command of third army when the krauts removed him permanently lou didnt know whether the rumor was true he wouldnt have been surprised though eisenhower and patton had been banging heads since the invasion of sicily two years ago now but here came ike driven down erlangens hauptstrassemain dragin a jeep a look of pious mourning on his face another jeep followed this one with pattons coffin on a standard army quarterton trailer hooked up behind an american flag covered the coffin the hauptstrasse led to the altstadter kirchethe old city churchnorth of the market square american soldiers lining the parade route fell in behind the jeep to crowd into the square germans who tried to do the same were discouraged more firmly than politely again lou hoped it would matter a couple of gis with scopesighted rifles peered out from the churchs steeple snipers lou thought terrific but maybe having them there was better than not having them maybe newsreel cameras recorded the goingson one of them peered up at the riflemen and how would they look to folks back home here months after peace was supposed to have come what were they thinking on the far side of the atlantic how much did they like this festering aftermath of war eisenhower climbed down from his jeep two unsmiling dogfaces with tommy guns escorted him to a lectern in front of the churchs steps the sun glinted from the microphones on the lecternand from the pentagon of stars on each of ikes shoulder straps general of the army was a clumsy title but it let him deal with field marshals on equal terms he tapped a mike noise boomed out of speakers mounted to either side of the lectern had some bright young american tech sergeant checked to make sure the fanatics didnt try to wire explosives to the microphone circuitry evidently because nothing went kaboom today it is our sad duty to pay our final respects to one of the great soldiers of the twentieth century general george smith patton was admired by his colleagues revered by his troops and feared by his foes ike said if there were a medal for hypocrisy he would have won it then but you were supposed to speak only well of the dead lou groped for the latin phrase but couldnt come up with it the fear our foes felt for general patton is shown by the cowardly way they murdered him from behind with a weapon intended to take out tanks they judged and rightly that george patton was worth more to the us army than a stuart or a sherman or a pershing eisenhower said damn straight muttered the man standing next to lou he wore a tankers coveralls so his opinion of tanks carried weight tears glinted in his eyes which told all that needed telling of his opinion of patton eisenhowers voice hardened his midwestern accent stern as weathered granite but these nazi cowards also judged they could scare us out of germany by murdering general patton they judged they could run us out of germany and they judged they could take over again once we cut and rantake over and start getting ready for the third world war thats what they thought thats how they thought he looked out at the assembled gis well folks i am herei am right here in erlangen in the american occupation zoneto tell them they are wrong lou whooped he clapped he was one of many very many the soldiers here had seen too much of what hitlers thugs had done ever to want to see any more of that we are doing all we can to put an end to their wicked violence eisenhower went on then he used the word of the moment because theyre fanatics our enemies are taking longer than they should to realize they cant hope to defeat the might of the united states of america he got another round of applause louder than the first the tankman next to lou joined in but he also murmured son of a bitch but i wish i was back in omaha lou wished he were back in new jersey too unfortunately wishing wouldnt put him there cleaning up the leftover nazis just might it looked like his best chance anyhow i have one more message for you men and for the ss goons who skulk in the woods and in the darkness eisenhower said its very simple we are going to stay here as long as it takes to make sure germany can never again trouble the peace of the world he probably expected more cheers then he gota few lou was one of the men who clapped the guy in the tankers coveralls edged away as if afraid he had something contagious that saddened him without much surprising him he wondered how many of the others who applauded there were also jewish quite a few unless he missed his guess yes eisenhower had looked for more in the way of approval there hed acted professionally grim before now his eyes narrowed and the corners of his mouth turned down he wasnt just grim any more he was pissed off we would waste everything weve done up till now if we walked away too soon he said and lou thought he was speaking off the cuff rather than from prepared remarks as he had earlier he pointed south down in nuremberg were going to try the thugs who are the only reason we had to come here at all and after that id be very much surprised if we dont hang em higher than haman this time lou clapped till his palms hurt most of the soldiers in the market square joined him they wanted to see the war criminals get what was coming to them all right eisenhower looked a little happier after thatnot much but a little and if we catch reichsprotektor heydrich by then well try him and hang him too he said or maybe we wont bother trying mr heydrich not when the maniacs he leads have done so much dirty work after the surrender more hot fierce applause heydrich was public enemy number one these days sure as hell lou and the counterintelligence corps were responsible for that posters displaying heydrichs rather lizardy features were plastered to everything that didnt walk they promised the famous taxfree to gis for information leading to his captureor to his body to a dogface making fifty bucks a monthand with luck to a kraut toothat had to look pretty damn good it also looked pretty damn good to lou years worth of a first lieutenants salary he glanced around lots and lots of gis no reinhard heydrich dammit heydrich was too cool a calculator to risk himself for the glory of it hed be hiding away somewhere cooking up more trouble and theres one more reason we dont want to step away before its time eisenhower looked east the fanatics have hurt the soviet union too remember they killed marshal koniev before they got general patton but whatever heydrichs men do over in the russian zone they wont drive drive out the red army you can bet your bottom dollar on that lou looked around again that comment didnt raise much applause but it made a good many soldiers nod thoughtfully almost the only thing that kept the usa and ussr on speaking terms was that they both hated and feared the nazis worse than they hated and feared each other without the fanatics they might have squabbled even more theres irony for you lou thought having got in his licks eisenhower stepped away from the lectern after that pattons memorial service was in religious hands it wasnt lous religion but that wasnt why he stopped listening ike had surprised him a couple of times the preacher sounded canned you knew what hed say three sentences before he got around to saying it nothing was wrong with his remarks exactly but they got bloody dull somebody not far from lou enlivened the proceedings by passing out hed stood in the sun too long and was fine as soon as they flipped water on him but the nearpanic when he pitched forward on his face told how jumpy all the gis were no german snipers no nothingonly jitters enough jitters though and you didnt need anything else as the memorial broke up a corporal talking to his buddy delivered his own verdict on patton sure he was a ballbuster but he was our ballbuster the buddy nodded so did lou that made more sense than most of the highfalutin blather hed listened to before like any soviet citizen vladimir bokov had learned more about what war could do than he ever wanted to know leningrad besieged by the germans and finns for three years with hundreds of thousands dead of bombs and shells and hunger and cold and disease stalingrad blasted from the air then systematically pounded flat by two armies till one could fight no more kharkov and rostovonthedon both taken by the nazis retaken by the red army taken back by the nazis and finally seized for good by the ussr with each side slaughtering the others collaborators and toadies as soon as it grabbed power and those were only a few of the high pointsor the low points if you thought that way but despite everything captain bokov had learned despite everything hed seen despite his utter lack of sympathy for the folk whod come too close to enslaving the soviet union forever dresden gave him the willies british and american bombers had visited hell on the city in the winter before the warwas alleged to have ended bozhemoi bokov muttered surveying square kilometers of barrenness of charred shells of buildings of places where asphalt had puddled and then run like rivers the twin stenches of burning and death still thickened the air he suspected they would linger for years cunts had it coming said his driver a stolid peasant named gorinovich oh no doubt bokov agreed not only did he really feel that way but you never could tell to whom gorinovich reported an nkvd man saw wheels within wheels whether they were there or not in the ussr and in bokovs line of work they commonly were he did add if the americans could do this without their fancy new bombs screw me if i know why they needed them gorinovich grunted in response to that then he said you were going to division hq sir da bokov nodded all right ill get you there and he did the paving was chewed up and sometimes nonexistent but neither mud nor gravel nor anything else fazed the twoandahalfton american truck us tanks had thin armor weak guns and highly inflammable gasoline engines the planes the americans gave the soviet union were mostly ones they didnt want themselves but nobody ever said a bad word about their trucks the red army would have had a devil of a time winning the war without them with a word of thanks bokov hopped out of this one in front of the battered house flying the divisional commanders flag sentries with submachine guns stood in front of the door like most of their kind they scrambled out of the way with comic haste when they spotted his armofservice colors in a way that wasnt so good a nazi who got hold of an nkvd cap and shoulder boards might bluff his way in to seeor to assassinatealmost anybody worry about it later bokov told himself one thing at a time he turned the knob and walked into the house major general boris antipov was drinking tea and laughing with a pretty redhead half his age when bokov came in she turned red exclaimed in german and disappeared with a rustle of silk shed landed on her feet in postwar germanyor more likely on her back who the antipov growled then he too noticed bokovs shoulder boards and cap some of the hostility left his voice as he went on oh youre the fellow they sent from berlin thats me bokov said does your ah friend speak russian not a word of it but she fucks like its going out of style so who cares why do you antipov broke off again and clapped a meaty hand to his forehead son of a bitch are you thinking trudis a spy thats the craziest thing i ever heard im not thinking that bokov said carefullyeven the nkvd had to pick its spots before it risked pissing off a general but you should recognize the possibility even so and i wanted to make sure we could talk without her eavesdropping well we can antipov said youll want to know about the prisoner eh bokov leaned forward like a hunting dog taking a scent yes ill want to know about the prisoner his voice was soft and eager cant tell you a whole hell of a lot antipov said what i mainly know is his bomb didnt go off maybe it was a dud or maybe he chickened out at the last second but my boys noticed him acting weird so they jumped on him when they found his vest they tied him up good and tight and let me know i called you people that kind of stuff is your baby thanks bokov said some red army men would have tried putting the screws to an important prisoner themselves in fact maybe antipov had casually bokov asked get anything out of him his name his rank his pay numberthats about it like i said we didnt work him over much figured that was your business antipov answered oh and he says hes a prisoner of war prisoner of war my dick bokov said not after the hitlerites surrendered hes not hes nothing but a fucking bandit and even before general antipov nodded the ussr treated german prisoners only slightly better than the nazis treated captured soviet troops hundreds of thousands of german pows went into the gulags maybe some would come out one day on the other hand maybe none would bokov wouldnt lose any sleep over that ill take him back to berlin where we can interrogate him properly the nkvd man said they would get answers out of the german bokov was sure of that the nkvd had ways of finding out what it needed to know they werent pretty but they worked come on then antipov got to his feet for a moment bokov thought the general himself would take him to the prisoner but he didnt as soon as they got outside antipov bawled for some men a squad appeared on the double the soldiers were well turnedout and looked very alert take him to the german antipov told them do whatever he says yes comrade general the men chorused their sergeant saluted bokov come with us sir theyd disarmed the wouldbe bomber and stowed him in a shed a couple of hundred meters away four soldiers with submachine guns stood guard around it that german wasnt going anywhere at bokovs nod one of the guards unbarred the door heraus he shouted it might have been the only word of german he knewor needed slowly the fritz emerged he had bruises and scrapes on his face and a cut lip by the way he cradled his right wrist in his left hand it was sprained maybe broken well the soldiers wouldnt have been gentle when they grabbed him ought to string him up by the nuts one soldier said roast him over a slow fire another agreed the way the captive watched them made bokov wonder do you speak russian he asked in german sir my name is fenstermacher gustav eduard fenstermacher my rank is obergefreiter gustav eduard fenstermacher rattled off a serial number i am a prisoner of war under the geneva convention i dont have to say anything else he was about twentyfivea few years younger than bokovwith blue eyes and brown hair the wehrmacht had several ranks between senior private and corporal he held one of them he wore ragged feldgrau as if it were new and pressed and kitted out with his rank badges and medals bokov laughed in his face fuck you fuck your mother and fuck the geneva convention too it would have sounded better in russian but german would do youre dead meat youre dogshit nothing else but have you got that fenstermacher stood mute bokov murmured to a red army man beside him grinning the trooper stepped up and whacked the german on his bad wrist fenstermacher wailed he went white he started to sag to his knees but managed to catch himself have you got that dogshit bokov asked again obergefreiter fenstermacher hesitated dont screw around with me bokov advised him if you were a hero you wouldve died yesterday last chance arselickhave you got that the german licked his lips ja he whispered just before bokov told the soldier to give him another lick better bokov said and it was once a girl whod been holding out let you get a hand between her legs everything else was easy interrogations worked the same way sodo you speak russian another hesitationa shorter one this time not much mostly bad words fenstermacher said plenty of russians bokov knew spoke bits of german the same way which didnt mean this snake was telling the truth the right lie now could give him his chance later hed think so anyhow bokov didnt intend to let anything like that happen the usbuilt truck waited not far from the house general antipov had commandeered the driver stood outside leaning against a fender and smoking a cigarette by the look of him gorinovich didnt care whether he stayed there another half hour or another week tie the german up bokov told antipovs men dont hurt him more than you have to unless he gives you trouble you you and youhe pointed to three soldiers one after anotheryoull come back to berlin with us and make sure nothing happens to him get moving they did had he said they were going to london they would have done the same after they hogtied gustav eduard fenstermacher they halffrogmarched halflugged him over to the truck when they were about to throw him in the back he finally asked the question that must have burned in his mind since bokov got him out of the shed or more likely since he let himself be taken alive whatwill you do to me images formed in the nkvd officers mind a cell too small to stand up or lie down in not nearly enough food not nearly enough sleep which could be even worse bright lights pain fear always fear fenstermacher had to be imagining most of those same things for vladimir bokov they werent imaginary they were the tools of his trade like a mechanics wrench and pliers or a sculptors mallet and chisel but that was all rightto bokov imagination and anticipation were tools of his trade too what a prisoner imagined his captors doing to him could break him faster than what they did bokov trotted out a couple of small tools a pitying sigh and a shake of the head you wont like any of it he said and by the time its over youll tell us everything youll be glad to and youll wish you could tell us more i wont even fenstermacher had to hear how hollow his defiance sounded oh you will bokov promised him one way or another you will you could come clean before it all starts believe me it wont change anything in the end except youll be a lot happier he eyed the german think about it on the way to berlin ill ask you again then if you say noyoull find out just what we do to you thats all i fenstermacher began chuck him in the truck bokov told the red army men cutting him off let him stew in his own juices all the way back to the ravaged capital of the ravaged reich after thatthe nkvd would get its answers captain bokov didnt much care how diana mcgraw was just starting to dust the spare bedroom when the doorbell rang damn she said and then looked around guiltily to make sure ed hadnt heard but the rattle and squeak of the old lawnmower out back told her he was still working on the yard that was a relief he didnt like her to swear not even a little bit she hurried downstairs a slim woman in her late forties going from blond to gray but not all the way there yet she muttered wordlessly as she opened the door her daughter and soninlaw were half an hour early that was annoying even if they would have little stan with them oh she blurted it wasnt betsy and buster and the baby out there it was a kid in a dark green jacket with brass buttons mrs uh mcgraw the kid had to look down at the pale yellow envelope in his right hand to get the name he was just about old enough to start shaving when diana nodded he thrust the envelope at her wire for you maam uh thanks she said in surprise she hadnt got a telegram in months hold on a second let me grab my handbag but when she came back with the purse the western union delivery boy was bicycling down the street pedaling hard her mouth fell open as she stared after him he hadnt waited for his tip how far behind on his work was he far enough to be scared of getting fired if he didnt go like a bat out of youknowwhere that was the only thing that made even a little sense to her then she opened the envelope and everything stopped making sense the wire was from the war department in smudgy carbon paperlike printing it said the secretary of war deeply regrets to inform you that your son patrick jonathan mcgraw private us armypats serial number followedwas killed outside of munich germany on september there was more all of it over the typed signature of a lieutenant colonel but all diana saw was son patrick jonathan mcgraw killed that looked big as the world and blotted out everything else she staggered toward the back of the house as if joe louis had landed an uppercut right on the button after a moment she reversed course long enough to shut the front door it was impossible the war in europe was over it had been for months oh there were stories in the paper about fanatics and diehards theyd even killed general patton but pats letters assured her everything was quiet in his sector like a foollike a mothershed believed him son patrick jonathan mcgraw killed ed she said when she got to the back door one syllable was all she had in her the lawnmower stopped ed mcgraws bald head gleamed under the endofsummer indiana sun dang he saidhe wouldnt swear in front of her either they here already then he got a good look at her face the halfrueful halfannoyed grin on his own faded what is it hon whats the matter so she had to find more syllables after all she managed two pat he but she couldnt say that she couldnt she held out the telegram instead it had the words son patrick jonathan mcgraw killed ed mcgraw stumped over to her hed lost the last two toes on his left foot in france in in spite of that hed tried to reenlist the day after pearl harbor they wouldnt take him they probably wouldnt have if he werent maimedhe was well overage so he went on working at the delcoremy plant in anderson the way he had since he came home with eight toes making good money and socking away a nice chunk of it anderson halfway between indianapolis and muncie was almost as big as the latter but people all over the country had heard of muncie plenty of people in indiana had no idea anderson existed neither diana nor ed cared about that they liked anderson fine theyd raised two good kids there and expected a fine crop of grandchildren it had already started coming in now diana had just started to cry when ed took the wire from her saying gently your mother her mother was seventyseven frail and starting to be forgetful if god forbid something were to happen to her it would be sad but it would be part of the natural order of things but when a parent had to put a child in the ground ed held the yellow sheet out at arms length he wasnt wearing his reading glasses not to mow the lawn diana wondered if hed be able to see what it said if he couldnt shed have to read it to him or tell him and she thought she would rather die herself oh jesus christ he said hoarsely he could read it all right when he raised his face to her it bore the same blind helpless look she had to be wearing herself pat he was stumbling over things too germanythose crazy fucking assholes even now she stared at him he didnt say things like that oh maybe at the factory but never around the house never except he just did and why not what else were the germans whod murdered pat its wrong if diana didnt say what was wrong maybe she wouldnt have to think about that so much quite so much maybe its wrong the war is over theyve got no business doing that close call there pat ed said again he was a minute or two behind her right now a minute or two bulked big as a mountain what are we going to do without pat hed come closer to actually talking about death than diana had we have to make it stop she said the wars over how many people are still getting wires like she broke off her mouth falling open no wonder the western union boy pedaled away so fast shed heard they didnt take tips when they brought news like that it seemed to be true hello diana almost jumped out of her skin there stood betsy holding stan and there beside them was her husband buster neft he had a limp worse than eds hed come back from the south pacific a year and a half before with a bronze star and a purple heart hed been an outstanding highschool tackle before the war hed talked about playing college ball but a shellburst made damn sure he wouldnt now he worked at delcoremy too close to half of anderson did betsy went on we knocked at the front door but nobody came bus heard you guys talking back here so we came around and she ran down when she noticed her folks werent responding the way shed expected them to her husband saw the telegram still in eds hand what happened he asked sharply when ed didnt answer buster came up and took the wire he didnt need to hold it away from himself to read it oh no he said and threw his free hand in the air in anguish god damn those motherfucking sons of bitches to hell part of diana thought those were the words shed been looking for herself but couldnt find part thought they didnt go nearly far enough what is it betsy snatched the telegram away from buster pat she wailed and let out a shriek that set the baby howling buster took him betsy ran to her mother and father they clung together that shriek brought neighbors out to see who was murdering whom and why they converged on the mcgraws house several of them had lost somebody in their family or at least had somebody hurt they knew what the mcgraws were going through because theyd done it and the ones who hadntthe lucky onesall knew people who had how could you not somebodydiana forgot whopressed a cold tumbler into her hands and said drink this up she did thinking it was up it turned out to be gin and tonic and almost went down the wrong pipe but she felt a little better with it inside her it built a thin wall between her and everything else she could still see through the wall and hear through it too she could even reach over it and feel what was there but the bit of distance the gin gave was welcome such a crying shame a neighbor said she was crying it made her mascara run pat was a good boy everybody nodded if you didnt like pat you didnt like people another neighbor said i dont know a soul who didnt everyone nodded again such awaste with women all around him buster swallowed some of what he might have said i mean when i got hit we were fighting the japs i knew why i was on that beachto make the slanteyed soandsos say uncle but to get killed on occupation duty thats a joke or it would be if it was funny what the heck are we wasting our timewasting our peopleover there for now that thedarn wars done thats what i said when i showed ed the wire diana exclaimed thats just exactly what i said isnt it ed she blinkedshe was talking very loud and very fast the gin must have hit her harder than she thought you sure did honey ed had a glass in his hand where did that come from diana had no idea not surprising not when she didnt know whod given her that welcome gin i wonder how many people all over the country are going through the same thing for no reason betsy said her mascara was all over her face too most of the womens was too many diana said one would be too many one is too many son patrick jonathan mcgraw killed yes she could feel what was there its a lot more than one buster said all these loonies with bombs strapped onbut i dont know how many i wonder if anybody outside the war department does papers sure dont talk about it you just pay attention to them and the radio everythings fine over there and thats not right either ed said his face was redder than the sun should have made it whoeverd handed him that drink had fixed him a doozie well why not wagging his index finger in the air he went on i can see why we didnt talk so much about casualties while the war was still cooking hitler and tojod find out stuff they didnt need to know but now what makes a difference now brass hats dont want folks back here to find out how bad they snafud things over there buster said wisely ed nodded vigorously enough to make the flesh of his double chin shake so did most of the men gathered there the ones whod served in either war diana realized she only blinked again in confusion snafud she wasnt sure shed even heard it right its short for situation normalall uh fouled up her soninlaw explained even at a time like that ed managed a grin and a grunted chuckle diana wondered why then she saw it could also be short for something else she blamed the drink for slowing her wits she wasnt about to blame herselfno indeed we ought to know the truth about whats going in she said isnt that what we fought the darn war for the news about pat had horrified ed into swearing in front of her she couldnt imagine a calamity that would make her swear in front of the neighbors youre right betsy said she took stan back from buster the baby was eight months old he had two teeth he could say dada but not mama yet which irked betsy he smiled whenever anybody smiled at him or whenever he just felt like smiling why not he had no idea what was going on the lucky little guy betsys face crumpled hell never get to know his uncle pat now she saidalmost the same thought as dianas betsy started crying again stan stared at her he could cry whenever he felt like it toocould and did he wasnt used to seeing mommy do the same thing a neighbor touched diana on the arm if theres anything we can do over the next few days sweetheart you sing out you hear anything at all and dont be shy she said if we dont help each other whos gonna thanks louise god bless you that made diana think of something else she still could think straight if she worked at it ed weve got to call father gallagher we sure do he shook his head which made his jowls wobble some more so much to take care off and for what for a waste a big dumb waste thats what it is all right nothing else but and nobody should have to die on account of a big stupid waste diana said not pat and not nobodyuh anybodyelse either its wrong dont you see its wrong more nods said her neighbors thought so too v if lou weissberg hadnt known what he was looking for he never would have found it even knowing he almost walked right past the forest bunker sergeant benton saved him pointing and saying reckon thats it sir is it lou turned backand got a raindrop in the eye mud squelched under his boots it was a miserable day to go poking through the woods but he finally saw the join between the regular forest floor and artfully camouflaged dugup ground yeah i guess youre right he gestured to the squad of gis whod come with them okay guyswere here spread out and form your perimeter right the corporal in charge of them sounded no happier to be futzing around in the middle of the bavarian woods than lou was nobodyd asked his opinion though and nobody was likely to take your positions he told his men and for chrissake watch out for trip wires unless you want your balls blown off thus encouraged the soldiers moved out around the bunker half of them carried ms the others grease guns if they had to they could put a lot of lead in the air nobody touched off a bouncing betty for which lou thanked the god in whom hed had more and more trouble believing since he found out about dachau and belsen and the murder camps farther east he would rather have come out here by himself or just with toby benton several horrors had proved that americans traveling alone or in pairs werent safe though and so he had a squad along to remind the krauts that theyd been defeated and surrendered and given up of course he wasnt exactly safe even with the hired muscle along as the corporal had reminded his men heydrichs goons liked booby traps the fanatics were too goddamn good at concealing them too sergeant benton was an artist in his own right he also had some specialized tools a batterypowered detector to find metallic mines and a long thin wooden probe to find the ones that werent and he had wirecutters to take care of the trip wires helike the corporalassumed would be there and they were okeydoke lieutenant he said after a good deal of careful work looks like we can dig now lou nodded to the corporal that worthy said rojek one of the gis jerked as if stung by a wasp whatd i do to deserve this you was born lucky the corporal answered cmon get your ass over here muttering bitterly rojek did he used his entrenching tool with a marked lack of enthusiasm i oughta write my congressman he said the corporal gave him the horse laugh yeah like they give a shit about us now tell me another one before long rojek banged the tool against a roof of logs and planks cant go through that he said with some satisfaction i aint no beaver you want beaver go back to nuremberg and fraternize with some the corporal said weve got saws along lou said the look private rojek gave him proved glares werent lethal but the corporal spread the wealth another gi got to play woodsman he cut through enough logs to open a space a skinny man could use to get in lou filled the bill before dropping down he shone a flashlight into the bunker he didnt want to land on a detonatoror on a bunch of knife blades or bayonets pointing up the fanatics came up with lots of ways to make the occupation moreinteresting this time he didnt see anything like that i knew i shouldve been a dentist he remarked as he lowered himself into the hole then i wouldntve had to mess around with crap like this but no i wanted to study english lit so when i volunteered they put me in cic my mother gets to say i told you so he let himself drop and landed with a thump on the floor of hardpacked dirt a damp musty smell filled his nostrils nobodyd been in this bunker for a while a prisoner had told the americans about it though so they had to find it and take it out of circulation which would do how much to win the fight against the fanatics how many of these bunkers were scattered all over germanyand austria and the germansettled parts of czechoslovakia and maybe other places too heydrich was a son of a bitch no two ways about it but by all the signs he was a goddamn thorough son of a bitch lou turned slowly playing the flashlight around the bunker a small stove sat in one corner with a pipe leading up through the roof to the forest floor above neither he nor benton had spotted where the stovepipe emerged however much you hated them nobody could say the jerries werent good at what they did the walls were planked neat metal brackets on them held mausers and schmeissers and close to a dozen of the halfwaybetween weapons the germans had started fielding in the last year of the war assault rifles they called them some people said hitler himself hung the handle on them true or not it wasnt a bad monicker they used a longer heavier cartridge than a submachine guns pistol round and fired at full automatic out to three or four hundred yards gis whod run into them said they were very bad news sergeant bentons head and shoulders appeared above blocking most of the cold gray light that drizzled in through the hole is it the goods lieutenant he asked looks that way lou said shucks benton sounded disappointed reckon ludwig gets to keep his family jewels after all too goddamn bad heh lou said tightly he didnt think cic would have made the prisoner sing soprano if hed tried to string his us interrogators along but he wasnt sure with the war allegedly over nobody seemed sure what the rules were for germans captured in arms against the occupiers some us officers called them francstireurs and shot them without trial some grilled them mercilessly declaring that the geneva convention didnt apply and some treated them as pows there were no orders from on high the brass was as confused as everyone else just to make matters even more delightful the fanatics kidnapped gis and murdered them and left their bodies in prominent places with placards saying things like vengeance for our fallen comrades sometimes they would just cut a mans throat sometimes theyd get more creative lou remembered the poor bastard with his cock stuck in his he shook his headshuddered really he didnt want to remember that he used the flashlight again a makeshift deska filing cabinet a couple of crates and boards across themstood in the corner opposite the stove lou walked over to it he started to open the top filecabinet drawer then he thought better of it hey toby he called benton came back what have you got lieutenant stick your head in a little further and see lou lit up the desk just the kind of thing the jerriesd boobytrap looks like want me to pull its teeth if you think you can maybe well get lucky the germans love paperwork if they give us a roster of half the bastards whove been driving us buggy well take it yeah sergeant benton nodded okay ill have me a look his shoulders were wider than lous he had to wiggle to fit through the hole he dropped into the bunker dont do anything youre not sure about lou told him a booby trap here could be wired to enough tnt to blow up this whole fucking forest uhhuh dont i know it benton advanced on the desk with unhurried calm i aint gonna get cutebelieve you me i aint i aim to climb on a ship and go home one of these days whether the krauts like it or not sounds good to me lou agreed as if he hadnt spoken benton went on so if i think theyre getting sneaky ill just back off im good at this business but i know theres guys where im not even in their class so he went to work on the top drawer lou stood there and waited he did his best to act relaxed but sweat trickled from his armpits down his sides sweat was supposed to cool you off these beads felt boiling hot he told himself that was his imagination it had to be but so what benton started to open the drawer then paused with a grunt he went around to the side of the file cabinet and shone his flashlight into the narrow space between its back and the wall uhhuh he said on a thoughtful note whats up looks like a wire goin back theretwo wires matter of fact one for top and one for bottom if idve pulledwell who knows but i dont aim to find out can you cut em oh sure benton seemed surprised he needed to ask be a second or twogotta fit the wirecutters to the extensions so theyll reach can you lean over and shine a light down while i work otherwise i kinda need three hands lean over the desk i mean dont touch nothin if you can help it you know ill try lou did wishing he were six inches taller so he had more to lean with hows that over to the left a tadthere you go lou couldnt see what benton was doing he heard a couple of clunks then one soft twang then another the sergeant sighed okaynow ive pulled all its teeth lets see what weve got are you sure not asking was as tough as standing there radiating unconcern had been if lou didnt trust benton to do this job right he should have brought someone else along doubting him out loud would piss him off and might hurt his confidence that could make him goof later which neither of them would enjoy lou opened the top drawer nothing blew up he wasnt astonished to find the drawer full of potatomasher grenades no sweat lieutenant benton said i cut the wire that woulda tripped those fuckers right away thats nice lou said you do the bottom drawer too better believe it thus encouraged lou also opened that one he found more grenades whistling between his teeth he turned the flashlight on the papers in the crates to his disappointment they werent anything he could use to track more fanatics some were comic bookstyle fourpanel illustrations of how to fire the panzerfaust and the panzerschreck others were propaganda posters showing bestiallooking american soldiers assaulting aryan children while a mother watched in horror the german caption read roosevelt sends kidnappers gangsters and convicts in his army toby benton read as much german as he read choctaw the pictures told their own story though nice to know they love us he said dryly this is old stuff lou said they printed it while the war was still going onbefore fdr died well well still get rid of it benton said well clean out all this crap and thatll be one bunker the bastardsll never use again sure it will and thatll leavehow many just like it loud had this unhappy thought not long before a million nah lets look on the bright sidea million minus one benton gave him a quizzical looknot the first hed got from the stolid noncom would you sooner leave it here no no lou shook his head but i was hoping itd give us a lead to more of the diehards and it doesnt look like it will shutting down places like this wont put out the fire neither will not shutting em down sergeant benton answered and lou couldnt very well tell him he was wrong congressman jerry duncan scrawled his signature on a letter commending a constituent for collecting a ton and a half of scrap aluminum with the war over people would find different things to do with their spare time and energy theyd still need letters of commendation from their congressmen though jerry duncan was morally certain of that plump and smooth and wellmanicured he was morally certain of a good many things like most republicans he was morally certain four terms were too many for any one president and especially for a democrat well god had taken care of that now that that man wasnt in the white house any more looked a lot rosier for the gop so did with any luck at all his party would recapture at least one house of congress for the first time since the hoover administration duncan had just been getting his feet under him in his law practice in those days another world back then one without hitler without the atom bomb without fdrs alphabetsoup agencies without american boys stationed all over the world and trying to figure out what the hell was going on well people right here in washington were trying to figure out what the hell was going on too jerry duncan knew damn well he was so much had happened so fast since the japs bombed pearl harbor and even after ve day and vj day things didnt seem to have slowed down his secretary stuck her head into his inner office whats up gladys jerry asked glad to escape his own thoughts that woman from anderson is here to see you congressman she is duncan glanced at his wristwatch in surprise howd it get to be three oclock already hed been doing this that and the other thing by what hed accomplished it shouldnt even have been lunchtime plenty of people lived their whole lives three steps behind where they should have been he supposed he ought to be glad he didnt get the feeling more often but it still rattled him he tried to pull himself together well tell her to come in sure gladys withdrew without closing the door all the way he heard her say you can go in now thank you the door opened again duncan got to his feet the woman who came in was about as old as he was she mustve been hot stuff when she was younger she wouldnt have been bad now if she werent wearing blackand if the look on her face didnt say hot stuff was the furthest thing from her mind congressman duncan she said automatically jerry nodded she held out her hand im diana mcgraw as automatically duncan shook it her grip was firm but cool pleased to meet you mrs mcgraw he said and i was very sorry to hear about your tragic loss please accept my sympathies too many boys are dead her nod was bitter and determined at the same time yes too many boys are dead she agreed and for what congressman for what why did pat have to die after the war was supposed to be over gladys came in with a tray coffee please jerry was glad for the interruption wont you sit down mrs mcgraw he asked while gladys poured two cups thank you she sat stiffly as if her machinery needed oiling gladys put cream and sugar into jerrys cup then looked a question at her black is fine mrs mcgraw said here you are then the secretary set cup and saucer near the edge of jerrys desk then went out again without preamble diana mcgraw said do you know how many american soldiers besides my pat have been killed since the nazis said they surrendered congressman duncan started to answer but caught himself no i dont know not exactly the war department hasnt publicized the numbers whatever they are it sure hasnt mrs mcgraw agreed with a snipers smile how many do you think if you dont mind my asking over a hundredim sure of that jerry said some of the atrocities do get into the papers i wouldnt be surprised if it were twice that number maybe even three times she smiled that frightening smile again it made jerry duncan want to dive for cover the true figure is at least a thousand dead at least she seemed to repeat herself for emphasis that doesnt count wounded all since the socalled surrender cautiously jerry asked how do you know do you really know was what he meant still picking his words with care he went on as i say the war department doesnt go out of its way to talk about figures would you if you had to talk about figures like that diana mcgraw returned as for how i know well i have connections she held up a hasty hand not political connections not the kind you usually think about but when pat and betsy were in school i was in the pta i was central indiana vicechairwoman for several years as a matter of fact i went to a couple of the national conventions i know mothers all over the country ever since patdied ive been on the phone ive been sending wires my friends have been asking questions where they live thats what theyve found out and i believe them jerry whistled softly i believe you he said and meant it she radiated conviction over a thousand good lord you have to understand she said if some german killed pat in the battle of the bulge i wouldnt be here talking with you now id be as sorry as i am but not quite the same way war is war and things like that can happen but were at peace now or were supposed to be why did pat have to die almost five months after the war was supposed to be over why have a thousand american kids died after it was supposed to be over thatsa better question than i thought it would be when you made this appointment jerry said slowly like a lot of midwestern republicans hed wanted nothing to do with the war in europe when it broke out he hadnt called himself an isolationist but he hadnt been far from thinking that way either then japan bombed pearl harbor of course he voted for the declaration of war he wanted tohe was as furious as anybody else and if he hadnt his district would have tarred him and feathered him and ridden him out of congress on a rail hitler declared war on the usa that saved him from wondering how he would have voted when roosevelt asked for war against germany maybe not knowing was just as well what do you want me to do mrs mcgraw he asked get some answers she said at once why are we still over there now that the wars over what are we doing over there that could possibly be worth a thousand lives why is the war department trying to hush up everything thats going on over there those were all good questions jerry duncan said so they were especially good questions for a republican to ask since they could hold a democratic administrations feet to the fire and what will you be doing yourself jerry inquired me diana mcgraw sounded surprised he needed to ask im going to the papers and the radio stations you cant keep things secret forever congressman you just cant youre right duncan said youre absolutely right some of the mistakes we made in the first part of the warwell thank god we didnt lose on account of them sometimes i wonder why we didnt believe me i do and the public still doesnt know about a lot of them a few weeks ago i would have been shocked if you told me something like that shocked now i believe you she said why do those people want to sweep everything under the rug to keep folks from pointing a finger at their mistakes again jerry replied without hesitation with a politicians facility he chose not to remember that hed voted against the draft bill that passed by a single vote the summer before pearl harbor and that hed also voted against more money for the war and navy departments before the usa actually got into the fighting pointing a finger at the administrations mistakes was easy pointing a finger at his own high time somebody did mrs mcgraw said germanys smashed its knocked flat its not going to magically come back to life if we bring our boys home i hope not jerry did remember that people had said the same thing after world war i but nobodyd blown up american doughboys in the aftermath of that fight who could say now what would have happened had the germans tried it then lets get on with it she said crisply how many gis will the fanatics have killed by this time next week or next month or next year and why will those gis have died for what for making sure the nazis dont come back and start up again jerry knew exactly what his democratic colleagues would say he said it himself to see how diana mcgraw responded she snorted she looked at him as if shed found half of him in her apple she was nothing but a housewife but she made him flinch oh nonsense she said and somehow she got more scorn into that than a cigarpuffing committee chairman would have from oh bullshit how do you hold down a whole country she went on and how do you fight people wholl blow themselves up to get rid of you if theyre already willing to die what can you do to make them quit jerry duncan opened his mouth then he closed it again nobody in america had been able to find a good answer to that one of the things the public didnt know was how much damage japanese kamikazes had done how much more would they have inflicted if the usad had to invade the home islands jerry silently thanked god for the abomb it had saved one hell of a lot of american casualties probably kept a good many japs from joining their ancestors too not that he gave a rats ass about them its a good question he said hoping his pause wasnt too noticeable ill be honest with youi dont know maybe some army officers do fat chance mrs mcgraw broke in i was going to say but if they do they sure havent given any sign of it no they havent her bitterness was hidden while she planned action it came back now and pats dead and my grandson will grow up never knowing his uncle and my husband stumbles around like a man in a dazeno like a man whos stopped caring and he has and how can you blame him if pat died for nothing if jerry began she interrupted him again if we get our troops out of there because of what happened to pat it may turn out to be worthwhile after all it may if we dont she shook her head then brushed at the bit of transparent black veiling that came down over her eyes from her hat she left a few minutes later back straight stride determined she had a cause and shed stick with it come hell or high water jerry duncan stared after her even though shed closed the door when she went out damned if she hadnt given him one too breslau wasnt in germany any more for that matter breslau wasnt breslau any more stalin had shoved the ussrs border several hundred kilometers west and shoved newly resuscitated poland west about as far at germanys expense to make up for it the poles were calling the place wroclaw which they pronounced something like breslau captain vladimir bokov didnt give a damn what they called it he also didnt give a damn that he was in sovietoccupied poland rather than sovietoccupied germany as long as the red army was around nobody except the fascist bandits he was trying to root out would give him any trouble local officials sure as hell wouldnt breslau wroclaw whatever you wanted to call it had its share of bandits and then some its garrison surrounded on all sides had held out till just before the general surrender the poles were trying to solve their german problem by resettling their countrymen from lwow and other cities to the east who didnt want to live under soviet rule and by uprooting the local germans and marching them west toward the new borderat gunpoint if necessary that would probably workin the long run for the time being it gave the remaining germans every reason to support the fanatics thus the local polish governor had just come to a sudden and untimely end a sniper had put a mauser round through his head from close to a kilometer away shooting poles had its points bokov had done it himself more than once even shooting communist party members was sometimes necessary as anyone whod worked through the purges of the late s could attest but shooting someone who was in the soviet governments good graces went over the line and so vladimir bokov had come east to do something about it the highway to wroclaw was wide and fine it had been part of the german autobahn system now the poles got to use it there was an american film where one police official told another round up the usual suspects the local authorities in wroclaw polish and russian seemed to have followed that rule to them the usual suspects seemed to include anyone who thought the city should still be called breslaushould in other words stay german theyd rounded up hundreds of wehrmacht veterans theyd added all the butchers bakers and candlestick makers whod ever said anything bad about poles or russians in a town like wroclaw that gave them plenty to choose from a captain in a csapka met bokov outside the wirefenced camp where the locals were stowing their prisoners bokov thought the squarecrowned polish headgear looked asinine but that wasnt his worry after a couple of false starts he and captain leszczynski conversed in german he could almost understand leszczynskis polish but leszczynski didnt want to try to follow his russian the pole wore three red army decorations on his chest but he was plainly a nationalist as well as a communist one day no doubt leszczynski would get purged bokov was sure of it maybe the proud pole knew it too but they were on the same side now these damned werewolves are driving us nuts leszczynski said bokov was highly fluent in german hed studied it for years leszczynski spoke it like a native before the war hed likely used it as much as polish the poles might hate and fear their western neighbors but they leaned toward them as if drawn by a magnet in russian a traveling fort with a cannon in the turret was a tank as it was in english the poles borrowed pancer from the germans well deal with them one way or another we will bokov said confidently jawohl aber naturlich irony filled captain leszczynskis voice poles didnt like russians much better than they liked germans they looked down their noses at russians though and hardly bothered to hide it so did germans of course it was almost less annoying from them than from fellow slavs we will bokov insisted if we have to kill them all well do that hmm well maybe captain leszczynski seemed to be reminding himself they were allies here which prisoners will you want to interrogate the ones you think likeliest to know something about comrade pietruszkas murder bokov answered before the pole could say anything he added the ones who hate us worst oh they all hate us leszczynski said the only question is which ones did something about it adrian marwede said hed been a wehrmacht noncom he still wore a ratty fieldgray service blouse bokov eyed a slightly darker ring on the left sleeve near the cuff the sort of ring a cloth cufftitle might leave after it was removed only a few wehrmacht divisions used cufftitles howeveryou were really in the waffenss nicht wahr all their outfits had them marwede turned pale wellyes he muttered but then captain leszczynski took bokov aside when breslau surrendered all the defenders were promised life personal property and eventual return to germanythe ss included what bokov couldnt believe it who made such an idiotic promise with a certain somber relish the pole replied lieutenant general gluzdovsky commander soviet sixth army first ukrainian front bokov gave him a dirty look the truth could be far more irritating than any lie all right i wont knock him around for being an ss swine the nkvd man said ill knock him around because he may know something about what happened to pietruszka does that make you happy pietruszka was a solid man leszczynski said which could have meant anything whatever it meant bokov could worry about it later he turned back to adrian marwede so ss man he said and watched marwede flinch in a russians mouth that was all too likely a death sentence in and of itself bokov let him stew for a few seconds then asked what do you know about reinhard heydrich ss man hes supposed to be a tough bastard marwede sounded less impressed than he might have he explained why as he went on how tough can you be when you hardly ever get near the front captain bokov didnt care whether heydrich was personally brave things hed heard made him think heydrich was but it didnt matter one way or the other the man was a goddamn nuisanceworse than a goddamn nuisanceand needed suppressing what do you know about what heydrichs up to ss man what you think the reichsprotektor talks to the likes of me marwede raised an eyebrow without changing expression bokov slapped him across the face forehand and backhand that was good technique not only did it hurt it humiliated the german staggered dont screw around with me bokov said evenly tell me what i want to know and dont give me any shit you answer another question with a question and what happens nextll make that look like a love tap get me marwede spatspat red in fact he nodded gingerly yes i get you he got that his life lay in an nkvd officers cupped palm well what else did he need to get if bokov decided to squeezewhat do you know about what heydrichs up to not much hastily marwede went on nobody up at the front ever found out much of what he was up to all we knew was there were times we couldnt get the guns or the ammo we needed when that happened people would swear at heydrich he was squirreling the stuff away or guys said he was ive heard that before captain leszczynski remarked so have i bokov said he knew why too it was true he also knew why heydrich was squirreling that stuff awayto do just what he and his merry thugs were doing now the russian eyed marwede what else do you know what else have you heard wellnothing i can prove marwede said bokov gestured impatiently the german continued sometimes guysd go back with light wounds things that wouldnt keep them out of action more than two three weeks tops only they wouldnt come to the front again when they shouldve healed up thatd drive our officers crazy what happened to them bokov asked and dont tell me you dont know either you fritzes have paperwork coming out your assholes ive never seen people for paperwork like germans if you wanted to find out where these troops were you could marwede held up his right hand with index and middle fingers raised together the gesture germans used when they were swearing an oath honest to god i dont know our officers couldnt track those guys it was like they fell off the face of the earth they just disappeared nobody knew where nobody could find out where people said heydrich had em i dont know if he did but people said so ive heard that before too leszczynski said me too bokov agreed he glowered at the ss man when did this start happening i dont know exactly marwede set himself for another blow when it didnt come he continued first couple of people i can remember disappearing like that were right after kursk i think fuck your mother bokov exclaimed in russian marwede scowled he must have learned what that meant the nkvd man didnt care if the germans had started collecting holdouts as early as the summer of theyd have a devil of a lot of them and the bastards could raise all kinds of hell which when you got right down to it was nothing he didnt know already that i hadnt heard captain leszczynski said with calm either commendable or excessive depending on how you looked at things neither had i as far as i know nobodys heard that before bokov said he wanted to slap the ss man around for no better reason than giving him bad news the look he gave marwede should have knocked him over by itself listen cuntface if youre lying to me just to make me trip over my own dick ill hunt you down and cut your balls off and stuff em down your throat he wasnt lying adrian marwede had the sense to realize as much not me he said using that oathtaking gesture again ive done plenty of stupid things but im not dumb enough to screw around with the nkvd so he recognized the collar tabs and cap did he that was interesting you were dumb enough to join the ss bokov growled youre dumb enough for anything summer bozhemoi vi the indiana state capitol was one impressive building diana mcgraw had never seen it before not in person even though anderson was only about twenty miles outside of indianapolis a housewife in a suburban town didnt need to hobnob with state legislators but since shed already seen her congressman the idea of coming here intimidated her less than it would have before now that shed seen the us capitol this one also seemed a little less splendid than it would have it was built in the same neoroman style but the dome was smaller and narrower the proportions altogether less grand well so what indiana wasnt washington and most of the time that was a good thing dressed in black she got out of the family pontiac ed sat stolidly behind the wheel lighting a chesterfield this wasnt his showit was hers he mourned their son by himself within himself diana was the one with the fiery conviction that what had happened to pat shouldnt happen to any other mothers son she was the one who was damn well going to do something about it too she glanced at her watch it was still a quarter to ten of course shed made sure she got here early things wouldnt start for another fortyfive minutes and when they didshe wasnt sure what would happen then you couldnt be sure till you went and did something a man across the street whistled and waved it wasnt a wolf whistlehe was trying to get her attention when she looked up he called mrs mcgraw thats me she nodded automatically he loped across the street toward her dodging cars like a halfback he wore a snapbrim fedora and a sharp suit that didnt hang well on his pudgy frame behind him came a bareheaded guy in his shirtsleeves who carried a big camera im e a stuart from the times the man in the lead said stuart no w we talked on the phone this sounds interesting jack herell take photos hi jack said around the stub of a smelly cigar pleased to meet you both diana said what does the ea stand for jack grunted laughter e a stuart sighed you really want to know ebenezer amminadab he answered resignedly my ma read the bible too darn much you want to know what i think but thats how come i use ea amminadab diana echoed in wonder hoping she was pronouncing it right well now that you mention it yes about your mother i mean he was the only kid in kindergarten who went by his initials jack said oh shut up e a stuart told him and diana was sure the reporter had heard the joke way too many times before stuart turned back to her how many people you expect here hundreds she said more confidently than she felt where were they shed made phone calls shed sent wires shed got answers no more shed got promises satan surely fried people who said theyd do something and then didnt come through that wouldnt do her any good though if this fizzlesill try something else thats all she told herself quitting never entered her mind another woman wearing mourning got out of a car the old de soto drove off the woman who shouldered a sign as if it were an m came over to diana so did another reporter he introduced himself as chuck christman from the indianapolis news the photographer he had in tow might have been jacks younger brother the way the newspapermen razzed one another showed theyd been covering the same stories for a long time the other woman was louise rodgers from bloomington she was about dianas ageno big surprise thereand shed lost a boy to a roadside bomb two weeks after the german surrender the papers and the news on the radio just whitewash everything she told e a stuart and chuck christman were here now christman pointed out months late and how many lives short louise rodgers said till i heard from diana i didnt think i could do anything about davidthats my son no was my sonexcept sit around the house and cry all day but if we can keep other mothers from crying thats better you said it diana agreed the reporters scribbled more women drifted in some of them had lost sons after the nazis allegedly gave up too others hadnt but still hated the idea of so many soldiers dying after the war was supposed to be over and victory won some men joined them toonot many but some two were veterans whod been wounded in france or germany another older was like ed hed caught a packet in they called the last one the war to end war this time the stupid war cant even end itself he said the reporters liked that they both wrote it down diana went back and opened the pontiacs rear door she took her own picket sign off the backseat bring our boys home from germany now it said come on she told the other demonstrators heart thuttering she led them to the sidewalk in front of the capitol shed never done anything like this before till pat got killed shed never imagined doing anything like this nothing like a kick in the teeth to boot you out of your old routine how many dead one sign asked too many dead another answered why are they still there another demanded isnt the war over yet a sign inquired rhetorically stop the war departments lies another said dead since surrender another sign declared anybody who carried one without either a question mark or an exclamation point seemed out of place another contingent of picketers came up the street illinois mothers support bringing troops home announced the sign their leader carried german occupation wastes american lives another one said a decorated veteran carried that sign good to see you diana called to the illinoisans she could hear how relieved she sounded well shed earned the right by god theyd said they would come down it was an easy train trip from chicago but promises were worth their weight in gold she remembered what shed thought a little earlier about the devil and people who didnt come through now where were the people from ohio theyd promised too which meantshed have to see what it meant or whether it meant anything a man driving a battered model a ford stopped right in the middle of capitol street the bakery truck behind him almost rearended him but he either didnt notice or didnt care he leaned out the window and shouted communists youre all nothin but a bunch of lousy reds were americans thats what we are diana shouted back the demonstrators near her cheered we have to carry flags next time she thought and wished she could write that down so she wouldnt lose it communists the man in the model a yelled again he shook his fist at the people on the sidewalk the bakerytruck driver leaned on his horn so did somebody stuck in back of him the man in the model a shook his fist once more maybe at them maybe at the picketers maybe at the world he put the decrepit old car in gear it wheezed on down the road well people are noticing us said the woman at the head of the illinois group her name was edna somebodyright this minute diana couldnt remember what she nodded thats the idea now where are those folks from columbus and cincinnati they said theyd be here isnt that them edna somebody pointed up the street lopatynski that was her name no wonder i couldnt come up with it for a second diana told herself sure enough here they came like the cavalry riding up over a hill in the last reel of a western serial ohio says too many have died for nothing their leaders sign said the war dept still wants war declared another and a haggard womans sign poignantly asked what did my only son die for another car stopped on capitol this one with a screech of brakes traitors yelled the man inside his face was beet red he all but frothed at the mouth they oughta string up the lot of you diana worked hard to stay calm shed fearedno shed knownpeople would shout things like that shed done her homework too the constitution says we can peaceably assemble and petition for a redress of grievances my son got blown up months after the surrender isnt that a grievance the redfaced mans arm shot up and out in a salute the germans had made odious all over the world heil hitler he said you fools want the nazis back again he drove off before horns blared behind him edna lopatynskis laugh was shaky but it was a laugh well diana are we communists or are we nazis no diana answered firmly were americans if the government is doing something stupid weve got the right to say so weve got the right to make it stop and thats what were doing she looked around chuck christman and e a stuart were both close enough to hear what shed said yes shed expected to get called a traitor and a communist that anybody could think she was trying to help the nazis after heydrichs lunatics murdered pather free hand folded into a fist she wanted to clock that guy the nerve several cops stood around watching the picketers go back and forth one of them ambled over to diana and fell into step beside her you running this whole shebang he inquired i organized it anyhow she said i dont know that anybodys in charge yeah well if it goes wrong youre the one well jug the policeman said keep doing like youre doing stay spaced out let people through stuff like that long as you play by the rules we wont give you no trouble i think youre full of hops myself but thats got nothin to do with whats legal my son got killed for no reason diana said tightly president truman never has said why we still need to be in germany i dont think he knows either hes the president of the united states the cop sounded shocked he was a kansas city machine politician till fdr dumped henry wallace diana retorted hes only president cause roosevelt died hes not infallible or anything huh shaking his head the policeman went away several men who looked like state legislatorsthey were mostly portly they had gray hair and they wore expensive suitscame out onto the capitol steps to watch the demonstration some of them shook their heads too they must figure were a bunch of crackpots diana thought well well show em one of the legislators got into an argument with his colleagues another man ostentatiously turned his back on him diana wondered if the first guy was on her side she could hope so anyhow a car horn blared the driver stuck his left hand out of the window middle finger raised he didnt bother slowing down lobbyists and lawyers with briefcases passed through the picket line on the way to doing business in the capitol you should be ashamed one of them said but he took it no further than that more ordinary people went through toomen in work clothes women in dresses theyd got from the sears catalogue or made themselves a couple of them said unkind things too but one fellow who looked like a mechanic said give em hell folks and flashed a thumbsup diana wanted to kiss him not everybody hated them shed hoped that was true but she hadnt been sure a fat middleaged man stood on the sidewalk watching the demonstrators every time diana turned around and got another look at him he got hotter and hotter edna lopatynski also saw it that fellows going to make trouble she said quietly im afraid youre right diana answered but what can we do about it they went back and forth twice more before the fat man blew a fuse commies he yelled nazis he didnt know which brush to tar them with so he used both then he charged into them fists flailing a woman squalled when he hit her another woman stuck out a foot and tripped him as he rampaged past her a man sat on him and kept him from doing anything worse than hed already done the capitol police came over in a hurry this time and came over in force the fat man yelled obscenities i dink he boke by dose said the woman hed hit her nose was sure bleeding red spotted the front of her white blouse jack and the photographer from the news both took pictures of her you cant haul off and belt a lady like that buddy one of the policemen said youre under arrest lady the fat man found several other things to call her none of them endearments then he said you oughta haul her off to jail for doing crap like this you oughta haul every goddamn one o these yahoos off to jail and you oughta lose the key once you do they may be jerks but they arent breaking any laws the flatfoot answered assault and battery now he clicked his tongue between his teeth you should be ashamed of yourself she aint even half your size a rattlesnake isnt big either but its still poison the fat man had strong opinions so did diana she wanted to tell the cops to haul him off and lose the key no matter what she wanted she made herself go on marching without saying anything the police didnt like her they wouldnt appreciate her sticking her oar in if she just let them do their job they did it they got the fat man up onto his feet cuffed his hands behind him and led him away he swore a blue streak all the way which did him exactly no good bring our boys home from germany diana chanted the other picketers joined her together they made more noise than the fat man diana thought it was obvious they made more sense too here you are congressmangladys plopped the days papers onto jerry duncans desk thanks he said could you bring me another cup of coffee too cant seem to get myself perking this morning she grabbed the cup and saucer ill be right back thanks he said again absently this time he was already starting to study the papers you had to keep up with what was going on if you wanted any chance to keep your head above water the new york times came first it was much more proadministration than jerry was but had far and away the best coverage of foreign affairs gladys brought back the fresh cup steam rising from it jerry duncan sipped without consciously noticing where the coffeed come from after the times he went through the wall street journal for economic news and the washington evening star the post and the timesherald to find out what was going on in his second home those done he reached for the indianapolis news and the indianapolis times then for the anderson democrat you also had to stay current with what was going on in your district if you decided washington was your first home not your second the folks back in indiana would likely throw you out on your ear next chance they got right in the middle of the news front page was a photo of cops dragging off a wildeyed fellow who could have dropped a few pounds or more than a few a woman with a picket sign and what looked like bloodstains on her face and on her blouse watched him go man arrested after attacking demonstrator the caption said the story under the photo was almost studiously neutral it identified the leader of the demonstration as diana mcgraw of anderson she was moved to oppose government policy on germany after her son patrick was killed there in september long after the formal german surrender hmm jerry said and went to see what the times had to say it was the more liberal paper in town because it backed the democrats it looked down its nose at anyone presuming to protest against their polices but even its tone was moreinsorrowthaninanger its editorial said while we understand mrs mcgraws grief and outrage and those of other similarly afflicted the united states must persist in its mission of returning germany to civilization and democracy to germany as for the anderson democrat it didnt seem to know which way to jump its name told where its politics lay on the other hand diana mcgraw was a home town girl doing something that got noticed beyond the home towns bordersnot easy not if your home town was anderson what would you do if it were your son shed asked the democrats reporter after the demonstration ended as far as jerry was concerned that was the sixtyfourdollar question even the democrat and the indianapolis times seemed to understand as much how could you condemn people whod lost their boys in combat for wanting to know why and wasnt that all the more true when theyd lost boys in combat when there wasnt supposed to be combat any more you might disagree with themboth papers plainly did but youd have a devil of a time calling them disloyal a dead son gave someone carrying a picket sign a decided moral advantage jerry realized he wouldnt be the only congressman reading these reports come to think of it he might not have been the only congressman diana mcgraw saw when she came to washington if he wanted to stay in front on this issue he couldnt sit on his hands he had to stand up or someone else would get ahead of him his colleagues could and would draw the same conclusions he was drawing his own party desperately needed a club with which to clobber the democrats the other side had dominated congress since the start of the s theyd just won the biggest war in the history of the world that might set them up to keep winning elections forever if the gop couldnt find a shillelagh if over a thousand gis dead since ve day werent a shillelaghthen the republicans would never come up with one jerry started scribbling notes the house was debating a bill that would finish rationing by the end of the year there wasnt much debate because nobody worth mentioning opposed the bill the whole country hated rationing the sooner it disappeared forever the happier everyone would be when jerry raised his hand that afternoon then he had no trouble getting the floor speaker rayburn pointed his way and said the chair recognizes the gentleman from indiana the wily texan no doubt hoped jerry would speak out against the bill if a republican wanted to commit political suicide sam rayburn would gladly hand him a rope thank you mr speaker jerry liked the houses ritual courtesies mr speaker i rise to discuss a related kind of rationingthe rationing of our troops lives in germany bang down came rayburns gavel you are out of order mr duncan our occupation policy is out of order mr speaker jerry said bang you are out of order mr duncan rayburn sounded like god right after the children of israel did something really stupid if you could imagine god moonfaced and pouchy and bald he looked like him too mr speaker point of order mr speaker the cries of protest came from a dozen republican throats maybe more jerry had wondered whether anyone else would back his play thered been a oneparagraph ap squib about the demonstration on page fourteen of the new york times nothing more the same squib showed up in the evening star the timesherald and the post didnt bother running it maybe the other republicans had noticed anyhow maybe sam rayburn had too he shook his head glowering down from his high seat on the marble dais this has nothing to do with the measure under consideration and the gentleman from indiana knows it may i address that point mr speaker jerry called briefly rayburn growled thank you it seems to me mr speaker that the bill we were debating mainly has to do with how best to wind down from the war thats what i want to talk about too because the fighting in germanys gone on and on even though the nazis said they surrendered last spring dont we need to wind that down rayburn scowled at jerry from on high then the texas democrat said that damnfool woman who led her silly march comes out of your district doesnt she minus the unflattering adjectives yes mr speaker she does jerry answered sure as hell sam rayburn didnt miss much all right then say your say and after youre done well ease back to the business at hand it wont matter one way or the other the speaker of the house sounded indulgent he knew the kinds of things representatives had to do for their constituents he might not miss much but he missed something that day when he didnt quash jerry duncan before jerry was well begun thank you mr speaker jerry said once more i want to know why the united states army the mightiest army in the history of the world hasnt been able to stamp out these german fanatics i want to know why we havent been able to hunt down this reinhard heydrich who seems to be the brains of the outfit i want to know why upwards of a thousand servicemen have been killed in germany since the socalled surrender and i especially want to know why the war department is doing its level best to hide all these deaths and to pretend they never happened members of his own party applauded him democrats jeered a couple of them shook their fists president truman knows what hes doing one man shouted youre soft on the germans another democrat added i am not jerry said indignantly when we try those thugs we capture i hope we shoot them or hang them or get rid of them for good some other way and i expect we will that has nothing to do with why were wasting so many lives in germany it has nothing to do with why we cant stop the insurgency either what are we doing in occupied germany and why arent we doing it better sellout that democrat yelled isolationist someone else put in the minute the japs hit pearl harbor isolationism became a dirty word bang bang bang speaker rayburn plied his gavel with might and main the house will come to order bang bang mr duncan how do you propose to find out what you want to know you dont really care rayburns words implied youre just making political hay jerry pretended not to hear that if you didnt notice you didnt have to react he simply responded to what rayburn actually said questioning some war department officials would make a good first step mr speaker you think so do you rayburn rasped a chuckle with a large majority in both house and senate democrats controlled who got questioned the speaker made it plain he didnt aim to let anybody ask the war department anything inconvenient or embarrassing shrugging duncan said you can pull a rug over a pile of dust but the dust doesnt go away it just leaves an ugly lump under the rug bang that will be quite enough of that sam rayburn said now returning to the bill we were actually considering sam rayburn didnt want to look at the lump under the carpet neither did robert patterson the secretary of war even though his department had done most of the sweeping that put it there and harry truman really didnt want to look at it and didnt want anybody else looking at it either well too bad for all of them jerry thought its there and they put it there and im damn well going to tell the country about it reinhard heydrich was a thorough man when he realized he would have to fight a long twilight struggle after the wehrmacht and waffenss went under he prepared for it as best he could he studied english and russian hed never be fluent in either one but with a dictionary and patience he could manage english should have been easier it was germans close cousin and used the same alphabet as heydrichs birthspeech but he found himself understanding the soviets much more readily than the britishto say nothing of the americans soviet authorities reacted to the holdouts much as hed expected deportations executions brutalitythat all made sense to him it was the way he would have attacked the problem were he running the nkvd it was the way the reich had attacked the partisan problem in russia and yugoslavia the germans hadnt done so well as they would have liked and heydrich hoped the soviets wouldnt either but it was a good rational approach the americans on the other hand on his desk sat a threedayold copy of the international heraldtribune the patriot whod put the paper in a secure drop had circled a story on an inside page in red ink heydrich had already read the piece three times he knew what all the words meant he even understood the sentencesindividually anyhow but the story as a whole struck him as insane i thought this must be a joke he told johannes klein a joke or a trick one what does it say klein asked the veteran oberscharfuhrer did fine in german and cared not a pfennigs worth for any other language it says there are rallies in america protesting the soldiers weve killed since the surrender it says the people protesting demand that the americans take their soldiers out of germany so we cant kill any more of them heydrich answered fine klein said when do the machine guns come out and teach these idiots some sense thats what i wondered heydrich answered thats what we did to those white rose traitors by god he shook his head still angry at the college kids whod had the gall to object to the fuhrers war policyand to do it in public too well theyd paid for it paid with their necks a lot of them and just what they deserved of course it is hans klein said what else can you do when a fool gets out of line the yankees arent doing anything to them zero not even taking them in for questioning madness heydrich said he added the clincher one of their congressmen is even making speeches taking the demonstrators side can you imagine that hans his longtime comrade shook his head so did heydrich he tried to picture a reichstag deputy standing up in and telling the fuhrer the war was lost and he ought to make the best peace he could what would have happened to a deputy who did something like that as near as heydrich could tell he wouldnt just die he would cease to exist would cease ever to have existed he would be aggressively forgotten the way ernst rohm was after the night of long knives as usual klein thought along with him so what are they doing to him heydrich brought a fist down on the newspaper nothing he burst out this foolish rag goes on about freedom of speech and open discussion of ideas have you ever heard such twaddle in all your born days not me klein said not me either heydrich said i read this and i thought the yankees were trying to trick us but a couple of our people have lived in america they say it really works this way any crackpot can get up and go on about whatever the devil he wants how did they lick us klein asked no german asked that about the russians stalin put out a fire by throwing bodies on it till it smothered he commanded enough bodies to smother any fire too which had come as a dreadful surprise to the fuhrer and the general staff but the americans werewell different seemed a polite word for it after some thought heydrich said that may be the wrong question well whats the right one then if they really are this naiveheydrich still had trouble believing it but didnt see what else he could think if the heraldtribune story wasnt made uphow do we take advantage of it ah ach so once klein saw the right question he focused like the suns rays brought to a point by a burning glass like any longserving noncom he had a lot of practice taking advantage of officers with more power but less subtlety his predicament with them was much like the reichs with its occupiers heydrich waited to see what he could come up with after a few seconds klein said we have to keep fighting the amis aber naturlich heydrich broke in we have to keep fighting ja the oberscharfuhrer seemed to remind himself of where hed been before he got to where he was going but we should also let them down easy give them something these people who want to go home can latch on to and use for an excuse so they dont look like a pack of gutless quitters like the pack of gutless quitters they really are heydrich thought but hans klein wasnt wrong the enemys morale mattered germany had done well with propaganda against the low countries and france then completely botched it against the russians treating them like a bunch of niggers in the jungle wasnt the smartest thing the reich could have done a little late to worry about that now though heydrich leaned forward intently what have you got in mind well sir way it looks to me is we ought to say something like were only fighting to get our own country back again we ought to let em know how much that means to us and to ask em how happy theyd be if some son of a bitch was sitting on their head and we ought to say well be mild as milk if they just pack up and go away klein winked at heydrich the reichsprotektor laughed out loud he couldnt remember the last time hed done that of course germany would rearm the moment it had the chance and of course german physicists would get to work on atom bombs as soon as they could that sparked another thought as long as theyve got this fancy bomb and we dont they have the whip hand too heydrich said we should tell them we understand that and we should promise wed never go after the bomb we should promise on a big tall stack of bibles hans klein winked again and damned if heydrich didnt laugh again after the last war the treaty of versailles said germany couldnt have all kinds of weapons her top aeronautical engineers designed civilian planes other engineers tested panzers in russiathe soviet union was another pariah state artillery designs for sweden uboats for hollandwhen hitler decided it was time to rearm he didnt have a bit of trouble if germany needed atom bombs to get ready for the next round shed have them can we do something like that sir klein asked youd better believe it heydrich got up from his desk and walked over to a file cabinet under the fuhrers framed photo it held a complete run of signal the reichs wartime propaganda magazine signal was a slick product printed in many languages people said enemy publications like life and look had stolen from its layout and approach that wasnt why heydrich started poring over back issues though theyd run an article he could adapt he remembered it had come late in the war after things on the eastern front went bad that helped him narrow things down he grunted when he found the copy he needed here we go what have you got hans klein inquired see for yourself heydrich held out the magazine to him the article was called what we are fighting for it showed a wounded wehrmacht man on one page his left arm bandaged and bloody his mouth open in a shout of anger and pain on the facing page was a closeup of a blond blueeyed little girl perhaps five years old the two photos summed up exactly what the reich was fighting for but text went with them that text was what heydrich wanted kleins eyes lit up wow amazing sir i saw this too i remember now that youre showing it to me again but i never would have thought of it let alone come up with it just like that he snapped his fingers words are weapons too heydrich said you need to know where you can get your hands on them why dont you go grab yourself some chow i want to fiddle with this for a while as soon as klein left heydrich sat down again and started writing he worked in german he knew hed make a hash of things if he tried to compose in english but it would get translated other people would suggest changes and add things too that was all right he was fighting again vii in nuremberg the city jail was near the center of town the palace of justicea fancy name for the local courthouselay off to the northwest it had taken some bomb damage that didnt surprise lou weissberg in nuremberg it was much easier to list the buildings that hadnt taken bomb damage than to set down the ones that had bomb damage or not the allies were going to try the nazi big shots theyd captured at the palace of justice the american judge and his opposite numbers from the uk france and the soviet union would give goring and hess and ribbentrop and streicher and jodl and keitel and the rest the fair trials they hadnt given to countless millions and then without the tiniest bit of doubt most of those goons would hang or face a firing squad or die in whatever other way that extraordinary court decreed in the meantime the nazis cooled their heels in the nuremberg jail as if they were ordinary burglars or wife beaters well not quite they had a wing of the jail all to themselves they had a lot more guards in that wing than anybody in his right mind would have wasted on burglars or wife beaters and the jail was surrounded by barbed wire and sandbagged machinegun nests and concrete antitank barriers the pointed obstacles looked to lou like german designs theyd probably been yanked from the siegfried line and carted back here in a way lou appreciated the irony the obstacles intended to slow up american and british tanks were now going into action against the krauts whod made them in another way that irony was scary almost six months after the alleged surrender the occupation authorities needed to stay buttoned up tight to make sure the germans didnt liberate their leaders if they somehow did that would give the united states a godawful black eye all the same lou wondered how much reinhard heydrich wanted to have to do with men who might have the rank to order him around somebody like goring wouldnt be able to resist trying and heydrich damn his little shriveled turd of a soul was managing just fine by himself anybody who tried to jog his elbow might come down with a sudden and acute case of loss of life lou eyed the jail again fuck he said softly despite all the barbed wire and the antitank barriers and the machinegun nests and the swarms of jittery dogfaces manning the position somebodyd managed to stick one of the fanatics new propaganda sheets on the wall shaking his head lou walked over and tore the sheet down it was what europeans used for typing paper a little taller and a little skinnier than good old lou had seen english and german versions of the propaganda sheet a printer was giving the fanatics a hand if the occupation authorities caught him at it hed be sorry lou snorted under his breath that didnt seem to worry the bastard one whole hell of a lot this was the english version it was obviously translated from the german translated by somebody better with german than with english what are we fighting for it said smudgy type on cheap paper what germans desire to acquire by victory is the fulfillment of the idea that an individual shall be respected for his own self this is what makes life worth living for us assholes lou muttered the nazis had sure respected jews and gypsies and russians for their own selves hadnt they we fight for the sake of our own culture the propaganda sheet went on if you had invaders ruthlessly occupying your own land you too would rise up against them how can a brave folk do anything else assholes lou said again louder this time titos guerrillas russian partisans the french maquiswhat did the ss and the wehrmacht do to real freedom fighters when they caught them everybody knew the answer to that one lou had seen a photo a german soldier took of a hanged russian girl maybe eighteen years old around her neck the ss had put a warning placard in german and russian i shot at german soldiers once we have once more our own state back in our hands we solemnly vow that we seek no new foreign conflict europe has seen enough of war the sheet declared as if hitler hadnt had thing one to do with that war and the way the nazis fought it all we seek is a fair peace and our own national selfdetermination which is the proper right of any free people what kind of selfdetermination did the reich give poles and scandinavians and dutchmen and belgians and frenchmen and yugoslavs and greeks and russians and but germans had a knack for feeling a shoe only when it pinched them lou started to crumple the sheet and toss it aside then he caught himself even though cic already had plenty of copies a major with a double chin was giving orders to some gis lou walked over to him and said major i just found this stuck to the wall here how come somebody was able to put it up the major snatched the paper out of his hand gave it one quick scornful glance and barked who the hell are you lieutenant and who the hell do you think you are im lou weissberg counterintelligence corps lou said calmly and who are yousir by the way he said it he made the title one of reproach not respect the major took a deep breath and opened his mouth to scorch him then the man had very visible second thoughts even a lieutenant in the cic might have connections that could make you sorry if you crossed him as a matter of fact lou did raising when you really held a full house gave you confidence that showed my names hawkinstony hawkins the major said in a different tone of voice he took a longer look at the propaganda sheet you found this goddamn thing hereat the jail just now like i said right over there lou pointed youve got this whole shebang around the building and i wondered how some jerry snuck this thing in here and put it up without anybody noticing goddamn good question major hawkins said fuck me if i know for sure but my best guess is his best guess got interrupted the explosion wasnt anywhere close by but it was big the ground shook under lous feet one of the soldiers said that an earthquake you california jerks think everythings a goddamn earthquake another gi answered thats a motherfucking bomb going off is what that is one huge honker of a bomb too that echoed lous thoughts much too well he looked around in all directions at least even money the jails gray bulk would hide whatever had just happenedbut no there it was off to the northwest a swelling cloud of black smoke and dust major hawkins had already proved he had a foul mouth he outdid himself now then he rounded on lou what do you wanna bet thats the fucking courthouse you cic cocksuckers are such hot shit how come you didnt keep the fanatics from blasting it to the moon oy lou clapped a hand to his forehead that hadnt occurred to him but as soon as he heard it he would have bet anything he owned that hawkins was right the older officers words had that oracular feeling of truth to them a bomb there couldnt be anything else well it could but he was only too sure it wasnt a moment later he said oy again and arent the judges working in there now if they could have bottled what major hawkins said then they could have heated water in every house in nuremberg for a year in spades the portly major added in case lou didnt think he meant it lou had other things on his mind cmon he said maybe we can do some good hauling people out of the ruins you go on lieutenant hawkins said shaking his head me i aim to sit tight and do what im supposed to be doing for all we know those mothers are trying to lure us away from here so they can rush this place and spring the big prisoners while were all making like a chinese fire drill right lou said tonelessly and the major was no two ways about it that didnt make lou like him any better sketching a salute lou took off he trotted on parallel to the pegnitz the river that ran through town the river made a better guide than the streets with so much of nuremberg ruined what was street and what was rubble werent always easy to tell apart as he hurried toward the palace of justice he sadly clucked several times the fanatics could sound reasonable that sheet theyd put out would make some people back in the states go see they only want to run their own affairs and be left alone but no matter how they sounded they went and did something like this lou loped past a pile of wreckage about a story and a half tall that gave him his first good look at the palace of justiceor rather what had been the palace of justice he skidded to a stop gravel and shattered bits of brick scooting out from under his boots holy crap he yelped somebody must have screwed up that was the first thing that occurred to him the american occupiers had gone out of their way to protect the jail they hadnt taken so many precautions at the palace of justice the authorities must have thought no one would attack it till the nazis honchos went on trial oops what the american authorities had thought might have been reasonable that turned out not to matter when reasonable was also wrong somebodywho would have to answer questions now that the pooch was screwed we did everything we reasonably could in his mind lou could already hear the calm sober voice explaining things whoever the voice belonged to it would be calm and sober he was sure of that would calm sobriety be enough to save the dumb fuckups career it might you never could tell but that would be tomorrows worry todays was more urgent shattered wreckage of a truckprobably one of the ubiquitous gmc deuceandahalfsblazed in front of what was left of the palace of justice three wings had projected out from the main body of the building one of those wingsthe central one the one in front of which the truck had stoppedwas just gone clean off the map the other two were shattered tumbledown smoking ready to fall down any second now christ how much tnt did that fucking truck carry lou wondered the sleepless analytical part of his mind instantly supplied the answer and a sneer to go with it two and a half tons dummy the palace of justice sure as hell looked as if a pound bomb had gone off right in front of it some of the rubble shook lou thought more of it was falling down but that wasnt what was going on a dazed bleeding american soldier pushed a door off of himself and tried to stand up he keeled over instead lou hurried over to him and pulled away more bricks and stones and chunks of woodwork the wounded mans left ankle bent in a way an ankle had no business bending lou fumbled at his belt sure as hell he still carried a wound dressing and a morphine syrette the guy needed about a dozen bandages but lou covered up a nasty cut on the side of his head anyhow the morphine was probably also sending a boy to do a mans job but it was what he had he stabbed the wounded soldier and bore down on the plunger to his amazement the gi opened his eyes a few seconds later what happened he asked his voice eerily calm maybe the morphine was doing more than loud thought it could truck bomb lou added the obvious great big old truck bomb boy no shit the man said you musta stuck me huh when lou nodded the guy went on you think you can splint my ankle while the dopes working best chance ill get ill try im not an aid man or anything the wounded soldier waved that aside lou got to work he had no trouble finding boards and he cut up the other gis trouser leg to get strips of cloth to tie the splint into place morphine or no morphine the guy wailed when he straightened that shattered ankle as best he could some aid men were there more ambulances rolled up bells clanging as lou wrestled with the splint some soldiers set up acaliber machinegun position too lou wondered if theyd gone asiatic till one of them said assholes aint gonna run another truck in here and blow up all the guys who came in to help that hadnt occurred to lou but some of the americans seemed properly paranoid he supposed that was good stretcher bearers carried a groaning wounded man past him and the fellow he was helping all badly hurt men sounded pretty much the same no matter where they came from but lou happened to look up at just the right moment he saw a notsofamiliar uniform on the stretcher holy cow he blurted in lieu of something stronger is that general nikitchenko he was proud of knowing the name of the soviet judge for the upcoming trial to his surprise the man on the stretcher knew some english i is lieutenant colonel volchkov he said alternate to iona timofeyevich the general he is he broke off gathering strength or looking for a word after a moment he found one kaput it wasnt exactly english but it wasnt exactly not english either lou had no trouble understanding it anyhow were gonna get you patched up colonel dont you worry about anything right this minuteyoull be fine one of the medics said and then to his own comrade get moving gabe soon as he goes into an ambulance well come back for this poor sorry son of a bitch his hands were full he pointed with his chin at the soldier lou was splinting who you callin a sorry son of a bitch the gi demanded and lous admiration for morphine leaped forward again the medics didnt bother arguing they lugged volchkov away then returned for the man with the broken ankle more wounded people staggered from the wreckage some were women secretaries clerks translators cleaning ladies lou had no idea all he knew was bombs werent chivalrous that also applied to the american bombs that had leveled most of nuremberg but he didnt worry about those corpsmen and other gis also carried women out on stretchers in blankets or sometimes just in their arms wounded women were slightly shriller than wounded men otherwise there wasnt much difference between them most of the casualties here not surprisingly seemed to be men lou thought for a moment that someone in a dark robe had to be a woman then he saw the person was wearing a mans black dress shoesone anyhow because the other foot had only a sock on it a judge he realized dully american french british that hardly mattered the medics didnt bother with some of the bodiesand pieces of bodiesthey found in the smoking wreckage they piled them off to one side a makeshift morgue one growing rapidly and they cursed the fanatics with a weary hatred that made the closecropped hair at the nape of lous neck try to stand on end turn the guys who wore red crosses loose on the nazis and they might clean them out in twenty minutes flat or worse luck they might not that enormous explosion hadnt just brought american soldiers out to see what had happened and do what they could to help shabby scrawny germans stared at the wreckage of the palace of justice and at the rows of corpses off to one side they didnt seem especially horrifiedbut then theyd seen plenty worse doesnt look like theyll have their trial any time soon a middleaged man remarked to his wife she shrugged so what it wouldnt have been anything but propaganda anyhow she said he nodded he took out a little can of tobaccoscrounged from butts no doubtand started rolling himself a cigarette lou wanted to kick him in the nuts and punch his stringy frau in the nose but the goddamn kraut was right god only knew when the authorities would be able to try goring and ribbentrop and the rest of those jackals and whod want to sit on the bench now and judge them hell whod dare goddamn heydrich to hell and gone lou muttered but damn him or not his fanatics had won this round the mcgrawshad a fancy radio set it did everything but show you pictures of what was happening at the other end and now with this newfangled television thing that was coming too back before the war when people first started talking about it diana figured it was all buck rogers stuff and would never come true well these days it didnt do to laugh too hard at buck rogers look at rockets look at the atom bomb and television was plainly on the way even if it wasnt here yet once upon a time the telegraph and typewriter and telephone were buck rogers stuff tooexcept buck wasnt around yet to give them a name dianas mouth tightened she wished the telegraph had never happened then she wouldnt have heard about pat she shook her head that wasnt the point the point was he never should have got killed in the first place shed timed it perfectly the tubes needed a little while to warm up almost the first thing she heard once they did was this is william l shirer reporting to you from nuremberg hed been reporting from europe since before the war started hed covered it from berlin during the nazis first fantastic run of triumphs she and ed had both read berlin diary now he was back on the other side of the atlantic broadcasting from the undead corpse of the third reich and the photos shed seen of himhe was a skinny little bald guy who wore a beret and smoked a pipedidnt detract too much from his authoritative voice and plain common sense as you will have heard by now reinhard heydrichs brutal diehards bombed the palace of justice in this city the leading captured war criminals from the nazis regime were to have gone on trial there for war crimes in a few days now those trials have been indefinitely postponed many people here doubt whether they will ever take place aint that aheck of a thing ed said diana shushed him she wanted to hear william l shirer the death toll is known to be close to two hundred the correspondent went on among the dead are the french russian and american judges and the british alternate the russian and british alternates are among the badly wounded as is judge robert jackson the american prosecutor two hundred dead diana echoed her voice rising in disbelief and for what to give those thugs the kind of trial they dont begin to deserve now ed raised a hand to quiet her william l shirer continued american authorities believe the fanatic who drove the truck loaded with explosives up to the palace of justice died in the blast he touched off before general pattons recent death he said the idea wasnt to die for your country but to make the soandsos on the other side die for theirs like the japanese the german fanatics seem to have taken this idea too much to heart after these messages ill be back with an american officer who will talk about the problems posed by enemies who dont care whether they survive a recorded chorus started singing the praises of a particular laundry soap diana knew from painful experience that it wasnt worth the money if you used it with hard water if you listened to the chorus it was the greatest stuff in the world but then you deserved whatever happened to you if you took radio advertisements seriously william l shirer returned with me is lieutenant louis weissberg of the us army counterintelligence corps he said thanks for coming on lieutenant thanks for having me mr shirer by the way weissberg talked he was from new york city or somewhere not far away tell us a little about why its harder to defend against enemies who plan to die after completing their missions for all the reasons youd expect lieutenant weissberg didnt say you dummy but you could hear it in his voice shirer wasnt a dummynowhere closebut he remembered that some of the people in his audience were after a beat weissberg went on they dont have to worry about escape routes and they can take chances ordinary soldiers never would because they dont expect to get away anyhow if you have the nerve to press the detonator its all over in a hurry isnt it just shirer agreed ruefully were standing here in front of what would have been the courtyard for the trial of the centurythe trial that would have warned the world no one can get away with wars of aggression any moreand theres not much left im afraid do you have any idea how the fanatic in the truck was able to pull up right in front of the building well mr shirer if a jeep isnt the most common military vehicle in germany these days a deuceandahalf is weve got more of em here than a dog has fleas put a guy in an american uniform in the drivers seatand you can bet that kraut was wearing oneand nobody paid any attention to him till too late weissberg said william l shirer asked the same question diana mcgraw would have isnt that a severe security breach sure weissberg answered which took diana by surprise we slipped up and we paid for it we have to hope we dont do it again thats all who was responsible for protecting the palace of justice shirer asked and whats happened to him since the bombing sir i dont have the answer to either of those questions weissberg replied you gotta remember im just a lieutenant i see little pieces of the picture not the whole thing youd do better asking general eisenhower or somebody like that for the record i have asked general eisenhowers headquarters shirer said spokesmen there declined to comment they claimed that anything they said might damage an officers career what do you think of that weissberg ducked again if they arent going to say anything about it you cant really expect me to can you never hurts to try shirer answered easily thank you for your time lieutenant weissberg sure weissberg said william l shirer went off the air the commercial this time was for a brand of cigarettes that in eds memorable phrase tasted like it came out of a camels rear end diana was steaming you see how things go she demanded of her husband do you see they know who was supposed to take care of that building they know he was asleep at the switch but will they say so dont hold your breath will anything happen to him because he was asleep at the switch dont stay up late waiting for that either army always takes care of its own ed said two hundred dead diana said one more time they arent just sweeping dirt under a rug theyre shoveling it onto graves thats wrong thats wrong dammit was what she wanted to say but the habits of her whole adult life with ed suppressed the swear word youre doing everything you know how to do ed said youre in the papers youre on the radio for cryin out loud me i couldnt get in the newspaper if i robbed a bank that suits me fine too it suited me finetill pat got murdered diana answered but this craziness wont stop till we make it stop if i have to get my name in the paper to do that i will babe im not arguin with you her husband said youd better not not about this diana thought that wasnt fair though and she knew it ed had backed her play as much as was in him to do it wasnt his fault that she was the more outgoing one in the family and speaking of outgoing or going generallyill need to make another trip to washington she said he grunted can we afford it he asked a reasonable question hed always brought in the money while diana figured out how to spend it the arrangement worked well for them but it meant she had a better notion of what was in the checkbook and the savings account than he did she nodded briskly not to worry we could swing it by ourselves but we wont have to weve got donations coming in like you wouldnt believe ive startedoh i guess youd call it a business account mothers against the madness in germany im calling it ed grunted again whatll it do to our taxes and can the government use it to come after us if we dont keep everything straight they got al capone on a tax rap when they couldnt nail him for anything else remember if they sent him to alcatraz they can sure take a whack at us they wouldnt do that diana answered with the sublime confidence of one sure of the righteousness of her cause on a more practical note she added and ive talked to a bookkeeper he says he knows how to keep everything straight okay i hope he knows what hes talking about ed said from what i hear at the plant tax law is pretty much whatever the government wants it to be i asked around abe is supposed to be the best in town bar none diana said you got abe jacoby i sure did she said not without pride how about that ed sounded relieved if a smart sheeny like him cant keep us outa trouble nobody can those people know money like they invented it maybe they didwouldnt surprise me one bit i was thinking the same thing diana said he doesnt work cheap ed guffawed theres a hot headline yeah i know diana laughed too a little sheepishly but like i said the moneys there and hes charging less than he might have too how come you bat the baby blues at him ed winked to show he was kidding i did no such thing actually diana thought abe was kind of goodlooking which made her sound stuffier than she would have otherwise hes got a nephew in munich and he wants to help make sure sheldon stays safe gotcha that sure makes sense bloods thicker than water i guess sometimes its thicker than money too lets hope so diana said i wont be the only one going to washington either if we can get into the papers all over the country for picketing in front of the indiana state capitol think whatll happen after we picket in front of the white house theyll arrest you thats what ed predicted no they wont not if we stay peacefuland we will diana said that chowderhead jumped our people in indianapolis we didnt start any brawls we wont in washington either but truman has to know we wont put up with stalling around in germany well youve got that right ed paused a moment thinking make sure you tell the papers and the radio before you go that way they can be there ready to get the story and the photosthe papers can get the photos i mean i understood you diana walked over to him bent down and gave him a kiss and ive already talked to the indianapolis papers and to the ones in washington and to the chicago tribune and the new york times if you want a story to go all over the country those last two are the papers to aim for i havent got hold of nbc and cbs yet but i will attagirl i mightve know you were a jump ahead of me ed chuckled truman doesnt know what hes up against poor sap when you start something you dont stop till you get it done maybe he was kidding again maybe not diana didnt care this needs doing darn it she said and ed didnt try to tell her she was wrongnot that she would have listened if he had whenthe jeep carrying tom schmidt came to the first checkpoint on the outskirts of munich the dogface behind the wheel let out a sigh of relief and lit up a lucky made it through injun country one more time he said is that what you guys call it the reporter took out a little notebook bound with a spiral wire and wrote it down you betcha charlie the gi who answered impartially to mel or to horseface nodded emphatically liable to be some asshole behind a tree behind a rock hiding inside any old ruined house or barnand there sure are enough of em the cigarette jerked as he spoke he wasnt wrong munich and its suburbs had taken sixtysix air raids during the war the estimate was that it held something like cubic yards of rubble and the rubble still held bodiesnobody knew how many but even in this chilly weather the stink of dead meat hung in the air the guards at the checkpoint werent delighted to see them one made mel pop the hood another got down on his stomach and slid a longhandled mirror under the jeep toms papers got examined with a jewelers loupe do you do this to everybody tom asked the mp going over them sure do the noncom answered goddamn krauts can get our uniforms stealing a jeeps easy as pie and theyre damn good forgers you must spend a lot of time doing it then tom said yes sir the mp said better than letting some bastard through with a bomb though they caught a guy a couple of days ago at another checkpoint what did they do to him when he saw they were gonna search the car he hit the switch and blew himself up he got four of usone of em was a buddy of mine sorry it wasnt enough but it was all tom could say yeah me too the mp replied you look legit though he turned to his comrades the jeep clean when they told him it was he nodded you can pass on getting to the vier jahreszeitenthe four seasons the hotel where ike was stayingwasnt easy munich had been plastered to a faretheewell all right the roads were all potholes or worse the jeep also had to clear two more checkpoints before they got to the hotel and the fortifications around it would have done credit to stalingrad after what happened up in nuremberg mac we dont take no chances said the gi who patted tom down he was so intimate tom halfway expected to be asked to turn his head and cough but after the blast at the palace of justice how could you complain finding nothing more lethal than notebook fountain pen wallet and a box of cherry cough drops the soldier let him through a generator chugged outside the vier jahreszeiten the biggest part of the city didnt have power yet the hotel had taken bomb damage tom would have been surprised if it hadnt most of downtown munich was nothing but bomb damage but you could tell this had been a hotel once upon a time which put it ahead of a lot of places he had to cool his heels for fortyfive minutes before eisenhower would see him that was also par for the course hed managed to get an appointment with the american proconsul at last a spruce young major led him in to the great man youve got half an hour the youngster said terrific tom thought he started with a big one how do you see things in germany now were making progress eisenhower said rubbish getting cleared power and sewage works coming back industry starting up again people getting fed we are making progress he repeated it as if to reassure himself how much trouble are the fanatics causing tom asked more than we wish they were less than they wish they were ike answered they cant go on forever sooner or later theyll run out of men willing to die for a dead cause how could he know that was he whistling in the dark instead of asking directly tom said how much support do they have among the people well some germans arent sorry they fought the war theyre only sorry they lost eisenhower said they wouldnt mind getting in the saddle againim sure of that but im just as sure it wont happen what do you think about the movement in america to bring home the occupation troops tom asked the room wasnt warm to begin with the temperature suddenly seemed to drop twenty degrees im a soldier im not supposed to have political opinions but i think that would be a poor policy eisenhower snapped in spite of all the casualties we cant seem to stop yes ike bit off the word he cut the interview short too tom schmidt was disappointed but on reflection again not surprised viii bernie cobb swore as he tramped through the woods and fields outside of erlangen fog puffed from his mouth and nose at each new obscenity when he looked back over his shoulder he could see his footprints in the snow fuck this shit he said i was doin this same crap a year ago when the krauts hit us in the bulge thats how you got frostbite in your feet walt lefevre finished for him we heard it before bernie yeah well this is still a crock cobb said wars been over since may for cryin out loud so how come im still lugging a fucking grease gun around and making like theres bandits in the woods on account of there are bandits inna woods sergeant carlo corvo talked out of the side of his mouth hed never said he had mafia connections but hed never said he didnt either connections or no he was a bad guy to screw around with we gotta make sure the cocksuckers stay hid and dont come out an make trouble see good luck bernie said sergeant corvo gave him a dirty look but he couldnt say bernie was wrong not when the fanatics had kicked up so much trouble already warming to his theme bernie went on i wish i had my ruptured duck goddammit i didnt sign up to chase diehards through the boonies after the war was done you signed up to do whatever the fuck uncle sam tells you to do sergeant corvo said if he wants you to dig latrines from now till youll fuckina do that and youll like it too cause hed find somethin worse for ya if ya didnt right now he wants you to go assholehunting you oughta be good at it experience taught you how much you could argue with a noncom corvo took less kindly to backtalk than most he isnt uncle sam even if he thinks he is bernie thought bitterly but corvos three stripes made him a more than unreasonable facsimile look for tracks corvo went on thats what we gotta do with the snow on the ground and the leaves off the trees and the bushes those nazi shitheels cant hide out here no more weve already found a buncha bunkers on account of that at least one of those bunkers had blown skyhigh while american soldiers were searching it too maybe more than one if bernie were in charge of things he would keep stuff like that as hushhush as he could but hed known one of the guys who went up in this particular blast pete would never try and draw to an inside straight again something moved over there walt pointed towards a stand of trees a couple of hundred yards away a bird a deer maybe bernie didnt want it to be anything worse lefevre shook his head i dont think so it ducked back behind a trunk like fuck sergeant corvo said for once bernie agreed with him completely spread out youse guys corvo went on if that assholes got one o them automatic rifles its like goin up against a bar cept the german piece only weighs half as much two grease guns and an m not impossible odds but not good either not against a weapon that fired full automatic out tofarther than this how come the krauts made the good tanks and the good guns bernie wondered were fuckin lucky we won or did we he had a finger on the trigger as he slowly approached the trees he felt all alone hell he was all alone one burst wouldnt get everybody that way but one burst could sure chop him down when the surrender came hed thought hed got free of this kind of dread he licked dry lips no such luck something stirred behind one of those skeletonbranched trees halt bernie yelled hande hoch his accent was horrible but at least he remembered to use german not english he hit the dirt while he was yelling a good thing too because three or four bullets cracked past the place where hed stood a second earlier he started shootingnot aimed fire but plenty to make the diehard keep his head down walt and carlo were banging away too if the fanatic was a kid maybe he wouldnt know which way to answer if on the other hand he was a waffenss vet whod swing for war crimes if they caught him he damn well would he fired at sergeant corvo who had the m that could hit from farthest away so it was the right move wanting to run bernie scuttled forward instead he could smell his own rank fear the jerry headed back to another tree bernie squeezed off a burst of his own at least one round caught the kraut in the back he pitched forward onto his face in the snow good shot corvo called he was up and cradling his rifle so the fanatic hadnt done anything too drastic to him lets see what we got careful nowliable to be trip wires for mines around here you dont want your balls bounced watch where you put your clodhoppers with so much free and almostfree pussy over here bernie took good care of his balls he raised and lowered his booted feet with utmost caution the germans used a trip wire so thin you could barely see it even when you were looking for it the fanatic was still twitching when bernie came up to him but he wouldnt last hed caught the whole burst one in the lower left part of his back one as near dead center as made no difference and one just below the right shoulderblade he turned his head to look at the american mutti he choked your mama aint gonna help you now kid bernie said roughly the other two gis came up behind him he bit down on the inside of his lower lip hoping he wouldnt heave the diehard was a kid with those smooth cheeks he couldnt have been more than fifteen well he wouldnt see sixteen now fuckin good shooting cobb sergeant corvo said theyre all the same size when they pick up a gun just to be on the safe side he grabbed the fanatics piece sure as hell it was one of those nasty new automatic rifles it looked ugly as sin all plastic and rough metal but it was very bad news that big bananashaped clip held what looked like a weeks worth of ammo mutti the german said again on a weaker note now no he wouldnt last long well good riddance but even so bernie spat in the snow i dont like shooting kids goddammit he said and those nazi cocksuckers are using more of them all the time sure they are walt said kids dont mind shooting you not even a little bit its cowboys and indians for thema game like surethats what bothers me bernie said they dont even know the score doesnt seem fair to point em at us this little asshole probably didnt even figure he could get hurt till you put three in his tenring corvo broke in get it through your head manfair went out the window as soon as these guys didnt come out with their hands up after the surrender they catch you you aint goin into no pow camp they catch you theyll cut your cock off and shove it down your throat you think this halfgrown fucker wasnt playin for keeps unhunh bernie didnt hesitate there hed come too close to getting ventilated okay maybe you aint as dumb as you look maybe corvo turned the kid over that seemed to finish killing himclose enough anyway bernie didnt notice exactly when he quit breathing for good the sergeant went on well go through his pockets maybe hes stupidmaybe he carried something the cic guys can do something with but he didnt about the most interesting things on the kids corpse were three or four little onepfennig coins cheap zinc dark with corrosion but still displaying the nazi eagle and swastika they werent legal tender any more the occupation authorities had come down like a ton of bricks on symbols of the old regime well maybe even a fanatic needed to remind himself what he was fighting for mournfully walt said now well have to search this whole goddamn wood see if theres a bunker hidden here somewhere boy im really looking forward to that gotta be done sergeant corvo said lefevre didnt argue with him neither did bernie cobb the noncom wouldnt be down on his belly probing he wouldnt be doing pickandshovel work either bernie knew he and walt damn well would no wonder corvo didnt mind the prospect so much who ever minded the hard work somebody else was doing captain howard frank slapped a film canister down on lou weissbergs desk lou eyed it as if wondering if it had an explosive charge inside truth to tell that wouldnt have much surprised him nu he asked nu nu frank agreed one jew to another and a new headache too lou could have done with a bromoseltzer he tried to make light of it i thought you were going to appoint me morale officer and have me show the troops the latest western ha funny his superior saidabout as much as the joke deserved i had to rout out a morale officer cause i needed a projector to run this verkakte thing its even got sound somewhere heydrichs assholes have themselves a regular photo lab whatexactly is it lou wondered if he wanted to know a photo lab what the hell were the fanatics doing now its trouble thats what come see it ill watch it again too maybe one of usll spot something i missed the first time i can hope so anyway okay lou got up captain frank grabbed the canister and carried it off the morale officer actually had rigged a screen and a projector in one room of the rambling nuremberg hotel the cic had taken for its own whyd you have me take it out of the machine if you want me to run it again he asked captain frank cause im dumb bruce the captain answered do it anyway okay sure bruce was a ninetyday wonder with one gold bar on each shoulder he wasnt about to argue he threaded the film through the projector he did that very well for all lou knew he was a morale officer because hed been a projectionist before uncle sam grabbed him as he turned on the machine he said hit the lights will you lou stood closest to the switch so he flicked it squiggles and scribbles filled the screen as leader ran through then without warning a scaredlooking young man stared out at him the man wore us uniform and looked as if hed been worked over his eyes kept sliding to the left toward something offcamera a rifle aimed at his head lou wondered something like that unless he missed his guess my name is matthew cunningham private us army he paused to lick his lips and glance left again then he rattled off his serial number and went on i am a prisoner of the german freedom front they say they will uh execute me if us authorities dont meet their uh just demands for now im being well treated the mouse under one eye the split lip and the fear all over his face gave the lie to that us forces are to leave germany at once germany is to be free to determine its own destiny like any other nation the struggle for national liberation will go on until victory is won no matter what you cannot hope to outlast the aroused german folk socalled prisoners of war must also be released to return to their loved ones germany demands peace and justice cunningham gulped then whispered one more word please he disappeared more squiggles flashed across the screen then it showed pure white which faded as bruce turned off the projector lou turned on the room lights jesus he said you betcha captain frank agreed a slightly chubby fundamentally decent man in a hell of an unpleasant place howd you like to get one of those every week or maybe every day jesus this time bruce beat lou to the punch is he really a gi lou asked not just a kraut who speaks good english a matthew cunningham was reported as awol in frankfurt last week frank answered were bringing in some of his buddies to make sure this is really him but for now its a pretty good bet yeah lou nodded the kid on the screen sounded just like a yank shit what do we do next that isnt for the likes of you or me to decide captain frank said but you can bet your last dime we wont pack up and go home you can bet we wont turn all the jerry pows loose either how many divisions worth of new recruits would we give heydrich if we did what about the chuckleheads back home bruce said whatll they do when they see this thing how loud will they squawk we aint gonna show it to em frank said we aint gonna say boo about it you want to spend the next twenty years in the aleutians son youll be lucky to get off that easy if you open your big yap where a reporter can hear got it oh yes sir bruce said solemnly but how do you know this is the only print those nazi bastards made fuck captain frank whispered i didnt even think of that lou hadnt thought of it either he realized he should have maybe bruce really had worked in a movie theater that would have got him used to thinking about more than one copy of a film at a time to lou a movie was a movie but how many people in how many theaters all over the country could watch the same movie at the same time lots lots and lots the captain visibly tried to pull himself together lou when you were watching thisthis piece of crap did you see anything that gave you a clue about maybe where it was made let me think sir lou said it wasnt easy all hed looked at was the gis face behind it wereplanks that didnt help much by the lighting it was shot with floods not with the sun bruce said you could tell by the shadows hes right lou wished he would have come up with that it was obviousonce somebody else pointed it out yeah captain frank nodded good one bruce you think it was in one of their goddamn bunkers then now hes asking the shavetail lou thought resentfully well bruce knew more about this stuff than he did himself probably the morale officer said and theyve gothow many of em too many thats for sure frank said gloomily couldve been in the woods couldve been inside frankfurt somewhere couldve beenany place at all near enough gevalt brassre gonna spit rivets when they see this lou said now tell me one i dont know his superior replied half of me thinks we just ought to ditch this film pretend we never got it except thatd be curtains for cunningham lou said yeah captain frank sighed heavily but its curtains for him anyway if those nazi shitheads follow through you think well get out of germany to keep them from shooting a hostage dont make me laugh lou didnt think so not for a minute but something else occurred to him if bruce here is rightand i bet he isthis isnt the only copy around if another surfaces after we make this one disappear well spend the rest of our days in leavenworth making big ones into little ones frank sighed again well you aint wrong i wish like hell you were all right already ill kick it up the line somebody with more rank than me can figure out where we go from here he paused to light a cigarette and smoked half of it in short savage puffs and youre right about something else too goddammit whats that sir any which way poor cunninghams fucked fraternizing remained against regulations for gis that didnt mean as much as the brass wished it did the americans occupying germany were as horny as any other young men they had a prostrate nation at their feet and plenty of frauleins were cute and persuadable quite a few didnt need much persuading they figured lying down with one of the conquerors was the best way to land on their feet more often than not they turned out to be right the same held true for american reporters only more so the occupying authorities couldnt give them orders against fraternizing some had wives back home but didnt care tom schmidt was single and thirtytwo sometimes he felt like a kid in a candy store sometimes he was a lot happier than that his latest flame ilse was small and dark and slimskinny if you wanted to get right down to it there werent many fat germans these days and a lot of the ones who were fat had been party bonzen and werent to be trusted ilse was close to his age she didnt wear a ring but a pale circlet on the third finger of her left hand said she had had fritz or karl gone to the eastern front and not come home or did he lie in or under some field in normandy ilse hadnt volunteered answers and tom hadnt gone looking for them as long as she said yes often enough he didnt require anything else she lived in a cellar most surviving nurembergers did because so much above ground was only wreckage she had a couple of lanterns and a little coal stove that kept the place warm enough thanks to tom she had plenty of fuel for them and plenty to cook on the little stove he sometimes wondered whether one person could eat that much and stay that skinny but if she had kids he never saw them he never saw their clothes or toys when he came to call again he didnt push it no answers werent what he wanted from her there werent many places to take a girl for a date no movie houses except the ones for american soldiers no fancy restaurants the only public eateries open were soup kitchenstyle places that served potatoes and cabbage and us army rations to keep people from starving you could walk in the parks if you didnt mind bomb craters and shattered trees and a reek of death whenever the wind swung the wrong way or you could get down to basics and go to bed tom didnt mind if that wasnt a guys idea of heaven he didnt know what would be ilse never complained if she had he would have looked for someone else it wasnt as if he didnt have other choices oh no one evening he brought her a carton of krationsless romantic than longstemmed roses maybe but the way to a girls heart in occupied germany she received them with hugs and kisses and promises of even better things later on then she surprised him saying and i have for you also etwas something shed learned some english in school before the war then forgotten most of it till she turned out to need it again tom had about that much german they managed what is it babe he asked now i know not she gave him a small parcel wrapped in old newspapers he frowned whered you get it a man give it to me he knew what the look on his face must have said because even by the light of two kerosene lanterns he could see her flush hastily she went on not that kind of man not a man i ever see before he give he say give to the amerikaner he go hah tom wondered if he ought to open it it was small for a bomb but you never could tell what did he look like a man ilse shrugged not big not small like a man who go through the krieg the war that meant almost every male here from fourteen to sixty okay tom wasnt sure it was but what else could he say he pulled out a pocket knife to cut the string holding the parcel together then tore the newspaper he didnt know what hed expected but a reel of movie film wasnt it huh he couldnt do anything with it till he found somebody with a projectorprobably somebody from the army would you recognize this guy if you saw him again what is recognize ilse asked know uh kennen she thought vielleicht um it might be or it might not he could watch the gears turning in her head she was no dope who would give her something to give to an american reporter well anybody might but the best bet was one of reinhard heydrichs merry men and if you admitted to recognizing one of those bastards you were much too likely to die before your time no wonder she stayed cagey and a lot of her mind was on other things shall i make for us supper sure babe go ahead tom answered ilse could do things with krats to turn army cooks green with envyarmy cooks who didnt just want to get the hell out of germany and go home that is assuming there were any such animals and tom was able to show his appreciation in a way much more enjoyable than helping with the dishes hed done that once but only oncehaving a man volunteer help with housework bewildered her afterwards sprawled over him warm and naked under the covers ilse said you will with this kinothis filmcareful be you betcha sweetheart tom assured her das ist gut she nodded seriously i do not want you to lose was that because he made a good meal ticket or did she actually fancy him between the sheets one more question tom was liable to be better off not asking tom ran a hand along her slim curves and let it rest on her backside almost like a boys but not quite no not quite lets hear it for the difference he thought aloud he said dont you worry about a thing ill be fine one of the lanterns had gone out the other was guttering low even in the dim red light remaining he could read her expression she thought shed just heard something really and truly dumb always i worry she said tom needed a couple of days to track down a corporal whose duties included running movies to keep the gis happywell happier yeah i can show you that the twostriper said eyeing the reel what is it stag film the idea perked him up i can sure as hell show you that buddy and watch it yourself too tom thought amused i dont know what it is i got it in town he didnt say anything about ilse run it and well both find out sound and everythinghow about that the projectionist said as he set things up gonna look a little washed outthis room aint as dark as it oughta be well lets see what we got he clicked a switch the projector whirred into action tom didnt think a german would have handed ilse a dirty movie to pass on to him but he didnt know what else to expect it wasnt a sweaty kraut grappling with a buxom blond fraulein it was my name is matthew cunningham private us army my serial number is tom gaped while the captured american soldier poured out the german freedom fronts demands only after the short film ended did he realize he should have been taking notes he was sitting on the biggest story of thewhat day week month not the year not in but the biggest one since the nuremberg palace of justice went up in smoke anyhow run it again he said urgently i dunno if i oughta the corporal answered you should take this straight to the brass i will tom had no idea whether hed keep the promise but ive got to know whats in it first we oughta kill all of them kraut motherfuckers the gi said as he rewound the film either that or get the hell outa here and let em kill each other off i sure as shit wouldnt mind seeing rochester again ill tell ya that you and jack benny both tom said the corporal laughed way more than the joke deserved after horror that often happened and if matthew cunninghams terrified face wasnt the face of horrorthen the shambling skeletons at dachau and belsen and the murder factories the russians found in poland were the nazis had so goddamn much to answer for how could anybody turn his back on that but how could anybody keep soaking up casualties after the surrender that wasnt either my name is matthew cunningham private us army i am nikolai sergeyevich golovko superior private red army vladimir bokov watched the film to the end it didnt take long then he turned to colonel shteinberg whod summoned him to see it all right comrade colonel there it is what are we going to do about it moisei shteinberg steepled his fingertips the senior nkvd officer had a pale thin face a blade of a nose and a dark heavy beard shadow he looked like the jew he was in other words what would you recommend he could sound like a bruiser yes but like a lot of jews bokov had known he could also use russian like a highly educated man well its tough luck for golovko of course captain bokov dismissed the hostage right away the soviet union wasnt going to bend because some stupid senior private let himself get nabbed the nazis whod taken him had to know that too they wouldnt have bent eitherthey also played for keeps the motherfuckers must be trying to put us in fear or else to embarrass us yes i think so too even though shteinberg often sounded tough bokov rarely heard him actually cuss listening to him you were tempted to forget there was such a thing as mat how do you propose to make them change their minds how many from their organization are we holding bokov asked here in berlin or all over our occupation zone i think berlin will do comrade colonel eight or ten were sure ofi know weve cracked a couple of the bandits cells another few dozen who may or may not be involved you know how it is colonel shteinberg shrugged once you start arresting people you may as well keep going you dont want to miss anybody by mistake da bokov noddedhe felt the same way well if it were up to me id kill off three or four of the real ones and leave their heads or their balls or whatever for the nazi pricks to find along with a message saying they can expect twice as much the next time they want to screw around with us best way i can think of to pay back nikolai sergeyevich shteinberg paused to fill and light a pipe stalin smoked one so a lot of soviet officials naturally imitated him shteinberg brought it off better than most maybe because hebraic features werent so different from those common in the caucasus after a couple of meditative puffs the jew said fuck your mother but thats a good notion go take care of it bokovs jaw dropped just when he thought shteinberg didnt use mat the jew dropped the basic russian obscenity on him and he used it the way a real russian would too to say something like this really needs doing so handle it i will comrade colonel bokov said give me a written authorization to take the bastards out of prison and ah deal with them and where do you think i should leave the ah remains we want to make sure the message gets to the right people still puffing shteinberg scrawled the requisite order anybody asks you questions tell him to talk to me he said handing captain bokov the scrap of paper bokov nodded again he didnt think anybody would quarrel with an nkvd officer but the world could be a strange old place his superior went on as for the other put the bitshmm theres a place on stalin allee they use sometimes that should get the message across the ussr was busily turning its chunk of germany into a proper socialist state where it could it used german communists whod survived the nazi epoch but it changed the landscape too lots of streets in soviet berlinand other places in eastern germanyhad new marxistsounding names bokov hoped hitler was spinning in his grave because stalin had a street named for himself here in the fascists capital and on armistice day the russians had unveiled a huge monument in the tiergarten commemorating the red army men whod died taking berlin away from the hitlerites adolfs ghost could look at that as much as it pleased bokov brought his mind back to the business at hand give me the address sir ill take care of everything he wouldnt have even wiggled without orders now that he had them he couldnt get in trouble for carrying them out he turned out not to need to show the jailer shteinbergs authorization do whatever you please with those people the man told him if you need to take them all go ahead i dont want them around the antisoviet bandits on the outside are liable to try and liberate them they wont liberate these four fuckers but youve got to hang on to the rest bokov said we may sweat more out of them yes comrade captain the jailer was the one doing the sweating bokov shot the prisoners one after the other he was no butcher though at his orders a sergeant took care of the necessary mutilation these cunts have it coming eh the underofficer said of course bokov answered the sergeant didnt seem to care much one way or the other he was just making conversation while he worked carrying the relevant remains in a canvas duffela damned heavy duffel nowbokov went out onto the chilly streets of berlin a large number of the men out and about were red army soldiers with padded jackets and felt boots they were equipped for worse weather than this most of them also carried either a rifle or a submachine gun if anyone gave overt trouble they were ready but what could you do against a fanatic with a bomb under his clothes or in a pushcartor worst of all against a fanatic driving a truck full of explosives most german men mooched around in shabby threadbare wehrmacht greatcoats german winter gear had been a joke the first year of the war though bokov doubted the hitlerites thought it was funny theyd got better at it later on but their stuff was never as good as what the red army used quite a few german women wore wehrmacht greatcoats too the ones in civilian clothes looked as mousy as they could they scuttled here and there like cockroaches trying not to get far from a doorway or alley into which they could escape nothing like the orgy of rape that accompanied berlins fall went on any more but the local women stayed scared good bokov thought four men in sharp western suits and topcoats strolled up stalin allee chattering in what had to be english they stood out like peacocks in a flock of crows one of them pulled out a notebook and wrote something in it who does he think he is the scandalized bokov wondered can he spy so openly but the american or englishman or whatever he was certainly could russians could go freely into the us british and french zones in berlin and it worked the other way too that was just wrong one of these days somebody would have to do something about it catching bokovs eye one of the foreigners tipped his snapbrim fedora the nkvd man wouldnt have minded wearing a hat like that it had style he touched the brim of his own officers cap and walked on idly he wondered how well the americans and british were dealing with bandit troubles in western germany he knew they had some their papers and those they permitted their germans gabbled about them in ways no soviet censor would have tolerated for an instant it surprised him at the end of the war the nazis seemed eager to give up to the western allies but went on fighting like maniacs against the ussr heydrich and his followers took on everyone they really were fanatics then bokov hoped theyd pay for it finding the building he wanted wasnt easy half the houses and shops and offices along stalin allee had been flattened or burned a lot of the others had taken damage of one kind or another street numbers were few and far between he could have asked a berliner he snorted fog bursting from his nose and mouth he was damned if he would then he snorted again on a higher note a berliner wasnt just somebody from berlin it was also the local word for a jelly doughnut he could have done with one of those right now he finally found what had to be the place by the way people went in and out it looked to be a cheap eatery or maybe a tavern that made some sense the fanatics could use the flow of customers to hide whatever they were up to bokov went in it was a tavern one of the shoddiest excuses for one hed ever seen three men scurried out a hole in the side wall as soon as they glimpsed his uniform the bruiser behind the bar kept his hands out of sight what did he have under there a schmeisser bokov wouldnt have been surprised in his best german he said theres a cordon around this place theyve already nabbed the rats who ran if i dont come out in ten minutes nobody here will like what happens next he was bluffing but the germans didnt know that he hoped so whatll it be then the barman asked beer bokov answered if they had anything they had that he laid a tenmark occupation note on the bar the man took it and started to make change bokov waved for him not to bother with a grunt the fellow gave him a seidel drink fast he suggested dont worryi will bokov did the beer was surprisingly good he set the duffel down beside him and turned a little to one side to keep an eye on the men sitting at the battered table they watched him too you got your nerve ivan poking your nose in here the barman said with a shrug bokov set down the mug all part of a days work he started out you forgot something a man called after him keep it youll know who needs to hear about it anyhow bokov didnt sigh with relief till hed got a hundred meters away ix diana mcgraw was packed she was ready tomorrow morning ed would put her on the train for washington tonight they were going to see the bells of st marys along with betsy and buster diana knew ed would stare at ingrid bergman every instant she was on the screen and never mind that she was playing a nun diana didnt mindmuch if you were male and didnt stare at ingrid bergman you were probably dead andsomething interesting might happen after her daughter and soninlaw went home to their baby inspirationor somethingwas where you found it shall we go babe ed said sure diana put on her coat it was down in the twenties nothing out of the ordinary not in anderson in december the weatherman said it wouldnt snow for another couple of days but what did the weatherman know they went out ed started up the pontiac when you worked for delco they looked at you funny if you drove anything but a general motors car they didnt usually say anything but they remembered glad ive got a heater ed remarked pulling the lever that got it going itll start putting out hot air right about when we get there diana said ed grunted but didnt try to tell her she was wrong the bijou was only a few blocks away in summer they would have walked over they still could have but the car was nicer especially with gas rationing gone at last downtown anderson was bright lights and tinsel and stores open late to snag more christmas shoppers with the war over with money in their pockets and purses most people were in a festive mood diana would have been but i wish pat were here too she saidas ed slid into a parking space oh boy me too he shook his head and stuck the key in his pocket he didnt bother locking the carnobody was likely to steal it he didnt put a nickel in the parking meter either it was after six oclock he paid for their tickets at the box office then he and diana walked into the lobby betsy and buster were already there buying cokes and popcorn ed got some too were free betsy exclaimed adding for a few hours anyway free nothing buster said im gonna have to pay karen galpin a buck and a half when we get home worth it betsy declared diana remembered how glad shed been to get out of the house once in a while when betsy and pat were little babysitters were worth the money and then some the bijou had seen better days too many feet had trodden the carpet too many bottoms had worn through the velvet on the seats even the curtain looked shabby and faded during the war peopled had more important things to worry about now most of them didnt but the wars not over not for everybody diana thought it should be but its not she sat down the seat creaked under heryes the bijou needed work well the management would likely be able to afford it the place was filling up fast everybody wanted either to stare at ingrid bergman or to listen to bing crosby people sighed with anticipation when the house lights went down then they laughed or whistled or let out catcalls because the curtain got stuck while it was still half closed a guy in overalls lugged out a tall ladder as the lights came up again a teenage kid scaled the ladder nimble as a squirrel he fiddled with something out of sight then flashed a thumbsup the curtain moved freely the audience gave him a hand as he descended he waved his face red the lights dimmed once more naturally the newsreel came first there were scenes of tiny exquisite japanese women in kimonos bowing to gis who seemed half again as tall they know theyre licked why dont the germans diana thought resentfully but beside her buster muttered miserable little monkeys japanese fire had made sure he wouldnt play football again by what the smoothvoiced announcer said everything was peachy in japan at least if you were an americanand who cared what happened to the japs then echoing what had just been in dianas mind the man went on but on the other side of the world things are harder one of our correspondents in the american zone in germany obtained this disturbing footage for us anonymous us army sources assure us its genuine there on the big screen a battered frightened young man said my name is michael cunningham private us army diana crossed herself she murmured a prayer for the soldiers family there were even worse things than what had happened to pat shed read the stories in the paper of course seeing the poor kidnapped soldier was a thousand times worse naturally the united states could not yield to the fanatics demands the announcer said i am sad to have to tell you that private cunninghams body was discovered not far from regensburg which is northeast of munich diana watched a couple of gis tenderly lift a canvaswrapped bundle into the back of a jeep the announcer went on the army is pursuing the heartless fanatics who murdered private cunningham and expects to make arrests soon diana wondered why the army expected to do that to look good in the newsreels she was getting more and more suspicious of everything the government claimed the army sure hadnt had much luck getting rid of the fanatics up till now the newsreel went on with floods and spectacular car crashes and highlights from football games diana couldnt care about any of them the flash gordon serial that followed also left her cold spaceships what a bunch of nonsense that was but then she would have said the same thing about atom bombs a few months earlier even the bells of st marys had trouble cheering her up that told her how far down she was more clearly than anything else could have but ed and betsy and buster enjoyed it she could enjoy their enjoyment even with none of her own afterwards as they went out into the cold betsy sighed and said back to the pressure cooker it gets better it gets easier diana said she wondered if she would ever feel the same way about the burden she carried after she and ed got back to the house they talked for a few minutes about nothing diana remembered the next day and then went to bed she wasnt amazed when he reached for her under the covers she didnt quite feel like it but she let him pull her close if he didnt fully please her he never knew it he went into the bathroom for a minute then came back and started to snore right away she lay on her back staring at the ceiling she had to get up early tomorrow to catch the train for washington but sleep stayed away the ticking clock sat on his nightstand she looked over at it but couldnt read the dimly glowing hands her sigh sounded just like her daughters after what seemed a very long time her eyes slid shut at last captain howard frank was not a happy man he stared at lou as if over the sights of a machine gun you know this mamzer schmidt ive run into him a few times lou told the truth if he didnt his superior could find out easily enough and when he didlou didnt care to think about that he wanted out of the army yeah but not with a courtmartial giving him a boot in the seat of the pants frank drummed his fingers on the card table that did duty for his desk what dyou think of him lou shrugged hes a reporter hell never make anybody forget shirer or howard k smith hes doing his goddamnedest the cic captain drummed harder what dyou know about how he got his hands on that film ice walked up lous back did the brass think he had something to do with that only what hes said which isnt much which isnt bupkis frank snapped a german gave it to him that only cuts it down to eighty million people maybe to forty million if its a fucking kraut from the american zone hot damn we ought to get more than that out of him lou said no kidding but hes a civilian he goes on about not revealing his sources all we can do is ship his sorry ass back to the states captain frank made as if to tear his thinning hair yeah throw me in the briar patch too why dont you and you know what else no but youre gonna tell me arent you lou said you better believe it the isolationist chowderheads who want us to bring all the boys home day before yesterday theyll make a hero out of him frank lit a cigarette he looked mad enough to breathe fire and smoke without one theyll say he was telling the truth and the armys trying to hide how horrible things are over here theyll wrap him in the first amendment and beat us over the head with it the army was trying to hide how bad things were in germany it would have been crazy not to as far as lou was concerned you did what needed doing and if holding down the resurgent nazis didnt need doing hed never seen anything that did but thesechowderheads struck him as much too nice a wordwanted to joggle trumans elbow what can we do about it sir lou asked find out where his footage came fromthatd make a halfway decent start captain frank answered he blew out more smoke and relax for cryin out loud im pretty sure youre clean cause we checked you out that surprise you not for this sir lou said slowly i wouldve hoped you couldve trusted me but with this you want to know its the army hey theyve been on my ass too frank said reproachfully he rolled his eyes gottenyu have they ever they really want to know how this schmidt item got his hands on that movie whats your best guess lou asked same one bruce the morale officer made when i first showed it to you frank answered heydrichs goons figured wed try and sit on it so they made more copies and spread em around schmidt got his hands on one some kind of way makes sense to me lous chuckle held no real mirth if we were the gestapo wed ram splinters under his fingernails and set em on fire hed singhed sing like a goddamn canary or even if we were the nkvd over in the russian zone his gaze sharpened how bad is it over in the russian zone dyou know captain frank hesitated officially you didnt get this from me get what sir lou was the picture of innocence okay his superiors laugh sounded as dry as his had a moment before from what i hear if the fanatics dont want us occupying them they really dont want the russians occupying them so theyre kicking up their heels in the russian zone and in what polands holding and in the czech mountains too but the russians arent mr nice guy like we are they arent taking the gloves off on account of they never put the gloves on to begin with so things are kinda rugged over there right now lou nodded thoughtfully yeah i bet they ever ask how things are going over here not through channels or not that ive heard of and i think i would have frank answered too bad itd be nice if we were still making like allies on something you know lou said it would wouldnt it frank agreed as soon as the germans went down for the count the usa and the ussr started glaring at each other over the fallen bodyand in the far east too berlin wasnt going to be the capital that ruled the world washington and moscow both had ambitions along those lines neither liked the idea that the other had ambitions lou didnt know what he could do about that well actually he did know what he could dobupkis as captain frank had said but he didnt know what anyone else could do either i wonder if we ought to talk to their people lou said we might do better against heydrichs boys if we were all fighting the same war not two separate onesknow what i mean yeah i do frank said but you are not to talk to the russians without orders from somebody above you thats a direct order lou you try sliding around it and i promise the brass will crucify you when they arent looking for nazis under the bed theyre looking for reds you hear me yes sir lou said resignedlyhe knew frank was right besides the captain went on we arent fighting two separate wars against the fanatics were fighting four well we do work with the english some but the french are almost as prickly as the russiansand almost as rough on the jerries too ive heard that breaks my heart lou said which won him another wry laugh from captain frank they werent the only american jews who wouldnt have been sorry to see their own government come down harder on the germans it ruled not by a long shot lou added frenchre getting some of their own back for four years under the nazis thumbs sure they are frank said but it still rubs me the wrong way when de gaulle goes on about turning france into a great power again when it wouldnt be diddlysquat if we werent propping it up me too lou said he thinks hes napoleonexcept hes a big guy i saw him once when i was on leave in paris hes gotta be sixthree maybe sixfour didnt know that captain frank replied what i do know is if we didnt prop him up stalin would in a redhot minute de gaulle knows it too it lets him bite the hand that feeds him like as long as he takes a good big chomp out of the fanatics i dont much care what else he does not right now lou said were on the same page therethats for damn sure howard frank said when diana mcgraw went to washington to talk to her congressman she could hardly get over being there the capitol the washington monument the white houseeven though pats loss was still fresh as a gash shed been a tourist or partly a tourist anyway how could you help it the first time you came to the capital you couldnt but when you came back again the scenery faded into the background you had work to do right now she didnt feel like a pta official she felt like a thirdgrade teacher trying to get her class lined up and on the way to where it was supposed to go like most of the people who were marching on the white house with her she was staying in one of the hotels near union station they werent after anything ritzy most of them couldnt afford anything ritzy diana was paying for her trip out of donations from the cause but even so they were a middleclass bunch diana stood on the corner of fourth and f right by judiciary square the us district court the us court of appeal juvenile court the municipal court even the police courtand she cared about none of them all she wanted to do was head west toward the white house and get on with things she looked down at the slim watch on her left wrist where is everybody she exclaimed her breath smoking it wasnt anywhere near as cold here as it was back in anderson but it wasnt summer either take it easy diana edna lopatynski said nothing rattled edna if gabriel were to sound the last trump shed ask him to wait till she finished dusting and shed get him to do it too she went on its only half past eightnot even we dont start moving till nineif were lucky i bet none of these things ever gets going on time this one sure wont diana said fretfully i know were here early but i expected more people wouldve shown up by now nah the woman from ohio shook her head the ones who show up real early are the organizers and thewell i dont like to call em fanatics not with whats going on in germany but you know what i mean and diana did ednas calm good sense helped her make her own butterflies quit fluttering so much most of the regional leaders were here and they were taking charge of the people from their areas or they were trying to anyhow edna was right some of the ones who showed up early looked as if theyd rather be carrying rifles than picket signs diana hoped like anything that nobodyd stashed a pistol in pocket or purse that wouldnt be so good which was putting it mildly someone driving by shook a fist at the gathering crowd attorneys going into one court building or another stared at the ordinarylooking people with the signs on their shoulders and a sizable contingent of washington dcs finest gathered to keep things peaceableor maybe to arrest anybody who got the least bit out of line at nine on the dot one of the policemen sauntered over to diana before she could wonder how he knew she was in charge of things he tipped his hat and said time to get em moving maam not everybodys here yet she protested the cop looked over the crowd youve got enough he said youre all up and down f street and youre starting to mess up traffic the ones who cant get out of bed quick enough know where theyre supposed to go right yes but no buts get em moving like i said or i can write you up for blocking the streets here i can write you up had to mean i will write you up diana considered several reporters were watching what went on she recognized e a stuart from indianapolis ebenezer amminadab what a handle what would they saywhat would they write if the police broke up the demonstration without letting it get started but her people really were starting to spill into the street not all the car horns that blared at them were political some were just plain annoyed she looked a question at edna lopatynski edna nodded back diana nodded too she raised her voice come on folks the president needs to find out what we think so does the whole country lets go show them she started west toward the white house holding her sign high how many dead in peacetime it asked behind her edna called regional leaders bring your people along we might as well be in the army ourselves somebody grumbled if you were going to run something this size you had to have organization otherwise you only thought you were running it but if all the people did whatever they wanted what you really had was a mob not quite a mile from the gathering place to presidents square the gray enormous greek revival treasury building on the east side of the square blocked the view of the white house better planning diana thought would have kept something like that from happening but better planning would have done all kinds of thingslike winning the war sooner and like making sure it was really over when it was supposed to be diana looked back over her shoulder again she wanted to see how many men she had here especially men whod fought in this war she nodded to herself enough she judged without them people would think this was only a womens movement she was old enough to remember how much that had slowed the suffragettes e a stuart trotted across the street toward her a cop shook his nightstick i oughta run you in he boomed jaywalkins against the law im a reporter stuart answered as if that freed him from obeying laws he didnt happen to like from what diana had seen of reporters the past few months it was liable to do just that stuart poised notebook and pencil how do you think things are going here mrs mcgraw fine diana was damned if shed admit to any worries no matter what she asked a question of her own how can you walk and write at the same time practice lots of practice when stuart grinned he looked like a kid then he got serious again what do you aim to accomplish today i want the president to know not everybody supports his policy in germany i want him to see the faces of the people whose sons and brothers and husbands hes killed i want the whole country to see them too diana answered i want everybody to know were not a bunch of nuts were just ordinary people if this happened to other ordinary people theyd be out here too a car zoomed by the driver gave the marchers the finger out the window it was nothing diana hadnt seen before what do you have to say to people like that e a stuart asked before diana could say anything edna lopatynski beat her to the punch they can go get stuffed diana staredthat wasnt like edna at all but the polish woman went on i mean it if people want to talk with me im glad to talk with them but if all youre gonna do is something disgusting like that to heck with you buddy they walked past fords theater lincoln got shot there diana thought she would have torn down the place after something like that but they hadnt then something else crossed her mind even as things were lincoln got a lot more time than a lot of the kids he sent into battle and he got a lot more time than pat had or ever would too the national theater stood another few blocks farther on diana didnt know one thing about it in a way that came as a relief nothing horrible had happened there except maybe some of the productions she turned right on fifteenth street in front of the treasury department building as soon as she got past it there was the white house on the left leaves had fallen from the trees on the white house grounds so she could see it really well theyd had at least one hard frost here because the grass was going all yellowbrown the way it did back in anderson left this time onto pennsylvania avenue the white house was at probably the one address besides their own that all americans knew somebody behind diana said it looks like a postcard she smiled shed had the same notion at almost the same time several men waited for the marchers right in front of the gate that led into the white house grounds some of them were reporters a newsreel camera crew filmed the demonstration people all over the country might see this the mere idea made diana automatically pat at her hair with her free hand and one of the men in suitsdiana waved frantically congressman duncan she called thanks so much for coming he hadnt promised he would he must have wondered whether showing up would gain him votes or cost them and he must have decided it wouldnt cost him too many anyhow diana edna tapped her on the shoulder when diana didnt answer fast enough to suit her she tapped again harder diana what diana said impatiently thats the congressman from my district there and and the guy next to himthe guy in the gray hatis senator taft edna broke in that counts for more you ask me senator taft diana whispered and it was sure enough she recognized him now that edna pointed him out she thought she would have done it sooner if the hat hadnt covered up his bald headand kept it warm too she supposed but she didnt see tafts picture every day edna was from ohio so chances were she did some of the other men gathered with jerry duncan and robert taft were probably senators and representatives too their home states and districts knew what they looked like but diana didnt maybe a book somewhere had pictures of all of them diana had never seen or heard of one like that but it would sure be a handy thing to have if you were a political kind of person and i amnow she thought i really am more of them here than i expected edna said have we got enough signs for them all we will diana declared if they didnt if they had to rob a few ordinary peters to let the political pauls picket she would do that without a qualm the country needed to see not all politicians blindly followed harry trumans lead hello mrs mcgraw jerry duncan came up to her with a big smilea politicians smilespread across his face may we join you i hope you will diana said who are your uh colleagues duncan introduced senator taft first as shed hopedhe was the heavy hitter in the group very pleased to meet you taft said his voice raspy youre making people think and thats never bad diana wanted to make people feel that would make them get out there and do things but she didnt want to argue with the senator from ohio so she nodded edna handed taft a picket sign that said isnt america enough he gruffly thanked her and nodded at the sentiment diana nodded to herself being from his home state edna would know the kind of thing he wanted to say jerry duncan presented more politicos from california from idaho from illinois from alabama from mississippi were not all republicans here you see he said sure diana nodded the congressmenor were they senators from the deep south might call themselves democrats but theyd be more conservative than most republicans diana didnt care whether they worshipped at the shrine of the donkey or the elephant as long as they wanted gis to stop dying in germany they were on her side duncans sign said didnt the nazis surrender reporters shouted questions at the politicians as they tramped back and forth in front of the white house along with the ordinary demonstrators this is pretty good edna said now the flatfootsll leave us alone they wont get tough where big shots can see em do it yup diana nodded in indianapolis or in washington the cops paid attention to power they had to what were they but powers hunting dogs diana went on this is pretty good edna but you know what next time we come here well fill that whole park with people she pointed across pennsylvania avenue to lafayette square wow you dont think small do you admiration filled ednas voice if i thought small id still be sitting at home crying cause pats dead wed all be sitting at home crying alone cause our boys are dead diana answered but sitting at home and crying doesnt help if we dont do anything but that nobody else will either weve got to get people moving and we will damn right edna could swear like a trooper when she felt like it to her it was just talk not filthy talk a car going by on pennsylvania avenue honked its horn traitors the driver yelled jackass senator taft said crisply this is just as much a part of government as all the wind and air up on capitol hill the man in the car couldnt hear any of that of course but the reporters could several of them took down what he said most seemed to share e a stuarts knack for writing on the move back and forth back and forth they had several hundred people therenowhere near enough to fill lafayette square but enough to be noticed enough diana thought to look like more when they film us the majority of the picketers came from the east and the midwest the majority of people in the country lived in those parts and they were closest to washington but a man was here from nevada and a woman from washington state and a couple from new mexico and several people from california when something like this happened to you it hit you hard you wanted to do something about it noyou had to after a while the newsreel crew took their camera off its tripod they loaded the gear into a van and drove away reporters drifted off diana hoped they were going to write up their stories not to hoist a few in the nearest bar some of the representatives and senators left after a bit too they must have felt theyd made their pointand theyd got filmed doing it which was even better jerry duncan and robert taft stayed diana had expected duncan to she thought of him as her congressman and didnt worry about whether he thought the same way but she was delighted about taft people said he was thinking of running for president in three years if he did if things changed thendiana shook her head things needed to change right away that was why she was doing all this a couple of men came around the corner of pennsylvania avenue and seventeenth street on the far side of the white house grounds they wore ordinary offtherack suits and hats that might have come from sears but they looked like combat soldiers just the same diana had seen men who looked like that too often to doubt her snap judgment and a moment later she understood why they did behind them strode harry truman dianas knees knocked that was the president of the united states the most powerful man in the world even if he did look like a smalltown druggist in his sunday best right down to his bright bow tie shed never dreamt he would come out of the white house too bad the newsreel crew was gone he pushed past his bodyguardsthey didnt look happy about itand walked straight up to her in person he seemed a little smaller a little older than he did when he got his picture in the paper or showed up in a newsreel on the big screen youre mrs mcgraw arent you the woman who started this whole silly thing his voice was familiar too and yet not quite so it had a different timbre coming from his own mouth rather than booming out of a speaker uh yes sir diana knew her own voice shook she forced it to firmness as she went on only i dont think its silly she kept walking as she answered the demonstration would have bogged down if she hadnt harry truman kept pace with her with her only later would she think about how surreal that was well yes i can see how youd feel that way truman said i commanded an artillery battery in the last war we mustve had fourleaf clovers in our pocketswe only took a couple of minor wounds most other units werent so lucky always unfortunate when you lose people but thats war yes thats war diana nodded but the war in europes been over since may thats what everybody says anyhow what are we still doing over there if the wars been over since may making sure it doesnt start up again for real truman had an agreeable missouri twang it made him sound like a smalltown druggist too parts of germany got occupied after world war i too remember the nazis are more dangerous than kaiser bill ever was so this time around the allies have to sit on the whole blamed country he wasnt the first one diana had heard who argued that way shed had to study up since starting her crusade she couldnt afford to sound like a jerk when she came up against somebody who thought she was talking through her hat but the germans werent killing our soldiers in how many men have we lost since they said they surrendered must be close to two thousand by now and what about england and france and russia trumans face hardened yes what about russia stalin isnt acting like good old uncle joe any more now that hitlers gone and germanys kaput he wants russia to fill her shoes and then some suppose we do what you want suppose we come home with our tails between our legs what happens next thats what you havent thought about mrs mcgraw either heydrichs goons come out of hiding and start getting ready for the next war or stalin marches in where we marched outand starts getting ready for the next war oh piffle one more thing diana had never imagined was that she might one day say piffle to the president but that day seemed to be at hand if they get out of line we drop one of our atom bombs on them or more than one if they need that the way the japs did then we go in and pick up the piecesexcept there wont be any pieces left to pick up will there its not so simple as you make it sound do you know nobody told me about the atom bomb till after i was in the white house i was vice president and nobody told me thats how secret it was truman sounded plaintiveand who could blame him one thing is plainits not something you can use casually its like swatting a fly by dropping a sherman tank on it and so we have this running sore instead diana said how long will the germans go on murdering gis sir will we still have soldiers over there in in do you think the american people will let something this senseless go on that long holding down the nazis and holding out the reds isnt senseless truman insisted if wed done things the right way after world war i we never wouldve had to fight world war ii getting thousands of soldiers killed after everybody said the war was over is senseless diana could dig in her heels too grandchildren wholl never be born she told herself not to puddle up that wasnt easy but she managed i have to do what i think is right truman said i have to think of the long term not just today and tomorrow if you foul up today and tomorrow whats the long term worth diana retorted and if you foul up today and tomorrow the american people will throw you out before you can do anything about it later on chance i have to take truman said youll be sorry sir diana told him i am already and you will be x new years eve new years day the big holiday in the soviet year behind christmas in the gregorian calendar but conveniently ahead of the old julian reckoning the orthodox used this year celebrating the slide from the year of victory to the year ofwhat the year when the soviet union didnt need to worry about victory any more not much anyhow and here in berlin the year where the russians could celebrate in style here where fascism had grown here where it had done its bloodyhanded best to annul the revolution and destroy the soviet peoplehow many officers would swill up the loot of a conquered country how many frightened german barmen would pour the drinks how many frightened german barmaids would serve them how many of those frightened german barmaids would serve the conquerors in other ways later on whether they much wanted to or not three days earlier vladimir bokov had been looking forward to getting his own drunken blowjob from some blond german bitch life wasnt fair hed thought so for a long time now he was sure of it instead of going off and drinking till he puked and getting his cock sucked he lay tossing on the meager mattress of a steelframed cot knocked flat by the nastiest case of influenza hed ever had colonel shteinberg lay one cot to his left shteinberg looked like hell no doubt bokov looked like hell too but he couldnt see himself he and his superior were both running a fever close to forty celsius bokovs head ached so did every other part of him sometimes he shivered and wished he had more blankets five minutes later sweat would river off of him he was in short a mess so was moisei shteinberg the only difference between them was that bokov remembered liking christmas when he was a small small boy before the revolution shteinberg never would have given a damn about it a male nursea red army private whod done something wrong and was lucky not to have drawn some worse punishmentbrought them aspirins and glasses of heavily sugared hot tea the tea stayed down some of the other things bokov had tried didnt want to he had vivid memories of that and wished he didnt the sullen nurse moved no faster than he had to no doubt he wished he were out carousing too and he had plenty to keep him busy bokov and shteinberg werent the only ones down with the grippenot even close as the aspirins lent bokovs wits brief clarity he thought youll probably catch it yourself you sorry fucker this is shit colonel shteinberg saidmaybe the little white tablets were also helping him think straighter well be flat on our backs for days more and then feeling steamrollered for another week after that pure shit nothing else but dont worry about it comrade colonel bokov said shteinberg gave him a bleary stare dont worry are you out of your mind why not he plucked at the cold compress on his foreheadexcept if it was anything like bokovs it wasnt cold any more because all the officers out drinking tonight will be just as bad off as we are bokov answered theyll have more fun getting thereno german girl was going to suck him off tonight not when he couldnt get it up with a cranebut theyll be fucked over too maybe shteinberg said grudgingly but do you suppose the stinking heydrichite fanatics will drink themselves blind tonight not likely theyre no fools damn themthey know how we do things and you just wait and see if they dont try something while were plastered out of our minds that struck captain bokov as much too likely he shrugged anyway it hurtbut what didnt right now this was even worse than a hangover and he hadnt even had the pleasure of getting plastered himself definitely unfair comrade colonel the two of us cant do a thing about it he said too right we cant shteinberg agreed i feel like dogshit da bokov looked around for that private he wanted more tea and he wanted his compress soaked in cold water againor better yet in the snow outside he didnt see the fellow where the devil had he gone was he off smoking a cigarette or had he cached a flask somewhere was he swigging right this second bokovs spirit lusted after vodka his body told his spirit it had to be kidding sometimes you had to listen to your body even if you didnt want to the orderly came back he didnt look so sullen now sure as hell hed found some way to make himself feel better and if the men he was supposed to be taking care of got short shrift that was their hard luck they were already sick werent they bokov drifted into a restless uneasy sleepthe only kind hed had since this miserable thing landed on him like a katyusha rocket his dreams were confused and dark that was all he remembered of them then a doctor with a thin clever jewish face much like colonel shteinbergs was shaking him awake another doctor this one an authentic slav was waking the nkvd colonel get up the jew told bokov we need you what is it bokov tried to sit up his head swam i beg your pardon comrade physician i am not well he gulped hoping the juices in his stomach would stay down he wasnt kidding not even a little bit in the next bed shteinberg was also feebly protesting you dont have time to be sick the jewish doctor said bluntly the fucking nazis have poisoned half the officer corps in berlin maybe more youve got to track them down and pay them back give me your arm bozhemoi how bokov exclaimed automatically he stuck out his left arm the doctor undid the cuff on his uniform tunic then rolled up his sleeve and tapped at the inside of his elbow to bring up the veins there as soon as he found one he stuck a hypodermic needle into it and pushed in the plunger bokov shook not only from the influenza but also because he flatout hated needles the doctor knew his stuff he didnt let the hypodermic slip out of the vein till hed finished the injection what did you shoot me with bokov asked i didnt think there was any medicine for the grippe there isnt the doctor said youll still be sick but with enough benzedrine in you youll be able to work anyhow well feed you pills from now on but we want to get you up and moving right away he knew how to get what he wanted the dose he shot into bokov was brutally effective the nkvd mans heart pounded as if hed drunk fifty cups of strong coffee all at once his snot dried up so did his mouth so did his eyeballs his brain felt on fire he knew he still had the influenza he also knew hed have to pay for this artificial vitality and that hed be even sorrier later than he was before the injection but all that would wait right this second he was raring to go poisoned how he demanded far from being fuzzy with sickness his wits raced at triple time he beat the doctor to the answer fuck my mother if they didnt put something in the booze for the new years bash right the first timewood alcohol the jew said lots and lots of wood alcohol they must have been setting this up for weeks the fucking cunts its the best thing in the world to use if youre poisoning liquor you wont notice it while youre drinking most people even like the taste but afterwardsafterwards itll kill you if you drink enough and itll leave you blind even if you dont bokov nodded he knew what wood alcohol could do plenty of illicit liquor got cooked up in the soviet union some of it was as good as any you could buy in the government stores some was better a labor of love but some was pure poison hed heard people say you could get rid of the bad stuff if you filtered booze through a loaf of black bread bokov didnt know whether that was truehed never tried it he did know they wouldnt have filtered their drinks at the new years feast theyd have poured them down as fast as they could over in the next bed colonel shteinberg had also risen like a drugfueled lazarus you will have held the bartenders and the serving women he demanded of the doctor whod injected him back to life the only answer he got was a broadshouldered shrug they told me to run my cock over here and start your motor the man answered i dont know what all else theyre doing if it werent for the commotion in the hall they wouldnt evenve told me how come i had to do that like so many red army officers hed carried out his orders precisely and to the letter and hadnt taken one step beyond them stalin had terrified initiative out of the whole country if being wrong landed you in the gulag you couldnt take the chance that kind of caution had cost casualties maybe even battles what would it cost here would anybody at the banquet hall have kept his head enough to think to make the necessary arrests bokov had to hope so would the barmen and barmaids have been the ones who poisoned the liquor no way to know till you started hurting them come on shteinberg said and then where the devil are my valenki bokov had already found his own felt boots under his cot he was pulling them on his superior grunted when he came up with his here the jewish doctor gave bokov a vial of pills take two of these whenever you start slowing down theyll keep you going for three or four days eat a lot drink a lot if you were an airplane youd be running on your reserve tank right bokov could feel that he wrapped his greatcoat around himself ready comrade colonel youd best believe it shteinberg barked hard mirthless laughter see we get to go to the party after all just what i wanted bokov said in a hollow voice benzedrine or no benzedrine the colonels chuckle also sounded less lively than it might have a jeep waited outside the barracks bokov and shteinberg piled in the jeep took off toward the south and west potsdam shteinberg asked again yes sir that palace with the german name the driver answered the schloss cecilienhof bokov didnt make it a question the red army noncom behind the wheel nodded bokov muttered that was where stalin had met with the american president and british prime minister more recentlynot even two months ago nowthe red army had celebrated the anniversary of the russian revolution there and now this we got careless we got predictable moisei shteinberg took the words out of his mouth we came back to the same place three times in a row and the fucking nazis went and made us pay somebody should answer for that sir the noncom said even in the trenches you dont stick your head up in the same place three times a sniperll put one through your ear if youre dumb enough to try it voice dry as the inside of his own mouth bokov said whoever planned our party would have gone to it himself chances are decent hes a casualty too he was shivering by the time the jeep got to the cecilienhof it wasnt just the coldit was the influenza trying to jump on him again he choked down two of the pills the doctor had given him colonel shteinberg did the same thing they had to pass through several belts of security that would have been funny if it werent so grim no fanatics could get in and shoot up the placebut nobodyd bothered to vet the booze shteinberg said it theyd got careless and theyd played right into the bandits hands an english country house for the kaisers daughterinlaw that was how the schloss cecilienhof got started just before world war i country house nothing bokov thought the benzedrine making his heart drum again its a goddamn country palace is what it is and at the moment it was a country palace in one of the nastier districts of hell spotlights spread harsh light on the snowcovered grounds around the main buildingsand on the uniformed bodies stacked there like cordwood one of the bodies wasnt uniformed but wore black tie and boiled shirt a barman had poured it down on the slyand got what the officers he was serving got he didnt know the shit was poisoned bokov said pointing to the corpse in the fancy suit you wouldnt expect many to shteinberg answered some american said three can keep a secret if two of them are dead he knew what he was talking about sensible for an american bokov said he jumped down from the jeep the noises from inside the cecilienhof sounded like something from a lowrent district in hell too he didnt want to go in there and he knew he had to then he stopped almost in spite of himself comrade colonel tell meplease tell methat isnt marshal zhukov it is shteinbergs voice was hard and flat the revenge stalin will takeunless he quickly shook his head and went inside unless what bokov wondered unless stalin decided to get rid of the popular zhukov and blame it on the heydrichites was that what the other nkvd man meant even if it was bokov didnt believe it if stalin wanted zhukov shot shot zhukov would be and never mind that he was the leading soldier in the red army but that bokov could wonderand that shteinberg could toospoke volumes about how the system they lived under worked bokov had no time to read those volumes and no interest in them he was after all part of the system himself he followed his superior into the cecilienhof it was as bad as hed expected maybe worse the palace stank of sweat and smoke and vomit and shit men reeled here and there some clutching their bellies others rubbing frantically at their eyes who turned out the lights a major shouted furiously the lights were blazing his eyes had gone dark wood alcohol sure as the devil bokov thought the nkvd men a sergeant shouted theyll take over thank god another noncom exclaimed now the monkeys off our backs he meant nobody could blame the poor underofficers for screwing up if they werent in charge no officers here still on the job shteinberg asked in the tones of a man hoping against hope but the two noncoms shook their heads bokov wasnt surprised either why else would a man come to a new years festival except to drink himself blind and how many red army officers had done just that here tonight have you got the germans under guard bokov asked the two underofficers gave each other apprehensive looks comrade captain we havesome of them answered the one whod spoken first some went home before people started getting sick he paused unhappily some may have slipped out when the devils grandfather got loose too things were pretty confused there for a while whenever a russian hauled the devils kin into a conversation he knew he was in the middle of a mess bokov knew it too as far as he could see things were still plenty confused part of him wanted to lie down and forget about everything but the influenza but neither duty nor benzedrine would let him a word from him or shteinberg could destroy these noncoms what point though they hadnt done anything wrong most of the ones who had screwed up were poisoned which served them right if i werent sick id be poisoned too bokov thought comrade captain what do we do if the nazi bandits rise up now the other conscript asked whod give orders to help us fight back people like you bokov answered and if they try it well whip them right out of their boots i hope they dofuck your mother if i dont if they come out and fight fair well smash them like the cockroaches they are the one way they can hurt us is by sneaking around like this unfortunately theyre too damned good at sneaking colonel shteinbergs voice was dry as usual only the way his hands shook and the unnatural glitter in his eyes told of the war between disease and drugs inside him he went on take us to the germans lets see what we can get out of them guards with submachine guns stood outside the door to the room where the servers were corralled nobody was going anywhere now of course it was much too likely that anyone with guilty knowledge had already got away as bokov and shteinberg went in one of the guards muttered to another never thought id be glad to see the damned chekists get here shut up the other fellow hissed theyll hear you if bokov didnt have bigger things to worry aboutbut he did if moisei shteinberg heard the whispers from the red army men he also gave no sign inside the splendid chambera plaque said it had been the smoking roomhuddled a gaggle of scaredlooking fritzes bokov nodded glumly to himself sure as hell the women were chosen for looks and figures the red army men in charge were careful about that about some other things things that turned out to matter more they werent colonel shteinberg pointed to one of the women a statuesque brunette you bitchcome outside with us he snarled he wasnt really speaking german at all but yiddish shed be able to follow it though and it ought to frighten her even more most germans hadnt had anything direct to do with killing jews but theyd had a notion of what was going on even so they didnt like the idea of jews holding power over them now they feared revengeand well they might her lower lip trembled but she came as soon as she got out into the hall and the door closed behind her bokov slapped her in the face she stared at him her mouth an o of injured astonishment she had eyes green as jade she didnt squawk which wasnt what he wanted scream your head off he told her give those other pigdogs back there something to worry about when she obeyed he felt as if he were standing in front of an airraid siren enough already shteinberg said and she shut it off as abruptly as shed let loose the jewish nkvd man went on so youre one of the ones who thought you could wipe out the red army eh i work in a shoe factory the darkhaired woman said one of your men pulled me out and said he would shoot my little son if i didnt come here and give your officers drinks and she stopped then made herself finish and anything else they wanted bokov didnt know if she was telling the truth her story sounded as if she could be though tell us what happened here he said they gave me these clothes to wear she said the black and white maids outfit didnt cover that much of her after a sigh she continued i brought drinks i brought food i got groped a couple of times but nothing worse the red army officers would still have been more or less sober and the sour resignation in the womans voice said she might have been on the receiving end of worse when the russians took berlin nobody knew how many rapes thered been then a lot though no doubt of that go on bokov told her when did people start getting sick a little before midnight she answered at first we thought it was because they were drinking likewell because they were drinking so much she had sense enough not to tell a russian that russians drank like swine but bokov already knew thatknew it from experience he could have been lying out there stiffening in the snow himself when he remembered how much hed looked forward to this feast and how pissed off hed been when he came down sickwhen he remembered all that he quickly thought about something else do you know any of the peoplethe germans i meanwho got out of here before the poison showed itself he asked nein mein herr curls bobbed back and forth as the woman shook her head i never saw any of them before your man must have liked my looks and thought i would make a good whore here she looked defiance at him daring him to deny that was what the red army man had in mind when bokov just waited she shrugged and went on i think most of the women got picked that way the men behind the bar might be a different story they didnt get chosen for their looks anyhow she made good sense even if she was trying to get the nkvd men to leave her alone colonel shteinberg went back into the smoking room presumably to grab one of the barmen bokov carried on alone with her show me your papers he snapped he wrote down her name elfriede taubenschlag a hell of a mouthful then he said so you have a boy eh wheres your husband he died in an air raid last year she answered bleakly he was home getting over a wound and he was out drinking beer with some other soldiers in the same boat and the tavern got hit i think most of what we buried was him i hope so if she was looking for sympathy she was looking in the wrong place bokov slapped her again almost hard enough to knock her over hitler shouldnt have started the war if he didnt want it to come home he snapped if you treat us like this no wonder we give you poison she said this time he did knock her down she might not have wanted to yelp but she did anyway bokov had to fight the urge to murder her right there if he hadnt thought it came from the benzedrine roaring through him he wouldnt have bothered fighting well kill all of you if we need to cunt nobodyd miss you a bit its what you tried to do to us elfriede taubenschlag kept quiet she could see he would kill her if she argued he could read her face now bruised too like so many germans she wasnt sorry hitler had started the war she only regretted losing bokov shoved her back toward the smoking room any luck colonel shteinberg asked him pausing with a barman whose flat nose and scarred forehead said hed done some prizefighting not much bokov answered eyeing the german to see if he followed russian seeing no signs of that he went on since the bitches were chosen for their looks the barmen look like a better bet so well see what uwe here knows shteinberg said then he fell back into rasping guttural yiddish and if he doesnt sing like a damned canary well see how he likes siberia i dont know nothin about nothin uwe saidlike most germans he had no trouble with the jews dialect no huh if we strip off your monkey suit will we find an ss tattoo under your armpit shteinberg asked the red army often liquidated ss men it captured as the war wound down toward disaster for them some of the nazi supermen had their bloodgroup marking surgically removed so it wouldnt betray them but a fresh scar right there could also be a death sentence got no tattoos uwe said stolidly he pulled up one trouser leg to show he did have an artificial foot goddamn french nailed me outside of dunkirk in i tended bar ever since i got out of the hospital even the volkssturm wouldnt take me with a leg and a half bokov had thought the only prerequisite for the germans lastditch militia was a detectable pulse but maybe he was wrong the answer didnt faze shteinberg who asked how about heydrichs crowd you dont have to run fast to pour wood alcohol into the vodka i dont know nothin about that and i aint no fuckin werewolf uwe said fuckin wars over we lost all i want to do is get on with my life if you know who poisoned it youll live better the jew told him we help people who help us uwe grunted happens i know a couple of dykes whore pretty much reds they make it through the war without the ss grabbing em red army shoots its way into berlin at last dykes come out waving and yelling kamerad know what happens next they get gangbanged believing goebbels bullshit cost me my foot what do i win for believing yours a trip to the gulag bokov thought you ran your mouth like that you were asking for it lets see your papers bokov said we may want to ask you more questions later and well need to know where to find you by his documents the german was uwe kupferstein bokov carefully noted his name and address he didnt know whether theyd need to question kupferstein some more or just stuff him onto an eastbound train so he could see how he liked life as a zek well that was a worry for another time how are you doing shteinberg asked as the barman stumped back away the fellow had had practice with that foot he hardly limped at all ive been better comrade colonel but ill keep going as long as the pills let me bokov answered how are you about the same the jew sighed and clicked his tongue between his teeth we wont find the answers here tonightthis morning i should say the eastern horizon was starting to lighten i dont suppose we will either bokov sighed too but weve got to try oh yes and we have to be seen trying too maybe the influenza and the benzedrine were what made shteinberg sail close to the edge sail over it really shaking his head at what had come out of his mouth he added lets go interrogate two more feeling in his pocket to make sure he still had the vial the doctor had given him bokov followed him back to the smoking room when lou weissberg passed from the zone to the british the way the tommies inspected his papers and examined his jeep told him things were just as rugged here as they were where hed come from having fun with the diehards are you he said to his way of thinking the corporal checking his documents had his chevrons on upside down the man was pale almost pasty and had an ugly scar on his left cheek he wore a newstyle british helmet halfway between the old tin hat and the american pot too bloody right we are he answered his accent even further from lous than toby bentons drawl was when we catch them they die hard all right officially the americans didnt do things like that germans caught in arms after the surrender werent legally powsthey were classed as enemy combatants instead still orders were to give them at least a drumhead hearing before shooting them lou happened to know those orders didnt always get observed the french thought their mere existence absurd frenchmen were practical people evidently englishmen were too you seem to pass muster leftenant yes the corporal spoke english but not the kind a yank from new jersey would use he gestured with his sten gun pass onand for christs sake keep your bleedin eyes open always good advice lou agreed he tapped his driver on the shoulder on to cologne yes sir the driver had make jokes about smells and perfume till lou was sick of them for a wonder the guy seemed to realize as much and cut it out maybe the age of miracles wasnt dead after all the british zone lay northwest of the bigger stretch of territory the usa administered signs in german lined the road the fanatics hurt you they said and the war is over and dont let the madmen get away with it lou didnt know how much the propaganda helped but it sure couldnt hurt he wished us military authorities were trying more of the same thing thered been more fighting here than in most of the american zone wrecked trucks and tanksus british and germanstill lay by the side of the road and in the fields they made lou nervous too many of them offered perfect hiding places for a diehard with a panzerschreck or a schmeisser or even a molotov cocktail hastily dug graves were scattered over the countryside some still marked by no more than a bayoneted rifle thrust into freshdug earth sometimes with a helmet on it sometimes without only makeshift bridges led across the rhine to cologne bombing had destroyed some of the real ones and the nazis the rest in the rhineland relatively close to england cologne had got the hell bombed out of it all through the war and then the germans fought in the ruins lou hadnt thought a city could be in worse shape than nuremberg but this one was he presented his papers at an enormous tent near the ruins of the train station care for a glass of beer asked the british intelligence major who cleared him id love one thanks lou answered although after what the jerries did to ivan last week theyve played with poisoned liquor here too havent they in your zone yeah but with hard stuff not beer and theyve done it by nickels and dimes not all at once like they did with the russians by nickels and dimes the major murmured lou realized people from the other side of the atlantic sometimes needed to pause and decipher american lingo too the beer was excellent far better than anything you could get back in the states the germans might be murderous heilscreaming brutes but by god they could brew lou was halfway down his stein when the man he was waiting for strode into the tent the british majorhis name was hudgeonsintroduced them in fluent german herr adenauer this is oberleutnant weissberg of us counterintelligence oberleutnant this is konrad adenauer former lord mayor of cologne former denizen of one of the late regimes concentration camps and current founder of the christian democratic union pleased to meet you sir lou said most germans these days claimed to have been antinazi adenauer really had been he was around seventy with thin foxy features and a perpetually worried air well hed earned the right to that a lieutenant adenauer said sadly well i suppose i am pleased to meet you too not your fault your superiors dont take this more seriously no matter what he claimed he was affronted europeans set more stock on status and rank than americans did loud seen that before adenauer thought he deserved a colonel or something chances were he was right too tell me about your new party herr adenauer lou urged before i belonged to the catholic center thanks to the nazis though this party is now kaput no point trying to make a dead body into lazarus adenauer said and lou nodded he only wished the nazis made as quiet a corpse as the catholic center party did hudgeons batman or whatever the noncom was called fetched adenauer a mug of beer after a healthy swig the german went on so we try something new eh germany needs a responsible conservative party we will not work with those ah to the right of us we know better hope so lou said back in plenty of conservatives thought they could work with the nazis hitlers henchmen chewed them up and swallowed them we dofrom experience adenauer said if germany is to become a democracya proper democracyshe must sooner or later have her own parties and they must be independent and be seen to be independent otherwise our folk will think they are tools of the occupiers and will not want much to do with them they will instead work with heydrichs maniacsand with those on the left we also aim to form a bulwark against communism maybe the american occupation authorities had sent lou to cologne instead of somebody more senior so they wouldnt seem too interested in the christian democratic union that was possible but lou didnt believe it his superiors didnt have the subtlety for a move like that they were paying for the lack too heydrichs goons take konrad seriously major hudgeons put in a bloke with a bomb under his clothes tried to take him out but the bloody thing didnt go off we nabbed him and weve learned some interesting things about how the fanatics operate in our zone i lit a candle in the church of st pantaleon to thank the lord for sparing me adenauer said i take it as a sign that i am meant to succeed and if i fail what is left for germany but the old dreadful choice between brownshirts and reds sooner or latersooner with luckgermany will need to stand on her own two feet again hudgeons said so we see it anyhow the only other choice is sitting on this country forever and that would bedifficult lou thought it was just what germany deserved whether the rest of the usa felt the same way was liable to be a different story people with picket signs marching in front of the white house congressmen and senators with them if theyd done that while the war was still going it would have been treason or something close to it it still felt that way to lou even though the fighting was officially over but more and more americans seemed to think otherwise and fewer and fewer dogfaces on occupation duty wanted to do anything more than pack up and go home in one piece we can stand up stand alongside of the united states and britain and france as a free and prosperous democracy adenauer said we can but we will not not until people are able to go about their business without worrying whether a fanatic will blow himself up in the market square or explode a truck in front of the church on sunday morning however much you may hate it fear is a weapon he had a point lou wished he knew how to keep heydrichs men from making everybody else afraid no one seemed to know how to do that not yet could something like the christian democratic union make a difference lou didnt knowbut if it could he was all for it xi sometimes you stepped on a dog turd and came out smelling like a rose sometimes the bread landed butter side up sometimes even in the newspaper game you had to go easy on the cliches and just write when the army booted tom schmidt out of germany hed been afraid he would have to quit reporting and find a real job if he didnt have to go that far hed figured he would end up on a weekly in michigans upper peninsula that never got word of his fall from journalistic grace hed been doing what he thought was right when he passed on the fanatics film of luckless private cunningham hed had the nasty feeling that would make him a villain to almost everyone outside the news business to his surprise he turned out to be wrong a startlingand growing which was even more startlingnumber of people back in the usa were loudly calling for president truman to bring all the gis home from germany they werent always people he was comfortable with but he was in no position to be choosy he was for instance a staunch new dealer the chicago tribune had gone after fdr from the minute he got nominated to run against hoover the tribune showed no signs of letting up on democrats just because a new fanny sat in the oval office swivel chair either but when it offered him a slot in washington at twice the money hed been making before he had to come home how could he say no he couldnt he didnt even try he had no trouble snagging an apartment in washington now that the war was over or mostly over or whatever it was more people flowed out of the capital than came in his landlord was almost pathetically eager to have him he didnt have much trouble finding a replacement for ilse either an awful lot of people left in babylon by the potomac were secretaries and clerktypists making connections wasnt hard myrtle was more expensive than ilse she wouldnt put out for krations what the hell you couldnt have everything when tom applied for a white house press credential he wondered if the flunkies there would tell him to fold it till it was all corners and then stuff it but after one of them made a phone call to a higherup everything went snickersnack thanks he said wondering how his vorpal blade managed to slice through red tape it aint your pretty face buddy the press secretarys subordinate replied if we turned you down how much crap would you crank out about how we were stifling free expression so we wont stifle it you want to ask the president questions go ahead five gets you ten he spits in your eye roosevelt had been a gentleman right down to his paralyzed toes from what tom heard harry truman was anything but if he thought you were a son of a bitch hed call you one well it made for good copy ill take my chances tom said you sure will the other man sounded as if he looked forward to it if truman cussed him outtom had been cussed out by experts you couldnt quote a president cussingthere were unwritten rules about such things as there were about reporting on say a senators lady friendsbut you could probably get the idea across one way or another toms chance came on a blustery day in the middle of january he presented his pass at the front gate of the white house wondering if the guards would turn him away at the last minute but they didnt one of them said lucky stiffyou get to go inside goddamn cold out here they wouldnt have had anything to complain about in the white house press room tom figured hed come out as a ham thoroughly cooked and just as thoroughly smoked his own old gold added only a little to the tobacco haze trumans press secretary came in and said ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states charlie ross was a longtime missouri newspaper man he was an even longertime friend of trumans theyd gone to high school together rawboned with a lock of gray hair that flopped down onto his forehead he stood several inches taller than the president but truman ran the show he bustled in and started sassing several correspondents he knew well they returned fire truman wasnt stalingiving him a hard time wouldnt cost you your head he looked out over the crowd of reporters when his eyes met toms he said havent seen you here before you new yes sir tom schmidt from the chicago tribune oh youre him truman looked as if somebodyd just farted charlie wanted to give you the bums rush but i said no you dont have to go sneaking around any more mr schmidt if youve got something to say say it to my face believe me i can take the heat thanks mr president tom said i wouldntve had to sneak if your people in germany werent hiding how badly things are going there theyre still fighting in germany mr schmidt in case you hadnt noticed truman said tartly we dont want to spread information that can help the fanatics he might be tart but he was also smart he didnt use the word war the war after all was over sure it is tom thought well yes sir he replied but since the nazis were the ones who kidnapped that poor gi and then filmed him dont you think they already knew what was going on truman glowered at him over the tops of his metalrimmed glasses tom felt as if he were getting grilled by his principal after some highschool scrape no doubt the president wanted him to feel just that way during the war between the states abe lincoln asked why he had to order a young deserter shot but let the clever soandso who conned him into deserting go free truman said all these years later its still a damn good question or dont you think morale matters he skated around war again of course i do mr president tom said but i think truth matters too or what are we fighting for hitler was the one who went in for the big lie trumans nostrils flared as he snorted angrily i suppose you think we should have pointed a big arrow with neon lights at the normandy beaches and run up a billboard that said were going to invade here some things need to be kept secret thats all go aheadtell me im wrong not me tom shook his head but you can hide anything you want behind that kind of smoke screen like i said we werent keeping this from the nazis we were keeping it from our own people i dont think thats right heydrichs soandsos didnt snatch private cunningham because they figured wed yield to those demands they made him mouth truman snapped they released that movie because they wanted to confuse decent americans and to scare them schrechlichkeit they call it frightfulness we tried to suppress it to keep that from happeningat my order in case youre wondering but you played straight into their murderous hands thank you one hell of a lot mr schmidt i hope youre proud tom had thought the president would say his commanders in germany had made the decision and he backed them because they were the experts and they were on the spot something like that anyhow but harry truman didnt seem to work that way hed done what hed done and he was ready to argue about it right or wrong he had the courage of his convictions and now ive wasted enough time on you he continued too much time to tell you the truth lets get back to business who else has got a question for me hands shot into the air truman pointed at a heavyset bald man drew how long can we keep troops in germany if the american people decide they dont want to any more drew pearson asked if the look the president sent him didnt scream et tu brute tom had never seen one that did since i dont believe the american people are going to decide any such thing that isnt worth answering truman said diana mcgraw will tell you youre wrong sir pearson responded i respect diana mcgraw i sympathize with her too and with all the good people whove lost loved ones because of heydrichs fanatics hitler called heydrich the man with the iron heart and for once adolf wasnt lying truman deigned to shoot tom another glare then he went on i talked with her when she came to picket the white house last month im convinced shes sincere im also convinced shes wrong if we run away from germany without finishing the job we set out to do there well be worse off in the long run than if we stay and not in the very long run either more and more people seem to agree with what shes saying drew pearson observed well so what that doesnt make them right yes truman could be as stubborn as a missouri mule and just because there are more of them than there were that doesnt mean there are very many of them most americans can see farther than the end of their noseand a good thing too he nodded to another correspondent whats on your mind walter walter lippmann asked him a question about farm legislation truman answered it with every sign of relief most of the time foreignpolicy issues werent what swayed elections in the aftermath of the biggest war in the history of the worldno not in the aftermath dammit because it wasnt over yet no matter whod signed which surrender documentsthe usual rules might not apply but they would if truman had anything to do with it tom schmidt remembered the line from the wizard of oz pay no attention to the man behind the curtain the wizard had said desperately that was only a movie but the president was trying to pull the same stunt for real could he make germany disappear from voters minds to tom that would be a bigger trick than any the wizard managed he wasnt the only one with such thoughts on his mind when truman pointed to another reporter the man said seems like the republicans want to use germany as a club to hit you over the head with in the upcoming elections what will you do if you have to deal with a republican congress next year ha thatll be the day truman was a dumpy little guy but he had an actors control of his expressions and attitudes his whole body radiated contempt work with me mr president the newspaperman urged suppose they do win the election then theyll be holding the purse strings what can you do if they decide not to appropriate any money for the occupation fdr would have set his granite chin and looked indomitable harry truman didnt have that kind of chin he didnt look indomitable eitherhe looked pissed off they wouldnt dare he snapped before the reporter could even try to follow up truman shook his head i know what youre gonna say bernard suppose they do right okay im supposing and this is what i suppose no matter what kind of stupid stunts the republicans try and pull with the budget this country still only has one commanderinchief and youre looking at him the united states of american isnt a box turtle no matter what some people think it cant pull its head and its legs inside its shell and pretend the rest of the world isnt out there that got us in trouble before the war itd be a lot worse now yet another reporter said if you were to try to do something after congress said you couldntthats how andrew johnson got impeached congress has no business telling me how to run the countrys foreign policy truman retorted and this is all moonshine anyhow im just indulging bernie there everything in germany will be fine the republicans wont win in november and even if they do they arent asinine enough to play games with the public purse you hope the reporter said no i hope they do try it theyd give me all the platform i need to bang on em like a drum in truman replied but theyre just not that stupid well a few of them are but not many what if they run eisenhower against you walter lippmann asked nobody knows whether ikes a republican or a democrat im not sure he knows himself the president answered he got a laugh even tom chuckled truman went on but i am sure of one thing eisenhower likes the idea of pulling out of germany even less than i do and they said it couldnt be done for the isolationists to line up behind him would be as foolish as for the antiwar democrats to line up behind general mcclellan against lincoln in but the democrats did do that lippmann pointed out tom thought he remembered the same thing but hadnt taken american history in a hell of a long time damn straight they didand they got their heads handed to them that november truman said if the republicans want to try what didnt work for my party in good luck to em he didnt lack for confidence tom had known that before seeing it face to face was more than a little daunting though he had to remind himself that being confident and having good reasons for confidence were two different critters would harry truman remind himself of the same thing off this mornings performance tom didnt think so god damn the russians to hell and gone reinhard heydrich ground out hans klein made sympathetic noises no one ever hit them a lick like the one we gave them new years eve he said not even stalin purged their officers the way we did wunderbar heydrich said sourly just killing them didnt matter killing them and accomplishing something does the new men in those slots wont be as sharp as the ones we got rid of klein said thats bound to help us later on wunderbar heydrich sounded even more morose this time he didnt know what the hell to do about the russians in the western occupation zones the resistance was going as well as hed hoped maybe better lots of americans and englishmen and even some frenchmen were yelling that holding germany down was more expensive than it was worth they hadnt taken a blow even close to the one poisoned liquor gave the red army but the russians didnt miss a beat they hanged germans and shot them and deported them and hunted heydrichs underground more ferociously than ever nothing seemed to faze them the reichsprotektor couldnt understand it well hitler hadnt understood it either hed said one good kick would bring the whole rotten structure of the soviet union crashing down and hed proceeded to deliver the good kick with men panzers and planes and the ussr staggered and lurched and reeledand then like one of those toys weighted at the bottom bobbed upright again in spite of everything and it started kicking back and didnt stop kicking till the reich lay prostrate under its boot the same thing was happening now knock out that many top french or british or american officershell knock out that many top german officersand the army youd just suckerpunched would do its best imitation of a chicken right after it met the hatchet which reminded heydrich what would happen to the resistance if he went down jochen peiper his number two was a puphed just turned thirty he was a damned capable pup though he ought to be able to carry on heydrich had to hope so as for the red army the germans had seen too often to their dismay and discomfiture that it had an almost unlimited supply of human spare parts take out a bunch of people and stalin would simply bolt on replacements and carry on as before maybe the military engine ran rough for a while but it kept running since it hadnt had much luck rooting out heydrichs fighters it avenged itself on the german people as a whole when heydrich growled about that johannes klein said its bad for even more reasons than youre talking about sir oh what am i missing heydrich was always ready to acquire fresh fuel for his righteous indignation they arent just killing germans for the fun of killing germans maybe theyre raping for the fun of it but not killing the veteran noncom answered heydrich snorted oberscharfuhrer klein went on theyre being horrible to try and detach the volk from us if people start thinking helping usor even keeping quiet about usmeans theyll get strung up theyll blab you bet they will theyll blab like you wouldnt believe heydrich thought that over but not for long scheisse he said crisply well when youre right youre right dammit now what do we do about it beats me sir klein said which made the reichsprotektor want to clout him in the ear oblivious to that or at least affecting to be klein continued as long as we look strong weve still got a decent chance the russian partisans werent that much trouble till they saw we wouldnt take moscow and our frenchies stayed in bed with us till the angloamericans landed hell some of em stayed longer than that a mocking smile stretched heydrichs thin lips some of the french collaborators had indeed clung to the reich till the bitter end what called itself radio paris went on broadcasting from sigmaringen in southwestern germany long after the real paris fell and some of berlins last defenders were troops from the ss charlemagne division socalled it never really got above regimental strength frenchmen with a few german officers and noncoms but things were different here now heydrichs followers needed the goodwillor at least the silenceof the people among whom they moved they tried not to compromise the wider populacebut how could you fight back at all without endangering them especially when you faced a ruthless foe like the russians you couldnt and as hans klein reminded him that carried risks of its own thinking out loud heydrich said i dont want to have to pull out of cities in the russian zone and in the parts of the reich the poles and czechs are stealing from us harder to strike at the enemy if we stick to fields and forests yes sir klein nodded chances are it wouldnt do us any good anyway just cause we move out of breslau say nothing to keep the russians from reaching in and hanging a hundred people there or a thousand on account of we blew up a panzer somewhere else himmeldonnerwetter heydrich muttered the oberscharfuhrer was right again however much heydrich wished he werent all the germans in the land lost to the soviet union were hostages the nkvd wouldnt need long to figure that out if it hadnt already and it would be as vicious as stalin decided it needed to beand if stalins viciousness had a limit the world hadnt seen it yet although hitler was almost eight months dead even thinking that someone else might be harder than he was made heydrich want to look over his shoulder and make sure no gestapo or sicherheitsdienst man was standing there and writing him up for disloyalty heydrich knew that was ridiculous if anyone qualified as fuhrer these days he did but like the men he led old habits died hard and knowing in your head was different from knowing in your belly as far as heydrichs belly was concerned hitler still ruled the reich from berlin i will rebuild it mein fuhrer i promise i will the reichsprotektor thought ill make it as much the way you would have as i can herr reichsprotektor ive got another question for you if you dont mind too much klein said you would flashed through heydrichs mind but he forced himself to patience as hed seen the noncom sometimes thought of things hed missed himself and so his voice held no snapor he hoped it didnt anyhowwhen he asked what is it suppose the amis do decide to pack up and go home then suppose they dont like what were doing once we come out of the caves and mines and bunkers and start running things will they drop one of those goddamn atom bombs on us i dont know if they will but they can im sure of thathow could we stop them heydrich said thats why weve got to get one for ourselves as soon as we can till we do youre rightwe live on their sufferance so do the russians but russias a lot bigger than germany we found that out the hard way klein remarked didnt we just i was thinking the same thing a little while ago and that reminds me of something else where the devil did i see it heydrich pawed through papers he didnt like being an administrator he craved action but unless he knew what was going on he wouldnt know what to act on his desk wasnt especially neat but after a few seconds he found what he was looking for they grabbed as many of our nuclear physicists as they could catch and took them over to england right after the surrender did they i hadnt heard that but it doesnt surprise me klein nodded to himself nope doesnt surprise me one goddamn bit the britishd want to grill em and they wouldnt want the russians to grab any of them right on both counts heydrich agreed same kind of race with them as there was with the engineers who built our rockets you can bet the ivans got their hands on some of both groups too damn them but thats not the point well what is the point then sir klein asked reasonably the point is that ten of these fellows with the high foreheads came back to germany on the heydrich paused to check the sheet of paper hed uncovered on the third of january thats when it was just a couple of weeks ago they landed at lubeck in the british zone now theyre staying at a trickedout clothing store in alswede not far away lubeck alswede dismay filled kleins voice thats up by the balticand no more than a long spit from the edge of the russian zone the tommiesd better hope the nkvd doesnt try a snatchandgrab they do have some security heydrich admitted reluctantly and they make sure the physicists cant just go wandering off on their own they have an evening curfew the brains cant leave the british zone and their families are hostages to make sure they behave the tommies dont say thats how things are but its what they amount to better than nothing i suppose still not good klein said now heydrich nodded he felt the same way but he turned the talk in a different direction ive made inquiries up there the british are going to really start letting people go any day now harteck and diebner plan to go the hamburg heisenberg and hahn aim to start up their old institute in gottingen von weizsacker and bagge and some of the others are thinking about joining up with them there they all know more than they did during the war if nothing else theyve learned a lot from the enemy and that means he let his voice trail away and waited people talked about watching a light come on on somebodys face heydrich watched it happen with johannes klein sweet suffering jesus the oberscharfuhrer exclaimed we can grab em ourselves put em to work making bombs for us we can sure grab them i aim to try heydrich agreed that way we deny them to the britishand to the russians i dont know how much they can actually do for us we wont have a lot of the equipment theyd need and we may not be able to take itsteal itwithout giving away too much still all we can do is try yes sir kleins eyes glowed when weve got a bomb like that for ourselves nobody will be able to kick us around any more not ever again thats right hans as a matter of fact well be able to do some kicking ourselves reinhard heydrichs predatory smile said he looked forward to it but then the smile faded like an old photograph left too long in the sun he started shuffling through the papers on his desk again whats up sir klein inquired some other business that needs taking care of heydrich said an answer that wasnt all this stuff happens at the same time and you cant let any of it get away from you or youre screwed its a miracle the fuhrer handled so much so well for so long and then after a while he didnt klein said heydrich gave him a look the noncom stuck out his chin oh cmon sir you know its true he screwed up the russian war like nobodys business and when we still werent doing real bad you know nobodyd make terms with us cause the angloamericans and stalin only figured the fuhrer would use the time to rebuild and then jump em again and he would have too tell me im wrong heydrich couldnt every word was gospel all the sameklein must not have had that internalized fuhrer looking over his shoulder will you say the same thing about me heydrich asked dryly sure hope not sir the oberscharfuhrer answered but wouldnt you rather have somebody tell you to your face youre going wrong instead of being too scared to open his mouth till after everythings down the shitter if you told hitler he was wrong to his face youd pay for it if you were lucky like some of his generals youd retire whether you wanted to or not if you werentwell that was one of the things concentration camps were for a point hans heydrich admitted still even if you do tell me im going wrong i reserve the right to think youre full of crap oh sure klein said officers always do every once in a while theyre even right he sketched a salute and ambled out into the rocky corridor heydrich stared after him noncoms whod been around for a long time always thought they deserved the last word every so often you had to remind them why you were in command every so oftenbut maybe not today lou weissberg held up a copy of the international heraldtribune it had a frontpage story about a demonstration in california against the continued american occupation of germany the story called the demonstration the largest and loudest yet captain howard frank grimaced when he saw the paper i already read it he said hot damn yup lou nodded story didnt make the stars and stripes funny how that works huh funny yeah funny like a truss captain frank made a small production out of lighting a cigarette he held out the pack to lou want one thanks lou flicked a zippo to get his started after a couple of puffs he said yknow we can lick our enemies we knocked these nazi assholes flat if stalin fucks with us well wallop him into the middle of next week hes gotta know it too but how the devil are we supposed to beat the people who say theyre on our side good question if youve got a good answer go tell eisenhower hell write it up and tell truman frank said thanks a bunchsir howard frank held up his hand hey im not kiddingnot even a little bit we cant stay here if the folks back home decide we ought to pack up and leave if your congressman tries to buck em theyll throw him out on his ass this november if truman tries theyll throw him out in and where will we be then up shit creek thats where and theyll be sieg heiling from what used to be the american zone twenty minutes after the last c takes off lou said frank stubbed out the cigarette and lit another one maybe not he said maybe we can hang around long enough to teach the germans how to stand on their own two feet you said that adenauer guy over in cologne impressed you gotta be more where he came from im sure there are but that wasnt agreement because lou went on but if we leave the way that mcgraw broad and her pals want us to those guys wont have the chance to stand up for themselves the nazisll bump em off first chance they get and then we start worrying about world war iii all in one lifetime maybe not frank said lou made a rude noise in a more rulesconscious army it might have landed him in the stockade captain frank just laughed you said stalins scared of us well yeah but hes fucking terrified of the germans if we do pull out hes liable to head for the rhine to make sure we dont get round two of the third reich we cant let him do that france shits its pants if he doessame with italy lou said gloomily so we go to war against him on account of the fucking krauts god thatd be a kick in the nuts wouldnt it and it sounds a hell of a lot like world war iii too it does doesnt it captain frank eyed the glowing coal of his cigarette youd think that when everybody says a war is over itd really be over yeah you would lou put out his cigarette too the ashtray was soldiermade from the base of a mm shell i figured id be home by now i figured my wifed be expecting another baby by now okay i understand what you mean morried probably be getting a little brother or sister if theyd given me a ruptured duck when i thought they would frank said but things after the surrender didnt work out the way anybody hoped you know that and what were doing here is worth doing you know that too hell everybody knows that not diana mcgraw and her crowd and it seems like her crowd gets bigger every day lou tapped the heraldtrib with his index finger that guy who smuggled out the cunningham film is with these people too tom shit whatever the hell his name was schmidt captain frank corrected primly then he shot lou a dirty look funny guy you and danny kaye and groucho marx you ought to have your own radio show youd sell tons of toothpaste and shaving soap all yehudim if hitler had his way he wouldve made us into shaving soap lou hesitated then went on some of the jewish guys over here they dont hardly seem to give a damn sure doesnt stop em from laying german broads nope me id sooner jack off if i fucked one of those bitches id break every mirror i own frank said lou nodded he felt the same way but a moment later his superior went on other people see it different thats all i heard one guy say he was getting his revenge nine inches at a time lou snorted a fucking braggart or maybe a braggart fuckingwho knows captain frank sent him another severe look he ignored it he was used to them more fun than going up against the wehrmacht or the waffenss i will say that or than going up against the fanatics frank said know what i heard fraid i dont but youre gonna tell me arent you lou said sure am the mps here grabbed a couple of german broads with vd who say people told em not to get cured they wanted these gals to make as many of our guys come down venereal as they could makes a twisted kind of sense lou said or it did anyway before sulfa and penicillin a guy with a drippy faucets just as much a casualty as a guy who got shot in the leg he was anyway till you could cure him with a needle in the ass or a handful of pills captain frank suddenly looked alert he pulled a fountain pen from his left breast pocket and scribbled a note something to remember heydrich and the other bastards down in the salt mines or wherever the hell they are dont know everything we can do theyve got old german intelligence reports and new newspapers lou broke in mmhmm and those howard frank nodded and which bunch has more crap mixed in with the good stuff is anybodys guess well youve got that right sir if hitlers intelligence on us were any good he never wouldve taken us on christ if his intelligence on russia were any good he wouldve let stalin alone too lou said back toward the end of the germans had already wiped out as many divisions as they thought the red army had frank said at the start they didnt know the russians had the t either you kinda lose points with your bosses when you miss stuff like the best tank in the war yknow oh maybe a few lou said which wrung a dry chuckle out of the captain then lou asked what are we missing that we ought to see for a moment captain frank looked almost comically astonished he was in the intelligence racket too did he really imagine he saw everything there was to see didnt imagining something like that take colossalalmost germanicarrogance captain frank started to say something then closed his mouth what he did say was probably quite different from what had almost come out youre a disruptive son of a bitch you know that thank you sir lou said which earned him another pointed glance but im serious god knows the nazis have their blind spots but so do we if we try to shrink em maybe we can japs sure blindsided us when they hit pearl harbor we never dreamt theyd be dumb enough to jump on us like that so they caught us flatfooted frank said they were tougher all kinds of ways than we expected we didnt know any more about the zero than the germans knew about the t and kamikazes his voice faded before the japs finally quit we played down how much trouble an enemy who didnt care if he lived could be lou said i guess we were smartthe japs wouldve done more of that shit if they knew how bad it hurt us but it seems to me we believed our own propaganda we didnt think the krauts could give us much trouble if they pulled stunts like that shows what we knew huh other thing we didnt think was that they would pull shit like that lou said before the surrender they didnt hardly the master race mustve learned something from the japs who woulda believed it not me captain frank held up a sheet of paper word is that that adenauer guy you brought from cologne is gonna speak at erlangen you really think hes the straight goods hes no nazi if thats what you mean lou replied if you mean is he the answer with a capital a hell i dont know but i sure hope like hell somebody can make the germans run their own government and not automatically go after all their neighbors if nobody can then weve got to do it ourselves frank finished for him unhappily lou nodded that was what hed been thinking all right his superior went on and god only knows how long well stay here we need to lou said no shit but what we need to do and what were gonna do theyre two different beasts and the jerks back home sure arent helping time may come when we have to go home prop up whatever halfassed german government weve patched together in the meanwhile and hope like hell heydrich and the nazis dont knock it over as soon as were gone it wont happen right away lou took what comfort he could from that not till after the fall elections anyhow captain frank lit another cigarette he blew out smoke and shook his head youre such a goddamn american lou whatever lou had expected from the other cic man that wasnt it i sure hope so sir he hesitated then asked what exactly dyou mean im damn glad im an american but you dont make it sound like a compliment frank sighed i dont mean it for an insult either but the europeans play a deeper game than we do cause they know how to wait and we dont heydrich figures if he can put the nazis back on top ten years from now or maybe twenty hes won and hes right too god damn him to hell but us we get bored or we find something new to worry about or we get sick of spending lives a few here a few there when its got no obvious point and so youre rightwe wont do anything much till after the elections but thats only this fall remember if the republicans take congressand if they take congress because theyre yelling what are we doing in germany now that the wars overwhat can truman do about it not much not if he wants to get elected in lou thought about that he shivered though a coal stove kept captain franks office toasty then he covered his face were screwed we are so screwed thats how it looks to me too captain frank said i hoped like anything youd tell me i was wrong xii diana mcgraw paid attention to the newspapers in ways she never had before pat got killed back in those prehistoric days shed looked at the funnies and the recipes and the advice and gossip columns foreign news as long as the americans and their allies kept moving forwardand from on they pretty steadily didwho worried about foreign news she did now the indianapolis papers didnt carry as much as she wanted as much as she needed and so the postman brought her the new york times she got it a few days late but that was better than not getting it at all the same went for the washington post if you wanted to find out what was going on in congress you had to read a paper that covered it seriously she was reading the times when she looked up and said ha ed was rereading the egg and i hed stop and chuckle every so often diana had read it too the only way you wouldnt stop and chuckle was if youd had your sense of humor taken out with your tonsils when you were a kid but that ha was on an entirely different note whats up sweetie ed asked she pointed to the story that had drawn her notice this german politician named adenauershe figured she was messing up the pronunciation but she hadnt taken any german in high schoolis coming into the american zone to talk to the germans there hes not a nazi is he ed answered his own question before diana could nah he wouldnt be they wouldnt let him get away with it if he was so how come you think hes a big deal i think were pushing truman and eisenhower and all the other blockheads running things over therepushing em our way i mean diana said if they set up some kind of german government that gives em an excuse to say well weve done what we need to do so we can bring our boys home now sounds good to me ed said she nodded to me too so lets hear it for mr konrad adenauer she tried the name a different way this time ed only shrugged hed come back from over there with a few scraps of german but hed forgotten it in the generation since the phone rang she picked it up diana mcgraw she said crisply the phone rang all the time these days she had to answer it as if she were running a business what else was she doing when you got right down to it she was just glad she wasnt on a party line the ringing that wasnt for them would have driven all the other people crazy hello mrs mcgraw this is e a stuart the reporter said shed already recognized his voice shed never imagined she would get to know reporters so well but it didnt impress her she would gladly have traded everythingtravel getting acquainted with prominent people even meeting the presidentto have her only son back again but god didnt make deals like that too bad it was almost enough to tempt you into atheism since she couldnt have what she wanted she did what she could with what she had what can i do for you mr stuart she used other reporters first names with ebenezer amminadab stuart formality seemed a better choice i was wondering if you had any comment on the speech senator taft made this afternoon stuart said she would see that speech when todays post or new york times got to andersonthree or four days from now can you tell me what he said she asked if it got reported on the radio i missed it radio news made even the local papers look thorough when you had to shoehorn everything into five minutes worth of air timewell you couldnt that was about the size of it basically he said truman doesnt know what hes doing in germany he said truman had won the war but he was losing the peace he said we heard all through the war how wicked the german people were if thats true he said they arent worth any more american lives and if its not true why were the president and the whole government lying to the american people from pearl harbor to ve day wow diana said thats not a mm useful remark e a stuart reminded her sorry youre right of course diana said let me see youcan say i agree with everything the senator said and he put it better than i could have okeydoke she could hear stuarts pencil skritching across paper yeah you may not like taftan awful lot of people dontbut you have a devil of a time ignoring him no kidding diana said has truman answered him yet yup he doesnt waste any timewhen somebody pokes him with a stick he pokes right back e a stuart sounded admiring and approving diana understood why truman made good copy to a lot of reporters nothing mattered more they didnt much care what public figures said or did as long as it sold newspapers mercenaries diana thought scornfully she had to deal with people like that and to be interesting in her own right for them she didnt have to like them when stuart showed no inclination to go on diana prodded him well what did truman say he said taft is like a guy yelling from the bleachers hes never been a manager in the dugout let alone a player on the field he said taft doesnt know what hes talking about but what can you expect from a guy up in the cheap seats the only reason hes not in the bleachers himself is that fdr died diana snapped she had the uneasy feeling that roosevelt wouldnt have wanted to pull troops out of germany but she didnt mention it to e a stuart the less you said that could make the people on your side unhappy with you the better off you were shed learned all kinds of unsavory but needful lessons about how to run a political campaign stuart chuckled hed probably call that baptism by total immersion hed have a point too phooey diana said and you can quote me well maybe i will the reporter answered wont take up any more of your time now bye the line went dead ive got other things to do he meant one more polite lie diana had learned a raft of them the past few months what did stuart want ed asked my comments on something senator taft said and on the presidents answer to it diana had said things like that often enough by now that she almost took them for grantedalmost but not quite taft makes good sense trumans full of malarkey well what else is new her husband said germans ambled into the market square in erlangen to hear what konrad adenauer had to say bernie cobb didnt give a damn about the politician from the british zone he wouldnt be able to follow the speech anyhow hed picked up a little more german since the socalled surrender enough to order drinks and food and enough to get his face slapped if he tried to pick up the waitress afterwards politics who cared about politics he and the other gis at the edge of the square werent there to listen to the speech they were there to frisk the krauts mooching in to make sure nobody was carrying a luger or wearing an explosive vest all bernie knew about the adenauer guy was that he was antinazi well no kidding otherwise the occupying authorities never wouldve let him open his yap but if the american authorities liked him you could bet your last pfennig that heydrich and the fanatics wouldnt which was why us soldiers were searching the german men who came to listen to adenauer what i want to do is pat down the broads bernie said not all of emyou can keep the grannies and stuff the cute ones hey itd be strictly line of duty right line of bullshit is what itd be cobb said carlo corvo the sergeant pointed toward the wacs and nurses who were searching german women see its taken care of one of the gals they were checking was a tall auburnhaired beautyjust the kind bernied had in mind yeah but they dont put their hearts into their work the way i would your heart is that what you call it these days sergeant corvo asked but he was leering at the goodlooking german gal too none of the jerries they frisked had anything lethal on him nobody else yelled out an alarm either and none of heydrichs goons blew himself up and a few dogfaces with him in frustration because he couldnt get close enough to konrad adenauer the german politico came out to what bernie thought of as extremely tepid applause hitler would have had the germans screaming themselves sick maybe theyd learned better than to get too excited about politicians more likely adenauer was about as exciting as soggy corn flakes without sugar he was an old fart with a sly face that would have served him well in a poker game an american officer introduced adenauer to the crowd in what sure sounded like fluent german to bernie quite a few officers and some enlisted men could go pretty well auf deutsch some had studied in school others like this lieutenant colonel rosenthal came by it in different ways bernie wondered what adenauer thought of having a jew present him to his own countrymen or did keith rosenthals being an american count for more wasnt adenauer trying to show that germans could handle their own affairs well sure they couldas long as the occupying authorities said it was okay despite the lukewarm hand adenauer got he waved as he stepped up to the microphone maybe the krauts had had all their political enthusiasm knocked out of them by now if they had that probably wouldnt be such a bad thing when bernie said so sergeant corvo nodded you better believe it wouldnt he opined or maybe this adenauer guy is as much of a boring old shithead as he looks like corvo always said exactly what he meant whether adenauer was getting his message across was liable to be another story if he fired up the krauts in the crowd they hid it well again chances were that was good news you know a little of the lingo right sarge bernie said whats he going on about he says germany has todo something with england and france germany sure did something to em bernie said shut up corvo snapped when you talk i cant make out what hes going on about he says germany needs to reconcile thats what it is he says germany has a lot to atone for yeah hesa catholic all right catholics like to talk about atoning for shit if you say so answered bernie a methodist who hadnt seen the inside of a church any time lately new mexico was full of catholics of course well as full of them as a mostly empty state could be but he paid even less attention to their religion than to his own how long would adenauer go on some of hitlers rants had lasted for hours hadnt they did the jerries expect all their politicians to match that if they didif they did they were even screwier than bernie cobb gave them credit for which was saying a mouthful fighting through france and germany bernied hated land mines worse than anything else they lay in wait for you and if you stepped on one or tripped over a wire that was all she wrote right behind themright behind themcame mortar rounds ordinary artillery announced itself somebody yelled incoming and a bunch of dogfaces hit the dirt or dove for holes but half the time you didnt know the bad guys had opened up with a mortar till the first bomb tore your buddys leg offor maybe yours bernie heard a faint hiss a faint whistle in the air he had a second or two to pretend he didnt it could have been a flaw in the microphone and speakers it could have been the wind which was nasty and cold it could have been bam an mm round burst right in the middle of the crowd of krauts listening to konrad adenauer next thing bernie knew he was as flat on the cobblestones as if a deuceandahalf had run over him he wasnt hurt in a way discovering his combat reflexes still worked was gratifying carlo corvo had flattened out beside him quite a few of the german men were also down on their bellies yeah theyd been through the mill too shrieks said some people were down because the mortar bomb had knocked them down and then another round came in and another and another a trained twoman crew could fire ten or twelve a minute morons could use an mm once it was aimed you dropped a bomb down the tube and you made sure it didnt blow your head off when it came out again it wasnt near as tough as designing an atomic bomb where the fuck you think they are corvo yelled as fragments whined not nearly far enough overhead the mortar guys you mean bernie said corvo nodded without raising his head bernies shrug actually hunched him down lower could be anywhere with a full charge one of those cocksuckersll shoot a mile and a half he tried to imagine securing everything within a circle three miles across centered on the market square his imagination promptly rebelled somewherein a fencedin yard or a back alley or up on a roofa couple of mortarmen were having a high old time and they could just leave the tube and bipod behind when they finished how many mortarsgerman and american and british and russianlittered the local landscape thousands maybe even millions cmon get up get moving corvo shouted we gotta make sure adenauers okay fanatics are bound to be after him bernie hadnt even thought about that he hadnt thought about getting up under fire either hed done it more often than he cared to remember during the war but the war was overwasnt it but seeing the sergeant stand up brought bernie to his feet too several other us soldiers were also up most of them headed for the platform from which adenauer spoke another mortar bomb scythed one of them down bernie looked away you didnt want to remember what explosives and jagged metal fragments could do to flesh the mortar rounds stopped falling then either somebodyd caught the guys serving the nasty little piece or theyd figured theyd done their duty and bugged out bernie knew what he hoped he also knew what he thought they werent the same there lay the auburnhaired gal hed wished he were searching nobodyd want to feel her up now a bad chest wound a worse head woundshe was still moving and moaning but bernie didnt think shed last long too bad too bad he jumped up onto the platform pointing his m this way and that it was dumbhe knew as much even while he did it the bastards whod done this werent close enough for the rifle to do him a nickels worth of good everybody here in the square with him probably hated the mortarmen as much as he did but you wanted to hit back somehow even when you couldnt ohmotherfuck sergeant corvo used his rifle too pointing with the muzzle one of the mortar bombs had blasted konrad adenauer off the platform he lay on his back staring up at the sky his thinning gray hair was mussed a single drop of blood splashed the end of his long pointed nose other than that his face was untouched he looked mildly surprised below his facebernie looked away the mortar rounds had done worse to adenauer than they had to the pretty woman with the dark red hair motherfuck carlo corvo said again you got that right bernie agreed he aint gonna be making more speeches any time soon i mean not unless its to st peter or the devil one a groan from a little farther away drew their attention to lieutenant colonel rosenthal he leaned against a wall clutching one arm with his other hand blood leaked out between his fingers can i bandage that for you sir bernie called i dont think youd better rosenthal sounded eerily calm as wounded men often did im holding it closed better than a bandage could if you want to yell for a medic thatd be good he paused as if remembering something and he was for he asked hows adenauer bernie wished he could lie but didnt see how it would help sir he bought a plot he raised his voice corpsman we need a corpsman over here shit rosenthal sounded furious then he said shit again this time in the way bernied heard much too often before the wound was starting to get its claws into him baring his teeth the american officer went on adenauer was the best hope we had for a germany that isnt either nazi or red was is right sir hes a gone goose bernie pointed toward the politicians crumpled body people always looked smaller when they were dead he didnt know why that was true but it was shit keith rosenthal said yet again score a big one for heydrich and his assholes then whos gonna have the nerve to try and stand up to em after this from in back of bernie carlo corvo said here comes a medic that was quick for a moment bernie was admiring then he wondered how come the aid man had got here so fast had the american authorities feared trouble and put the medics on alert maybe even posted them close by what did that say about konrad adenauer whod trusted us security arrangements it said hed been a jerkthat was what and what did it say about how things were going in germany generally nothing good bernie cobb was goddamn sure of that vladimir bokov had been through the influenza before you spent a week flat on your back then you spent another week feeling as if youd been beaten with knouts after that you were pretty much all right running on benzedrine while you were at your sickest meant that afterwards you felt as if youd been beaten with knouts and chains and you felt that way for three weeks not one all of which got him scant sympathy from his superiorsnot even from moisei shteinberg who was as miserable as he was did influenza keep anyone from holding the nazis out of moscow and leningrad shteinberg demanded did it keep anyone from throwing them out of stalingrad he paused for a coughing fit influenza probably kept some red army men flat on their backs during those fights bokov knew better than to say so instead he said the western imperialists have lost one of their reactionary politicians i suppose we need to protect the leaders of the social unity party of germany i suppose so ulbricht isuseful no doubt about it shteinberg spoke with the same not so faint distaste bokov had used they had their reasons walter ulbricht was useful he headed the social unity party of germany the front through which the ussr intended to rule its chunk of the dead reich like lenin he was bald and wore a chin beard there the resemblance ended lenin by all accounts had been loyal to no one and nothing but himselfand the revolution ulbricht by contrast was stalins lap dog hed spent the war in exile in the ussr returning to germany in the red armys wake he would do exactly what the soviet union told him to do no more and no less if heydrichs hooligans blew him off the face of the earth moscow might have to turn to someone less reliableto say nothing of the propaganda victory his death would hand the bandits with a sigh shteinberg went on im not really enthusiastic about keeping any germans alive these days if you want to know the truth well comrade colonel plenty who were alive on new years eve are dead now and plenty more will be bokov said they had it coming shteinberg said coldly mass executions in berlin and all through the rest of the soviet zone warned the germans that having anything to do with the fascist bandits was a bad idea far bigger mass deportations drove home the same lesson how the camps in the arctic and siberia would absorb so manywasnt bokovs worry you could always plop prisoners down in the middle of nowhere and have them build their own new camp if some of them froze before the barracks went up if others starvedit was just one of those things bokov had been through the germans murder camps they sickened himthe soviet union had nothing like them they also struck him as wasteful they didnt squeeze enough labor out of condemned people before letting them give up the ghost zeks were to use not just to kill so it seemed to him anyhow shteinberg lit a cigarette that made him cough too which didnt keep him from smoking we never did catch the swine who poisoned the booze he wheezed sucking in more smoke has to be the germans who laid in the supply bokov said if the barmen and serving girls knew anything we wouldve pulled it out of them he and shteinberg and their comrades had pulled all kinds of things from the people whod been at the schloss cecilienhof that night all kinds of things but not what they wantedwhat they needed there should be a list of those people shteinberg said there should bebut there isnt maybe nobody bothered to keep one bokov said had germans given the ordersround up that liquorthey would have kept a list since the command probably came from a soviet quartermaster who could say russian efficiency was no byword bokov added if someone did keep one somebody else made it disappear if we can find out who did that shteinberg broke off shaking his head anybody whos smart enough to make a list disappear is smart enough to make himself disappear too da bokov agreed glumly i used to wonder how the red revolutionaries could operate right under the noses of the tsars secret police why didnt they all get arrested and shipped to siberia bozhemoi why didnt they all get arrested and killed some of the tsars men were secretly on our side some were soft some were stupid shteinberg stopped again and some were very good at what they did we had to kill a good many of them but othersothers we reeducated some of them still serve the soviet union better than they ever served the tsars a young able lieutenant or captain from would be a colonel or a general or even a marshal nowif hed lived through all the purges in the generation between some would have made it some couldwhat did people say about anastas mikoyan some could dance between the raindrops and come home dry that was it something else shteinberg had said made bokov mutter to himself how many of our people are secretly on heydrichs side not many russians youd have to be a vlasoviteworse than a vlasoviteto side with the nazis now shteinberg said bokov nodded the germans had captured general andrei vlasov in and hed gone over to them even if they never quite trusted him anyone whod served in his russian liberation army was either dead or in a camp wishing he were dead but the germans who say theyre on our side bokov said he felt the same way about those germans as the hitlerites had felt about vlasov and his fellow russians they might be useful but would you really want to have to rely on one of them at your back yes we shall have to go through them that seems all too clear heydrichs men want us to think theyre ordinary mushrooms when theyre really amanitas shteinberg would have gone on but he had another coughing spasm this damned grippe i dont think itll ever let go bokov displayed a vial of benzedrine tablets they still helpbut i have to take more to get the same buzz i have some too shteinberg said i try not to take them unless i have to sometimes though theres no help for it so volodyahow do we get the amanitas out of our mushroom stew reinhard heydrichs chin and cheeks itched hed let his beard grow for a couple of weeks before emerging from the mine where hed sheltered for so long he wore beatup civilian clothes with an equally ragged wehrmacht greatcoat over them the kind of outfit any german male of military age might have hans klein sat behind the dented rusty kubelwagens wheel heydrich hadnt wanted to risk using an american jeepit might have roused suspicion are you sure you should be doing this at all sir klein asked since heydrich wasnt he scowled but he answered the operation is too important to leave to anyone else if you say so klein didnt believe him klein thought he was using that as an excuse to come out and do his own fighting klein was much too likely to be right too but klein was only an oberscharfuhrer heydrich was the reichsprotektor if he decided he had to come out none of the other freedom fighters had the rank to tell him he couldnt and if anything went wrong jochen peiper fidgeting inside another buried command post would take over and doas well as he could that was all so far everything was fine theyd already made it from the american zone up into the one the british held their papers had held up at every inspection things would have been harder where the russians ruled the russians did heydrichs men the dubious courtesy of taking them and their uprising seriously neither amis nor tommies seemed eager to do that they wanted the fighting to be over and so they did their best to pretend it was a jeep with four british soldiers in it came down the road toward heydrich and klein the jeep carried a machine gun the tommy behind it aimed it at the battered kubelwagen heydrich had seen that was only an ordinary precaution the fellow wouldnt open up for the fun of it he just feared that the kubelwagen might be full of explosives and the men inside willing to blow themselves up to kill him and his mates too not today friend tommy heydrich thought as the vehicles passed each other weve got something bigger cooking after a while klein pulled off onto the shoulder he started messing around in the kubelwagens engine compartment as if hed had a breakdown heydrich watched the road when it was clear in both directions he said now they jumped back in klein drove into the woods till trees screened the kubelwagen from the road youll know where the bunker is he asked id better heydrich answered confidently inside though he wondered how far out of practice was he and how much would finding out cost to his relief a scrap of handdrawn map in his greatcoat pocket written with russian names to make it look like a relic from fighting much farther east if he were searched and a compass brought him to a hole under a fallen tree the hole led to a tunnel the tunnel took him to the bunker three men waited there despite exchanged passwords they all pointed schmeissers or assault rifles at the entrance till heydrich and klein showed themselves all rightit is you one of them said lowering his weapon ja heydrich said lets get what rest we can we move at the underground hideout had bunks enough for all of them alarm clocks clattered to wake them at the appointed hour they armed themselves and went up and out into the quiet german night no blackouts any more which seemed unnatural to heydrich he could see the little town ahead even though it was mostly dark in the middle of the night softvoiced challenges and countersigns showed more germans gathering around alswede this assault would be in better than platoon strength the fighting wolves hadnt shown their strength like this before into the town they strode some wore the stahlhelm others used american or russian helmets instead their weapons were a similar blend and the tommies didnt even seem to realize they were there the british had converted the fancy clothiers emporium where they housed the german physicists into a residence hall it stood near the center of alswede heydrich hoped to bag all the brains because they had to be back at their new residence by sundown every day as his ragged little force converged on the emporium he imagined himself a field marshal on the eastern front moving armies and corps like chessmen on the board but those methods had failed the reich maybe this platoons worth of men would do more for germany than an army group had in the ukraine it had better heydrich thought yawning tommies stood sentry outside the physicists quarters the british werent altogether idiots but the sentries didnt expect trouble hands up an englishspeaking german called to them if you surrender you will not be harmed a burst from a sten gun answered him unlike the tin tommy gun that had almost murdered heydrich in prague this one worked fine but so did the germans assault rifles and schmeissers and grenades the sentries went down one after another lights came on all over alswede as people woke to the firefight and tried to figure out what the hell was going on heydrichs raiders charged into the haberdashery schnell he called to them we have to be gone before the tommies come in force he didnt know how long they had fifteen minutes he judged would be uncommon luck long before fifteen minutes were up the raiders came out again herding along men middleaged and elderly in their nightclothes weve grabbed nine of them a captain yelled to heydrich lets get out of here wheres the last one as long as they were in alswede heydrich wanted to make a clean sweep but the captain answered hes kaputcaught a bullet in the head poor bastard he jabbed a thumb toward the ground all right as long as the loose end was cleared up heydrich wouldnt fuss hed known going in that they took that chance if the british resisted they were luckymore than one of the sliderule boys might have stopped something heydrich raised his voice withdraw plan one some of the raiders left alswede heading north they made a hellacious racket whooping and shouting and firing their weapons into lighted windows everyone in town could tell exactly where they wereand could tell the british exactly where theyd gone along with the captured physicistswho were now starting to shiver in the latenight chillheydrich and the rest of his men quietly retreated to the south far fewer locals would pay them any attention far fewer would be able to tell the tommies where theyd headed and with luck the british would be slow to figure out they were the important group how important could they be if they didnt fire off everything they were carrying one of the scientistsa middleaged fellow with rumpled greasy hair and thick glassesasked why did you shoot poor heisenberg shut up professor diebner or well shoot you too heydrich was pleased with himself for recognizing whod spoken heisenberg was an accident an unfortunate accident too he thought heisenberg washad beena highhorsepower physicist coldly heydrich went on we will shoot you on purpose though if you slow us down or give us away give you away i dont even know who you are diebner said a man who believes in a free strong germany heydrich answered a man who doesnt believe the war is over yet or lost behind the spectacle lenses diebners eyes were enormous maybe the lenses magnified them heydrich wasnt sure he didnt care much one way or the other but diebner began and then clamped his mouth shut that made sense he was in no position to argue he and the others had probably spilled their guts while the enemy held them in england heydrich didnt even reckon it treason obviously the angloamericans were ahead of germany in nuclear physics he would have grabbed american scientists if he could but his countrymen were the best he could get his hands on maybe theyd be able to come up withsomething anyhow out of alswede into the woods the raiders divided into smaller groups splitting the physicists among them gunfire broke off to the north heydrich smiled wolfishly his distraction was working just the way hed hoped it would be damned sir hans klein said i think we pulled it off i said we would heydrich answered klein kept his mouth shut officers and leaders said all kinds of things sometimes they delivered sometimessometimes your vaterland ended up occupied by unfriendly foreigners but heydrich had delivered and maybe germany wouldnt stay occupied too much longer xiii cold rain pissed down out of a gray curdled sky bernie cobb manned a checkpoint outside of erlangen and steamed the rain blew into his face and dripped down the back of his neck which did nothing to improve his mood he looked this way and thathe tried to look every which way at once visibility wasnt much more than a hundred feet so looking didnt do him a hell of a lot of good the only consolation was a nazi sniper couldnt see any farther than he could what did they stick us out here for mack leff asked for about the tenth time leff wasnt a bad guy but hed got here after ve day so bernie didnt trust him as far as he would have trusted somebody whod been through the mill beats me bernie said somethings screwed up somewhere thoughthats for goddamn sure otherwise they wouldnt have put so many of us out on patrol at once yeah mack agreed mournfully his left hand moved inside the pocket of his field jacket bernie knew what that meant he was feeling a pack of cigarettes in there and wondering if he could keep one lit in this downpour he must have decided he couldnt because he didnt try to light up bernie had already made the same glum calculation and come up with the same answer he wasnt twitchy from missing a smoke yet but he sure wanted one the orders we got are all bullshit too he went onhe could always piss and moan even if he couldnt light up check everybodys papers hold anybody suspicious for interrogation suspicious how you come out in this weather at all you ought to have your head examined mack leff opined got that right bernie wondered if he could peel the paper off a cigarette and chew the tobacco inside hed always thought a chaw was disgusting to say nothing of hillbilly but out in the open in weather like this rained this hard when we got over the rhine last year then at least we could lay up in a house or a barn or somethin and stay out of it sometimes uhhuh leff nodded musta been good when you knew who the enemy was when you didnt have to worry about everybody from the grocer to the old lady with a cat you didnt have to watch your back so hard then fuck bernie muttered mack actually thought hed had it easy when the real war was on how was that for a kick in the nuts the really weird thing was the new guy might have a point you kinda had to look at things sideways to see it but when you did he became aware of a new noise punching through the endless hiss of rain off paving and fields heads up mack he said cars comin the jeep theyd ridden out here made a decent obstacle after theyd pulled it across the road if you wanted to go around it youd probably get stuck in the mud and youd probably get shot too bernie had the safety off on his m if mack leff didnt he was too dumb to deserve to live only worry was whether whoever was in the oncoming car could spot the jeep in time to stop they did which impressed berniethat kubelwagen had seen plenty of better years hitlers equivalent of a jeep could do most of the stuff a real one could only not so well two men sat in the kubelwagen if they werent vets bernied never seen any cover me he told leff as he came out from behind the jeep he raised his voice and used some of his terrible german papieren bitte then hopefully he added you guys speak english both krauts shook their heads bernie sighed he mightve known they wouldnt it was that kind of day they passed him the papers the guy behind the wheel was ludwig mommsen the documents said the other fellow whose long thin nose kind of leaned to one side and who needed a shave like nobodys business was erich wisser youin krieg bernie asked them they looked at each other where he said uh wo ostfront wisser answered danzig mommsen nodded again to show hed served over there too bernie grunted you couldnt get a jerry to admit hed ever taken a shot at an american if you listened to those guys talk nobodyd fought between normandy and central germanynot a soul bernie wished he didnt know better these guys seemed legit though he handed back their documents wo gehen sie he asked nurnberg mommsen answered pronouncing it the way a kraut would instead of nuremberg like an american they were on the right road okay bernie said and then louder move the jeep mack leff did the germans put the kubelwagen back in gear and drove off to the south that wasnt so bad leff said sure wasnt bernie agreed they should all be so easy lou weissberg read the report howard frank gave him then he handed it back to his superior officer he didnt have rank enough to get his own copy for that matter neither did captain frank hed have to give the report to his own superior who would stow it in a stout safe where no unauthorized eyes could see it jesus christ lou exclaimed he and captain frank exchanged selfconscious halfsmiles that was a hell of a thing for a jew to say but plenty born in the states did it all the time did the limeys screw the pooch or what they sure did frank said they screwed it like you wouldnt believe and so now the fanatics have nine firstrate atomic physicistssomewhere can they make a bomb lou asked the guy who wrote your little paper doesnt think so but does he know his ass from third base how am i supposed to tell do i look like einstein frank returned one thing i will say is that making a bomb seems to take a lot of fancy equipment heydrichs baboons have all kinds of shit damn them but i dont see em having that kind of gear so id bet against it mm lou nodded that made sensea certain amount of it anyhow if they cant make a bomb how come the diehards nabbed em maybe to make us yell and scream and jump up and down like weve got ants in our pants captain frank answered or maybe just for the hell of itthey dont think the sliderule boys can pull a rabbit out of the hat but they dont want to take the chance they might be wrong if you were in heydrichs shoes what would you do hang myself and save everybody else a lot of trouble lou said promptly he won a snort from his superior after a moment he went on been a week since they made the snatch right yup frank said and nobodys caught any physicists since not many diehards either nope the captain turned downright laconic well shit lou said chances are that means they got away clean yup frank said one more time if wed caught em people like you and me never would have got to see this report now its gonna be up to us to try and track the bastards down my aching back lou said that didnt satisfy him so he added gevalt howard franks head bobbed up and down lou took the name of the lord in vain the fanaticsll stash em underground somewhere way the hell down south how many places have they got in the mountains there too manyand we havent found a tenth of em yet frank said they were ready for the collapse damn them they started getting ready two years before the surrender thats what the interrogation reports say anyhow way things look youve got to believe it too uhhuh lou sounded as uncomfortable as his superior interrogators didnt always bother playing by geneva convention rules when they caught diehards alive the reich had surrendered after all and they needed information and didnt much care how they got itespecially since the krauts werent playing by the rules either if a hotshot lawyer or a reporter who sided with the letsrunawayfromgermany people back home found out what went on questioning fanatics the fur would fly oh boy would it ever and the chicago tribune and the other antiadministration papers would print every goddamn word well now youve got all the good news captain frank said where we go from here god only knows if he does i wish hed tell us lou scowled god didnt work that way if anybodyd had any doubts what went on during the war would have quashed them and i wish hed tell us why he decided to throw all the yehudim from france to russia into the fire nobody knew how many were dead for no other reason than that they were jews not even to the closest million nobody has a good answer for that frank said heavily god doesnt have a good answer for that the words should have sounded like blasphemy to anyone whod seen the inside of a german concentration camp they seemed only common sense reputable german firms had taken contracts for crematoria and bone crushers and all the other tools that went along with industrialized murder lou had followed more paper trails than he cared to remember and they all led back to businessmen who said things like we didnt know what theyd be used for and how could we say no to the government the scary thing was they meant it sometimes saying no to the government was the most important thing you could ever do but try and explain that to a german and heydrich wants to start it all up again only worse this time lou said worse yeah captain frank said gloomily who woulda thought that was possible after the nazis surrendered nothing could be worsen what they already did right then along comes the atom bomb and we find out maybe thats not right after all swell old world we got huh before lou could answer the phone on his desk rang it was an army field telephone patched into a network that also included what was left of the german national telephone system he picked it up weissberg here you da guy in charge o going after the fanatics by the way the gi on the other end of the line talked he was from new jersey too or maybe long island im one of em lou said how come on account of i got a kraut right here whos ready tswear on a stack o bibles he seen that heydrich drive through town a little while ago jesus christ lou exploded this time altogether unselfconsciously put him on the german knew some english but proved more comfortable in his own language he had a beard but i recognized him he said his picture was all over the papers when the english tried to kill him in the war there is a reward for me if you catch him ja jawohl lou agreed the reward for heydrich dead or alive was up to a million bucks lou had no idea who this german was or what hed done between and whatever it was it was nothing next to heydrichs list whats cooking frank asked one hand over the mouthpiece lou told him the captain almost jumped out of his skin we can catch him we really can find out how long ago this guy saw him and which way he was headed we can spread the net ahead of him so tight a hedgehog couldnt sneak through lou got back on the phone he asked the jerry captain franks questions then relayed the replies he got less than an hour ago and heading southeast son of a bitch howard frank said reverently weve got him reinhard heydrich had served in the navy before the wartill he left it abruptly after not marrying the senior officers daughter hed seduced hed flown combat missions over poland and the soviet union the only experience he had as a foot soldier was getting away from the ivans after his crashlanded between their lines and the germans squelching through a swamp and ducking down into the mud and the water plants wasnt his idea of fun but hans klein had the perfect spur for him do you want the fucking amis to catch you sir now that you mention it no heydrich admitted well then dont stand straight up and down like a heron looking for frogs get down here with me klein said he hadnt had much ground combat experience himselfcertainly none since he became heydrichs driver but he sure talked like somebody who knew what he was talking about if youd been able to fix the kubelwagen when it broke down for real heydrich began peevishly but that didnt wash either the oberscharfuhrer let out a derisive snort ja doch then what ill tell you whatsir idve driven us straight into a yankee ambush thats what and theydve filled both of us full of holes again he was altogether too likely to be right that made heydrich love him no better when freezing water filled his shoeagain maybe infantrymen really were the heroes of the war even if pilots and panzer commanders got more ink from goebbels infantrymen put up with more shitno possible doubt about that the kubelwagen had flatulently expired about ten kilometers outside of nuremberg the horrible noises it made told klein he didnt have the tools to fix it they started off for a farmhouse they could see a couple of kilometers off the road maybe the farmer would have the tools if he didntif he didnt they would think of something else that was all theyd just trudged into a grove of apple trees not far from the farmhouse when klein looked back over his shoulder and said mm herr reichsprotektor i think maybe we dont want to go back no matter what are you out of your heydrich had begun then hed looked over his shoulder too american jeeps and an armored car and us soldiers in their pot helmets and ugly greenish khaki uniforms swarmed around the dead kubelwagen when heydrich turned to say as much to klein klein wasnt there he was down on the ground and reaching out to tug urgently at heydrichs trouser leg heydrich needed a second to get it which proved him no infantryman then he hit the dirt too they crawled away from the car that had chosen such an opportune moment to crap out no bullets chased them so the amis hadnt spotted them before they went down have they got dogs klein whispered as they slithered away i dont think so i didnt see any heydrich replied also in a low voice low voice or not he had trouble hiding his scorn the russians would have had dogs the russians damn them were serious about this twilight battle the americans didnt seem to be they thought his men annoyances nuisances they wanted everything peaceful and easy and smooth well you didnt always get what you wanted even if you were an ami after a while klein found another question do you know of any bunkers around here a map formed inside heydrichs mind he had an excellent even outstanding memory and a knack for visualization after a moment he nodded ja theres one maybe three kilometers east of here can you find it shall we go there i can find it heydrich said confidently what he promised he could deliver the other half of kleins question wasnt so easy to answer after some thought the reichsprotektor said id rather not go to ground if i can help it if they track us to the bunker were trapped like a badger inside its sett well yes klein returned also after a pause to think but they can run us down in the open too you know if heydrich made it back to his underground headquarters he didnt plan on coming out again any time soon in the meanwhileas long as were above the ground and moving weve got a chance to get away i think the risk that they can follow us to the bunker and dig us out is just too big had klein argued he might have convinced his superior to change his mind as things were the oberscharfuhrer only sighed well youre right about one thing bosswe can get screwed either way they werent screwed yet the americans made a hamfisted job of going after a pair of fugitives without false modesty heydrich knew the ss would have caught up with him and klein in short order for that matter so would the nkvd professionals knew what they were doing the americans how the devil did they win they were braveheydrich couldnt deny that and there were lots of them and what came out of their factoriesfew germans had imagined just how much the usa could make when it set its mind to it bombers fighters tanks jeeps trucksyes each man from the wehrmacht or waffenss was better than his enemy counterpart but he wasnt enough better not when the other side had so many more troops and so much materiel and however clumsy the other side was it hadnt given up here american soldiers stumbled across the landscape how far south and east the search extended heydrich didnt want to think sooner or later the amis were much too likely to blunder across him and klein by sheer luck if they did if they do im a dead man heydrich thought so was klein but hans could do his own worrying if the noncom did it stretched no further than himself heydrich also worried about the fate of the whole national socialist uprising it would go on without him he knew that whether it would go on so well and sting the enemies from the east and west the way it had was a different question yes jochen peiper was capablehe wouldnt have been second in command if he werent still heydrich didnt think anybody could match heydrich what are you idiots doing screwing around in this swamp the question came in such a broad bavarian dialect that heydrich barely understood it he almost plugged the man who asked it any which way hed had no idea anybody but hans was anywhere within half a kilometer but this wizened little grinning bastard appeared from behind a tussock as if he were a sprite in one of wagners lesser operas now was he a good sprite or the other kind he was a sprite who was wary of firearms that was for surehe stood very still and kept his hands where heydrich could see them hey buddy you dont want to do that he said his grin slipping only a little you shoot me all the american pigdogsll come running this way are you loyal to the grossdeutsches reich heydrich demanded he knew about the everrising price on his head if this scrawny son of a bitch decided to play judas hed get a lot more than thirty pieces of silver but he wont live to enjoy them if he does the reichsprotektor promised himself got out of the ukraine in one piece got out of romania in one piece hell got out of hungary almost in one piecethey grazed me while i was hightailing it over the border got stuck in vienna after that and got away there too the bavarian said we still owe folks a thing or three maybe he was telling the truth maybe he was spinning a line to lull heydrich and klein the underofficer came straight to the point can you get us out of here without tipping off the amis not a surefire deal but i think so the bavarian answered want to come along and see heydrich and klein looked at each other they both shrugged at the same time heydrich didnt see how he could leave somebody who might be a betrayer at his back he also didnt see how he could quietly dispose of the fellow yes the man might take them straight to the amis sometimes you just had to roll the dice lets go heydrich said after a barely perceptible pause get moving then the bavarian replied off they went are you sure this is a good idea klein whispered no heydrich returned are you sure it isnt the oberscharfuhrer answered with another shrug after a few minutes heydrich became convinced the bavarian wasnt going straight to the americans he wasnt going straight at all his turns seemed at random but they all took him and the halftrusting men at his heels deeper into the swamp bushes and scraggly treesthe edges of the lorenzerwaldhid them ever more effectively right season you can get all kinds of mushrooms around here their guide smacked his lips i believe it hans klein sounded more as if he was thinking of death and decay than of a thick slice of boiled pork smothered with mushrooms since heydrichs train of thought ran on the same track he couldnt very well tell klein to shut up the bavarian chuckled not only was he at home in this miserable countryside he was enjoying himself how will you get us past the enemy heydrich asked one of his wet shoes was rubbing at the back of his heel pretty soon like it or not hed start limping he wondered if hed do better barefoot if he had to hed try that but running something into his sole wouldnt slow him upit would stop him cold he resolved to hang on to his shoes as long as he could oh there are ways the other man said airily they came to a shack beside a little stream the shack might have been built from junk salvaged after the surrender or it might have been leaning there in growing decrepitude since the days of frederick the greator frederick barbarossa nice place hans klein said dryly the bavarian chuckled glad you like it follow me around back around the back a stubby wooden pier stuck out into the stream like the shack it might have been there a few months or a few hundred years the boat tied to the pier wasnt new but also wasnt obviously a remembrance of things past get in the bavarian told heydrich and klein then lie flat its roomier down there than it looks and so it was this fellow probably didnt smuggle fugitive national socialist fighters every day if he didnt smuggle something every day or often enough heydrich would have been astonished just to make sure of things the bavarian draped a ratty tarpaulin over them the tarp smelled of mildew and tobacco heydrich nodded to himself thought socigarette smuggler these days cigarettes were as good as money in germany in a lot of places they were money near enough off we go the mans voice came from the other side of the tarp like the sun from the far side of a cloud what happens if the americans make you stop klein asked well worry about that when it happens all right the bavarian didnt lack for nerve the boat began bobbing in a new way it was floating down the stream now pretty soon the bavarian sat down and started rowing to help it along the oarlocks creaked time stretched all rubberlike heydrich didnt know whether to be terrified or bored beside him klein started snoring softly heydrich found himself jealous of the underofficer sometimes not thinking ahead made life simpler after a while heydrich jerked awake and realized hed been dozing too hans klein laughed softly you snore herr reichsprotektor well so do you heydrich said how far do you suppose weve come i dunno a ways shut up you two the bavarian hissed amis on the banks sure as hell a voice called out in accented but fluent german hey fritzi you old asslick you running luckies again not me the bavarian answered solemnly chesterfields he got a laugh from the american but then the enemy soldier went on you seen a couple of guys on the lam high command wants em badtheres money in it if you spot em your high command must want them bad if its willing to pay the bavarian observed and won another laugh but me ive seen nobody he kept rowing if the american called forfritzi to stopbut he didnt the boat slid on down the stream heydrich wished he could see what was going on he could see the bottom of the boat the tarp a little of himself and even less of hans it wasnt enough he kept his head down anyhow after a while the bavarian said we gave that lot the slip shouldnt be any more for a while and even if there are i can make it so they never see us good by me klein said and me heydrich agreed one of the basic rules was you didnt argue with somebody who was saving your ass heydrich had broken a lot of rules in his time but that one made too much sense to ignore lou weissberg could count the times hed been on a horse on the fingers of one hand he thought of a jeep as the next best thing or maybe even the equivalent a jeep could go damn near anywhere and almost never broke down the stars and stripes cartoon of the sad cavalry sergeant putting a hand over his eyes as he aimed his at the hood of a jeep that had quit only reinforced the comparison in his mind mud flew up from under this jeeps tires as it roared toward the edge of a twobit stream the pfc driving it gave it more gas dont worry lieutenant the guy said cheerfully ill get you thereand ill get you back too i wasnt worried lou answered and he was telling the truthabout that at any rate he was worried about heydrich getting away if the report was true they should have grabbed the son of a bitch by now theyd found the kubelwagen or a kubelwagen not too far from here that much checked out but no heydrich that jerry hoping for a big chunk of change had to be sweating bullets right now for all kinds of reasons if the kraut was bullshitting the americans would come down on him hard if he wasnt whod want to sell him life insurance the jeep half skidded to a stop lou hopped out carrying a grease gun he trotted over to the gis by the side of the stream the mud tugged at his boots but hed been through plenty worse plenty thicker seen anything he called to the dogfaces hed been thinking of stars and stripes one of the soldiers had a bent nose and a dented helmet just like joe of willie and not a goddamn thing he said adding uh sir a beat later when he noticed the silver bar painted onto lous steel pot only fritzi running smokes like usual whos fritzi lou asked the gis looked at one another lou could tell what was going through their minds this guy is supposed to help run things and he doesnt know stuff like that patiently the one who looked like joe explained hes this kraut who lives in the swamp around here he gets cigaretteshell i dunno where but he does and he makes his living turning em over yknow what i mean hes a good german fritzi is how do you know that lou had met any number of germans whod done things that would make jack the ripper puke but who were kind family men and never kicked the dog you just couldnt tell oh you oughta hear him cuss hitler and the generals the soldier answered far as hes concerned they screwed things up like you wouldnt believe terrific lou said tightly you searched the boat right they eyed one another again at last the guy who looked like joe said nah we didnt bother fritzis okay like i said and we woulda had to notice the cigarettes and that woulda just complicated everybodys life his buddies nodded suppose he was carrying heydrich lou snapped then we fucked up the gi said shrugging but whatre the odds okay okay but when the prize is this big we gotta tie up all the loose ends lou said if all hes gotre cigarettes i dont give a shit but all the krauts hate hitlernow ask em five years ago and you woulda got a different answer so which way did this goddamn boat go thataway the soldier said as if hed watched too many westerns he jerked a thumb toward the southeast then well go after him lou declared he had a radio in the jeep and turned back towards it ill call in reinforcements call in a bunchsir the dogface told him you go much farther and things start getting trickylike again his pals heads went up and down lou shrugged too in a different way fine so things get tricky i will call in a bunch and he did then he had to wait for the reinforcements to get there when they did his heart sank they were new drafteesyou could always tell they didnt want to be there and barely bothered to hide it they squelched into the swamp like guys ordered to take out the siegfried line with slingshots just remember the price on heydrichs head guys lou called to them a million bucks taxfree youre set for life if you nail him anything to get the reluctant soldiers moving if he thought they would have believed him he would have promised them a week of blowjobs from rita hayworth they did move a little faster but only a little one of them said yeah like this fuckin krauts really in there now tell me another one like any other soldier with an ounce of sense the american gi was a professional cynic these fellows didnt know much about soldiering yet but theyd sure figured that out sometimes there was no help for a situation sometimes there was lou knew one that frontline officers had often used before the surrender well follow me goddammit he snapped and plunged past the draftees into the swamp himself they muttered and shook their heads but they did follow that accomplished less than he wished it would have he rapidly discovered why the troopers who knew fritzi had set up their checkpoint where they did past that the stream split up into half a dozen narrow channels that crossed and recrossed braided and rebraided like a womans pigtail woven by a nut some of what lay between the channels was mud some was bushes some was rank secondgrowth trees all of it was next to impossible to get through have a heart lieutenant one of the draftees panted after a while if that whatshisname asshole came this way hell never make it out again several of the other new fish nodded my ass lou said sweetly you wouldnt be dogging it if the jerries were plastering this place with si guarandamntee you that behind him the gis muttered nobody directly answered him though he knew what that meant it meant just what hed thought these guys were fresh off the boat from the states theyd never been under fire and they had no idea what the hell he was talking about something fairsized and brown splashed into the water and swam away lou came that close to opening up on it before he realized it was an animalone that walked on four legs most of the gis came out with variations on what the fuck was that but one of them said hey clifton that a muskrat or a nutria muskrat i betcha nutrias even bigger clifton sounded froggier than most of the frenchmen loud met five got you ten he was born within spitting distance of the louisiana bayou after a moment he went on damfino what either one of ems doin here theys american critters waddaya wanna bet the krauts brung em over to raise for fur and they got loose way nutrias did when we shipped em up from south america his buddy answered my uncle raise nutrias for a while then he go bust and sponge offa pa lou didnt give a muskrats ass about escaped rodents or the soldiers sponging uncle spread out he told his none too merry men god damn it to hell we are gonna comb this swamp and see whats in here he hadnt gone another fifty yards before he realized it was hopeless a regiment could have gone through here and missed an elephant standing quietly in the shade of the trees no elephants or none he sawthe jerries wouldnt have brought them in for fur but with the best will in the world the platoon he led couldnt have searched the whole swamp in under a year and these clowns didnt have the best will in the world or anything close to it they pissed and moaned they dragged their feet reward or not they couldnt have cared less about catching reinhard heydrich because they didnt think he was within miles as for fritzi and his rowboat full of illicit tobaccothe only thing that mattered to them was that they were getting muddy and their poor little tootsies were soaked more than once lou had heard krautsespecially krauts who didnt know he spoke germanwonder out loud how the hell the usa won the war hed never been tempted to wonder the same thing himselftill now a gray heron almost as tall as a man made him nervousall the more so because its plumage was only a little lighter than feldgrau but no landser ever born came equipped with that cold yellow stare or that bayonet beak the herons head darted down a carp wriggled briefly then disappeared the sun sank toward the western horizon clifton said no offense lieutenant but we aint gonna find him yeah lou said and then several things quite a bit warmer than that maybe the gis posted on the far side of the swamp would scoop heydrich up when he came out lou had to hope so he wasnt going to be the hero himself the reichsprotektor shouldnt have got awaybut it looked like he had xiv a teletype chattered tom schmidt pulled the flimsy paper off the machine the dateline was munich the headline said heydrich mocks pursuers after escape the story wasjust what youd expect after a headline like that the boss of the german national resistance was back in hiding again and thumbing his nose at the blundering americans whod let him slip through their fingers well jesus christ schmidt said in disgust we really cant do anything right over there can we what now asked another reporter in the tribunes washington bureau he was interested enough not to light his cigarette till he got an answer schmidt gave it to him finishing what dyou think of that wally wally did light up before replying i think it stinks thats what what am i supposed to think first the krauts grabbed a bunch of guys with slide rules then when their own big cheese put his neck on the chopping block we couldnt bring the goddamn hatchet down somebodys head ought to roll if heydrichs didnt sounds right to me tom said you know what else im all ears wally said he wasnt so far wrong either he really did have a pair of jug handles sticking out from the sides of his head ill tell you what tom always had liked the sound of his own voice this part of the war is harder on us than whipping the wehrmacht was thats what how dyou figure wally asked cause when we were fighting the wehrmacht we knew who was who and what was what tom said now were in the same mess the nazis got into when they had to fight all the russian partisans you cant tell if the guy selling cucumbers likes you or wants to blow you to kingdom come and does that pretty girl walking down the street have a bomb in her handbag how are you supposed to win a fight like that if the other side doesnt want to let up kill em all wally suggested we arent gonna do that tom said and the other reporter didnt disagree with him after a moment he added hell even if we wanted to i dont think we could hitlers goons pretty much tried it and even they couldnt pull it off besides dyou really wanna imitate the goddamn ss they didnt have the atom bomb so they had to do it retail wally said we could do it wholesale maybe we could but we wont tom said aint gonna happenno way nohow i almost wish it would its the only thing that could get us out of the deep shit we walked into either that or just packing up and going home wally said you oughta write the rest of it up itd make a good column yknow especially if you use the heydrich story for a hook damned if it wouldnt tom carried his filthy mug over to the coffee pot that sat on a hot plate in the corner of the room the pot had been there since sunup and it was late afternoon now the black steaming stuff that came out when he poured would have stripped paint from a destroyers gun turret adulterated with plenty of cream and sugar it also tickled brain cells tom ran a sheet of paper into his underwood and started banging away when things went well he could pound out a column in fortyfive minutes this was one of those times he passed it to wally when he finished strong stuff the other reporter said nodding trumanll call you every kind of name under the sun okay by me tom said only thing i want to know now is whatll the guys back in chicago do to me if you dont like getting edited you shoulda written books instead of going to work for the papers wally said nah tom replied ill never get rich at this racket but i wont starve either you try writing books for a living you better already have somebody rich in the family yeah i dont like what the editors do sometimes but i can live with it a regular paycheck helps a lot you think im gonna argue with you wally shook his head not me charlie i got two kids and a third on the way schmidts column ran in the tribune the next day at the presidents next press conference truman said i didnt imagine anybody could make me think a guttersnipe like westbrook pegler was a gentleman but this schmidt character shows me i was wrong tom felt as if hed been giving the accolade then walter lippmann who was staunchly on the side of keeping american troops in germany till the cows came home attacked him in print up till then lippmann had never deigned to acknowledge that he existed much less that he was worth attacking tom fired back in another column one that drew him even more notice than the first had he was as happy as larry every once in a while though he got reminded of what his happiness was built on as if to celebrate heydrichs escape the diehards blew up an american ammunition dump on the outskirts of regensburg the blast killed fortyfive gis and wounded a number the war department coyly declined to state it broke windows ten miles away a survivor was quoted as saying i thought one of those atomic whatsits went off how do we let things like this happen tom wrote and if we cant keep things like this from happening why do we go on wasting our young mens lives in a fight we cant hope to win wouldnt it be better to come home let the germans sort things out among themselves and use our bombers and our atomic whatsits to make sure they can never threaten us again sure looks that way to me he paused that wasnt quite a strong enough kicker he added one more linesure looks that way to more and more americans too no brigadier general summoned to testify before congress ever looked happy in jerry duncans experience that was as much a law of nature as any of the ones sir isaac newton discovered this particular brass hathis name poor bastard was rudyard holmyardlooked as if hed just taken a big bite out of a fertilizer sandwich which didnt stop the indiana congressman from trying to rip him a new one how do we let things like this happen duncan thundered if a newspaper columnist had put it the same way a few days earlier well it was still a damn good question um sir when both sides have weapons and determination you just arent likely to pitch a perfect game holmyard said we found that out the hard way in the philippines at the turn of the century and again in the caribbean and central america during the s and s sometimes you get hurt thats all you do your best to prevent it but you know ahead of time your best wont always be good enough one of those things eh jerry laced the words with sarcasm general holmyard nodded somberly jerry went on when we were fighting in the philippines at the turn of the century though we didnt have to worry about the guerrillas getting the atom bomb did we no sir the general replied of course we didnt have it ourselves either would we have dropped one on the philippines if wed had it then duncan wondered his guess was that we probably would have how could teddy roosevelt have carried a bigger stick and the philippines were a long way away and the people there were small and brown and had slanty eyes they werent quite japs but yeah teddy would have used the bomb if hed had it with an effort the congressman pulled his thoughts back to the middle of the twentieth century why havent we been able to recapture any of the physicists the fanatics kidnapped he asked general holmyard looked even gloomier jerry hadnt thought he could a couple of points there sir he said first we dont know for a fact that the missing scientists ever entered our occupation zone they may be under british or french administration or even russian so they may the only thing were sure of is that theyre under reinhard heydrichs administration isnt that a fact a muscle in holmyards jaw twitched but his nod seemed calm enough yes sir he said stolidly another thing i need to point out is that unfortunately a nuclear physicist looks like anybody else when hes not wearing a white lab coat coming up with these guys is like looking for multiple needles in a heck of a big haystack terrific jerry said at which point the democrat running the committee rapped loudly for order sorry mr chairman duncan told him he wasnt but the forms had to be observed i only have a few more questions the first one is how likely are the fanatics to be able to manufacture their own atom bombs now that they know its possible very unlikely congressman i have that straight from general groves holmyard replied jerry winced having run the manhattan project to a successful conclusion leslie groves owned a named to conjure with general holmyard continued atom bombs may be possible but they arent easy or cheap you need a sizable supply of uranium ore and you need an even bigger industrial base the nazi fanatics have neither youre sure they cant get their hands on uranium duncan said when we entered germany we had a special team ordered to take charge of whatever the germans were using to try and build their own bomb rudyard holmyard said that team did a firstrate job the war department is confident heydrichs goons cant come up with anything along those lines the war department was also confident the germans would stop fighting after they signed their surrender jerry pointed out the chairman banged the gavel again jerry didnt care hed wanted to get in the last word and now he had no further questions he said and stepped away from the microphone none of the other congressmen raked general holmyard over the coals the way jerry had of course the majority of the committee members were democrats but the rest of the republicans also stayed cautious the democrats wished the issue of germany would dry up and blow away too many men on the same side of the aisle as jerry duncan didnt have the nerve to reach out and grab it with both hands of course the majority were democrats jerry muttered to himself as he went back to his office ever since the depression crashed down the democrats had ruled congress these days most people took their comfortable majorities for granted jerry didnt he thought germany was a prime way to pry them out of the chairmanships and perquisites theyd enjoyed for so long he only wished more republicans agreed with him as usual a fat pile of correspondence awaited him when he sat down at his desk actually two piles one from within his own district the other from outside it before he made a name for himself about germany nobody outside the area that stretched northeast from anderson and muncie had cared a nickel for him that had suited him fine too now though people from all over the country sent him letters and telegrams some said he should run for president others called him a fathead or told him he would burn in hell or said he had to be a nazi or a communist or sometimes both at once and still otherssadly fewer than he would have likedwere thoughtful discussions of what was going on in germany and what the united states ought to do about it this latest stack of mail from all over would have to wait a while his district came first any congressman who didnt get that didnt stay in congress long more people from indiana seemed to understand what he had in mind not only did he know his district but hed represented it long enough to let it get to know him too oh there were a couple of burninhell letters here and one unsigned one decorated with swastikas but you couldnt make everybody happy no matter what you did the local mail wasnt anything that made jerry doubt hed win in november and winning in november was what he had to do once hed taken care of that he would look around and see everything else he needed to deal with but if he lost the upcoming electionwell there wasnt much point to anything after that was there reinhard heydrich didnt bother with full dress uniform very often what was the point god only knew how many meters underground the other resisters down here knew who he was and what he was and that he had the authority to command them what more did he wantegg in his beer sometimes though he needed to impressno to intimidatepeople and so today he wore the highpeaked cap the tunic with the ss runes on the black collar patch and the eagle holding a swastika on the right breast the knights cross to the iron cross at his throat and the rest of his decorations on his left breast it was all devilishly uncomfortable but he looked the part of the reichsprotektor which was the point of the exercise hans klein also in full ss regalia came in and said loudly herr reichsprotektor the scientist wirtz to see you as you ordered send him in oberscharfuhrer heydrich replied zu befehl herr reichsprotektor klein clicked his heels they never would have bothered with that nonsense if karl wirtz werent out in the corridor listening but they had to make wirtz and the other captured physicists believe the reich was still a going concern and to a certain degree they had to believe it themselves klein strode out he returned a moment later with professor wirtz the scientist looked to be in his late thirties he was tall and thin with a hairline that had retreated like the wehrmacht on the eastern front leaving him with a forehead that seemed even higher than it would have anyhow heydrichs right arm snapped up and out heil hitler he barked wirtz gaped erhitlers dead he muttered you will address the reichsprotektor by his title hans klein rumbled ominously sounding every centimeter the senior underofficer the fuhrer may be dead heydrich said the reich he founded lives onand will live on despite any temporary misfortunes and you herr doktor professor wirtz will help ensure its survival mme if the prospect delighted wirtz he hid it very well all i ever wanted to do was come home from england and get back to my research you are homehome in the grossdeutsches reich heydrich said and we brought you and your comrades here so you could conduct your research undisturbed by the english and the americans you want us to make a bomb for youherr reichsprotektor wirtz wasnt altogether blindno indeed thats exactly what we want yes heydrich agreed with it we are strong we can face any foe on even terms the americans the russiansanyone without it we are nothing so you will give it to us wirtz licked his lips it makes me very sorry to say this herr reichsprotektor but what you ask is impossible he was sorry to say it heydrich judged because he feared what the reichsprotektor would do to him and well he might but though wirtz didnt know it heydrich had already heard the same thing from several other physicists all he said now was why do you think so you do not have the uranium ore we were using before do you the ore from which we would have to extract the rare pure material we need for the bomb wirtz said when heydrich didnt answer the physicist went on and you do not have the factories we would need to perform the extraction the americans spent billions of dollars to build those factories billions herr reichsprotektor when i think how we had to go begging for pfennigs to try to keep our research going he shook his head we were fighting a foe who was bigger than we are again heydrich had heard the same thing before he liked it no better now than he had then can you get the uranium you need i have no idea where we would do thatsir professor wirtz said we were working at hechingen and haigerloch in the southwest when the war ended french troops and moroccans with themhe shudderedcaptured the towns and captured us then american soldiers took charge of us and took charge of the uranium we were using hechingen and haigerloch were still in the french zone the french fought heydrichs resisters almost as viciously as the red army didno doubt for many of the same reasons still something might be managedif it had a decent chance of proving worthwhile the uranium is all gone everything is all gone yes wirtz said as the other reclaimed scientists had before him but then as none had before he added except perhaps heydrich leaned forward abruptly enough to make the swivel chair creak under his backside except perhaps what herr doktor professor he asked softly when the amis captured us we were making a new uranium pile the actual word wirtz used was machine a term heydrich had already heard from the other scientists hed questioned the physicist continued we also had about ten grams of radium one of the technicians hid the metal under a crate that had held uranium cubes the americans took the uranium of course but i am sure they did not take the radium as far as i know it is still in hechingen excitement tingled through heydrich radium was potent stuff everybody knew that everybody had known that even before anyone imagined atomic bombs and ten grams that sounded like a lot can you make a bomb with it heydrich asked eagerly nein herr reichsprotektor if you expect me to do that youd better shoot me now it is impossible wirtzs voice was sad but firm he understood the way heydrich thought all right heydrich didnt want to believe him but decided he had no choice if wirtz was lying one of the other physicistsdiebner most likelywould give him away and then heydrich would shoot him he had to understand that well if you cant make a bomb what can you do with ten grams of radium heydrich demanded you must be able to do something useful or you wouldnt have brought it up in the first place let me think wirtz did just that for close to a minute then he said well you know radium is poisonous even in very small doses how small a tenth of a gram a hundredth heydrich asked a poison that strong could make assassinations easier karl wirtz actually smiled much less than that herr reichsprotektor anything more than a tenth of a microgram is considered toxic he helpfully translated the scientific measurement anything more than a tenmillionth of a gram der herr gott im himmel heydrich whispered he did sums in his head and then when he didnt believe the answer did them again on paper ten grams of radium could poison a hundred million people that stuff could kill off everybody still alive in germany with almost enough left over to do in france too theoretically if everything were perfectly efficient wirtz said you couldnt come anywhere close to that for real but we could still do a lot of damage with it heydrich waited impatiently for the physicists response wirtz slowly nodded yes you could i have no doubt of that i am not sure of the best way to go about it though well thats why you and your friends are here heydrichs grin was as wide and inviting as he knew how to make it spring was in the air vladimir bokov was almost back to his old self again everything should have been easy after all hadnt the fascist beasts suffered the most devastating military defeat in the history of the world if they hadnt what was the tremendous victory parade through red square all about where had all those nazi standards and flags that proud soviet soldiers dragged in the dust come from the only trouble was the germans didnt want to admit they were beaten the russian zone in what was left of the shattered reich what had been eastern germany and was now western poland what had been east prussia and was now split between poland and the ussr western czechoslovakia the soviet zone in austriarebellion bubbled everywhere bokov would have suspected the western allies of fomenting the troublethe soviet unions greatest fear had always been that the usa and britain would end up in bed with hitler not stalinif he hadnt known they had troubles of their own they might even have had worse troubles than the ussr did because they put them down less firmly poland and czechoslovakia were kicking out their germans the soviets were doing the same thing in their chunk of east prussia what had been konigsberga town the nazis fought for like grim deathwas now called kaliningrad after one of stalins longtime henchmen reliable russians poured in to replace the germans who were anything but once poland and czechoslovakia were germanfree the uprisings there would fizzle out that delighted bokov less than it might have you couldnt expel all the germans from the soviet zones in germany and austriacould you not even stalin who never thought small seemed ready for that and so the nkvd had to make do with lesser measures hereabouts mass executions avenged slain soviet personnel mass deportations got rid of socially unreliable elementsand often enough of people grabbed at random to fill a quota the survivors needed to understand theyd better not help or shelter fascist bandits all that might have scared some of the remaining germans into staying away from the bandits others though it only cemented to what should have been the dead nazi cause which was why bokov bucketed along in a convoy of half a dozen jeeps on his way south to chemnitz one jeep took the lead four more followed close together the last one did rearguard duty the hope was that the formation would defeat bandits lurking by the side of the autobahn with panzerschreck or panzerfaustor for that matter with nothing fancier than a machine gun bokov certainly hoped the stratagem worked his neck after all was among those on the line here this ploy was new the bandits would take a little while to get used to it after thathe knew his countrymen better than he wished he did they would go on repeating it exactlyand the germans would get used to it and would find some way to beat it then the red army would take too long to figure out what to do differently chemnitz wasnt quite so devastated as dresden had been but angloamerican bombers had visited the saxon city too the old town hall and a red tower that had once been part of the city wall stood out from the sea of rubble in the old town hall worked the burgomeister a cadaverous fellow named max muller good to meet you comrade captain he said shaking bokovs hand he belonged to the social unity party of germany of coursethe russians wouldnt have given him even the semblance of power if he hadnt and he might well have spent the hitler years in russian exile with ulbricht if he so readily recognized bokovs rank badges youve had a string of assassinations here bokov said red army soldiers had established a barbedwire perimeter around the town hall they wanted to keep muller alive if they could he was the fourth burgomeister chemnitz had known since the surrender we have he agreed now sweat glinted on his pale forehead though the day was far from warm he had to be wondering what the heydrichites were plotting nowand who could blame him neither our own resources nor those of the fraternal soviet forces in the area have quelled them he certainly sounded like a good marxistleninist all the same bokovs voice was dry as he asked and what makes you think one more officer will be able to set things right like this he snapped his fingers oh but comrade captain youre not just one officer youre the nkvd muller exclaimed well not all of it bokov said more dryly still he was glad this fritz respected and feared the soviet security apparatus but he meant what hed said before there was only one of him you have the rest behind you muller declared in ringing tones the other nkvd men were probably goddamn glad they were nowhere near chemnitz the place stank of death so did a lot of germany but this was worse a labor gang of germansold men in overalls younger men in wehrmacht rags and women in everything under the sundumped rubble into wheelbarrows and carted it away how many wheelbarrows full of broken bricks and shattered masonry did chemnitz hold how many did all the soviet zone hold how many did all of germany hold how many years would it take to clear them and how big a mountain would they make added together a tall one bokov hoped then he wondered how big a mountain the rubble in the ussr would make leningrad and stalingrad werent much besides rubble these days plenty of cities some of them big ones had changed hands four times not just twice as the nazis fell back theyd destroyed everything they could to keep the red army from using it against them how long would the soviet union take to get over the mauling the fascist hyenas had given it vladimir bokov scowled not liking the answer that formed in his mind germany had caught hell no doubt about it but even though the red army finally drove the invaders off with their tails between their legs it was plain the ussr had caught whatever was worse than hell how many dead twenty million thirty somewhere between one and the other probably but bokov would have bet nobody could have said where he kneweverybody knew even if it wasnt something you talked aboutthe germans had inflicted far more casualties on the red army than the other way around but that wasnt all that was barely the beginning the germans had slaughtered jews commissars intellectuals generally would the ussrs intelligentsia ever be the same and so many civilians had starved or died of disease or simply disappeared under german occupation it wasnt all onesided the labor gang dug up an arm bone with some stinking flesh still clinging to it as nonchalantly as if such things happened every day and no doubt they did or more often than that a scrawny old geezer with a white mustache shoveled the ruined fragment of humanity into a wheelbarrow with the rest of the wreckage one of the women in the gang sent bokov a look full of vitriol he stared back stonily and she was the first to drop her eyes he and the red army hadnt had anything to do with this death it lay in the angloamericans ledger captain bokov only wished the bombing had done more and done it sooner then fewer soviet citizens might have died the woman muttered something the nkvd man didnt catch by the way several of the other germans nodded she was bound to be lucky he couldnt hear her he thought about seizing her anyway and the laborers whod nodded he could rounding up a few red army men to take them away would be a matter of moments the only question was whether it would be worthwhile it would teach these germans they couldnt flout soviet authority but it would also make their friends and familieswho wouldnt understand the progressive soviet line toward provocationsmore likely to throw in with the heydrichites or at least to keep silent about their banditry that calculation made bokov stalk off instead of yelling for russian soldiers it also made him stop in dismay a few paces later if he was calculating about the heydrichites as if they were serious enemiesfuck my mother he exclaimed if he was thinking of them that way then they really were diehards fanatics banditsnames like those minimized them they were enemy combatants and this was still a war lou weissberg didnt speak french captain jean desroches didnt speak english they were both fluent in german lou felt the irony he couldnt tell what if anything desroches felt the french intelligence officer had a formidable poker face hechingen somethings up with hechingen lou said auf deutsch and what would that be desroches inquired i dont exactly know lou answered but a couple of the fanatics weve caught lately have talked about it i dont mean men we caught together eitherone we nabbed up near frankfurt and the other by munich so somethings going on unless they want you to think something is while they really strike somewhere else desroches said i meanhechingen he rolled his eyes the most noaccount excuse for a town god ever made i dont know much about the place lou admitted but ill tell you something you may not knowhechingen is where the german nuclear physicists got captured you mean before heydrichs salauds captured them back desroches used one word of french but lou had little trouble figuring out what it meant his opposite number went on besides what difference does that make now i dont know what difference it makes lou was getting tired of saying he didnt know even if he didnt but its liable to make some and you guys ought to be on your toes on account of it you tend to your zone lieutenant desroches said icily we will handle ours we can send some men if youre short lou offered he knew hed made a mistake even before the words finished coming out of his mouth poker face or no captain desroches gave the impression of a bluehaired matron whod just been asked to do something obscene that will not be necessary he said after a moment as if feeling that wasnt enough he added you offer an insult to a sovereign and independent power monsieur i didnt mean to lou said instead of something like will you for gods sake come off it france threw its weight around as if it wouldve had any weight to throw around if the united states and britainde gaulles scorned anglosaxonshadnt saved its bacon but you couldnt tell that to any frenchman not unless you really wanted to piss him off lou didnt have the nerve to ask desroches how he came to know german so well life in france had beencomplicated from to the frenchman lit a cigarette one of his own a gauloise to lou the damn thing smelled like smoldering horseshit he fired up a chesterfield in selfdefense through the clouds of smoke desroches said i will take you at your word everything about the way he glared at lou shouted you lying son of a bitch since lou was lying or at least stretching the truth he couldnt call desroches on it he said if you dont want our soldiers we dont desroches broke in you dont have to use them lou went on as if the other man hadnt spoken but do keep an eye on hechingen if anything happens there i sure hope youll let us know my superiorsall the way up to general eisenhowersure hope you will is that a threat desroches demanded what will happen if we dont im only a lieutenant i dont make policy but the people above me said it could be important enough to affect how much aid france gets lou eyed captain desroches who was wearing usissue combat boots and a us army olivedrab uniform with french rank badges most of the french army was similarly equipped from boots to helmets to m rifles to sherman tanks though they were also using some captured german panthers french soldiers ate us cand krations and slept in us pup tents desroches followed lous gaze down himself he went red you americans have the arrogance of power he said aw bullshit lou said in english as hed figured captain desroches got that just fine in german lou went on hitler had the arrogance of power if we had it you guys would be going heil truman right now desroches turned redder he stubbed out his foul cigarette and lit another one perhaps you are right i phrased it badly i should have said that you americans have the arrogance of wealth that did hit closer to the mark lou was damned if hed admit it we have some worries about hechingenthats what we have france and the usa are allies ja we pass the worries on to you the way allies are supposed to if anything happens there we hope youre ready and we hope youll let us knowthe way allies are supposed to captain desroches sent up more smoke signals i will take this report back to my superiors and we will dowhatever we do thank you for thisvery interesting session lieutenant good day he got up and stamped out of lous crowded little nuremberg office boy that was fun lou said to nobody in particular dealing with the french was more enjoyable than a root canal but not much he went to captain franks office down the hall frank was talking to a german gendarmewho also wore mostly usissue uniform though dyed blackand waved for him to wait lou cooled his heels in the hallway for fifteen minutes or so then the jerry came out looking unhappy lou went in nu frank asked lou summarized his exchange with desroches his superior muttered to himself you sure we were on the same side thats what folks say lou answered are they going to pay any attention to hechingen captain frank asked my guess is its about fiftyfifty sir lou said they sure are touchy bastards arent they oh maybe a little frank said they both laughed but neither smiled other thing is sir we dont know for sure the fanaticsll hit hechingen and we dont know for sure the froggiesll tell us if they do lou said uhhuh aint we got fun frank tacked on another mirthless laugh gotta be something to do with the damn bomb scientists doesnt it looks that way to me lou agreed thats where we grabbed those guys in the first place but it could be something else i guess if theyve got a big old stash of mortar rounds or panzerfausts or something outside of town they might be all hot and bothered about those instead yeah they might howard frank didnt sound as if he believed it well lou didnt either xv jerry duncan got back to anderson whenever he could he got to see his wife betsy more that way theyd been married for going on thirty years and still got on well and hed long since decided that any congressman who turned washington into his fulltime home town deserved to lose his next electionand probably would he also knew he was liable to lose his next election anyhow the democrats were putting up a decorated and twicewounded veteran named douglas catledge even though it was still spring catledges posters and signs were everywhere vote catledge they shouted support our president support our troops when jerry spoke at the local american legion hall he met that one headon anybody who says i dont support our troops is a liar he declared its just that simple folks i dont support keeping our troops in the wrong place at the wrong time for all the wrong reasons im afraid harry truman does we did what we needed to do in germany to do what truman wants well need soldiers there for the next fifty years if thats what youve got in mind youd better vote for the democrats but ill tell you what i think i think its no accident they use a donkey to stand for their party he got a few chuckles and more than a few smiles plenty of the guys who hung around the hall had known him for years after he made his speech everybody went to the bar and hoisted a few a younger guy wearing a ruptured duck on the lapel of his tweed jacket stuck a forefinger in jerrys chest and declared the germans deserve every goddamn thing that happened to them i was there i sawhell mr duncan you dont want to know most of what i saw he gulped down his highball i dont say they dont ive never said they dont jerry answered what i do say is our boys dont deserve whats happening to them in germany right now we won the war we knocked the nazis flat isnt that enough they arent knocked flat enough the newly returned soldier said he hurried back to the bar and reloaded then he planted himself in front of jerry duncan again they wont cause any more trouble now duncan said confidently they cant weve got the atomic bomb and they dont if they get out of linewham we blow em off the map what about the russians asked the guy with the ruptured duck well what about the russians jerry said confidently if you believe general groves itll be years and years before they figure out how to make an atom bombif they ever do and they wont let germany get too big for its britches either mmmaybe the younger man didnt sound convinced he jabbed a forefinger at jerry again and you waste too much time with that crazy mcgraw gal before jerry could answer that a middleaged guy in a chambray shirt and dungarees spun the youngster toward him diana mcgraw isnt crazy my daughter graduated high school with her boy pat ive known her and ed since dirt he fought the krauts the last goround same as me and hes been at delcoremy ever since and dianahow do you expect her to feel when her only son gets bumped off after the goddamn wars supposed to be over and done with supposed to be is right thanks art jerry said any time jerry art answered me i dunno if id go whole hog the way diana went and did but heyive got girls they didnt have to head out and get their asses shot off uh pardon my french maybe the new vet said again then he went off to finish the fresh highball somewhere else art laughed we whipsawed him you and me i guess we did jerry agreed that wasnt exactly what hed had in mind showing the other guy he was wrongor showing him hed get popped in the snoot if he kept mouthing offwasnt how you won his vote you made him like you if he liked you he wouldnt care whether you kept a cashbox marked bribes on your desk back in washington hed vote for you because he thought you were a good fellow and he wouldnt need any better reason hell there was no better reason another man one more of jerrys vintage came over to him and said yknow i hate like the dickens to cut and run in germany if you make a mistake dont you try and get out from under it jerry said if what were doing in germany isnt a mistake what would you call it ron ron grinnedthe congressman remembered his name jerry remembered a gazillion names but his constituents didnt think about that they just noticed that he remembered theirs jerry nodded to himself make them like you he repeated silently nothing made somebody like you more than recalling his name it made him seem important in your eyesregardless of whether he really was well we did mess up some ron allowed now oh maybe a little jerry allowed in another tone of voice it would have been polite agreement the way he said it it sounded more like the understatement of the year several of the guys standing around laughed two or three though scowled instead one of them made a point of turning his back on jerry in nazi germany or red russia that kind of rudeness would have bought him a ticket to a concentration camp or maybe to a firing squad in anderson indiana it only meant he wouldnt vote republican when the election rolled around as far as jerry was concerned that was bad enough he wasnt ready to hang out his shingle and go back to practicing law even if he would make more money here in anderson than he did in washington politics was as addictive as morphine to jerry it had a sharper kick too a private stuck his head into lou weissbergs office sir theres a frenchy outside who wants to talk to you the kid said yeah lou set down his pen does he speaka da english no sir but he had a piece of paper with your name written on it hes a skinny guy looks kinda mean yknow got a scar right here the private ran a finger along the side of his jaw ah okay i know who he is lou was depressingly aware he might make a good target for heydrichs fanatics but if that wasnt captain desroches the nazis had come up with somebody who could play him in the movies you want i should bring him in the gi asked lou pushed back his swivel chair nah ill go out there and talk to him any excuse to get outside is a good one spring was in the air so was the stench of death which winter chill had muted but lou ignored that pigeons and house sparrows hopping on the rubblestrewn street crowded hopefully around his boots looking for handouts starlings in shiny breeding plumage trilled from any high spot they could find he might have seen and heard the like back in new jersey he wished like anything he were back in jersey but he wasnt so so he watched storks build a big untidy nest of sticks on top of a chimney he wouldnt have seen that in new jersey and neither would roger tory peterson captain desroches by his expression didnt give two whoops in hell about spring pigeons sparrows starlings or storks the gauloise he was puffing on insulated him from the death reek though it might have smelled worse lou wondered why the frenchmen had ridden all the way to nuremberg as soon as desroches saw him lou stopped wondering the french officers face lit up in an itoldyouso sneer it couldnt possibly be anything else and it wasnt a good day to you herr oberleutnant desroches said in his gallic german i have for you news from hechingen guten tag herr hauptmann lou answered resignedly tell me the news whatever it is there was indeed a fearsome raid by these vicious and savage german renegades desroches was as good at the mockepic as anybody this side of alexander pope im glad you survived mockepic was beyond lou sarcastic he could manage even in german oh yes a great relief the terrible monsters struckthe rubbish heap outside the building where some of the nazi scientists got seized last year captain desroches stubbed out his butt and started another smoke screen a sparrow darted in to grab the dogend then spat it out after one taste lous sympathies were with the bird before long though some german would gladly scavenge the butt collect three or four of them and you could roll one nasty cigarette of your own and either smoke it or use it to buy something you needed more but that was by the way did the fanatics get anything lou demanded rubbish i assume desroches inhaled till his already hollow cheeks looked downright skulllike what else is there in a rubbish heap well i dont exactly know that was truer than lou wished it were nobody above him wanted to tell him much about what went into making an atomic bomb he couldnt blame his superiors for that but ignorance made his job harder maybe youd better tell your story to captain frank desroches exhaled an exasperated cloud of smoke this is a waste of my time lieutenant if you wasted enough time to drive to nuremberg and gloat you can damn well waste a little more come on they glared at each other in perfect mutual loathing but captain desroches came hello lou captain frank said when weissberg led the french intelligence officer into his cubbyhole whos your friend sir this is captain desroches he doesnt speak english but hes fine with german lou answered in the latter tongue he nodded to desroches please tell captain frank the story you just told me if you insist desroches had the air of a man humoring an obvious lunatic he gave frank the tale almost wordforword the way lou had heard it but for the warning from your bright young lieutenant here he finished plainly meaning anything but we never would have noticed the garbagehounds at all as things were we fired a few shots they fired a few shots and then they ran away it was i assure you nothing to get excited about captain frank didnt look assured you say this was outside the place where the german scientists got caught yes i do say that but so what any comic who wanted to play a frenchman on the stage would have studied desroches shrug a scientists rubbish is no different from anyone elses nicht wahr i dont know about thatbut i think id better find out as far as lou could tell captain frank didnt know much more about atom bombs than he did himself the french captain watched alertly as frank spoke lou suspected desroches followed more english than he let on after talking with somebody captain frank hung up and called someone else he told desroches story over again there was a long long pause at the other end of the line then whoever was there shouted son of a motherfucking bitch lou heard it loud and clear so did captain desroches who raised an eyebrow it must have damn near blown out franks eardrum the other officer went on at lower volume for some little while captain frank listened he scribbled a couple of notes when he finally rang off he nodded to captain desroches well thank you for bringing the news now we know what were up against anyhow which is desroches inquired acidly howard frank looked right through him lou admired that look and wanted to practice it in front of a mirror it would cow every rude waiter and sales clerk ever born sorry but i cant tell you frank said you havent got the clearance or the need to know this is an outrage desroches was almost as loud as the fellow whod talked with frank on the phone lou looked for him to breathe flame or for steam to pour out of his ears you have no right i have my orders captain frank replied im sure you understand im sure you understand you can fuck off he meant desroches called him several things in german captain frank only smiled blandly desroches switched to french lou hadnt thought french was much of a language to cuss in he discovered hed never heard an expert before captain desroches sounded electrifying or possibly electrified captain frank never lost his smile when the frenchman slowed down a little frank said et vous et votre mere aussi even lou could figure out what that meant desroches stormed out he slammed the door behind him it didnt fly off its hinges but not from lack of effort wow lou said listening to desroches roar down the corridor like a tornado with shoulder boards then he asked so what was that all about i talked with this guy named samuel goudsmit hes a colonel i thinksome kind of science officer frank said goudsmit lou said musingly kraut dutchman captain frank replied and now i know what the fanatics were afterwhat it looks like they got nu lou said ten grams of radium goudsmit says the physicists snatched it there when we grabbed them and one of them mustve blabbed to heydrich fuck lou muttered then he asked how can goudsmit know that when the german big brains were in england they were wired for sound only they didnt know it a couple of them talked about this radium fuck lou said again if we knew about it how come we didnt go in there ourselves and take it away good questiondamn good frank said best answer i can give you is we didnt want to tip off the frogs that they were sitting on something important lou clapped a hand to his forehead gevalt and so the nazis get it instead aint that a kick in the nuts what can heydrich do with the shit like i know i told you once already i aint no einstein captain frank said but youve gotta figure they think they can do something anyhow otherwise they wouldnt have gone after it right right lou said glumly can they make a bomb with it beats me frank held up a hand no i take that back i bet they cant we used bs to clobber hiroshima and nagasaki so those bombs musta been big old mothers ten grams isnt much its likewhat half an ounce not even so i figure no way in hell they make it go boom you think im wrong well the way you say it it makes sense but im no sliderule jockey either lou said if they cant make a bomb out of it what can they do captain franks shrug wasnt so elaborate as captain desroches but it got the message across goudsmit says hell let our guys with the thick glasses know about it well see where we go from there thats all from there or from wherever the fanatics take us after a moment lou added too bad we didnt trust our own allies with the news about the radium uhhuh howard frank nodded but if all these frenchmen are like desroches you can see how come we didnt too diana mcgraw wondered when a secretary of state had last made a speech in indianapolis she wondered whether a secretary of state had ever made a speech in indianapolis before a secretary of agriculture or a secretary of commerce possiblyprobably even but state indianapolis wasnt where you went when you talked about foreign policy only now it was and diana knew why too or thought she did would james byrnes have come here if she didnt live in nearby anderson would he have talked about germany here if she hadnt started the movement to get americans out of the defeated country she was sure he wouldnt have you dropped a bucket of water where something was already burning didnt you secretary byrnes spoke inside the indiana national guard armory a formidable pile of yellowbrown brickthe color of diarrhea actuallyup on north pennsylvania nobodyd advertised his speech in the papers no one on the radio had mentioned that he would be there so what diana thought she had connections now shed known for most of a week that byrnes would be here and so she and her cohorts marched outside the armory these past months shed grown intimately familiar with the way a picket signs stick pressed against your collarbone as you paraded her sign today said how many more will die for nothing bloody red letters on a white background boredlooking cops stood by the entrance to make sure her people didnt try to go inside and disrupt the meeting of the indiana internationalists or whoever they were byrnes stooges trumans stooges diana thought scornfully the cops were bored because theyd seen she and her people played by the rules she would have loved to storm the podium in there she would have loved to scream at secretary byrnes come to that she would have loved to chuck a grenade at him but going over the line like that lost supporters not drawing to an inside straight ed called it diana played bridge not poker but she understood what her husband meant the indiana internationalistsor whoever they werehad rigged up loudspeakers so the pickets could hear the secretary of state even if they werent allowed inside maybe they thought wise words of wisdom spoken wisely would show the poor heathens out on the sidewalk the error of their ways and lead them back to the true faith if they did they were even dumber than diana gave them credit for she wouldnt have believed such a thing was possible but hey you never could tell we will not forsake europe heard through big cheap speakers james byrnes voice grated unpleasantly i want no misunderstanding we will not shirk our duty we are staying there people inside the armory applauded people outside booed for a while diana couldnt make out what the secretary of state was saying she shrugged which made the stick shift against her dress what difference did it make whether she heard or not anybody who spoke for the government would be telling lies anyhow when the noise subsided byrnes was continuing in the same vein in the united states was forced into the first world war after that war we refused to join the league of nations we thought we could stay out of europes wars and we lost interest in the affairs of europe what a buncha baloney ed mcgraw yelled from right behind diana marching back and forth hurt his poor tornup foot but hed come along tonight she was the one who drew the attention though what do you think of the secretary of states speech so far e a stuart asked her poising pencil above notebook to await her reply its nothing we havent heard before its nothing we havent heard way too often before diana answered the truman administration is going to do whatever it wants to do and it wont pay any attention to what the little man wants to what the people want the reporters shorthand spread pothooks and squiggles across the page how do you propose to change his policies by showing him he has no popular support by winning lots of seats for people who oppose his occupation policies in november diana said james byrnes voice kept on blaring from the tinny loudspeakers we will not again make that mistake we have helped to organize the united nations we believe it will stop aggressor nations from starting wars the american people want to help the german people to win their way back to an honorable place among the free and peaceloving nations of the world more applause inside more boos outside diana turned to e a stuart whenever the president or one of his flunkies talks about what the american people want theyre really talking about what harry truman wants stuart wrote down the quote without slowing up diana stopped then because she wanted to tell the reporter something else keep moving there one of the cops called setting a hand on his billy club she kept moving she didnt want to give the police any excuse to get rough as she marched she bitterly added how peaceloving do the german people seem to you mr stuart they have their ups and downs all right stuart agreed so did the secretary of state after his series of polite phrases he got down to the meat of his speech so it seemed to diana anyhow though she wasnt so sure byrnes would have agreed the united states is not about to abandon europe he declared security forces will probably have to remain in germany for a long period some of you will know that we have offered a proposal for a treaty with the major powers to enforce peace for twentyfive or even forty years there diana pounced she felt as if the enemyfor so she thought of james byrneshad delivered himself into her hands did you hear that mr stuart did you hes talking about american soldiers in germany in forty years from now thats what truman really wants he did say that i heard it wonder filled e a stuarts voice he scribbled some more as he walked beside diana weve got another guy listening inside but i cant afford to let that get by forty years from now oh boy not everybody seemed to have caught it maybe most people out here werent listening so closely or maybe they just didnt want to believe what theyd heard how could you imagine trying to hold germany down in didnt you have to be a little bit nuts or more than a little bit to think you could get away with something like that for so long of course you did diana mcgraw had no doubts on that score why jesus himself hadnt lived for forty years if god wouldnt have been able to hold things together that long who did harry s truman think he was somebody in a studebaker driving up pennsylvania honked and yelled goddamn commies a moment later somebody driving down pennsylvania really leaned on his horn and shouted you stinking nazis diana laughed doesnt that bother you e a stuart asked her not any more it used to but now i dont care she answered truthfully if some people think were reds and some people think were nazis chances are were really right where i want us to bein the middle were the genuine americans the ones who screech at us theyre the lunatic fringe huh that was one of the more thoughtful grunts diana had ever heard inside secretary byrnes finally finished his speech the blind fools whod sat there listening to all that hot airso they seemed to diana anyhowgave him a big hand to get one like that after such a speech he had to be the best hypnotist sincewhat was the name of that character in the potboiler novel theyd made a silent movie about him too diana grinned as she dredged it up the phantom of the opera thats who he was james byrnes didnt want to play the phantom of the armory as truman had in washington he came out to talk to the people protesting his policies city policemen and khakiuniformed state troopers with drillsergeant hats surrounded him but loosely experience had taught them that diana and her group wouldnt try anything drastic experience had its virtues if you relied on it too much though you murderer a woman screamed and hurled herself at the secretary of state how much american bloods on your hands she had bloodor more likely red paintall over hers she left james byrnes with one messy scarlet handprint on his jacket and another on his white shirt and necktie before she could do anything else to himif she had anything else in mindthe startled police officers woke up and wrestled her to the ground youre under arrest an indianapolis policeman yelled assault on a federal official a state trooper added thats a felony another trooper rounded on diana clear your people out of here right now lady he snapped they stick around well run em in for conspiring with this gal here that goes for you too well go diana said i dont know who that woman isi want you to know that i never saw her before yeah id say the same thing if i was in your shoes the state trooper retorted that doesnt make it true and even if it iswell so what you go around talking nonsense all the time of course youll draw the loonies a magnet picks up nails right we arent talking nonsense diana said indignantly were you there better believe it i was lucky i just got a little crease in my uh backside my brother matt lost a leg we run home now well only have to do it all over again before too long i dont think so diana said and the war isnt over no matter what kind of papers the germans signed a year ago were already doing it all over again cant you see thats wrong no hostility roughened the troopers voice he glanced down at his wristwatch you and your chowderheads have one minute to get lost after that we start arresting people one minute fromnow fiftyninefiftyeight chowderheads diana exploded but thanks to that woman whod gone too far whoever she was the trooper had the law on his side and diana was bitterly certain the cops would seize the excuse to keep a closer eye on her people whenever they tried to march she wanted to cry she wanted to swear all she could do was retreat bernie cobb drove one of the middle jeeps in a convoy bound from erlangen up to frankfurt the americans had taken longer than the russians to adopt that approach but it seemed to workas well as anything did a jeep traveling alone in germany was in deadly danger as general patton could have testified if he were in a position to testify about anything a jeep in the middle of a convoy was just in danger german pows cleared brush and shrubs back from the sides of the road gis with grease guns guarded them we shoulda started doin that a long time ago drawled bernies passenger an ordnance sergeant named toby benton if they cant hide they cant shoot their goddamn rockets at us hot damn bernie said so they lay back a few hundred yards and cut us into dogmeat with their goddamn spandaus instead is that better some sergeant benton said he looked very ready to use the jeeps machine gun a big beautifulcaliber piece it outranged and outshot any german mg but the son of a bitch behind a spandau could wait in ambush till he found a target he liked squeeze off a burst and then disappear clearing roadside bushes back a hundred yards would make things tougher for assholes with a panzerschreck or panzerfaust it wouldnt come within miles of curing all the americans problems here which reminded berniehow come they want you up in frankfurt anyway benton only shrugged some kind of rumor that the fanatics planted a bomb in our settlement there im supposed to check it out if anybody can find that kind of shit im the guy he spoke like a master plumber he was the fellow other plumbers called when they couldnt find a leak or fix one themselves you really that good bernie was impressed in spite of himself ive been doin it since before the surrender and im still in one piece so are a bunch of other guys benton answered the krauts theyre pretty sneaky but ive learned to be sneaky the same way sounds good to me bernie swerved around a freshly repaired pothole maybe the fix was legit or maybe it concealed a land mine sure as hell the diehards were pretty sneaky he noticed every jeep in front of him had also dodged the pothole either the ones behind him also swerved or else it really was okay because nothing went boom things not going boom was one of the sweetest sounds bernie had ever heard he hadnt been up to frankfurt before erlangen hadnt suffered badly during the war nuremberg had frankfurt was bigger than nurembergsay about the size of pittsburgh or st louis it looked as if god had stomped on the town and then ground in his heel and so he had except hed used bs and bs and lancasters instead of a milelong boot boy oh boy bernie said you look at a place like this you wonder how anybody lived through the bombing people always do toby benton said i guess maybe thats how come we made the atom bomb drop one of those suckers and thats all she wrote id drop one on heydrich in a redhot minute if itd stop all the crap weve gone through bernie said the ordnance sergeant nodded bernie couldnt think of a single dogface in germany who wouldnt make that deal he honked his horn to warn the jerries in a labor gang to get out of his way they stepped aside though none of them moved any faster than he had to regulations said german men werent supposed to wear wehrmacht uniform any more but these guys either hadnt got the news or more likely didnt have anything else they were skinny and palehell most of them looked greenand badly shaven some master race huh benton said you betcha bernie agreed looking down your nose at the germans was easyunless one of the bastards carried an antitank rocket or had dynamite and nails under his raggedy tunic or drove a truck full of explosive till he found a bunch of gis all together and pressed down on the firing button wired to his steering wheel hausfraus queued patiently for cabbages or potatoes or whatever the guy in the shop was doling out most of them looked shabbier than their menfolk theyd got even less in the way of clothes than german soldiers had the stuff they were wearing was falling to pieces and years out of style and had been dumpy to begin with a couple of them had on cutdown feldgrauprobably the only cloth they owned their complexions were also fishbelly pale a few of them had put on rouge and mascara it made things worse not betterbernie thought of so many madeup corpses a block or two farther on a buxom young fraulein walked hand in hand with a gi nothing wrong with her complexion by godshe was radiantly pink she had meat on her bones too luxuriantly curved meat her dress didnt cover all that much of her and clung to what it did cover the american soldier on whom she bestowed her favors looked as if hed invented herbut not even thomas edison was that smart some hardass mp spots them hell get in trouble for fraternizing sergeant benton said worth it bernie declared the ordnance specialist didnt try to tell him he was wrong right in the middle of frankfurt behind a barbedwire fence nine feet high was another world the army had built what amounted to an american suburb for something close to a thousand families of us occupation officials and highranking officers close to half a million germans lived in postwar misery all around them but they had it as good as they would have back in the statesbetter because they couldnt have afforded servants there except for those servants the enclave was offlimits to germans electricity ran twentyfour hours a day there not two hours a day as it did in the rest of frankfurt the enclave boasted movie theaters beauty shops a gas station a supermarket a community center and anything else the homesick yankee soul might desire holy moses bernie said as he drove up to the gate in front of the guardhouse no wonder they keep this place behind barbed wire if you were a kraut you wouldnt need to be one of heydrichs goons to want to blow it to kingdom come yeah thats crossed my mind a time or three too toby benton agreed but if youre just a little guy like us what can you do about it try and make sure the fanatics dont sneak in any bombsthats all i can see and thats what im here for guards inspected the jeep with microscopic care before they let it into the enclave the kids playing there didnt wear rags they didnt look as if a strong breeze would blow them away fords and de sotos rolled along the clean rubblefree streets bernie wondered for a second where the hell he really was yeah if the jerries saw thisbut bernie cobb shook his head if they dont like what theyve got now they shouldnt have lined up behind hitler back then he thought xvi vladimir bokov watched germans go back and forth between the russian and american zones in berlin the spectacle struck him as too anarchic for comfort he turned to moisei shteinberg comrade colonel we need to tighten this up he said people we should keep can get into one of the western allies berlin zones easy as you please and from there they can leave the soviet zone of germany altogether and the western allies have such bad security bandits can hide in their zones for as long as they want then they cross over and attack us shteinberg nodded captain bokov hadnt expected anything else no nkvd man could go far wrong talking about the need to tighten up and shteinberg worried about things bokov hadnt even thought of it wouldnt surprise me if the angloamericans let heydrichs hyenas move about freely in their zones here there always was talk about the usa and britain lining up with the hitlerites against the soviet union da there was bokov agreed no nkvd man could go far wrong by assuming all the enemies of the ussr were plotting together either if we have to we ought to build a wall between our zone and theirs to make sure only the proper people pass from one to the other id like that shteinberg said id like blockading the western allies berlin zones to force them out of here even better they didnt spend their blood taking this city we did it should be ours by right of conquest but but what bokov said thats a wonderful idea sir we ought to do it we ought to start right away unfortunately the international situation does not permit it believe me comrade captain ive had discussions with our superiors about this shteinberg sighed mournfully they fear deviating from the fourpower agreement on berlin would touch off a war the militarys judgmentand the politburosis that we cant afford one now well bokov had trouble arguing with that anyone whod seen what the fight against the nazis had done to the soviet union would yes eastern europe obeyed marshal stalins every wish and busily remade itself on the soviet model yes the hammerandsickle flag flew in berlin but oh the price of planting it here and there is another concern shteinberg continued inexorably if we fight the united states we risk the atom bomb till we also have this weapon we have to be more cautious than we would if it did not exist well that also made more sense than captain bokov wished it did how long till we build our own i dont know volodya shteinberg said with a shrug till the americans used one i never dreamt anything like that was possible im sure our people are doing everything they can oh so am i bokov exclaimed if all the free physicists in the ussr and all the ones whod gone into the gulag for one reason or another or for no reason at allnobody knew better than an nkvd man that you didnt always need a reason to end up in a camp werent working twentyonehour days in pursuit of uranium he would have been astonished and we will have taken some german physicists back to the motherland im sure the same as weve taken some rocket engineers shteinberg said bokov nodded no doubt everybody knows the german rocket engineers are good thoughthe americans have grabbed the ones we didnt but the fascists couldnt make an atom bomb a good thing too or they would have used it on us his superior broke in that seemed too likely even to rate a nod bokov went on with his own train of thought how good are their physicists how much can they help us if they cant theyll be sorry cold anticipation filled shteinbergs voice a german brought to the ussr who earned his keep might get good treatment a german who didntwas gulag fodder if he died in a camp well the gulags never ran short of bodies but bokov found something else to worry about what about the physicists the heydrichites snatched up the ones england turned loose in germany he said how much harm can they do theyre probably better men than the ones we took he was resigned to the fact that the more capable german scientists and engineers had wanted to get captured by the angloamericans not the red army they cant make heydrich a bomb shteinberg sounded completely confident about that and if they cant make him a bomb theyre a nuisance a propaganda coup an embarrassment to what passes for englands security system we understand propaganda so do the fascist jackalshitler made a point of it in mein kampf but the angloamericans bokov shook his head only when it bites them he went on do you think the bandits can actually make them take their troops out of the zones they occupy the last thing we need is a germany where the nazis are running free again you think so do you shteinbergs irony had as many barbs as a porcupines quill he was an nkvd man he was a soviet citizen though no doubt officially an unbeliever he was a jew even jews who didnt believe remained jews like most russians bokov was convinced of that the colonel continued i have no idea what the angloamericans will do next i often think they have no idea what theyll do next but if they should walk away from the occupation bokov persisted what do we do then moisei shteinbergs gaze put bokov in mind of murmansk winter the junior officer was glad it wasnt aimed straight at him in that case shteinberg said quietly we do whatever we have to do no no no a democratic congressman said exasperation filling his voice no one is talking about pulling american troops out of germany and if the distinguished gentleman from new york doesnt think anybody is talking about bringing our boys home from germany i suggest that hed better pull his head out of the sand a republican broke in bang sam rayburn rapped loudly for order that will be enough of that the speaker of the house declared as a matter of fact thats too much of that sorry mr speaker the republican sounded anything but still he observed the forms its getting rough jerry duncan thought after pearl harbor foreign policy had been thoroughly bipartisan before pearl harbor with the exception of a few warrelated measures like lendlease foreign policy had barely been on the houses radar screen and nobodyd ever heard of radar but now the two sides were going at each other like a bucket of crawdads thank you mr speaker the democrat from new york said pointedly if i may take up my remarks from the point where i was interruptedno one is talking about pulling our troops out of germany and even if we were to remove them for any reason the russians would not proceed to occupy the western zones i can guarantee that because he got interrupted again by a different republican this time how can you guarantee it who told you god gods the only one who knows what the reds are liable to do next bang speaker rayburn wielded the gavel again if you let the gentleman finish maybe hell tell you how he can guarantee it thank you mr speaker the democrat repeated as a matter of fact i was about to do that the russians wont invade western germany because we will drive them out with atom bombs if necessary or maybe well just let them keep it another democrat put in we know we can deal with uncle joeweve been doing it since but does anybody want to let the nazis get up off the mat after all we did to knock em flat thats what taking our troops out of germany means whether you like it or not jerry muttered under his breath that was the administrations trump card truman and his backers tried to make anybody who favored removing troops from germany seem pronazi as far as jerry was concerned it wasnt even slightly fair mr speaker he called jumping to his feet mr duncan has the floor sam rayburn intoned thank you mr speaker the problem is thousands of our men are getting killed and maimed for no good reason thousands mr speaker more than a year after this war was alleged to be over and for what for what are we one inch closer to putting down the german fanatics than we were the day after what was called ve day if we are wheres the evidence are you asking me mr duncan rayburn inquired i am not a military man nor do i pretend to be i understand that mr speaker jerry said but the military men have no answers either they say soandso many fanatics have been killed soandso many bunkers have been uncovered and soandso many weapons have been captured or destroyed and i say soandso what they dont say the fanatics will quit any time soon they dont say the fanatics will quit at allwhich seems wise because they show no signs of quitting but if these men show no signs of quitting if we cant put them down what are we doing there besides wasting american lives and american taxpayers money i mean i will speak to that the democrat from new york said by all means rayburn told him please go ahead thank you mr speaker the new yorker said he had even more reason to be polite than jerry did jerry was on the other side he wouldnt get anything out of sam rayburn no matter what but a democrat who offended the speaker of the house could find himself almost as unhappy about his office space and his committee assignments as your runofthemill republican like a lot of politicians rayburn had a long memory for slights the democrat from new york turned to jerry duncan what were currently doing in our occupation zoneand what our allies are doing in theirsis very simple we are preventing heydrich and the nazis from taking over germany again president truman thinks thats a job worth doing i agree with him it was certainly the strongest argument the democrats had nobody in the united stateshell nobody in his right mindhad a good word to say about the nazis is this the best way to do that though is this even close to the best way jerry asked we were supposed to have knocked the nazis over the head last may how long will we have to stay in germany the secretary of state talked about forty years do you want your grandsons shot at by german partisans in do you think the american people will put up with spending forty years and god knows how many billions of dollars trying to drain a running sore if we leave heydrich wins do you want that the new yorker said if we stay we throw away thousandtens of thousandsof lives and those billions of dollars do you want that jerry countered we cant let the fanatics drive us out the democrat said we cant let them bleed us white either jerry duncan said they pick their spots they plant mines under a road or bombs in wreckage beside it our boys cant pick up an ashtray without being afraid itll blow up in their hand they cant take a drink without being afraid its poisonedlook what the fanatics did to the russians on new years eve and when one of those maniacs with a truckload of explosives blows himself up he costs heydrich one man he doesnt cost him a truck cause thats one of ours stolen he takes out anywhere from a dozen to a hundred gis and we cant stop it by all the signs we cant even slow it down are you looking forward to forty more years of that by the look on the democratic congressmans face he was looking forward to getting the hell out of there and having a long stiff drinkor maybe three or four long stiff drinks we are paying a price he said sam rayburn jerked like a man whod just found out he had a flea in his shorts democrats werent even supposed to admit that much doing his best to make amends the new yorker hurriedly went on but wed pay a much higher price if we cut and run we might pay the price of world war iii so youre saying its worthwhile to go right on bleeding till jerry asked i dont believe well have to do that or anything like that the democrat from new york said i think we can defeat the fanatics in a reasonable amount of time i think we will too jerry pounced then youd favor a timetable for getting all our troops out of germany i didnt say that the new yorker squawked sure sounded like you did jerry said by sam rayburns glower he felt the same way president truman has said a timeline is unacceptable i agree with him a timeline just tells the enemy how long he has to wait before he wins the democrat from new york said in that case you dont really believe we can lick heydrichs goons in some reasonable time jerry said you believe well still be stuck there when that time is up and you know what i think we will too so whats the point of waiting around and taking more casualties lets bring the boys home now several people listening to the debate up in the gallery started to applaud sam rayburn used his gavel order order he called they went on clapping he banged the gavel some more we must have order he declared i will have the gallery cleared if this continues slowly the people whod applauded quieted down jerry figured hed made his point at least to them the unhappy look on the new york democrats face said he did too wow lou weissberg eyed the swarms of gis with grease guns and ms the halftracks and the pershing heavy tanks surrounding the nuremberg jail mustang fighters roared low overhead we couldve captured half of germany with a force this big yeah well howard frank let his voice trail off he needed a few seconds to find a way to say what he was thinking when he did it turned out to be bleakly blackly cynical look how much all our security helped old adenauer lou grunted in a way that was applicable in another way it wasnt heydrichs goons wanted adenauer dead you gotta figure theyll try a rescue here if they try anything at all who knows who the hell knows anything any more captain frank said wearily weve given em a big concentration of our own troops to shoot at and an asshole with a mortar is awful hard to catch another p thundered past at just above rooftop height even with planes overhead hes still hard to catch frank continued with a mournful sigh and besides maybe heydrich wants the other nazi big shots dead then nobody can claim he doesnt deserve to be fuhrer if he lets us try em well take care of that for him lou said but he doesnt want to do that either he pointed northwest toward the shattered palace of justice if the fanatics had let the trial go on we wouldve hanged those bastards by now better than they deserve too you dont need to tell me lou i already know frank might have been on the point of saying something more but the doors to the jail opened out came mps with grease guns followed by the nazi prisoners in civilian clothes goring and hess were easy to recognize even though theyd both dropped a lot of weight the restwithout their uniforms without the power those uniforms conferred they looked like a bunch of smalltown shopkeepers and tradesmen with maybe a lawyer and a doctor and a preacher thrown in there were almost two dozen of them all told the mps hustled them into four halftracks guards also scrambled up into the armored personnel carriers the tanks and other armored vehicles rolled away to take the lead in the convoy one by one the halftracks with the important captives followed the rear guard was at least as strong as the force that had gone before more american troops and vehicles waited along the route the armored convoy would take still more were posted along routes it might have taken but wouldnt i wonder how much this little move is costing the taxpayers lou remarked youll find out captain frank said as soon as the jerks who want to make heydrich happy and go home hear what the number is theyll shout it from the housetops grab a copy of the chicago tribune or any hearst paper and youll see it thats what im afraid of lou said dont people understand the wars still cooking even if the krauts did sign a surrender hey if you get a scoop who gives a shit what happens to the poor goddamn dogfaces on the other side of the ocean yeah frank was in a cynical mood all right lou also had a strong opinion about what people like that could do to themselves it violated several commandments and other biblical prohibitions to say nothing of the laws of anatomy physiology and probably physics he expressed it anyhow his superior laughed sideways lou added well its not like i dont feel the same way howard frank said but im just a poor goddamn dogface on the other side of the ocean too far as theyre concerned uhhuh letters from lous familyand even more letters hed tried and failed to write to themhad painfully proved to him that he wasnt a civilian any more he wondered if he ever could be again he had his doubts but i think theyre just what you called em frank said im not gonna worry about emnot unless they make so much noise they dont let us do what weve gotta do over here sounds good to me too sir lou said the last pershingfinally an american tank that could match up with a panther only it got to the battlefield a couple of months before panthers went out of businessrumbled away exhaust fumes choked the air i just hope everything goes good on the other end too captain frank said boy me too lou said next stop he dropped to a whisper he wasnt supposed to say where even if the only guy who could possibly hear already knew anyway bringing out the place had a thrill of the forbidden frankfurt the truck was a deuceandahalf painted olive drab well what the hell else would it be in germany these days the english used them so did the french so did the russians and the jerries had used all the big american brutes they could capture these babies beat the crap out of the opels and the other hunks of tin the krauts had manufactured for themselves papers said the guard at the entrance to the american compound in frankfurt without a word the driver passed them to him the guard looked them over they were in order they looked in order anyhow it wasnt the same thing but the guard didnt think of that ive got to inspect your cargo he said the driver only nodded the guard eyed him watsamatter cat got your tongue buddy the driver mimed tipping back a stein or maybe a bottle he held his head in both hands and rolled his eyes the guard laughed okay okay ive tied one on a few times or maybe a few times too many but i still gotta look at your stuff with a hesitant nod the driver waved him on the man was as pallid as if hed got plastered the night beforethat was for sure the guard went around to the back of the truck he scrambled up onto the rear bumper so he could look over the gate at what the canvascovered truck body held then he jumped down in a hurry his own face felt as if it were on fire he knew it had to be beetred carton after cardboard carton all with kotex printed on them in big embarrassing scarlet letters soldiers wives officers grown and mostly grown daughterssure theyd need stuff like that but a nineteenyearold draftee didnt want to get reminded of it well go on goddammit he tried to make his voice rough and deep but it broke in the middle of the curse mortified anew he waved the deuceandahalf forward it should have headed straight for the px which was for all practical purposes a supermarket instead it made for the community center right in the middle of the american compound in frankfurt hey the gi said to his companion who hadnt bothered coming out of the guard shack what does he think hes doing what is he doing the other guard emerged to look he was a year older which only meant his whiskers rasped more when he rubbed his chin sure doesnt know where hes going does he no and he oughta unless a sudden horrid suspicion filled the kid whod waved the truck through he raised his grease gun and his voice hey you halt or else ill too late if there are two more mournful words in the english language what could they possibly be the truck was out of voice range and almost out of greasegun range it hadnt been full of kotex after all it blew skyhigh im in deep shit the guard thought as he went ass over teakettle that was pretty goddamn mournful too but it needed more than two words then he slammed into what was left of a wall across the street from the compound a rib broke it stabbed him from the inside out motherfuck he gasped and got stabbed again that wasnt mournful it was half automatic half furious at that he was one of the lucky ones when the german fanatic pressed the button on the steering wheel or wherever the hell it was hed got yardsmaybe even a quarter mileinto the compound almost to the community center he blasted himself to kingdom come of course he blew up twentynine us soldiers and seventythree women and nineteen children under the age of ten the papers were very particular about that for some reason children under the age of ten they all said the exploding truck wounded more than twice as many as it killed so the papers proclaimed right after the fanatic killed himself to strike at the usa the luckless guard lay on a cot in a crowded room in a crowded army hospital his chest was bandaged so tight he could hardly breathe he had nothing to donothing he could dobut read the papers and listen to the radio that sat on a wall shelf in one corner of the room a broken rib that wasnt so much after a while youd get better except the guard didnt he lost his appetiteeasy enough to do with army chow but still when he scratched his head his hair started coming out he didnt feel good at all not even a little bit a frowning nurse gave him a blood test not too much later a frowning doctor came in and asked him how long have you been anemic son huh what me the guard didnt even know what the word meant how come im going bald the doctor didnt answer which pissed him off it would have made him even madder if hed felt better he threw up that night and the vomit had blood in it a tech sergeant walked into the ward much too early the next morning he carried a metal box withthings attached to it the guard still nauseous wasnt inclined to curiosity just then one of thethings was a set of earphones the tech sergeant steered the other one over the guard something clicked in the earphones even the sick guard could hear it the sergeant looked down at a gauge on top of the metal box jesus christ he muttered and got out of there in a hurry they carried the guard out of the ward later that day the medics who moved him wore gas masks and thick gloves what the hells going on he asked i aint typhoid mary i aint got smallpox or nothin i know i ainti been vaccinated all i gots a coupla cracked ribs right well no coming through the gas mask the medics voice sounded otherworldly what is it then how come i feel so crappy the guard asked after we abombed the japs the docs called it radiation sickness the medic replied son of a bitch the guard would have got more excited but he did feel crappy that thing the fuckin kraut touched offthat was an atom bomb how come i aint dead the medic hesitated maybe you will besomething like that had to be going through his mind the guard would have been more upset had he been less wrung out too at last the medic said well it wasnt a real atom bomb what blew up was just tnt that kinda shit if it was a real atom bomb frankfurt wouldnt be there any moreone gone goose but the fuckin krauts put some kinda radioactive crap in with the explosive and the blast spread it all over the place you musta been pretty close to where it went off yeah i sure was thats how i got the ribs the guard agreed what happens now am i gonna die he wished he cared more see how much of that crap you took in see if you get better or not the medics who were lugging the guard stopped at a door with isolation painted above it in big letters that looked new a nurse held the door open for them she was a blonde with a nice shapebetty grable legsbut a gas mask kept the guard from telling whether she was cute or not he also wished he cared more about that if he didnt give a damn about what a girl looked like he had to be much too close to buying a plot several other guys already lay in the isolation ward a couple of them seemed pretty chipper others looked even worse than the guard felt the medics got him up onto a bed he lay there like a lump wondering what happened next or if anything happened next he had a hard time caring one way or the other robert patterson didnt look happy about coming before congress jerry duncan didnt give a good goddamn about how the secretary of war looked let me get this straight mr secretary jerry said we had this enormous enclave in frankfurt for american officers and their dependents constructed at taxpayer expense for several million dollars is that right yes congressman patterson looked even less happy jerry hadnt been sure he could okay jerry said it wasntnot even closebut sometimes you had to soften em up before you bored in for the kill we had this enclave now we cant use it any more because this damned german fanatic blew himself up right in the middle and left it radioactive we were going to try the german war criminals there but now we cant do that either is all that right yes congressman unfortunately it is there had to be some bottom to the secretary of wars gloom but he hadnt found it yet how did the german drive his truck into the middle of our enclave jerry inquired acid in his voice was the guard asleep at the switch it appears the guard was deceived sir if thats what you mean patterson answered stolidly what would have happened if the guard wasnt asleep at the switch jerry liked his own phrase better it made the guard and the secretary of war look bad wouldnt the whole enclave have been saved well sir i think the most likely thing is that the fanatic behind the wheel would have touched off the vehicle at the first sign of trouble patterson replied there was a lot of explosive in that truck it still would have blown up a large area and it would have spread the uh radioactive material far and wide any which way damn jerry thought that seemed likely to him too even if he wished it didnt he tried a different jab how did heydrichs fanatics get their hands on radioactive material in the first place how did they know what to do with it patterson licked his lips they kidnapped physicists out of the british zone the radioactive material came from the french zone so none of this is the war departments fault is that what youre saying jerry asked the bomb blew up in the american zone didnt it it contaminated the american zone didnt it yes sir the secretary of war said and this uh radioactive material the fanatics got from the french zonehow did they know it was there jerry pressed i presume one of the german physicists told them the secretary of war said now we knew the stuff was there but we didnt try to get it because we didnt want to alert the french to its presence isnt that right jerry said patterson sipped from the glass of ice water in front of him before answering yes congressman i believe it is in his shoes jerry would have been sweating too and would have wanted to cool down we held our cards too close to our chest wouldnt you say jerry asked it did turn out that way yes sir hindsight is always twentytwenty patterson said how many people got blown up by the bomb mr secretary how many will die of radiation sickness or cancer because of it couldnt we have used some twentytwenty foresight jerry demanded bang the committee chairman used his gavel there will be no badgering of witnesses he declared you need not respond to that mr patterson sorry mr chairman jerry said but when he thought about the stories the papers would run he wasnt sorry one bit some soviet printer in berlin had run off countless copies of the latest ukase from moscow the fellow must have if one appeared on the desk of an officer as junior as vladimir bokov with the order in hand he went down the hall to see what his superior thought of it colonel shteinberg was reading the pronunciamento when bokov came in hello volodya he said youve seen this he held up the sheet of cheap pulp paper da comrade colonel bokov displayed his own copy what do you make of it it will be a little inconvenient maybe but of course well do it because the order comes straight from marshal stalin shteinberg said of course bokov agreed straightfaced anyone who didnt follow an order from stalin would regret it the rest of his life which might not be long but would be unpleasant we will have to help organize postage and reparations to make sure everything is examined by geiger counter before it proceeds to the motherland he paused then asked comrade colonel how many of these geiger counters are there in the soviet zone and what are they for they measure radioactivity i found that out with a phone call to a doctor who did a course in physics before the war shteinberg replied at the moment i believe we have seven in the soviet zone but more are coming from the ussr good thats good bokov said with what he thought of as commendable optimism every motherlandbound letter parcel truck soldier dismounted factory seven of these geiger counters yes they needed morethousands more all the same he thought he understood why stalin gave the order radioactivity could kill and kill invisibly the bandits bomb in frankfurt must have put the little fathers wind up if the heydrichites still had any of their radioactive materialwhatever it wasleft they could strike a blow at the very heart of the soviet union of course stalin would do everything he could to block it another question formed in bokovs mind what do we do if we find something thats uh radioactive he had only the vaguest notion of what the word meant ah they must not have issued you the supplement moisei shteinberg brandished another sheet of paper in that case we are to find out who delivered it and where and where he got it this may give us some leads on who gave it to him yes it may bokov didnt believe that but he had to sound like someone who did well it wasnt as if he hadnt had practice and so we have our orders and so we will carry them out shteinberg declared at my suggestion the red armys postmasters have directed that all mail to the motherland be routed through berlin six of the seven geiger counters are here in this city all rail traffic between the soviet zone and the ussr will be centralized here allowing us to inspect soldiers and functionaries very good comrade colonel what about germans assigned to camps bokov asked oh i dont think we need to worry about them shteinberg said with a certain savage satisfaction they wont be going any place where they can endanger people who matter bokov nodded makes sense to me we wont have to take any of these counters away from important work then well be stretched thin enough as is shteinberg agreed can we borrow geiger counters from the angloamericans bokov wondered theyre imperialist powers i know but theyre still our allies against the fascist jackals shteinberg pondered then clicked his tongue between his teeth not a good idea comrade captain we will not show england or the united states that we are weak in any way when he put it like that bokov couldnt possibly argue even trying would have been dangerous so he didnt xvii ravens were nasty birds lou weissberg hadnt seen manytruth to tell he couldnt remember seeing anyback in new jersey he hadnt even seen that many crows but hed found out more than he ever wanted to know about ravens in the months before the german surrender they pecked out corpses eyes and worried at wounds to make them bigger and get at the exposed flesh sometimes they didnt wait till what they were pecking at was a corpse here they were again on the road between nuremberg and munich the day before a squads worth of fanatics had tangled with about an equal number of gis more often than not the krauts assault rifles and schmeissers would have given them a firepower edge over american troops not this timethree of the dogfaces were bar men the brownings chewed up the fanatics and left themravens meat vultures prowled the grass along with the ravens european vultures were hawkier than their american equivalents they looked as if they wouldnt mind going out and killing something when the carrion ran short well they didnt need to do any extra work today the gis with the bars had taken care of that for them the americans had lost one dead and three wounded the germans were mostly dead theyd given themselves a nasty surprise sure as hell but the gis had captured a couple who were only woundedhe didnt get to interrogate fanatics all that often plenty of us soldiers surrounded the tent that housed the wounded aryan supermen most of the time the jerries would have gone to a hospital in munich or nuremberg not today josephine so soon after the radioactive attack on frankfurt the brass wasnt sure heydrichs goons wouldnt try another one a tent in the middle of nowhere didnt make a promising target for that kind of thing jumpy troopers made lou show his id three different times and frisked him twice before he got inside the tent in the far east hed heard army discipline was going right down the crapper the japs actually believed they were licked american troops might not want to be in europe but they didnt get slack and dick around here nothing concentrated the mind like the possibility you might get your head blown off a medicno a doc he wore captains barslooked up when lou ducked into the tent you weissberg heard you were coming call me lou lou had captains bars of his own brand new ones that was more for time served than for anything hed actually accomplished and he knew it too well he went on i wish your watchdogs woulda got the word they wouldntve felt me up like i was jane russell howre the krauts one of ems got a sucking chest hes in bad shapedunno if hell make it the army doctor answered other guys got a smashedup leg maybe ill have to amputate maybe not penicillin and sulfa give him a chance to keep it anyhow ten years ago it wouldve been gone for sure you can talk to himhes with it the one with the chest wound keeps going in and out know what i mean oh yeah ive seen fellows like that before lou said our guys waxed these assholescleaned their clocks the doctor said sure hope it gets into the papers me too but i cant do a thing about that lou said so i can talk to this one huh he pointed to the german with a leg wrapped in bloody bandages yeah hes got plenty of morphine in him toohe needs it so if hes flying maybe hell sing for you you can hope anyway i sure can lou leaned over the german who wore a neater less raggedy feldgrau tunic than hed seen for a while and the man still had on a set of shoulder straps with a senior sergeants rank badges which had been against regulations since the dreadfully misnamed ve day well the jerry had bigger things than that to worry about lou switched to deutsch hey you herr feldwebel can you hear me the krauts eyes opened they were aluminumgray a genuinely scary color but they also looked back at lou from a million miles away plenty of morphine and then some lou thought im not a goddamn feldwebel the german said im a scharfuhrer and dont you forget it contempt and weariness warred in his voice he had to be doped out of his skull or hed never admit to owning waffenss rank lou decided to roll with it sorry herr scharfuhrer he said tell me who sent you out on this dumbheaded mission that got you shot god damn egon to hell and gone he can lick my asshole the son of a whore lou thought the scharfuhrer would bust right open but he didnt no matter how full of drugs he was he knew what he was supposed to say when somebody started interrogating him my name is bauer rudolf bauer i am a scharfuhrer waffenss he gave lou his serial number by the geneva convention i am not required to tell you more pigdog lou yelled loud enough to make the doctor jump do you think the red army gives a rats ass about the geneva convention bauers aircraftskin eyes widened lou watched him try to fight the morphine but he sputtered buti am in the american zone you are wearing an american uniform shit lou thought but shit wasnt what came out of his mouth once upon a time somebody whod come back from a visit to smashed berlin had taught him how to cuss a little in russian hed never imagined that would come in handy but maybe it did now gavno he yelled and for good measure yob tvoyu mat hearing him a real russian likely would have laughed his ass off a drugged and wounded ss man was in no position to realize what a lousy accent he had rudolf bauer gulped the way his adams apple swelled and contracted he might have been in a bugs bunny cartoon he started to give his name rank and pay number againhe had nerve shut up lou yelled tell me who sent you out whats egons whole name had he been a real russian interrogator he probably would have kicked that wounded leg about then morphine or no morphine bauer wouldve gone right through the roof of the tent lou didnt have the stomach for it even if the doctor wouldnt have reported him but bauer didnt have to know that the scharfuhrer gulped again then he whimpered the leg had to hurt in spite of everything talk you stinking turd lou screamed in a horrible way it was fun he could see why ss and nkvd men enjoyed what they did for a livingand he wondered if hed be able to look at himself in the mirror when he shaved tomorrow morning in a very small voice bauer whispered he is hauptsturmfuhrer steinbrecher aha where do i find this cocksucker lou demanded hes dead a bar blew his brains out if bauer said that and stuck to it how could anybody prove he was lyingshort of kicking his leg anyhow but once a prisoner started talking he often sang like a nightingale he lives in the town of pforring outside ingolstadt bauer said he is a mechanic there how about that the doctor mutteredhe spoke german then yeahhow about that lou agreed a break maybe sure could use one the fanatics were good you couldnt break into their cells very often but if this egon steinbrecher was happily repairing stuff in pforring and if lou and some gis dropped in you never could tell if somebody kept a schmeisser handysee you later doc lou tore out of the tent he corralled some of the guys guarding the scene of the firefight they piled into three jeeps and roared off toward pforring about twenty minutes away most of the small town was intact one block on the outskirts and then two more a little farther on had had the bejesus knocked out of them loud seen that kind of thing before those were the places where the krauts tried to make a stand when the american army came through at lous order the jeep stopped by an old woman carrying a few sticks of firewood where do i find egon steinbrecher the mechanic lou asked her three blocks that way and one block up she pointed a brick house with a shed to one side if she was lying she was damn good on the spur of the moment the dogface driving the jeep didnt know german lou gave him the directions the other two jeeps zoomed after his there was the house there was the shed there was the guy who had to be steinbrecher working on something broken with a pair of pliers lou pointed a grease gun at his midsection hold it right there lou yelled drop the pliers hands high clank the pliers fell on the cement floor was ist los steinbrecher said as he raised his hands i have done nothing wrong well see about that lou said in german and then in english to one of his men frisk him sandy and check under his arm for the tattoo sure thing captain the gi patted steinbrecher down he found nothing more lethal than a clasp knife but when he undid the germans shirt and looked under his left armpit he grunted and nodded yeah hes got it wearing your blood group on your skin made transfusions quick and easy and safe even if you were badly hurt and couldnt tell the doctor what group you were egon steinbrecher hadnt bothered getting his tattoo removed as the war wound down bring him along then lou told sandy well question him back in nuremberg but i have done nothing wrong steinbrecher bleated again yeah tell me another one lou answered he didnt remember the last time hed felt so good something had actually worked out for a change a major in dress uniform read from a statement in a pentagon press room nine of heydrichs fanatics were killed and two captured one of them later died of his wounds an ss captain was also captured afterwards american losses in the skirmish were one dead three wounded we believe the captured officer will give us valuable information about the fanatics organization and resources he looked out at the reporters questions gentlemen tom schmidts hand shot up when the major nodded to him he said why should a story like this impress us germany surrendered more than a year ago shouldnt it be quiet over there by now one of the things tom had learned in germany was how to read campaign and decoration ribbons among others the major wore one for a purple heart with two tiny oakleaf clusters attached he also wore an expression that said he wanted to scrape tom off the bottom of his shoe when you grow up mr schmidt you learn theres a difference between what ought to be and what is he said in the flat voice of formal hostility and you learn you have to deal with what is not what ought to be some of the reporters in the briefing room snickered they werent all administration backers either toms ears felt incandescent well let me ask that another way then major he said doing his best not to show his own fury how could we have dealt with what was a year ago so we wouldnt have this mess on our hands today sir i am trying to show you progress in the fight against the fanatics and you dont want to look at it the briefing officer complained tom sniffed we won a skirmish hot diggety dog a year ago did you expect wed still be having skirmishes today my opinion on these issues doesnt matter the major said okay fine did anybody in the war department or the state department or the white house expect wed still be fighting a shooting war in germany halfway through that doesnt matter now the major insisted the point now is that we have to win it and were going to win it and we are winning it this fight we just had how many years before we can go back into frankfurt how many people from there are refugees tom broke in does that say were winning the briefing officer turned brick red maybe it would be better if someone else asked questions for a while mr schmidt better for who another reporter inquired for whom yet another man corrected assemble a bunch of people who made their living with words and somebody was bound to turn copy editor on you for people who want full and accurate information thats for whom the major answered what had probably been a rhetorical question the papers only seem interested in bad news when anything good happens you dont want to talk about it maybe he didnt know how big a can of worms he was opening or maybe he had orders from people above him to try to put the fear of god into the washington press corps if he did it didnt work even the people whod laughed when he mocked tom schmidt started screaming at him now tom was sure of that as far as he could tell everybody in the briefing room started screaming ive had enough someone shouteda variation on one of the republicans campaign slogans to err is truman another reporter added this time parroting the republican line then he said and youre right up there with him major i dont know how we got such an unpatriotic press the briefing officer said you people are worth regiments to heydrich and his maniacs here im trying to show you were making progress and you dont want to listen tom didnt laugh out loud but he felt like it the major had delivered himselfand with him maybe the truman administrationinto the reporters hands accuse them of supporting the other side and theyd tear you into bloody chunksall in the name of freedom of the press of course they screamed at the major they demanded to know what he was talking about are you saying were cardcarrying nazis one of them yelled cause ill make you sorry if you are he was short and fat and wore thick glasses a born f if there ever was one the major might have been wounded three times but as long as he wasnt in a wheelchair he wouldnt have any trouble with a twerp like that which didnt stop the reporter and might even have spurred him on the briefing officer didnt try to back down or cover his tracks the way he should have he scowled back at the gentleman of the fourth estate and answered i dont know what you guys are i wonder what the fbi would turn up if it tried to find out that was blowing on a fire they told him all the reasons the fbi had no right to do anything like that they told him how theyd sue j edgar hoover if he tried and for how much they didnt ask him any more questions they swarmed out of the briefing room swarmed out of the pentagon to write their stories and file them with their papers they werent the kind of stories the truman administration would have wanted army suppresses truth was the headline under which toms piece ran as those things went that was one of the milder ones tom schmidt smiled when he saw some of the others if the army fucked with him hed fuck with it right back lou weissberg lit a cigarette in germany that made him a rich manhe could afford to smoke his money major frankthe other mans promotion had come through about the same time as his ownwas smoking too well of course they were rich here they were americans after all i was talking to a guy who hit the beach at dday lou remarked yeah howard frank tried to blow a smoke ring it was a ragged botch uhhuh lou nodded he told me his lci was a few hundred yards from the beach when it got hit by a round from an hes lucky hes still here to tell you the story in that case frank said the german antiaircraft gun antitank gun and main armament in the tiger tank and the jagdpanther tank destroyerwas one hellacious piece of artillery no shit lou agreed only reason he is is the jerry gunners loaded an ap round instead of high explosive so the damn thing went through the side of the landing craft went through two of his buddies and went straight out through the bottom okay im hooked give me the next reel of the serial frank said well the lci started to sink like youd expect lou said not real quick but it took on more and more water and rode lower and lowertill finally it scraped up onto the beach and the guys who hadnt got ventilated got out and headed for the war mmp major frank essayed another smoke ring with no better luck than before he looked disgruntled maybe at the miserable puff of smoke maybe at lou and youre telling me this story because by the way he said it he didnt believe lou had any reason but lou did on account of it kinda reminded me of what weve been doing here since the surrender weve been sinking an inch at a time like you know what i mean sir i only wish i didnt frank stubbed out the cigarette in his shellcasing ashtray and promptly lit another as he took a deep drag on the new coffin nail he asked so wheres the beach the beachoh i was hoping you could tell me lou said if we cant make it that far before we go under all we leave is a trail of bubbles and then were gone for good he got a fresh smoke going too the inside of his mouth felt like sandpaper still the little nicotine buzz was worth it hed tried quitting a time or two but that hurt so he hadnt one more time major frank said and tilted his head back this smoke ring wasnot good but better anyhow as if it helped jog his brain he continued maybe if we kill heydrich maybe lou allowed if one of our bombs had blasted hitler in that wouldve kicked over the anthill for sure to his surprise howard frank looked less than enthusiastic they mightve fought the war better if old adolf did go to hell halfway through you know he told em to do a lot of dumbass things and nobody had the nerve to go wait a minute youre out of your goddamn mind lou grunted no doubt his superior had something there something for the reich in for sure now wasnt now a different story you think heydrichs meshiggeh too lou asked meshuggeh frank said its a miracle the krauts can understand you the kind of yiddish you talk its all in the front of your mouth yeah yeah bite me lou saidtheyd gone around that barn before a time or twelve i did proper german in college too you know that but do you think heydrichs squirrelly bite me sir major frank said without rancor he paused to chew on the real question reluctantly he shook his head nah i guess not coldhearted son of a bitch but thats not the same thing for somebody with a crappy hand hes played it damn well or do you think im wrong wish i did lou answered boy do i ever but im not sure how bad his hand really is yknow yeah his guys cant fight us straight up any more like they did before the surrender but so what they sure can drive us nuts same as the russian partisans did with them and those assholes were ready for this they started gearing up a couple of years before the wehrmacht threw in the towelstashing guns getting men out of regular units and salting em away not a lot of men not when youre talking about a real army for partisans though they got plenty aint it the truth frank said mournfully and how do you stop somebody who doesnt care if he kills himself as long as he gives you a good one in the balls two atom bombs made the japs believe they honest to god lost lou said our guys over in the pacific dont have any trouble nowlucky bastards you dont like it where youre at you can always put in for a transfer major frank said ill endorse it like nobodys business lou sent him a reproachful look through the smoke that hazed the office you know i dont want to do this i want to clobber these nazi mothers ive got millions of reasons why too same as you do i just wish to hell i knew how we were gonna do it and that congress would let us do it as if to punctuate his words the thump of nottoodistant explosions rattled the windows that gave major frank a look at the devastation outside lou tensed ready to hit the dirt before he did a veterans judgment told him he didnt have to howard frank didnt dive under his desk only a mortar lou said frank nodded mortars were the small change of this war unless one came down close to you you didnt have to worry about them much good that did old adenauer lou reminded himself but trucks full of explosives and heydrichite fanatics wearing vests stuffed with tnt and nails were what you really needed to worry about the germans had surrendered more than a year before this kind of picayune crapmaybe a couple of gis wounded maybe just something smashedlooked as if it could go on forever are we ready to hold these shitheads down forever lou wondered he was he was much less sure about the rest of his country lights from light bulbs slightly stale air the hum of fans in the background reinhard heydrich hardly heard them any more not unless he made a conscious effort and listened nowadays this was where he belonged deep underground the raid into the british zone that netted the german physicists only rubbed his nose in the truth however much he wished he were he wasnt a field operative any more this is what happens to a field marshalor to a fuhrer he thought the allies spread stories about how hitler had gone mad down in his bunker heydrich didnt think that was happening to himbut hed changed no doubt about it he was damn glad his wife and children made it to spain while things were falling apart in the reich a lot of people had used that escape route and franco wouldnt give them up of course the whole war would have gone differently if franco had let the wehrmacht take gibraltar away from england hitler came back from that meeting saying he would rather have three teeth pulled than dicker with the caudillo again at least heydrich didnt have to worry that the yankees would try to use lina and the kids against him better still he didnt have to worry that the russians would whatever they tried wouldnt have swayed himhe was sure of thatbut it might have clouded his judgment he couldnt afford that not when he had to fight this unbalanced unequal kind of war oberscharfuhrer klein came in with the latest stack of newspapers from all over germanyand from beyond he laid a copy of le figaro on heydrichs desk and pointed to a photo on the front page isnt this disgusting he growled theyre so damned proud of themselves because they tied themselves to the amis apron strings the photo showed a french panzer rumbling down the champs elysees it looked rather like a panther heydrich knew the french army was using some of those it had taken more or less intact his french was rusty but he could make sense of the story under the photo it bragged about how the frenchbuilt panzer showed that france was a great power again heydrich wanted to spit on the newspaper how great was france in he growled thats what i was thinking herr reichsprotektor hans klein leered i was on leave in paris in and the girls were pretty greatill tell you that leave a few reichsmarks on the dresser and theyd do whatever you wanted theyd smile while they did it too he chuckled reminiscently those were the days all right and now the same girls suck off the americanssome great power heydrich said klein laughed out loud heydrichs eyes already narrow narrowed further we ought to teach them a lesson hans we really should maybe another one for the english too as if england could have beaten us if she hadnt let herself get overrun by american niggers and jews damn right sir klein sounded hearty but only for a moment then he asked umwhat have you got in mind i dont know yet heydrich admitted but something there has to be something no security to speak of in france or englandnot like here getting people and the stuff they need across the border should be easy as you please ja klein nodded youve got that rightfor france anyway england may be harder though miserable channel heydrich nodded too unhappily englands natural moat wasnt even a good piss wide but it had been plenty to frustrate the reich in moving our personnelthat should be manageable the reichsprotektor said thinking out loud what they needtheres the hard part shame we dont have any uboats left hans klein remarked that made heydrich think some more a few of the submarines that had surrendered had put in at german ports regretfully he shook his head we havent got the people to man one and even if we did the allies would shit bricks if one of those boats went missing cant have that not when were trying to keep a secret klein grunted yeah youre right sir too damn bad but you are a fishing boat maybe heydrich wondered that might work he had no idea how many fishing boats were setting out from german ports these days up till this moment hed never had any reason to worry about it and the north sea and the baltic were about as far from his redoubt as you could get and still stay in the reich have to see what we can find out whatever it is the tommies wont like it klein predicted heydrich didnt smile very often but he did now thats the idea hans summer pressed down on anderson indiana like a hot wet glove diana and ed mcgraw went to movies on weekends and whenever ed didnt come home from the plant too tired during the week what was playing they didnt much care the theaters had airconditioning that counted for more than what went on the screen the movie houses were packed whenever they went too they werent the only ones who wanted to beat the heat for a couple of hours i wonder what itd cost to aircondition the house diana said when they left a theater one night it was after ten but still sweltering outside i can tell you what ed answered more than we can afford thats what i make pretty good money but not that kind he opened the pontiacs passenger door diana slid in she knew he was right ed went around to get in on the street side as he started the car he went on youll be taking your trips anyway the trains are airconditioned and so are the hotels right a lot of the time anyhow diana agreed well thats something anyways ed put the car in gear where do you go next detroit no minneapolis she said he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand thats right i forgot detroits later but they were both up north and i mixed em up its a wonder you can keep everything straight maybe itll be cooler up there you can hope sure diana said and then after cautious silence does it bother you that im gone so much nah to her relief ed didnt hesitate even a little bit it needs doin i couldnt hack anything like that i aint got the waddayacallitthe personality but youre goin great guns patd be proud of you honest to god babe he would thanks tears stung dianas eyes she did sometimes wonder what their son would have thought of her campaign against the government that was foolishness she never would have started it if one of heydrichs fanatics hadnt killed him and opened her eyes minneapolis turned out to be hot too the paper there said the heat wave ran all the way up to winnipeg on the other side of the border the canadians were lucky they didnt have to try to help hold germany down the ground around minneapolis was as flat as if it had been ironed and puddled with ponds and lakes of all sizes most of the people were tall and fair they spoke with a slight singsong scandinavian accent and said ja when they meant yes most of the time they didnt seem to notice the way they talked every once in a while they would grin wickedly and put it on twice as thick to drive an outoftowner loopy signs printed in red on whitestop the bleeding in germany rally at loring park were tacked to telephone poles and pasted to walls everywhere on the short car ride from the great northern depot to dianas hotel looks like you folks have done a terrific job getting ready diana told the couple whod met her at the station well we try said susan holmquist who ran the minnesota fight against the war ja we do agreed her husband sven they both seemed surprised at her praise other places people acted as if they wanted a medal for pitching in not here not with the holmquists quietly susan added danny would have wanted it this way if you do something do it right sven nodded theyd lost their son at almost the same time as diana lost pat a german wearing explosives under his clothes blew himself up in a crowd of gis and danny holmquist was one of the unlucky ones loring park hadinevitablya twolobed lake at its heart susan said the ice skating was terrific during the winter diana had tried ice skating exactly once and sprained an ankle besides just then she was amazed the little lake wasnt steaming the air shimmered under the swaggering sun a buntingdraped platform with a mike stood near a statue of ole bull a plaque at the base of the statue explained that ole bull was a nineteenthcentury norwegian violinist a good thing too because diana wouldnt have known otherwise what he was doing immortalized in bronze in a minneapolis parkwell it was a scandinavian part of the country picketers paraded and chanted their placards carried all the slogans diana had seen so often before some of them shed come up with herself by now she had trouble remembering which ones those were they all blurred together people who disagreed with the picketers shouted and hooted boredlooking cops kept them from doing anything more in places like new york city or pittsburgh the cops wouldnt have looked bored a lot more of them would have been here too even so they might not have been able to keep the two sides apart folks in these parts seemed to have better manners susan holmquist made a speech the crowd in front of the podiumnot too big not too smalllistened politely they applauded politely at the right places reporters took notes photographers photographed it was all very civilized if everybody behaved like this world war ii probably never would have happened but susan introduced diana who got a bigger hand stepping up to the microphone diana thought of how scared of public speaking shed been when she started out she wasnt any more shed done it often enough to let it lose its terrors she hammered away at the points shed made so many times before why was the usa still in germany why had so many young men died after victory was declared why couldnt the americansor anyone elsesquash the german fanatics how long would it go on how much more money and how many more lives would it cost she cut her speech shorter than usual they were going to do something different here they were going to read out one after another the names of all the servicemen andwomen killed in germany since what was laughably called ve day sven holmquist came up with a typewritten sheet of paper irving sheldon aaronson he intoned hovan abelian creighton abrams manuel jose acevedo diana found herself nodding as she listened to name following name it was oddly impressive oddly dignified and it brought home one name at a time just what the united states had already thrown away maybe she wasnt the only one who felt that way a man in a suit bustled out of the crowd and headed toward the speakers platform he had a pointed chin and a high foreheadhe was going to lose his hair but he hadnt lost too much yet diana noticed his person less than she noticed that the police were letting him through who is that guy she whispered to susan whats he doing is he safe was what she really meant thats mayor humphrey hubert humphrey susan answered the name meant nothing to diana the minneapolis woman went on hes proadministration all the way humphrey hopped up onto the platform may i say a few words he asked his voice was a light tenor a bit on the shrill side this isnt your show mr mayor sven holmquist said this is ours but hubert humphrey grabbed the mike anyway folks i just want you to think about one thing he said loudly diana got the idea that there would be no such thing as a few words from him he went on if we run away from germany the nazis win all the soldiers whove died will have died for nothing for nothingdo you hear me we will have wasted years and tens of thousands of lives and tens of billions of dollars is that what you want cutting and running wont diana took the microphone away from him he looked astonishedhe wasnt used to people doing anything like that mr humphrey mr holmquist was right this is our show diana said if you want your own you can have it im sure i only meant humphrey began i dont care what you meant sir diana cut him off it wasnt easyhe was used to talking through or over other people but with the mike in hand she did it adding when i was a girl wilson talked about the war to end war what did he know was he right what do politicians ever know let the people decide if you please the crowd really applauded then hubert humphrey looked amazed all over again he eyed diana as if he were seeing her for the first time theres more to you than meets the eye he said i dont know about that i dont care either diana answered all i know is this is our show and were going to run it get down off this platform before i ask the police to run you in for interfering with a public meeting he blinked you would wouldnt you mr humphrey it would be a pleasure now get down diana said and humphrey did because he had to know she wasnt bluffing she gave the microphone back to sven holmquist if youd go on from where you were interrupted please yes maam he said something not far from awe in his voice donald andrew barclay peter leroy barker a room a couple of armed guards a bright light a prisoner an interrogator how many times had that scene played out during the war and in how many countriesto say nothing of how many movies now lou weissberg was in the drivers seat the light shone into hauptsturmfuhrer egon steinbrechers face theyd been through several sessions by now lou was fast running out of patience with the captured german look he said in reasonable tones youre a dead man the geneva convention doesnt apply your side surrendered if you fight on after that its your tough luck the ss captain licked his lips hed been slapped around a little but nothing more lou and the americans generally didnt like torture unless you had to tear something out of somebody right this second what was the point and steinbrecher didnt know anything like that lou got the feeling he wasnt up to being a suicide warrior the way too many of heydrichs fanatics were but he tried to hold a bold front so why have you not killed me then why do you think lou said so we can squeeze you if you sing pretty enough we may even let you keep breathing who all was in your cell you already know that steinbrecher said they had bad luck when they attacked your men those were the only ones lou asked the german nodded lou laughed in his face tell me another one it is the truth steinbrecher sounded affronted that anyone could doubt his word he yawned he hadnt had much sleep since he got nabbed that wasnt quite torture not to lous way of thinking and it could soften a guy up or at least make him punchy and stupid how do you get your orders lou asked there isthere wasa drop in a hollow tree fifty meters behind my shop steinbrecher said sometimes a piece of paper would show up there it would tell me what to do i would do it i do not know who put the paper in so you need not ask me that ill ask you whatever i damn well please lou snapped the trouble was he believed steinbrecher here that was how undergrounds all over the world ran their operations if you didnt know who gave you your orders you couldnt tell the other side if they caught you lou grimaced this wasnt going the way he wanted he took another stab at it you cant do any better its time for the blindfold and cigarette this time the ss man gulped and he named half a dozen names all of them men living in pforring they all hate you he declared well check it out lou said he left the interrogation room and made a telephone call an hour and a half later he got an answer the men werejust men nothing showed they had any connection with the fanatics an hour after that hauptsturmfuhrer egon steinbrecher stood tied to a pole in front of a wall he declined the blindfold but accepted a cigaretteironically a luckyfrom lou who commanded the firing squad i die for germany he said as he finished the smoke you die all right lou agreed he stepped aside and nodded to the halfdozen gis readyaimfire their ms barked steinbrecher slumped against the pole he died fast lou didnt have to finish him off with his carbine that was a relief anyhow hed had this duty before and he hated it he also hated not getting morehell not getting anythingout of steinbrecher maybe he hadnt known the one right question to ask the one that would have made the german sing maybe there hadnt been any one right question all he had now was one more dead nazi which wasnt bad but wasnt good enough in the first days of the occupation theyd taken newsreels of executions like this and shown them in german theaters that quickly stopped the films raised sympathy for heydrichs goons not the fear us authorities wanted no camera crew here just the squad and a couple of the gis looked as if they wanted to be sick lou cut steinbrechers body down bury this crap he said sometimes nothing went the way you wished it would xviii jurgen had been in paris twice before hed paraded through the city of light in june everything seemed possible then hell everything seemed likely the wehrmacht had done what the kaisers army never could france lay naked at germanys feet with a smile jurgen remembered how tired hed been as he marched under the arc de triomphe tired hell hed been out on his feet so had most of the landsers who tramped along with him theyd had a month of hard fighting to get to where they were and theyd felt every minute of it but great days great days england would give up next and that would end the war the reich would take its rightful place in the sun everybody would be happy and he could take off the feldgrau and go back to being a longshoreman again only things worked out a little differently yeah just a little jurgen thought wryly when he came back to paris it was december the red army had just chased his division out of kiev hed been on the eastern front for a couple of years hed stopped one bullet and one shell fragment by then his left elbow didnt bend much but if you were righthanded you could live with that pariswasnt the same winter sure but also shortages of everything electricity only a few hours a day not much heat the streets empty of cars skinny shabby people on foot or making do with bicycles the restaurants couldnt cook what they couldnt get even the whores just went through the motions well jurgen wasnt the same as hed been in either hed only imagined he was tired back in the old days he hadnt had exhaustion seep into his bones into his very soul in hed hibernated like a dormouse all the way across europe in his railway car hed hardly looked out to notice what lancasters and bs and bs were doing to the vaterland hed seen bad things fighting through france hed thought hed seen everything what the hell did he know he was just a kid what hed seen in russia what hed done in russiaeven now he shied away from remembering that and it wasnt as if the ivans didnt play the game the same filthy way what they did to some of the guys they capturedjurgen shied away from remembering that too you always saved one cartridge for yourself you didnt want them getting hold of you oh no so he wasnt afraid of doing himself in he might have needed to do it long before this if reichsprotektor heydrichs men hadnt plucked him from the depot and turned him into a holdout he still wanted to live but all that soldiering had taught him you didnt always get what you wanted so here he was in paris again in the cab of a us twoandahalfton truck he wore olivedrab american fatigues that fit pretty well but not quite well enough he had papers that showed he was somebody called paul higgins it was the kind of name even a german who knew no english could pronounce well enough hed traveled across france with it he didnt have far to go now once more paris wasnt the same it was nighttime all the lights were on that struck him as perverse but paris didnt worry about air raids now and it seemed to have been captured by americans olive drab was everywhere so were trucks just like the one he drove they made traffic on the narrow winding streets horrendous after a while he realized not all the olivedrab uniforms had americans in them a french flic directing traffic in a kepi looked like an ami from the neck down maybe not all the deuceandahalfs had american drivers jurgen chuckled he knew one that damn well didnt he checked the map on the seat beside him that was funny too he could see where he was going by god he just had to find the right way to get there also on the seat lay a sturmgewehr and a couple of extra magazines hed taken them out of hiding when he got into town he might need to do some shooting on the last leg of the trip extra steel sheets armored his doors heydrichs mechanics hadnt had to do that the ami whod driven the truck before it was stolen had taken care of it he hadnt wanted to stop a german bullet jurgen didnt want to stop an american round or even a french one not now not when hed come this far he came up alongside the champ du mars a rectangle of greenery and geometrically precise garden in the heart of paris the eiffel tower loomed ahead beyond it lay the pont djena napoleon had beaten the prussians at jena jurgen knew that the french named their bridges for battles theyd won there wouldnt be a pont dardennes in paris any time soon well he wasnt going as far as the pont djena anyhow he cut hard left and made for the base of the tower a flics whistle shrilledhe wasnt supposed to do that he started to reach for the assault rifle spraying a few bullets around would buy him the time he needed but nobody opened up on him nobody tried to block him the paris cop blew his whistle again furiously he thought jurgen was a drunk ami on a joyride jurgen laughed sorry flic orders were to see if he could drop the tower straight down onto the pont djena to double the damage from its fall one look told jurgen that wouldnt happen the supports were positioned so it had to go down diagonally to the bridge nobody back in germany had remembered that well if it went into the seine that would screw things up pretty goddamn well jurgen thought it was tall enough to reach as he drove under the more northerly of the riverside supports somebodyprobably that policemanfired a pistol at the truck too little too late like everything the french did jurgens finger found the detonator button on the side of the steering column he wished he could watch what was about to happen it ought to make one hell of a show oh well you couldnt have everything sieg heil jurgen said and stabbed the button hard lou weissberg stared at the front page of the international heraldtribune some photographer was going to win himself a pulitzer prize for this pic the way that guy in the pacific had for his shot of the flagraising on iwo jima the year before there was the eiffel tower still mostly lit up leaning at a fortyfivedegree angle to the rest of the skyline but it didnt keep leaning the way the tower of pisa did it crashed all the way down the last hundred feet or so going right into the seine what a mess lou muttered what a fucking mess he read the story though the headlinetower falls and the photo got the message across by themselves sometimes the details carried a morbid fascination of their own he learned that counting radio antenna the tower was had been more than a thousand feet high taller than anything manmade except the much newer empire state building it weighed about tons or as much as the water a heavy cruiser displaced and nowit was tons of scrap iron shaking his head lou turned to the continued on page the inside page had another shot of the toppled tower this one taken in the cold gray light of dawn as it lay on the groundand in the riverit reminded him of nothing so much as one more soldier shot dead in the war the story said eightyone people had died when the eiffel tower fell some had been on it others under it or caught in the blast of the exploding truck that sheared through one of its enormous feet and a weatherman whod been up at the very top reading a barometer got pitched into the seine and was fished out with nothing worse than a broken wrist fuck lou said when he read that sometimes youd rather be lucky than good if he were that weatherman he thought hed go out looking for wallets next to the inside photo and the continuation of the story from the front page was another one seeing its headlinegerman freedom front claims blastlou ground his teeth heydrichs goons had released a statement by planted communiques telephone calls and their clandestine radio station the stinking bastards didnt miss a trick god damn their blackhearted souls to hell if you believed them and lou unfortunately had no reason not to the fellow whod brought the tower down was an unteroffiziera lousy corporalnamed jurgen voss he gave up his life gloriously for the future liberation of the fatherland and its folk the statement said let all who dare to oppose us beware of course a lousy corporal from the last war a fellow by the name of hitler had done a lot more damage than this jurgen voss ever dreamt of but it sure wasnt bad for a first try general de gaulles statement only made page four lou thought putting heydrich ahead of him was chickenshit but what could you do about newspapermen the tower shall rise again de gaulle declared nazi germany never will slowly lou nodded that had style if only he could be as confident himself as de gaulle sounded harry trumans response went right next to the french leaders today we are all frenchmen the president said that was pretty good too truman went on this latest vile nazi atrocity shows the desperation of the madmen who refuse to accept the verdict of history lou frowned that also sounded good chances were itd play well back in the states it was a vile atrocity no two ways about it but were heydrich and his chums madmen were they desperate if they were they hid it much too well fighting the usaand the uk and the ussrtoetotoe hadnt worked out so well for the third reich fighting a partisan war was a whole different story dammit if you were trying to drive the other guy nuts and hurt him way worse than he could hurt youwell if you were trying to do something like that how could you play your hand better than heydrich had it was nine in the morning lou headed for the officers club anyway he needed something to turn off part of his brain right now bourbon would do like so much of the american presence in nuremberg these days the quonset hut that housed the officers club cowered behind rings of barbed wire and sandbagged machinegun emplacements the gis who manned those emplacements seemed extra jumpy this morning lou would have too if heydrichs goons could knock over the eiffel tower for christs sake what was one stinking officers club not worth noticing lou hoped even so early the place was more crowded than it usually was at night tobacco smoke hazed the air almost every man in there from lowly second lieutenant to bird colonel held a copy of the heraldtrib or of stars and stripes which also had that picture of the tower in midfall and almost every man in there was drinking hard whatll it be sir asked the pfc tending bar when lou squeezed up to him once upon a time a jerry had worked back there after what happened to the russians in berlin that didnt look like a good idea any more bourbon on the rocks lou said make it a double ive got some catching up to do yes sir comin up the kid poured in two generous jiggers of kentucky lightning and some ice cubes hell of a mornin aint it man you said a mouthful lou looked around major frank was sitting with a tough skinny major named ezra robertson robertson who was from vermont or new hampshirelou couldnt remember whichwas supposed to help the prosecutors in the warcrimes trials if the twicederailed trials ever got off the ground no doubt he would frank waved lou snagged a chair and joined the two majors he raised his glass mud in your eye frank and robertson both had glasses in front of them they drank with him the bourbon ran down his throat like sourmash fire whew he shook his head tastes funny this time of day yeah it doesnt go with powdered eggs thats for damn sure major robertson waved his hands sure isnt stopping anybody though its like it was us this is even worse than that radium bomb in frankfurt who wouldve thought anything could be howard frank said gloomily he put his head in his hands had he drunk himself sad already not a world record maybe but pretty fast his voice was muffled as he went on we are screwed we are so fucking screwed not yet goddammit robertson said the fanatics can annoy us they can embarrass us but they cant beat us they cant make us pack up and gonot a chance in church gentlemen they flatout arent strong enough the only people who can beat us is us he frowned uh are us hell you know what i mean yeah lou said thats why were screwed elections coming up what happens when all the people whore squealing get out of germany now go into congress so fucking screwed frank intoned again as if it were a dirge and so it was much too likely to be red army doesnt have to worry about this election shit robertson said uncle joe tells em hop and up they go fanatics are giving them a hard time too lou said theyre finding out how much fun the other end of a partisan war is they dont like it for beans thats for sure robertson agreed their warcrimes peopleall officers you knowcuss as much as they can in english or german then they go back to russian and really cut loose we ought to do more with their intelligence people by god we really should lou said weve got the same enemy just like we did before ve day a considerable silence followed lou considered itunhappilywhile major frank and major robertson looked at each other how far into his mouth had he stuck his foot at last voice gentle frank said that wont go very far if you try to push it up the line i told you so before the bourbon at an unaccustomed hour might have hit lou harder than he figured for he said why dammit about time somebody did ezra robertson looked down into his nowempty glass you know what paf stands for captain he asked quietly lou nodded you picked up all kinds of weird stuff in the cic most of it you put right back down again because you couldnt use it but bits and pieces stuck whether you could use them or not premature antifascist lou said guys who went to spain to fight for the republic and like that yeah and like that robertson agreed guys who couldve given us a lot of special help during the regular fighting too only most of em never got the chance on account of we didnt trust em as far as we could throw em you go yelling we should team up with the nkvd youll end up in that same basket yknow im no red lou said some of the americans whod come over to administer prostrate germany had had those leanings a few of them were now working directly for uncle joe because theyd headed for the soviet zone one jump ahead of the internal investigators we know you arent major frank said but if you start talking about working with the russians youll bump up against people whove never heard of you before and theyll nail you to the cross ezra robertson added oy lou said dryly howard frank snorted major robertson didnt get it lou hadnt expected him togoys would be goys lou only wished he thought the new englander was wrong with a sigh he went on might almost be worth throwing away my army career for i think it needs doing wouldnt just be your army career robertson said youd fubar your whole life every place you looked for a job people would go hes the one who you dont believe me find one of those guys who fought in the lincoln brigade and see how much fun hes had wearing paf ever since he might have been talking about the weather he couldnt have been much more matteroffact if he were and he seemed more likely to know what he was talking about than most weathermen of lous acquaintance lou remembered the frenchman whod gone into the seine talk about luck shit lou said he got back up and headed for the bar again one double wasnt enough to get him where he wanted to go as the pfc built him a refill he decided two might not get him there either oberscharfuhrer klein came into reinhard heydrichs office with a stack of newspapers that had found their wayherefrom the french zone and from france itself they all went on and on about the downfall of the eiffel tower and about what france was doing to pay the germans back after quickly flipping through them heydrich asked have you seen these hans ive looked at a few of em anyhow the veteran noncom answered sounds like the frenchies are pissing themselvesand pissing on us it does doesnt it heydrich said not without satisfaction and it sounds like theres a regular partisan war going on in the french zone plenty of people will pick up a rifle when they think what happens to them if they dont will be worse ja i saw that too klein said more than one of the stories blame it all on us heydrichite fanatics they say he sounded proud of the label scheisse said heydrich himself our people arent doing anything in the french zone right now nothing you hear me i ordered our cells there to stay quiet because i knew the french would go out of their minds for a while if voss managed to bring the tower down theyre bad enough anywaymuch worse than the englanders or the americans sometimes theyre worse than the damned russians too klein said well the damned russians really did beat the wehrmacht in the end that makes them feel better heydrich said the french never didthe angloamericans had to rescue them so theyre still afraid their cocks are too small and they act tough to try and make up for it hans klein guffawed thats telling em sir the only thing theyll do in the occupation zone is get us more recruits heydrich said anybody whos willing to grab a gun and fight them on his own is liable to be someone we can use if our people are lying low how do we find em how do they find us klein asked heydrich only shrugged well manage well do it later if we dont do it right away were in this for the long haul hans if were still down here in or then we are thats all klein looked down at his hand if we are ill be pale as a ghost remember to take your vitamin d tablet heydrich said but i dont think well still be down here then we have the will for the struggle however long it takes do our enemies i dont think so sound trucks blared jerry duncans message to the people in his district reelect duncan bring our boys home from germany keep us prosperous jerry knew reelect was the magic word once you got in you had to do something pretty stupid to make the voters want to throw you out or things had to go into the toilet the way they had in the depression herbert hoover dragged his whole party down the drain with him but they had a chance to come back here in at last jerry thought germany was harry trumans mess nobody elses more and more democrats winced every time they stood up to support the president douglas catledges posters said dont throw victory away how much of a victory was it though when the eiffel tower lay in ruins president truman doesnt want to listen to the american people duncan shouted at a speech in a park in anderson his wife stood on the platform with him along with the mayor of anderson and a couple of councilmen the weather was gray and cool summer giving way to fall the forecast had said it might rain but that seemed to be holding off jerry was gladhe had a good crowd on this saturday afternoon truman doesnt want to listen he repeated louder this time he doesnt want to bring our soldiers home from germany well if he doesnt want to we just have to make him thats all people clapped their hands they cheered oh a few hecklers lurked in the crowd they jeered and hooted some of them tried to start a sieg heil chant that was trumans best argumenttarring people whod had enough with the nazi brush but jerrys backers didnt let the sieg heil chorus get started they hustled the chanters away a few scuffles broke out but cops kept things from getting out of hand when you dont have a plan of your own you smear the man who does jerry adlibbed and got another hand he went on we dont have any business in germany any more were just getting sucked deeper and deeper into this swamp he held up a newspaper yesterday six more gis got killed in what people call the american zone another thirteen got wounded lucky thirteen right the laugh that rippled up was bitter scornfulnot at him but at the president no more truman we need a new man somebody yelled that won a hand tooa bigger one than jerry had got we do need a new man jerry agreed but we have to wait two more years for that in the meantime we have to bring the man weve got to his senses no more blank checks for our stupidity across the atlantic no more money to keep our soldiers in germany unless we start bringing them home right away that did it the crowd erupted more hecklers tried to break up the tumultuous applause they got shouted down take a look at whats happening in the french zone jerry said the french tried to get revenge for the eiffel tower and what did they end up with their very own shooting war even worse than the one were stuck with in our zone and do you know whatll happen next ill tell you what theyll come begging us to pull their chestnuts out of the fire we had to do it in we had to do it two years ago too they sure cant take care of themselves theyve proved that over and over again more cheers you couldnt go wrong taking shots at france jerry had thought about trotting out the french war debt from world war i but held off clobbering truman was more likely to get his followers all hot and bothered and he had plenty to clobber truman about foreign policy was one thing if you had a son or a brother or a husband stuck in germany it mattered to you but if you didnt what happened overseas didnt seem to count so much on the other hand everybody had to eat how many of youve tried to buy hamburger any time lately jerry asked a forest of hands went up how many of you managed to do it he asked quite a few of the hands went down how many of you paid less than a dollar a pound he inquired not a single hand stayed up jerry waved to show he got it didnt think so i know my wife paid a dollar and seven centsdidnt you sweetheart betsy duncan nodded jerry finished and ill tell you something else i know too i know thats a shame and a disgrace and a crime had he got hands like that every time he went up onto the stump he could have been elected president himself president hell he could have been elected popeand he wasnt even catholic vladimir bokov felt himself cast back in time to the bad days the dark days of and the hitlerites had had the bit between their teeth then they did whatever they chose to do and the soviet union had to react to it well the soviet union did react and react well otherwise captain bokov wouldnt have been prowling through the ruined streets of berlin instead some sicherheitsdienst officer would have stalked through wrecked moscow trying to keep stubborn soviet partisans from damaging the city any more bozhemoi bokov muttered shaking his head this work had to be getting to him if pictures like that formed in his head it was he knew it was and he knew why despite the biggest military victory in the history of the world the ussr was reacting to the nazis again the heydrichites blasted radium all over the heart of frankfurt soviet technicians had to check everything and everyone bound for the motherland from germany to make sure no radium went along inconvenient so what expensive so what timeconsuming again so what so said moscow against whose orders there was no appeal now the fascist bandits had managed to knock over the eiffel tower which meantto moscow it meant all prominent cultural monuments in eastern europe needed special guards to keep the same thing from happening to them inconvenient expensive timeconsuming so what stalin had decided that the ussr wouldnt be humiliated the way france had been bokov had heard that stalin couldnt stand de gaulle visiting moscow de gaulle had called the battle of stalingrad a symbol of our common victories over the enemy stalin hadnt asked what french victories though bokov thought he himself might have were he in the marshals position but stalin never took de gaulle seriously again after that either more guards protected the monument commemorating the red armys liberation of berlin than any others that was the one that had to gall the heydrichites the most the troops around it understood oh yes comrade captain said a red army major commanding a battalion we know they may try and hit us well they can try but they wont get through unless theyve gone and stashed some tanks nearby theres a cheery thought bokov exclaimed do you think they could have no that no the major shook his head and even if they did they wouldnt get far everybody in our ts and stalin tanks would start shooting off everything he had the second he laid eyes on one of those slabsided nazi contraptions da bokov said the bandits had stowed away small arms and antitank rockets and mortars in truly horrendous quantities but those were all small and easy to hide panzers werent which didnt mean you couldnt play games with them bokov remembered one stunt the wehrmacht and the red army had each used against the other before the surrender are you sure the fascist hyenas cant steal any of our tanks and use them to fuck us over the major blinked whether at the idea or the language bokov wasnt sure comrade captain i am not responsible for tank security the man said slowly i command infantry the tanks are under the jurisdiction of the divisions armored regiment not many red army officers were willing to move even a centimeter beyond their stated duties they would follow orders no matter how harebrained or suicidal or die trying knowing there was no excuse for disobedience when it came to showing initiativethey didnt say what you would about the germans they could think for themselves in the field this major wore decorations on his chest he still dared not do anything outside his assigned sphere and do i bokov wondered he looked west if the soviets worked with the angloamericans and even the french against the heydrichites instead of apart from the western alliesif he proposed it his superiors would tell him no colonel shteinberg was dead right about that if he tried to do it without proposing ithe sighed if he was lucky theyd shoot him for espionage if he wasnt theyd spend a long time hurting him and then shoot him for espionage so much for my initiative and moral courage chastened bokov dragged himself back to the business at hand i will consult with the officers in armor then he said he saw the relief in the majors gray eyes as he took his leave the red army had more guns but the nkvd still made people shiver talking with the commanders from the armored regiment turned out to be a good idea they hadnt thought the bandits might try to hijack a tank or two we will strengthen the guard force around the tank park immediately comrade captain a lieutenant colonelsurkov his name wassaid thank you for bringing this to our notice if something had gone wrong he made a small choking noise that was about what would have happened to him all rightagain if he was lucky even now the lieutenant colonel might get reprimanded for inadequate readiness but he wouldnt get his shoulder boards torn off he wouldnt get shipped to a gulag and vladimir bokov went back to his office and drafted a memo about alertness in the armored forces it went out to units all over the soviet zoneand for all he knew elsewhere in eastern europe too it might do some good whether it would do as much as cooperating with the angloamericanshe didnt have the initiative to find out oh this here was cute sergeant toby benton said watcha got lou weissberg asked they were only a couple of hundred yards outside the barbedwire perimeter around american headquarters in nuremberg you see how this paintings got a wire coming off itlooks like it might be part of the wire that hung it to the wall the explosives expert said right lou nodded he saw it when the oklahoman pointed it out hed learned a lot from benton but he wouldnt make an ordnance man if he lived another fifty years and he wouldnt live anywhere near that long if he tried the trade paintings old looks like it might be worth a little somethin but the dogface who found it reckoned it might be boobytrapped so he didnt pull it off the wall he called the explosives guysmeinstead good thing too on account of that wire leads to a bouncing betty in the wall oh my lou said in shrill falsetto he crossed his hands in front of his crotch like a pretty girl surprised skinnydipping some nazi engineer must have won himself a bonus for the betty when the mine went off a small charge kicked the main charge up in the air the main charge blew up at waist height and sprayed shrapnel all around too many american soldiers were singing soprano for real benton nodded uhhuh but that aint the worst captain gevalt lou said toby benton had worked with him often enough to have a notion of what that meant after a moment lou went on so whats worse than a bouncing betty i tore up the wall to get at the son of a bitch benton answered but i didnt want to lift it out right away yknow maybe i watched too many movies or somethin i kinda got to thinking this here is mighty slickmaybe even a little too slick so instead of taking out the bouncing betty like i usually woulda done i dug down underneath the bastard instead yeah lou said yeah sergeant benton nodded and i found me another wire goin down below the building an that son of a bitch was attached to a ton and a half of tnt with a delay fuse so it woulda gone off after there was a good old crowd here takin care of the poor sorry shitheel who blew his nuts off with the bouncing bettyor to pat the explosives guy on the back when he really wasnt smart enough wow lou said that didnt seem remotely adequate he tried again ill write you up for a medal write me up so i can go on home sir toby said id like those orders a fuck of a lot better an you can sing that in church yeah well i believe you lou said shit ill even try god knows you just earned yourself a ticket to the states but it wont do any good i can tell you right now what the brassll say this guy is good we cant afford to discharge him cause too many peoplell get hurt if we do well if that dont beat all benton said disgustedly if i do me a crappy job i get my sorry ass blown up if i do me a great job they make me stick aroundsos i can get my sorry ass blown up he spat on the filthy floor ought to be a name for somethin like that where you get fucked over comin an goin yeah its a heller all right one of these days i bet there will lou got a strange kick out of thinking like an english teacher instead of a counterintelligence officer a guy whos been through the mill will write a story or a book about it hell hang some kind of handle on it and from then on everybodyll call it that toby benton let out a thoughtful grunt well maybe so till then fucked over comin an goin works good enough sure does lou agreed he shook his head the classroom inside it vanished he was back in bombedout stinking fanaticinfested nuremberg again doing uncle sams job not his old one aw shit he thought wearily how long would itve taken for heydrichs fuckers to set this up well you dont sneak in a ton and a half of explosives an bury em overnight not if you dont want the sentries yonder and the patrols and all to spot you while youre doin it benton answered yeah lous voice was sour i figured youd say something like that so weve got fanatics hiding out inside of nuremberg huh and theres bound to be ordinary krauts who know just who the assholes are too only stands to reason but have they said anything to us dont you wish aint there a reward for that kinda information toby asked certainly it came out more like soitainly as if lou were curly from the three stooges you know how long a german who turns stoolie usually lives afterwards sergeant benton chewed on that he grunted again then he said likely makes my line of work look downright safe by comparison the average guy in his line of work had a life expectancy measured in monthssometimes in weeks he was far above average which along with fool luck especially at the start was why he was still breathing and unfortunately he was dead right here we have to make the jerries like us better than they like the fanatics or we have to make em more afraid of us so far we havent managed either one you find an answer there sergeant and ill get you home if i have to carry you on my back lou said wont hold my breath you smart guys cant fix it dont expect me to benton said lou sighed i will write you up for the medal whether you want it or not its something i can do it seemed a gi could only get what he didnt want fucked over comin an goin rang in lous mind again xix bernie cobb was not a happy man occupation duty in erlangen hadnt been so bad oh you looked sideways at about every third jerry you passed on the street but hed kind of got used to that and erlangen wasnt a big city yeah the fanatics had bumped off that adenauer guy there but that was just one of those things halfremembered bits of cole porter spun through his headsomething about gossamer wings he wished he had some right this minute what he was doing now wasnt occupation duty it was warno other name for it he was part of a skirmish line combing through a valley somewhere in the alps looking forwell anything that didnt belong there some of the things that didnt belong here were krauts with rifles and schmeissers and machine guns not all of them were heydrichs diehards the rest were just brigands theyd lived by robbery all through the war and hadnt felt like quitting after the surrender but they could kill you every bit as dead as any fanatic yeah those gossamer wings would come in handy all right bernie imagined flying above the rocky landscape spying out trouble thatd be hard to spot from the ground then he imagined some asshole in a ragged wehrmacht greatcoat doing antiaircraft work with an mg his imagination came back to earth with a thump the same way he would if the bastard shot him down his breath smoked his short eisenhower jacket didnt keep him warm enough fall was here sure enough erlangen was cooler than albuquerqueall of europe that hed seen was cooler than albuquerquebut in summer that was okay now tramping through these miserable mountain valleyshe shook his head and exhaled more fog haystacks dotted the valleys all the grass was going yellow because of the night freezes so the stacks were less picturesque than they would have been a few weeks earlier that didnt mean they were any less dangerous haystacks were great to sleep in and to hole up in bernied found that out for himself plenty of times before the surrender he and his buddies warily approached the closest stack they fanned out so they could make sure nobody was hiding on the far side inside was harder to be sure about raus bernie yelled hande hoch nobody came out with his hands up want me to give it a burst another dogface asked hefting his grease gun bet your ass roscoe bernie said the rest of the gis stood clear roscoe sprayed three short bursts through the haystack nobody staggered out bleeding and wailing either okay this ones clean another soldier said is now by god bernie agreed if some german hiding in there had just quietly died with his brains blown out bernie wouldnt shed a tear son of a bitch had the chance to give up that was more than he wouldve given the guys hunting him the americans tramped on bernie lit a cigarette a few hundred yards off a gi in another group of troops waved silently asking what the gunfire meant bernies answering wave said everything was jake the distant soldier gave back one more flourish to show he got it then he returned to his own hunt bernies bunch came to a farmhouse and outbuildings the farmer was about fifty so maybe hed put in his time and maybe he hadnt his skinny wife eyed the americans as if shed just taken a big swig of vinegar they had a daughter who mightve been cute if she hadnt looked even more sour than her ma and on the mantel they had a framed photo of a young man in the uniform of a wehrmacht junior noncom bernie pointed at it and raised an eyebrow ostfront the farmer said tot a sad shrug gefangen another one dead or captured fighting the russians said roscoe who had the usual gi bits and pieces of german yeah i got it too bernie said he pointed at the farmer soldat du westfront ostfront nein bauer durchaus krieg the man replied in elementary deutsch german for morons not that bernie cared he got the answer he neededthe guy claimed hed farmed all through the war and maybe the kraut was even telling the truth he was wearing patched overalls like an okie fleeing the dust bowl in the s his shirt and shoes werent wehrmacht issue either a lot of germans hung on to their army clothes because those were all they had this stuff wasnt any better than what the jerries got from the wehrmacht but it was different lets search the joint bernie said maybe mother and daughter vinegar phiz knew some english because they looked even nastier than they had before it did them exactly no good they might have got themselves shot if they did anything more than glare but they didnt the gis turned the place upside down and inside out they opened drawers and scattered clothes all over the floor some of them got a giggle out of throwing womens underwear around they poked and prodded the mattress and bedclothes and lifted them up to check underneath they found a stash of dirty pictures with plump naked frauleins doing amazing things to men with oldfashioned haircuts those were good for a giggle too several guys helped themselves to the best ones bernie wondered how the farmer would explain them to his picklefaced wife that wasnt his worry thank god what they didnt find were any weapons the most lethal things in the place were the kitchen knives they went out to the barn and the other outbuildings guys whod grown up on farms back in the states led the search there again they came up with nothing maybe these people really didnt hang around with bandits danke schon bernie said as the soldiers started to leave he tossed the farmer a pack of luckies it wouldnt square things but it might help by the farmers expression and by some of the things he muttered under his breath it didnt if any of heydrichs fanatics wanted to hide here from now on the guy would probably serve them roast goose and red cabbage well too goddamn bad as the gis trudged away the farmers wife started screeching at him oh boy is he gonna catch it roscoe said not without sympathy he had one of the farmers finest photos carefully tucked into a breast pocket they hadnt gone more than a few hundred yards when they came to the place where a mineshaft plunged into the hillside it wasnt much to look at a roughly rectangular hole a little bigger all the way around than a man was tall bernie went in as far as the light reached which wasnt very spider webs shrouded support timbers that looked as if theyd stood there since napoleons day or maybe martin luthers but you never could tell this was the kind of stuff theyd been sent out to find one of the guys had a radio set on his back instead of his ordinary pack he was already on the horn to divisional hq when bernie came out of the shaft bernie told him what little hed seen and the radioman passed it on he listened for a little while then gave the word theyll send a search team and a demolition team were supposed to wait till they get here and then support the search team suits bernie said he flopped down in front of the big black hole in the ground and lit a cigarette some of the dogfaces dug out kration cans and chowed down others promptly started snoring bernie had lost the knack for sleeping on bare ground and wasnt sorry he had but if they kept giving him shit like this to do he might have to get it back the demolition squad and the searchers showed up a couple of hours later bernie wasnt anxious to go back into the mine but he did it the search team brought flashlights that could have doubled as billy clubs you oughta sell these suckers to mps bernie said turning his this way and that all he saw was carvedout gray rock and more of those ancient support timbers his boots thumped on the stone floor of the shaft not a halfbad notion damn snowdropsd be dumb enough to fork over said a corporal on the search team bernie snickered the mps white helmets and gloves gave them the scornful nickname hold up somebody called from ahead big old cavein here this is the end of the road bernie glanced at the corporal the twostriper was already turning around bernie wasnt sorry to follow him outnot even a little bit everybody out a man from the demolition squad yelled into the shaft no one answered bernie looked around all his people were standing outside the mine the sergeant in charge of the search team seemed to have all his guys too the demolitions people placed their charges they backed away from the opening again bernie wasnt sorry to follow the man whod yelled used the detonator boom it wasnt so loud as bernied expected dust spurted out of the shaft when it cleared the hole was gone full of fallen rock thatll do it he said yeah agreed the soldier whod touched off the blast nobody going in or out of there now all we gotta do is seal off about a million more of these motherfuckers and weve got it licked erright bernie wished he hadnt put it that way it made him think hed be tramping through these miserable mountains forever he looked around hell he was liable to be boom the explosion was a long way off which didnt mean reinhard heydrich didnt hear it he swore the amis had just plugged one of the ways into and out of his underground redoubt they didnt know theyd done that of course all the shafts that led down here were artfully camouflaged to look as if they deadended even so things had picked up the amis wanted him dead theyd wanted him dead before of course but now they really wanted him dead they wanted him dead enough to put some real work into killing him into killing him in particular because he was what and who he was not because he was some nazi diehard i should thank them for the compliment he thought wryly hed got under their skin hed hurt the enemy enough to make the enemy want to hurt him back no to make the enemy need to hurt him back this wasnt just war it was politics too american elections were coming up soon if the amis could show off photos of reinhard heydrichs mutilated corpse their hardliners would win votes ladies and gentlemen we got him it would go out over the radio in the newspapers in their magazines and the oppression of germany would go on clausewitz said war was an extension of politics by other means hitler had oftentoo oftenforgotten that now that the fuhrer was dead heydrich could look at him and his policies more objectively and heydrich didnt have the mighty wehrmacht at his back the mighty wehrmacht was rotting meat and scrap metal heydrich couldnt bludgeon foes out of the way he had to keep stinging them wasplike till they decided germany was more trouble than it was worth and left on their own he wanted to stay alive too he wanted to enjoy the free germany hed created and he especially didnt want to die if dying gave the occupying powers an advantage and hurt the rebuilding reich hans klein walked in they arent coming after us good heydrich nodded i didnt think they would we spent a lot of time and a lot of reichsmarks making the holes in the ground that lead in here look like holes in the ground that dont go anywhere when youre playing bridge one peek is worth a thousand finesses klein said when youre playing our game one traitors worth a thousand tonnes of camouflage heydrich grunted nothing like a cynical noncom to put his finger on your weakness we havent had to worry about that so far the reichsprotektor said weve been lucky so far klein retorted again heydrich couldnt very well tell him he was talking through his hat klein damn well wasnt at least heydrich had the sense to see as much plenty of people whod yelled heil hitler as loud as anybody were serving the angloamericans now or they were licking the lickspittle frenchmens boots or else kowtowing to stalin the way theyd once bowed down to their proper fuhrer when such folk made conspicuous nuisances of themselves heydrichs men disposed of them a sniper from meters a bomb planted in an automobile or posted in a package poison at a favorite eaterythere were all kinds of ways collaborators knew they had to be careful some of them decided the risk wasnt worth it and quit collaborating every one like that counted as a victory but the enemy also had his weapons one of them was cold hard cash heydrich remembered the huge price on his head a million us dollars now wasnt it would that be enough to tempt some sniveling little judas whod got sick of staying cooped up in a hole in the ground for years heydrich nodded to himself a million dollars was plenty for a traitor to buy himself an estate and a rolls and the kind of pussy that went with an estate and a rolls then all hed need to worry about was his former friends revenge he might figure the resistance movement would die with heydrich he might be right too though the reichsprotektor didnt think so if the resistance had gone on after hitler died it would go on after heydrich too jochen peiper was more than capable in his own rightand freedom for germany was more important than any one man which didnt mean treason couldnt hurt people do have to keep their eyes open heydrich said thats right klein agreed you cant push it too hard though not when weve all been down here so long folks stop listening to you anything you have to say over and over starts sounding like quatsch uh sir and you not even a berliner heydrich said with a mocksorrowful shake of the head but the slang word for bilge was understood all over germany these days after some thought heydrich nodded much more seriously that is one of the troubles with a fight like this well if you think the warnings get to where they do more harm than good let me know will do herr reichsprotektor klein promised heydrich had no doubt he would too klein was solid you couldnt win a war without leaders but you also couldnt win it without reliable followers heydrich would have paid a reward of his own to bring in more just like hans klein meanwhileweve lost one doorway weve still got plenty if they think we cant hurt them nowtheyll find out november election day sunny but chilly in anderson early in the morning jerry duncan and his wife made the ceremonial stroll from their house to the polling place a couple of blocks away sure enough two or three reporters and their accompanying photographers stood waiting on the sidewalk wave to the nice people bets jerry said in a low voice and followed his own advice betsy duncan did too also quietly she answered i know what to do its not like this is the first time nope jerry agreed the one whod be sweating rivets was douglas catledge duncan didnt think the democrat had ever run for anything before he came back from the war who you gonna vote for congressman one of the reporters called who do you think ea jerry said e a stuart grinned one of the other reporters laughed out loud it was funny and then again it wasnt about every other election you heard of some little raceschool board maybe or town councilmandecided by one vote sometimes it was decided whenoops one candidate chivalrously voted for his opponent like any serious politician jerry believed in winning more than he believed in chivalry the polling place was in the auditorium of an elementary school jerry shook hands with people in there till an election officiala skinny old lady and undoubtedly a democratsaid no electioneering within a hundred feet of the polls i wasnt electioneeringjust meeting friends jerry lied easily he got his ballot went into a booth and pulled the curtain shut behind him after hed marked his ballot he folded it up and gave it to the clerk in charge of the ballot box that worthy stuffed it into the slot mr duncan has voted he intoned ceremoniously betsy came out of her booth a moment later the clerk took her ballot too mrs duncan has voted flashbulbs from the photographers cameras filled the dingy auditorium with bursts of harsh white light the walk back to the house was attended only by e a stuart jerryd hoped he would get to be an ordinary human being on the way home but no such luck what will you do if the republicans win a majority today stuart asked celebrate betsy answered before jerry could open his mouth chuckling jerry said shes right you can write it down i think the first thing well do after that is try and bring our boys home from germany president truman wont like it ea stuart predicted jerry tried to remember his full handle but couldnt it was something ridiculous and biblicalhe knew that no wonder he went by his initials trumans had a year and a half to fix the mess jerry said he hasnt done itnot even close things are worse now than they were right after the surrender if he wont get cracking on his own well just have to make him move and if the democrats hold on stuart asked jerry and betsy duncan made identical faces the reporter laughed i cant quote expressions folks he said awww jerry said and e a stuart laughed again he tried another question would you oppose the occupation so strongly if diana mcgraw hadnt mobilized opinion against it betsys step faltered ever so slightly she was jealous of diana jerry hadnt given her any reason to be but she was what she didnt know about a few young pretty clerktypists back in washington wouldnt hurt her he picked his words with care of course mrs mcgraw comes from my district he stressed mrs for his wifes benefit that makes me pay some extra attention to her views but the presidents disastrous policy would have sparked opposition with her or without her i have to think i would have been part of it okay stuart said scribbling now jerry held up a hand can we hold the rest for tonight or tomorrow then ill know whats what right now id just be building castles in the air okay well sure e a stuart smiled crookedly but thats half the fun maybe for you jerry turned into his own walk a mans home was his castle and reporters and other barbarians could damn well wait outside the polls closed at seven jerry and betsy were at his campaign headquartersa storefront three doors down from the bijouat five past radios turned to cbs rca and mutual stations blared returns some people had trouble straining information out of electionnight chaos not jerry he could pick the east coast nuggets from all the random chatter and all the nuggets seemed pure gold democrat after democrat was losing or trailing significantly as the pundits liked to say republican after republican claimed victory excitement made jerrys fingertips tingle it had been so long so very long and now we have the first returns from indiana one of the radio announcers said everybody at campaign headquarters yelled for everybody else to shut up while people were yelling the announcer read off the returns in spite of jerrys ear he couldnt make them out downstate someone said were leading three to two is that all someone else sounded disappointed downstate indiana down by the ohio river was as solidly republican as anywhere in the country still three to two wasnt half bad not by any standards and most of the votes might have come from some local democratic stronghold till you knew provenance you had to be careful about what the raw numbers meant in the suburbs of indianapolis the announcer went on incumbent jerry duncan leads his democratic challenger the totals are to in what are still preliminary results cheers erupted so did a few fourletter words aimed at the man on the radio people from anderson and muncie didnt like to hear their towns called suburbs of indianapolis when you got right down to it they were but folks didnt like to hear it or think about it what were the numbers like two years ago i dont remember exactly betsy said not as good as they are now i was only up by maybe a hundred votes at this stage of things like most politicos jerry had total recall for all the returns in every election hed ever contested but he was also cautious cant tell too much yet besides who knows where these votes come from okay betsy said but i sure like it a lot better than i would if you were behind by that much he laughed well when you put it like that so do i the air got thick with cigarette smoke and the odd pipe and cigar then it got thicker jerry was puffing away like everybody else but he didnt like it when his eyes started to sting and water that took a good thing too far more good news kept blaring out of the radio this does look like a repudiation of harry trumans domestic and foreign policy a broadcaster said unless things out west dramatically change the situation the republican party stands to gain control of both houses of congress for the first time since the hoover administration more cheers jerry shouted along with everybody else but he couldnt help wishing the guy on the radio hadnt mentioned hoover if ever there was a jinx but not even the ghost of hoover and the depression could jinx the gop tonight around half past ten when jerrys lead had swelled to over votes one of the telephones at campaign headquarters jangled the staffer who answered it waved to try to cut the hubbub in the room not having much luck he bellowed its douglas catledge congressman jerry jumped to his feet and hurried over to the phone the campaign workers yelled and clapped and stamped their feet but when jerry waved for quiet he got it he grabbed the handset saying thanks irv he talked into the telephone this is jerry duncan hello congressman doug catledge here the young democrat sounded tired and sad but determined about the way jerry would have sounded in his shoes one of these days i will sound that way going to washington is always a roundtrip ticket but not today thank god jerry thought after an audible deep breath his opponent went on i called to congratulate youon your reelection thank you very much doug thats mighty gracious of you jerry said you ran a strong campaign i was worried right up till the polls closed he hadnt been hed thought things looked pretty good but if the other fellow was gracious you had to follow suit kind of you to say so catledge replied if you dont mind my two cents worth now i do hope youll softpedal the pullout foolishness you spouted the past few weeks jerry frowned douglas catledge had lost not least because he backed trumans policies and he was telling jerry what to do go peddle your papers sonny jerry came that close to saying it out loud but no just because the other guy couldnt mind his manners didnt mean jerry had to imitate him what he did say was the fight over there costs more men and more cash than we can afford our dollar is falling against the swiss franc and the canadian dollar and even the mexican peso it would be falling against the pound but englands stuck in this flypaper too if we run away from germany either the russians grab all of it or the nazis come back in and start getting ready for world war iii catledge said i dont think either one helps the united states i dont think either one is anything weve got to worry about not as long as we have the atom bomb jerry answered good night mr catledge he wasnt about to argue not tonight good night douglas catledge said sadly i still think youre making a bad mistake i know you do but the voters dont jerry said good night once more and hung up hed got the last word so had the voters the only word that mattered in an election jerry stood up and held up his hands everybody in the crowded room looked his way my opponent has just generously conceded he told the campaign workers i want to thank him and i want to thank all of you for making my victory possible im the one whos going back to washington but i couldnt possibly do it alone thanks again to every one of you from the bottom of my heart he got another round of applause he went over and kissed betsy then somebody stuck a lighted cigar in his mouth he didnt usually smoke them but he took a few puffs with it held at a jaunty angle while the photographers snapped away it was like a victory lap at the indianapolis as soon as the photographers were done he stuck the cheroot in an ashtray and forgot about it diana mcgraw walked into the campaign headquarters about fifteen minutes later the campaign workers gave her a hand too jerry joined in his wife he noticed didnt no betsy never came out and said anything about diana but she didnt need words to make her feelings plain congratulations diana said when the radio said catledge had conceded i figured i could come over without causing too much distraction were going to have another term jerry said betsys smile might have been painted on another term diana agreed how long do you think it will take to get the bonehead in the white house to bring our men home good question if trumans shown one thing its that hes at least as stubborn as fdr ever was jerry answered but congress holds the purse strings diana said if you dont give him the money to keep troops in germany have to see what things look like what the lineup is after they count all the votes jerry said hed been trying to make that calculation himself knowing the numbers of republicans and democrats in the upcoming eightieth congress would help only so much some democrats would steer clear of truman for fear of losing the next time around while some republicans would stick with him because they were scared of stalinor just because the people in their districts thought occupying germany was still a good idea diana of course had her sights set on one thing and one thing only the sooner the boys come home the sooner no more mothers will start hating the western union delivery boy she said how were you supposed to answer that jerry couldnt all the more so because he thought she was right but she seemed sure the election would make things happen as if by magic as a multiterm congressman jerry duncan knew better thered be plenty of horse trading and log rolling before anything got done washington was like that it always had been if it ever changed he would be astonished if truman wont see reason you ought to impeach him and throw him out on his ear diana said jerry held up a hand like a traffic cop at a busy intersection dont even try to get anybody to talk impeachment youd only be wasting your time and no one would listen to you he said trumans not doing anything unconstitutional hes just wrong theres a big difference if they impeached everybody in washington who was wrong the placed be empty inside of two weeks betsy said if youre wrong enough diana began maybe she had something too if roosevelt had been on the point of losing the war wouldnt people have run him out of town on a rail jerry suspected they wouldwhich in those days would have left henry wallace president of the united states a genuinely scary thought truman had no vice president at the moment that would make the speaker of the house president if he got impeached and the new speaker would be a republican ed mcgraw read the paper while he ate bacon and eggs over easy and toast with butter and jam and smoked a cigarette well he said looks like youve got the kind of congress youre gonna need what are the final numbers diana asked around a mouthful of toastshe was eating breakfast too her husband read from the frontpage story if present trends continue the house in the eightieth congress will consist of at least republicans democrats and one american labor party member the final eight races are too close for a winner to be declared in the senate there will be at least fiftythree republicans and fortytwo democrats again the final senate race is still up in the air thats amazing diana said the democrats had big majorities in both houses of congress the last time around ed rustled the newspaper to show he wasnt done yet this historic reversal is surpassed in recent times only by the democratic sweep that went with franklin d roosevelts election he read pundits believe many of the voters who turned to the gop yesterday did so in protest against president trumans costly and bloody occupation of germany diana mcgraws opposition movement galvanized voter unhappiness he grinned at her around the cigarette which was about to singe his lips how about that babe you and zinc and sheet metal in the nick of time the butt went into the ashtray how about that diana echoed she didnt quite get the joke but ed had been making factory jokes she didnt quite get ever since they were newlyweds she went on jerry said something like that last night but hes on the same side as we are so its hard to take him all that seriously jerry ed mcgraw shoveled in a forkful he took a bite of toast then he lit another cigarette ever figure youd call a congressman by his first name youve got to be kidding diana started to say that the congressmans wife didnt like it very much she swallowed the words before they came out why have ed wondering whether betsy duncan had a good reason not to like it that would set ed wondering too which wouldnt be good when nothing was going on between her and jerry and she realized a beat later it would be even worse if something were going on youre hot stuff kiddo ed took the cigarette butt out of his mouth long enough to drink some coffee after that it went right back in but ive known you were hot stuff since high school oh you she said fondly she never had confessed some of the things that went on in the back seat of his beatup old chevy before they got married what the priest in the booth didnt know wouldnt hurt himand god of course had already seen it so how does it feel he asked hed never looked for any of the limelight himself he wasnt that kind of man all he cared about were his house and his job and their family you know all these big shots you met the president and everything you get your name in the papers i wish nobodyd ever heard of me diana said that would mean we had pat back to hell with all this other stuff no she didnt usually swear in front of her husband she hardly noticed doing it this time ed didnt notice at all his big bald head bobbed up and down you got that right oh boy do you ever id trade anything for another minute with him even but you dont get those chances over again you sure dont diana drained her own coffee mug she looked at the clock above the stove it always ran fast but she made the correction without conscious thought youd better get going i know i know ed stood up he grabbed his sheetmetal dinner pail tongue sandwich in here sure goodone of my favorites ed leaned down and brushed his lips across hers leaving affection and the smell of tobacco smoke behind then he was out the door and heading for work right on time ever since they got married hed been as reliable as the machines he tended diana smiled as the pontiac backed down the driveway and chugged out into the street ed was reliable here toonot just on the job she didnt want him to think she was running around even if he didnt always leave her glowing in bed any more hed never given her any reason to think he was not even during the war when all those rosie the riveter types flooded into the plant some of themplenty of them in dianas jaundiced opinionwere looking for more than work if theyd found it they hadnt found it with ed reaching across the kitchen table diana snagged the newspaper ed always got it first because he had to hustle out the doorand not to put too fine a point on it because he was the man but she could look it over now it had maps and charts showing senators and representatives by party in the old congress and the new no doubt jerry was right yes i do know my congressman by his first name diana thought some republicans would back the occupation while some democrats would vote against it but the more republicans in congress the better the chances it would end soon you didnt need a crystal ball to see that we will bring them home diana said there in the empty kitchen it would have been empty even if pat did come home he wouldve gone off to work with ed but it would have been a different empty it wouldnt have been such an aching emptiness pat would have been gone but he wouldnt have been gone diana nodded to herself pretty soon nobody else would have to worry about the aching kind of emptiness she hoped xx more than a year and a half after the war in europe was supposed to have ended london remained a sorry miserable place food was still rationed so was coal people wore greatcoats even indoors demobilized soldiers seemed to huddle in theirs as they ambled along looking for workbut jobs were as hard to come by as everything else in britain these days police constable cedric mitchell counted himself lucky hed had his position reserved for him when he came back from the warif he came back plenty of his mates hadnt hed made it across the channel from dunkirk in a tugboat that got strafed by two stukas then hed gone to north africa and then on to the slow bloody slog up the italian boot now he had a military medal a great puckered scar on the outside of his right thigh and nightmares that woke him up shrieking and sweating once or twice a week he also had a new dream that wasnt so nasty to retire to algiers or naples or somewhere else with decent weather one day down in those countries winter didnt mean long long nights and fogs and endless coughs and shivers he wouldnt have believed it if he hadnt seen it with his own eyes but he damn well had italys wasted on the bloody eyties he muttered his breath adding to the mist that swirled in front of parliament fucking wasted he walked his beat back and forth back and forth the most lethal weapon he carried was a billy club thinking of that made him snort which also added to the mist no jerryd sneak up behind him and cut his throat here no stinking dago who still loved mussolinid chuck a german potatomasher grenade into his foxhole he didnt need a sten gun or a fighting knife or an entrenching toolwhich could be a lot more lethal than a knife if you knew what to do with it and he did a fellow in american pinks and greenskhaki trousers and olivedrab jacketlooked left before he stepped out into st margarets street watch yourself yank pc mitchell shouted the american froze a truck rumbled past from the direction in which he hadnt looked jesus he said why dont you guys drive the right way we think we do mitchell answered and since youre over here youd jolly well better think so too thats the third time the past two weeks i almost got myself creamed the yank said do you suppose you ought to suspect a trend but mitchell didnt say it even though the americans were two years late getting into the wara year better than the last time around at thattheyd done all right once they got going hed fought alongside them in italy so he knew theyd paid their dues and britain would have gone under without the supplies they sent so well have a care crossing was what did come out of mitchells mouth his sergeant would have been proud of him he beckoned the american on seems safe enough now it seemed safe enough before the yank said darkly but he made it from the houses of parliament to westminster abbey without getting run down not that many cars were on the road petrol was still rationed too and hard to come by pc mitchell wondered how long the country would need to get back to normal then he wondered if it ever would india wanted to leave the empire and nothing short of another war seemed likely to keep it in without india what was left wasnt worth tuppence hapenny and there wouldnt be a war on the far side of the world when germany only a long spit away had turned into a running sore blam no sooner had mitchell heard the explosion than he was flat on his belly it hadnt knocked him overhed hit the dirt that was a hell of a big bomb going off somewhere not far enough awaynot close enough to hurt him but nowhere near far enough away across the street the yank in pinks and greens had also flattened out like a hedgehog smashed by a lorry hes seen action too then mitchell thought as he started to scramble to his feet lorries no sooner had they crossed his mind than a big oneone of the kind the usa had built by the millions during the warcame tearing down the middle of the street toward him it was as if the driver knew he ought to stay on the left but had trouble remembering jesus mitchell said furiously blowing his whistle just what the poor sorry world needed a drunken yank driving a deuceandahalf like hed just been let out of the asylum then pc cedric mitchell got one glimpse of the drivers face as the fellow swerved across the street toward westminster abbey the bloke was a nutter all right but not that kind of nutter not barking mad but exalted mad he had the face of someone about to do something marvelous and the devil with the consequences he had a face that made pc mitchell hit the dirt again right after nazi fanatics bombed the eiffel tower soldiers had appeared in front of parliament and westminster abbey and buckingham palace and st pauls and a few other places then when nothing happened they vanished again mitchell had most of a second to wish men with rifles and sten guns were anywhere close byor even that bobbies like him carried firearms then the fanatic in the truckand he couldnt have been anything elsetouched it off the other explosion had been too close for comfort frightening but not dangerous this onewhen this one went off it was like getting stuck in the middle of the end of the world much too much like that in fact blast picked pc mitchell up and slammed him into something hard oof he said and then ow he could barely hear himself even though that second noise came closer to a shriek than a yelp blast had also smashed at his ears had the nazi struck at parliament mitchell would have been nothing more than a smear on the sidewalk but hed steered his truck into westminster abbey before detonating itand god help that poor bloody american in his smart uniform broken glass clattered and clinked down around the bobby a big sharp shard shattered between his legs he shuddered a foot higher up and that one would have cut it right off him or left him with no need to shave for the rest of his days he snuffled as he staggered to his feet a swipe at his nose with his sleeve showed he was bleeding there like a mad bastard no great surprise he realized he was lucky he was still breathing blast could tear up your lungs kill you from the inside out and not leave a mark on you hed seen that more than once fighting north through italy no broken ribs grated and stabbed when he moved that was nothing but fool luck and his bobbys helmet had kept him from smashing his head it wasnt anywhere near so tough as an armystyle tin hat but evidently it was tough enough across the streetevery english or british sovereign since william the conqueror was crowned in westminster abbey the bulk of the structure dated from the reign of henry iii in the late thirteenth century not all of it was ancient the tomb of the unknown soldier from the last war was in the west nave no had been in the west nave the abbeyd come through the blitz and the later unmanned german doodlebugs and the even more terrifying vs without much damage but cedric mitchell couldnt imagine a building in the world that would have come through unscathed if a deuceandahalf stuffed to the gills with high explosives blew up alongside it and westminster abbey hadnt through rags of mist and through much more roiling dustliterally the dust of centurieshe saw the abbey was nothing more than rubble and wreckage but for the size of the pile it might have been an italian countrytown church hit by shellfire flames started licking through the brick and stone and timber wood burnedmitchell shook his head trying to clear it of course wood burns you bloody twit so does anything with paint on it to his slackjawed amazement people came staggering and limping and crawling out of the rubble a priest in bloodied vestments lurched up to him and saidwell something police constable mitchell cupped a scraped hand behind his right ear whats that mate he bawled his mouth was all bloody too was he also bleeding from the ears he wouldnt have been a bit surprised more caught in there the priest shouted loud enough this time for mitchell to make out the words will you help ill do my damnedest mitchell answered the words didnt seem blasphemous to him till later the injured priest took them in stride another wall went over with a crash that made mitchell flinch anything loud enough for him to hear was liable to be frightening he followed the priest across st margarets to the ruin they both had to skirt the crater the exploding lorry had blown in the pavement water was rapidly filling it bloody nazi must have wrecked the pipes mitchell said the priest a pace in front of him didnt turn around the other mans ears must have suffered in the blast too a womans legs lay under some bricks together the bobby and the priest pulled some of them off her then mitchell twisted away wishing they hadnt what was left of her upper body wasnt pretty how do we get revenge for this he bawled into the priests ear i dont know the man answered it may be unchristian of me to say so but we need to do that dont we here and st pauls thats where the other one was pc mitchell broke in the priest nodded mitchell swore not that that would do any good either would anything he didnt think so now lou weissberg had seen both stars and stripes and the international heraldtrib no english shutterbug seemed to have matched the photographer whod snapped the eiffel tower in midtopple no picture of st pauls splendid dome collapsing nor of westminster abbey falling down only rubble and wreckage and bodies and rage some of it came from clement attlees labour government the germans show why their ancestors were named vandals attlee thunderedas well as a mild little bald man with a scrawny mustache could thunder destruction and murder for the sake of destruction and murder will settle nothing and will only rouse the hatred of the entire civilized world that was good as far as it went a lot of englishmen didnt think it went nearly far enough winston churchill wandering in the wilderness after the electorate turned him out of office the year before aimed his thunder at the labour government how could these barbarous swine smuggle the tools of their filthy trade into our fair country he demanded how could they do so altogether undetected someone had blundered tennyson said the poet never claimed to know who i hope we shall do rather better than that in getting to the bottom of our shameful failure here major frank walked into lous office while he was drowning his sorrows in coffee somehow this latest outrage didnt make him want to run out and get crocked the way the fall of the eiffel tower had maybe you could get used to anything even enormities wasnt that a cheery thought howard frank pointed to the picture of the ruins of st pauls on the front page of the heraldtrib well the fuckers got the frogs and they got the limeys he said next thing you know theyll make it to washington and blow up the capitol lou eyed him if they wait till the new congress gets sworn in next january before they try it theyll do the country a big favor now now frank clucked at him like a mother reproaching a little boy we have to respect the will of the people my ass lou said and then a long beat later sir dammit we really do major frank said if we dont whats the difference between us and the fucking nazis what did trotsky tell one of the guys who followed him everybody has the right to be stupid comrade but you abuse the privilege something like that anyhow lou said well the american people are abusing the privilege right now goddammit and well all end up paying cause they are treason frank said sadly damn straight lou agreed call the mps and haul me off to leavenworth ill be a hell of a lot safer in kansas than i am here if they dont get to take me away they dont get to take you either frank said and i aint going anywhere ha thats what you think lou told him fucking isolationists in congress wont give truman two bits to keep us here well all be heading home pretty damn quick got a cigarette on you you give me all this crap i dont need and then you bum butts offa me major frank shook his head in mock disbelief i oughta tell you to geh kak afen yam despite the earthy yiddish phrase he tossed a pack down onto the newspapers on lous desk when lou picked it up and started to extract a cigarette he paused because his eye caught a phrase hed missed before heres heydrich the smarmy son of a bitch thus we remind the oppressors that the will to freedom still burns strong in germany and were gonna turn our backs on this shit and just go home he did light up then and sucked in smoke as hard as he could frank reclaimed the pack he lit a cigarette of his own way you talk im one of the jerks who want to run away im on your side lou yeah i know sir honest i do but lous wave was expansive enough to cover two continents worth of discontent and the atlantic between them do these people want to fight another war in fifteen or twenty years do they think the nazis wont take over again if we quit or the russians if the nazis dont what we need is heydrichs head nailed to the wall howard frank said if we get rid of him and things start settling down maybe we can make the occupation work after all thatd be something lou agreed not much luck yet down in the mountains though a few weapons caches but those are all over the fucking country no alpine redoubtor if there is its as close to invisible as makes no difference those may not be the same thing frank said thoughtfully huh lou said also thoughtfully and then youve got a point redoubt or not though you know what germany is these days sure a fucking mess frank answered i mean besides that lou said its like one of those smalltown china shops with a sign in the window that goes you drop it you break it you pay for it and we dropped it and we broke it and were paying for it boy are we ever major frank said but what the folks back home cant see is well end up paying even more later on if we bail out now hell could you see that if your kid came home in a box a year and a half after hitler blew his brains out and the nazis surrendered i dont know sirhonest to god i dont lou stubbed out his cigarette which had got very small all the butts in the ashtray would get mixed in with the general trash and then thrown out and once the stuff got beyond the barbedwire perimeter the krauts would pick through it like packrats and get hold of every gram of tobacco and every scrap of crust of burnt toast times were tough here that it was the jerries own goddamn fault made it no less true well there you are then frank had kept on with the conversation while lous wits wandered yeah here i am lou agreed and you know what else no matter how fucked up this lousy place is i need to be here so do you so do weall of us but how much longer will all the big brains back in washington let us do what we gotta do you get that one right lou you win the sixtyfour dollars howard frank said berlin was a ravaged city no two ways about it and yet vladimir bokov had come to realize it could have been worse the wehrmacht had done the bulk of its fighting off to the east trying to hold the red army away from the german capital blocks in berlinespecially blocks around the seat of the nazi governmenthad got smashed up certainly but not every block every house had been fought over till one side or the other could fight no more in that berlin differed from stalingrad or kharkov or warsaw or budapest or konigsberg ora hundred or a thousand other places large and small on the eastern front the germans would be able to rebuild berlin faster because of that the women and kids and stooped old men chucking broken bricks into bins one by one had only millions to dispose of not tens of millions the way they would have if every building had been wrecked captain bokov grimaced the soviet line proclaimed that the german people werent the ussrs enemies only the former hitlerite regime and the heydrichite bandits who wanted to resurrect it bokov wasnt stupid enough to criticize the soviet line an nkvd officer who did something like thatassuming anyone could be so idioticwould soon discover just how far north of the arctic circle his country built camps but even if he wouldnt say so out loud bokov was a lot more suspicious of the german people than soviet propaganda suggested he ought to be that kid with the peach fuzz and the drippy nose and the mittens full of holes who was chucking rubble into a bucketwas he old enough to have toted a rifle or a schmeisser the last year of the declared war sure he was the volkssturm had sucked in plenty of younger guys and the scrawny bastard working next to him the one with the gray stubble and the limpwhat had he done before he got hurt he warily watched bokov letting his eyes drift down or away whenever the nkvd man looked in his direction he probably wasnt wearing an explosive vest right nowhe was too skinny but if he put one on with a raggedy greatcoat to camouflage it and went looking for a crowd of russiansno the only germans bokov was sure he could trust close to him were naked women even then hed heard stories that some of them deliberately spread disease to put occupiers out of action he didnt know that was true but it wouldnt have surprised him hed seen that the germans deserved their reputation for thoroughness no one whod been through one of their murder factories could possibly doubt it why wouldnt they use infected prostitutes as a weapon then a bullet cracked past his head he forgot about subtle weapons like syphilitic whores not a goddamn thing subtle about rifle fire he heard the report as he threw himself flat in the wreckagestrewn street had to be a sniper shooting from long range if the round beat its sound by so much another bullet pierced the air where hed stood a moment before it spanged off a paving stone behind him a woman screeched and clutched at her arm the ricochet must have got her three or four red army soldiers most of them carrying ppsh submachine guns trotted purposefully in the direction from which the gunfire had come the germans in the work gangexcept the wounded womanstarted making themselves scarce they knew the soviet union took hostages when somebody fired at its troops they knew the russians shot hostages too bokov didnt have time to worry about that right now he wriggled behind the burntout rusting carcass of a german halftrack that had sat there since the last battle one of these days somebody would haul it off for scrap metal but that hadnt happened yet he waited for another shot unlike a softskinned vehicle the halftrack really would protect him against smallarms fire but the sniper didnt shoot at bokov or at the red army men now going after him since hed failed he seemed to want to get away and shoot at somebody else another time cautiously captain bokov peered out from behind the halftracks dented front bumper if the sniper had outguessed him if the son of a bitch had drawn a bead on the front end of the halftrack and was waiting for him to show himselfwell in that case bokovs story wouldnt have a happy ending but no bokovs sigh reminded him hed been holding his breath the soldiers were heading for a block of flats that had to be almost a kilometer away yes a marksman could hit from that range bokov didnt like turning into a targetwhich wouldnt matter a kopeks worth to the damned heydrichite with the scopesighted rifle no more gunfire from the distant apartment block bokov stood up straight and brushed dust and mud off his uniform he started toward the flats himself his eyes flicked back and forth if the sniper missed him again he wanted to know where to dive next more soldiers came around a corner they also headed for the apartments they went in germans started coming out any of them over the age of twelve might have been the gunman bokov didnt think any of them was if the shooter wasnt long gone he would have been surprised a senior sergeant whod been with the first bunch walked up to him saluting the man said well comrade captain we have enough of these bastards for the firing squads good enough bokov answered did your men find any weapons or antisoviet propaganda in the flats no weapons sir the underofficer suddenly looked apprehensive we werent really searching for propaganda we could go back no never mind bokov said the sergeants sigh of relief wasnt much different from the one hed let out himself behind the german halftrack if you had found something like that it might have told us whod want to harbor one of the bandits since you didnt he shrugged question the lot of them if you dont learn anything interesting give them to the firing squads if you do bring the ones who know something over to nkvd headquarters and execute the rest have you got that da comrade captain with another sharp salute the senior sergeant repeated bokovs orders back to him he wore several decorations bokov wouldnt have been surprised if hed led a company during the war more than a few underofficers had casualties among lieutenants and captains being what they were his look and manner proclaimed him a competent man all right then carry on the nkvd officer said da the sergeant repeated then he added something he didnt have to glad the son of a bitch missed you sir this kind of crap just goes on and on there doesnt seem to be any end for it does there and too damned often weve got to carry off the poor bastard who stopped one thats no good you know we won this fucking wardidnt we bokov could have sent him to the gulag for those last two imperfectly confident words he could have but he didnt the senior sergeant made it plain he cared whether an nkvd man lived or died from a red army trooper that was close to miraculous by the way they talked most soviet soldiers had more sympathy for heydrichites than they did for chekists when bokov got back to his office moisei shteinberg greeted him with well volodya i hear you had an adventure this morning afraid so comrade colonel bokov agreed sniper missed memissed me twice in fact he got away afterwards dammit the fascist bandits will probably reprimand him for bad shooting i shouldnt wonder shteinberg was so serious he destroyed bokovs small pleasure at his own joke after a moment the colonel went on weve been lucky over here for a while now the heydrichites havent used any radium against us and they havent pulled off any outrages against us either the way they did in paris and london how long can that last bokov wondered aloud colonel shteinbergs eyes were dark heavylidded and narrow not slanted like a tartarsor like those of so many russians bokov includedbut definitely narrow they were also very very knowing a jews eyes in other words bokov had never thought of them that way before but when he did the notion fit like a rifle round in its chamber yes a jews eyes after studying bokov a long moment the jewthe senior nkvd officergently inquired have you no confidence in the ability of the soviet system to defend itself against the fascist bandits what a minefield lay under one innocentsounding question i have perfect confidence that our system will triumph in the end captain bokov answered with the greatest of careand also took care not to show how careful he was but no one can know ahead of time the road by which it will triumph or how strongly the reactionaries will be able to resist khorosho volodya ochen khorosho the smile that flickered across shteinbergs face said he appreciate the response no less than he might have savored a particularly lovely passage in a new shostakovich symphony still even if its a good answer it doesnt tell us how to keep such disasters from happening to us shrugging bokov said we work hard we hope we stay lucky he paused wondering whether to press his own luck with colonel shteinberg pleased with him he decided to and maybe we really ought to work more with the angloamericans no matter how pleased shteinberg was he shook his head without the least hesitation nyet he said firmly dont even waste your time thinking about it it wont happen and youve got no idea how much trouble youll end up in if you suggest it to anybody but me i keep trying to tell you that but you dont want to listen all right comrade colonel by the way bokov said it it wasnt but his superior wouldnt come down on him for that still seems a shame though sending a good officer to kolyma would be a shame too shteinberg observed since kolyma in far eastern siberia was one of those places that lay well above the arctic circle bokov decided not to press the argument any further too bad but you did have to live if theyd let you stand clear the demolitions guy yelled bernie cobb figured he was already well beyond anything the charge in the throat of the old mine could throw he backed up a few more paces just the same some chances he got paidnot enough but paidto take this wasnt one of them several other gis also retreated a few steps the first sergeant with the detonator looked around one more time fire in the hole he yelled and rammed the plunger home boom bernie had heard a lot of explosions like this one he watched dust and a few rocks fly out of the mouth of the shaft none of the rocks came anywhere near his buddies and him they all knew how far to back up by now as the dust settled he saw that the shaft was closed presumably for good he nodded to himself the fellow with the explosives knew what he was doing which was reassuring if you handled that shit you needed to know what was going on anyone who didnt would end up slightly dead or more than slightly and a butterfingers was liable to take some ordinary dogfaces with him too the thought had hardly crossed bernies mind before something out of the ordinary happened most of the timeall the time up till nowthered been the explosion and the roar as the mouth of the shaft fell in and that was it except that wasnt it not today things down underground kept falling over it was like listening to a house of cards collapse if you could imagine cards made of rock and each about the size of a bus holy moses said one of the gis standing alongside of bernie son of a bitch another one added meaning about the same thing jesus h christ said the first sergeant with the detonator i figured this was a little blind shaft like all the others i closed off sure dont seem like it god only knows what alls under there we sure as shit cant get at it from here any moreyou can sing that in church for a bad moment bernied feared the top kick would order the men to get out their entrenching tools and start digging through the rubble clogging the top of the shaft but for a wonder the man had better sense maybe he realized hed get the shaft if he tried giving an order like that whatever was in there youre rightwe wont get at it now bernie said to drive home the point nope the demolitions man agreed sounded like a whole bunch of dominoes falling over down below yeah it did bernie grinned the other guyd come up with a better figure of speech than he had himself somewhere back in the states an english teacher would have been happy if only she knew maybe we could use pows to dig it out the first sergeant said thoughtfully yeah maybe bernie didnt want to come right out and say he didnt think that was such a hot idea he let his tone of voice do it for him and the demolitions mans rueful chuckle said bernie had got the message to garcia or maybe not the explosives expert said some of those guys hate the nazis worsen we do cant blame em eitherthe nazis got their asses shot off sure sarge but most of the pows who hate the nazis hate em because they lost the war not because they started in the first place bernie said i know but i wasnt done yet the demolitions man answered some of em hate the nazis like i said before but theres othersif they saw a chance to duck into a tunnel and run straight to heydrichs assholes theyd do it like that he snapped his fingers boy would they ever so maybe putting pows to work here aint the smartest notion since tom edison came up with the fucking light bulb bernie grinned at him you find a couple of those fucking light bulbs pass one on to me all ive seen is the regular kind shit you dont need a special light bulb to fuck these kraut broads the first sergeant answered a pack of luckiesll do it or a few cans of krats you cant get your ashes hauled here you aint half tryin man since bernied discovered the same thing he would have left it right there but one of the guys in his squada new draftee poor devilsaid what about the orders against waddayacallitagainst uh fraternization he pronounced the word with the excessive care of somebody who wasnt sure what it meant well what about em the first sergeant returned look buddy nobodys gonna make you fuck one of these german gals but if you want to theyre pushovers hell after the jerries knocked france out of the war the french broads lay down and spread for em like nobodys business now were the winners and if you see how skinny some of these german gals are youll know why they put out too its against orders the new guy said some people were like that if somebody told them what to do and what not to they followed through right on the button and they were happy acting that way bernied seen it before it saved them the trouble of thinking for themselves he figured a hell of a lot of germans worked that way what else did such a good job of explaining how theyd lined up behind hitler fine its against orders the demolitions man spoke with exaggerated patience i look at it this way if the broads aint playing mata hari with meor if they are long as i dont tell em anything they shouldnt knowim gonna have me a good time and the way things are nowadays even if i come down venereal so what a couple of shots in the ass and im ready to hop in the sack again hell of an age we live in aint it you come down venereal the brassll give you a bad time the draftee observed sure they willif they hear about it the first sergeant agreed indulgently some people though some people know a corpsman or a sawbones wholl give em some of this penicillin shit and not bother filling out all the paperwork afterwards know what i mean after some very visible thought the new guy decided he did know by his expression he hadnt been so surprised since his mother regretfully informed him the stork didnt bring babies and leave them under cabbage leaves and how long ago had that been maybe six months before he got his greetings letter from selective service bernie wouldnt have been surprised but what the kid knew about the facts of life wasnt bernies problem this underground collapse was or could be maybe we dont use pows to find out what happened under there he said we ought get there some kind of way though bulldozer crew nah a coupla dozers the first sergeant said beats working those mothers can dig fastern a companys worth of guys with picks and shovels that idea bernie did like you have the pull to get em he asked oh hell yes the demolitions man answered the first sergeant in an engineering battalion he owes me from before the surrender i tell him we need a couple of ds up here theyll come pronto dont worry your pretty little head about that bernie snorted i been called a whole lotta things since i got sucked into the army but never pretty not till now anyway the demolitions man eyed him yeah well i can see why the other guys in bernies squad chuckled even the new draftee thought that was funny its okay you wont put lana turner out of business any time soon either bernie said the first sergeant grinned at him theyd probably never see each other again so they could both sling the sass without getting hot and bothered it also wouldnt bother bernie if the bulldozers uncovered something juicy he didnt expect ithed given up expecting anything muchbut it wouldnt bother him one bit xxi one of the first tricks heydrichs fanatics had tried was still among the nastier ones they used as a matter of fact the germans had trotted this one out even before the surrender so maybe some bright wehrmacht feldwebel dreamt it up stretch a wire across a road at just above windshield height on a jeep and youd get anybody who was inside by the neck scuttlebutt said the diehards had decapitated a few gis with that little stunt lou weissberg didnt believe it and he was in a better position to know than most american soldiers he supposed it might be possible if the wire was stretched good and tight and the jeep was really hauling ass but the next confirmed report he saw would be the first which didnt mean a wire stretched across a road couldnt put an unlucky or careless dogface in the hospital in miserable winter weather like this snow alternating with freezing rain youd never see a wire till you were way too close to stop that was why the jeep lou rode in like most in the american zone had a wire cutter mounted on the hood most jeeps in the british french and soviet zones also mounted wire cutters these days the contraption made from a couple of welded steel bars would part any wire like moses parting the red sea these days casualties from murder wires were few and far between lou wondered why the fanatics kept running the risk of stretching them across highways he supposed it was because theyd got used to doing it when it still accomplished something it wasnt as if they were the only military force ever to get bogged down in routine he remarked on that to his current driver a swarthy fellow who went by rocky and had five oclock shadow at ten in the morning rocky swore and spat as the jeep rattled along between nuremberg and munich fuck lieutenant nice to think something these assholes try dont work so hot he said wellyeah lou hadnt thought of it like that he wished rocky hadnt either the driver had a grease gun on the seat beside him where he could grab it in a hurry lou carried acaliber m carbine which gave him about as much firepower as a submachine gun but he also manned the jeeps pintlemountedcaliber browning that baby could reach out over a mile and kill anything it reached a damn nice weapon to have all the same he and rocky both kind of hunkered down whenever they passed a wrecked german or american vehicle by the side of the road they did that at least every few hundred yardssometimes a lot more often where fighterbombers had rocketed or just shot up a column on the move you never knew whether some bastard lurked in or behind a burntout hulk if he popped up and let fly with an antitank rocket your fancycaliber machine gun might not do you one goddamn bit of good youd have a panzerfaust up the ass and hed duck back down before you could even get a shot off at him almost rocky said after they rolled past a seventyton king tiger tank that some colossal explosion had flipped over onto its side lou tried to imagine what it took to do that to one of the fearsomely lethaland fearsomely immensepanzers he had trouble coming up with anything plausible answering rocky seemed easier i wont be sorry to see the end of ill tell you that he said but then the driver said back when those nazi cocksuckers signed the surrender did you figure youd still be here now maybe to get rid of war criminals lou said uncomfortably i didnt think the fightingd still be going who could have yeah who rocky gunned the jeep to hustle past a dead panzer iv those babies werent nearly so dangerous as king tigersthey made a pretty fair match for say a sherman the krauts had had a lot more of them than king tigers but nowhere near enough a rocket had blown the turret clean off of this one when the iv proved really and truly dead rocky went on me i wont be sorry if congress ships us all home only way well ever get there looks like to me you want to fight another war in fifteen twenty years lou demanded shit captain ill worry about that thenor ill let my nephew worry about it hes like six or seven now rocky answered what i know for sure is i dont want to fight this motherfucking war any more ive paid my dues and then some fifteen twenty years till we go again i think that sounds pretty goddamn good lou stared at him as he might have stared at a blue giraffe in a zoo were people really shortsighted enough to think like that of course they were why else was the incoming eightieth congress full of folks who wanted to pretend that the united states could walk away from europe without anything bad happening afterwards but they werent pretending they really believed it that was even scarier they drove through some trees lou didnt know whether to swing the heavy machine gun to the left or the right he feared it wouldnt do much good either way because he couldnt see very far in either direction well with luck any lurking german fanatics also couldnt see very far only trouble with that was he couldnt know ahead of time where the fanatics lurked they already had a pretty good notion where the road was they could have their rocket launchers or machine guns all sighted in spang the wire cutter mounted on the jeeps hood did its job greatest thing since rocky started he never got sliced bread out the world blew up before he could that was how it seemed to lou anyhow one second he was grinning along with rocky this wirecutting wonder damn well was the greatest thing since sliced bread american ingenuity and knowhow beat the evil fanatics again it was an ending straight out of a hollywood serial except it wasnt the next second lou flew through the air with the greatest of ease he fetched up against a tree trunk on the far side of the road with an oy followed a moment later by a louder more heartfelt shit that stab when he inhaled had to mean at least one fractured rib if he hadnt been a good boy and worn his helmet the way orders said he was supposed to he likely would have had a fractured skull to go with it he wasnt a hundred percent positive he didnt anyway he was sure as hell seeing double as he struggled to sit up and at that hed been lucky getting blown clear of the jeep was the best thing that could have happened to him well actually not getting into the jeep at all would have been luckier but it was way too late to worry about that now way too late to worry about the blasted jeep too it had slewed sideways and caught fire whatever blasted it to hell and gone must have killed rocky he wouldnt have been pretty even without the flames he seemed to be in several chunks muzzily lou tried to figure out what the devil had happened theyd taken care of that damn wire and then shit lou said again on a different note this time cutting the wire must have touched off whatever explosive charge the fanatics had hooked up to it explosive charge and fragments it wouldnt have done that to rockyand to the jeepwithout plenty of fragments a buried mm shell maybe the blast seemed about right for something like that if lou had been catholic he would have made the sign of the cross he realized how lucky he was not to be ground round himself lucky yeahand rocky caught some of the fragments that would have torn him up instead the only good thing you could say about rocky was that he never knew what hit him one second he was being happy about the wire cutters the next blam no he couldnt have suffered much not when he ended up looking likethat lou hauled himself to his feet that made the rib or ribs stab him again it also informed him that one of his ankles could have been working better he scowled at the wire cutters which he now saw through a curtain of flames and smokeand through a deeper curtain of apprehension if you took them off jeeps the fanatics wires would start causing casualties again but if you left them on how many wires would turn out to be hooked up to big old artillery shells youd find out pretty damn quick boy would you ever the hard way something warm dripped from lous nose blood he discovered when he wiped it on his sleeve no surprise there blast could have broken both eardrums as easily as not it could have torn up his lungs too if hed been inhaling instead of exhaling if could have done all kinds of things it hadntquitedone all it did was earn him a purple heart just what i fucking need he thought doing his best not to breathe deeply after a moment he realized the improvised bomb had done something else it had turned rocky who wanted to get the hell out of germany into a statistic that argued for doing just that he would be the whatever and sixth gi killed in germany since what the papers were calling the socalled surrender and lou had just made the statistics himself he would be the whatever and twentyninth american soldier wounded since ve day hot damn he muttered and then shit one more time vladimir bokov remembered last years new years eve much too well influenza and benzedrine made a lousy combination they went even worse with woodalcohol poisoning damn the heydrichites anyway theyd taken out far too many firstrate soviet officers with that stunt some of the men who replaced those casualties couldnt tie their own boots without reading the manual first others didnt have the brains to read the manual things could be worse colonel shteinberg said when bokov complained out loud hows that sir bokov asked well the heydrichites could be holding their own victory banquet right now the senior nkvd officer replied youre right bokov admitted it isnt that bad but it isnt good either for instance comrade colonelhow many times have you been in a jeep that cut a garroting wire stretched across the road a few more than a few in fact that was a clever gadget our technicians came up with shteinberg said why vladimir bokov happened to know an american noncom had invented the wire cutters that sat on the hoods of most jeeps in germany these days he also knew shteinberg wouldnt listen if he said anything like that out loud it was beside the point anyway be careful if you cut another wire thats all was what he did say oh how come moisei shteinberg asked because heydrichs bandits have started hooking those wires to mm and mm shells buried by the side of the road bokov answered the wire gets stretched the wire gets broken and bam colonel shteinberg understood what that meant all right gevalt he exclaimed captain bokov blinked his superior spouted yiddish about as often as he spouted mat shteinberg had to be truly provoked to come out with either by the way he hastily lit a cigarette he wanted to pretend he hadnt done it here he blew out smoke and sighed one more way for the heydrichites to get in our hair im afraid so bokov said damned if we do and damned if we dont if you know what i mean weve already had some casualties on account of this so have the americans i gather nice to know the fascist hyenas arent saving all their cute tricks for us alone shteinberg said i suppose this reports on my desk too it just hasnt surfaced yet believe me comrade colonel i understand that bokov spoke with great sincerity even though he swam easily through the sea of soviet bureaucracy he said what else does more than paperwork to keep us from accomplishing anything really important shteinberg sent a meditative plume of smoke up toward the ceiling maybe youre right maybe i ought to send you to a camp for saying such a thing maybe youre right and i ought to send you to a camp for saying such a thing captain bokov laughed he didnt think shteinberg was serious on the other hand the only way you knew for sure when someone was serious about a crack like that was when the burly chekists knocked on your door in the wee small hours bokov had made it through the frightful nights of and he hoped times like those would never come again besides shteinberg continued as if what hed just said meant nothing at all exactly what bokov hoped it meant unless something goes wrong somewhere else im not getting into a jeep tonight not for anything im not going to drink tonight either not unless i have some german taste the booze first makes sense bokov said remembering last years madness once more and wishing he could forget it perhaps rashly he asked so what will you do then me im playing chess with marshal stalin what else shteinberg said bokov shut up whatever his superior would be doing it had none of your damned business written all over it bokov didnt know what hed be doing as turned into either like shteinberg and for all the same reasons he was leery of drinking on new years eve true the heydrichites probably wouldnt try the same stunt two new years eves in a row but they might decide the soviets would figure they wouldnt try the same stunt twice running and try it anyhow to see what happened why take chances red army soldiersand no doubt their french and angloamerican counterpartsstarted shooting rifles and pistols in the air about half past eleven that gave bokov one more reason for thinking staying quietly indoors was a good idea if you went outside without a helmet a falling bullet could punch your ticket for you just fine and how many murders were getting committed under cover of that smallarms fire by heydrichites by ordinary robbers by husbands sick of wives and wives sick of husbands most of them wouldnt be the nkvds worry for which bokov thankedno not god he decided i thank my good luck frontline soldiers had no trouble sleeping through worse gunfire than this so they insisted especially after they took aboard a good cargo of vodka vladimir bokov hadnt seen the kind of action that would have inured him to such a racket he kept waking up whenever a new set of drunks squeezed off yet another annoying volley bokov also kept going back to sleep no noncom came to shake him out of bed with word of some horrid atrocity from the fascist bandits that might not mean a lot of progress but it meant some and it meant a halfway decent nights sleep if not a great one you took what you could get if it wasnt too great you thanked whatever you thanked that it wasnt too bad bokov finally gave up and got out of bed about half past six it was still dark the sun wouldnt be up for a while yet berlin was only three or four degrees of latitude south of moscow it had long summer days and long winter nights bokov rubbed his chin whiskers rasped under his fingers his beard wasnt especially heavy but hed have to shave this morning a jeep started up outside bokov went to the window to see what was going on it might have been raiders taking off after planting a bomb it might have been but it wasnt it was colonel shteinberg taking off with an extraordinarily pretty brunette sunrise might be more than an hour and a half away but bokov had no trouble seeing that the soviet barracks blazed with light to help hold the heydrichites at bay well well bokov said softly and then again well well plenty of soviet officers were screwing german women that general hed visited in dresden sprang to mind it wasnt encouraged though raping german women had been at least unofficially as the red army stormed into the reich but the soviets didnt try to declare it offlimits the way the us army did the women were there they were in no position to say no of course men would screw them moisei shteinberg thoughfor one thing he was nkvd which meant he had more to keep quiet about than most red army men for another he was a jew was he avenging himself every time he stuck it in there or was he just a man who got horny like any other man even if hed had his cock clipped interesting bokov murmured and it might give him a hold on shteinberg it also might not but finding out could be interesting too a new face up there on the rostrum sam rayburn was just another congressman again well not just another congressmanrayburn remained house minority leader but after youd been speaker house minority leader wasnt worth a pitcher of warm piss as john nance garner had famously said and been famously misquoted about another washington office jerry duncan grinned like a fool well pride could do that to a man instead of rayburns combative bald roundfaced visage which made him sound like churchill whom he resembled not at all there was the aristocratic new england countenance of joseph w martin joe had represented his massachusetts district since just after the indians got chased out of it he finally had his reward the gop finally had its reward joe martin was speaker of the house it was a cold day outside cold enough to snow some of the democrats staring up toward joe martin were bound to be thinking a cold day in hell well maybe satan was juggling snowballs because the republicans had their majority back what jerry was thinking was that traffic would go to hell coming from central indiana he took snow for granted washington didnt the town didnt get it often enough people didnt know how to drive in it the street authority or whatever they called it here didnt know how to keep the main highways cleared it would be a mess till it melted joe martin raised the gavel and brought it down again the eightieth congress is now in session he declared there it was official the speaker went on we have a lot of things to try to set right the american people expect it of us nothey demand it of us along with most of the other republicans jerry nodded he had all he could do not to clap his hands the democrats by contrast all looked as if theyd been issued lemons and ordered to suck on them from pearl harbor through vj day congress had shown a bipartisan spirit unusual in its raucous history that wouldnt go on any more its trumans fault not ours jerry thought with the smug righteousness a majority could bring if he didnt want to keep on occupying germany when any idiot can see thats a losing proposition we could get along with him just fine but lets see him occupy germany if we dont give him any money to do it the speaker of the house said the same thing only more politely its time to take a long hard look at our foreign policy its also time to get our fiscal house in order i think well see that the two of those go hand in hand more solemn nods from the republicansand from the democrats who didnt think theyd make it to the eightyfirst congress if truman went on pouring men and money down the german rathole more scowls from the presidents loyalistsand from the republicans who feared hitlers ghost or stalins reality more than they feared the endless bloody bog through which truman insisted on wading behind jerry somebody called and well bring our boys home from overseas the voice wasnt one jerry recognized but that didnt prove anything not on this friday january too many new voices too many new faces hed get to know the new kids on the block pretty soon but he hadnt yet all the rage on both sides that had sizzled just below the surface exploded congressmen shouted congressmen swore some congressmen clapped their hands others shook their fists things must have felt like this just before the country tore itself to pieces when lincoln was elected order order there will be order joe martin shouted plying his gavel with might and main but there was no order bang bang he tried again the sergeant at arms will enforce order the sergeant at arms looked at him as if hed lost his marbles jerry duncan wasnt so sure the poor unhappy functionary was wrong one man couldnt enforce order on well because joe martin up on the rostrum wasnt being disorderly unless they wanted it enforced and right this minute they didnt all they wanted to do was yell at one another we havent got the money to pay for even half the things we really need another new republican congressman bawled he had a bigger rougher voice than the fellow whod first ignited the uproar and he used it like a top sergeant roaring his men forward through an artillery bombardment were going to spend it to blow up innocent people if we can get enough kids to grow old enough for us to send to germany to get their heads blown off for the presidents amusement jerryd only thought things were bad before a skunk at a picnic a photographer at a notell hotel couldnt have raised a tenth the ruckus that furious shout did not so many republicans clapped this time the democrats though shame some of them cried shame and they were the polite ones what the others yelled would have made a dock worker blush what it did to the handful of congresswomenwell they all seemed to be shouting their heads off too order order speaker martin said again this time in something not far from desperation he used his gavel so fiercely jerry duncan was surprised the handle didnt break off in his hand and he gotsomething not far from order anyhow maybe everyone was shocked at how fast things had gone down the drain jerry knew he was censure sam rayburn shouted shaking his fist at the new congressman whod said what he really thought i demand a vote of censure that gentlemanhe spat the wordis a disgrace to the house now mr rayburn joe martin said if we censure everyone who loses his temper and says something unfortunate unfortunate i dont know whether he should be more embarrassed for spouting claptrap or we for listening to it rayburn thundered i move that we censurewhatever the devil the stupid puppys name is second that cry rang out from all over the democratic side of the aisle by the look on joe martins face he was wondering why hed wanted to be speaker in the first place he called for the vote the motion failed to quite a few congressmen sat on their hands jerry voted against the motion though he didnt think the new representative had done himself or his side of the argument any good at least half a dozen republicans voted in favor of censuring him and that was the first day the day that was supposed to be ceremonial and nothing but ceremonial the eightieth congress got livelier from there they issued lou weissberg a corset and a stick when they let him out of the military hospital theyd already given him his purple heart he could have done without it but the brass gave it to him anyway when he came back on duty major frank greeted him with well well look what the cat drug in your mothersir lou answered sweetly i found out how to fly without an airplane if it werent for the honor of the thing idve rather walked you could do worse than steal your jokes from abraham lincoln you could and lou figured he probably would good to have you back any which way and more or less in one piece howard frank told him goddamn good to be back lou said one piecewith a few cracks and chips and shit like that theyd put me on the discount table at woolworths you betcha well the problem hasnt gone away while you were on the bench thats for sure frank said matter of fact you found one of the ways its getting worse care to guess how many mm shells and s and s are lying around germany waiting to get turned into bombs too fucking manythats all i can tell you lou replied government didnt issue me a slide rule or maybe id do better too fucking many is good enough bad enough i mean major frank said one of the fanatics bright boys mustve had a brainstorm cause theyre starting to play all kinds of cute games with shells lately those goddamn trip wires i found out about those all right i found out more than i ever wanted to know lou said yeah i bet you did but thats not the only thing theyre doing if lou was back major frank would bring him up to date come hell or high water that kind of persistence made frank annoying but it also made him a good officer he went on theyve got some of them wired so a guy watching half a mile off can blow em up when he sees theyll do him the most goodhurt us worst i should say figured that out thanks lou said dryly did you frank gave him a wry grin the guy with the detonators long gone natch by the time we trace the wire back to where he was hiding but the wire does let us do some tracing so the assholes have one more stunt some of these shells theyve got em hooked up so they can touch em off by radio fuck lou spoke with great sincerity you said a mouthful howard frank agreed try tracing a radio wave i know i knowwe can do some of that we can do more than the jerries ever thought we could but a signal that lasts this long he snapped his fingers then mournfully shook his head fanatics gone transmitters goneits a majorleague snafu is what it is sure sounds like one lou said does it matter to a kraut if heydrich pins a knights cross on him instead of hitler you dont get a knights cross pinned on you wear it around your neck frank said he was right too lou had interrogated several german supermen whod won the awardit was more or less the equivalent of the distinguished service cross all the same lou made a face now they shoulda sent you to law school he said nah i got good at picking nits the times i was lousy captain frank said lou winced hed had lice more than once himself if you spent much time in the field chances were you would frank added thank god for ddt is all ive got to tell you that shit really works yeah lou nodded enthusiastically hed seen the same thing himself from what retreads said nothing theyd tried in the first world war stopped the cooties but ddt did the trick sure as hell it knocked mosquitoes over the head too and it didnt poison people how could you not like something that slick well anyway like i said its goddamn good to have you back frank told him i did want to get you up to speed as fast as i couldand i wanted to let you know you arent the only guy the fanatics did for with their new trick misery loves company lou said the funny thing was it was true if something happened to a bunch of other guys too you didnt feel quite so bad when it happened to you not that lou had felt good when that or whatever it was went up but well youve got it frank said word is theyre working over the russians the same way too i bet ivan loves that to death lou knew what the red army and the nkvd did when they were unhappy he would have said theyd learned their lessons from the wehrmacht and the gestapo but theyd needed no instruction hostages firing squads mass deportations concentration campsthe russians knew at least as much about such things as the germans before he could say anything more he heard something outside a shoutand a shout in english at that he hadnt heard any gunshots or explosions beforehand but how much did that prove any time peoplefor the shout had definitely come from more than one throatin occupied germany started yelling in english something had hit the fan somewhere son of a bitch major franks mouth thinned to a pale furious line he must have understood the shout where lou hadnt those stupid bastards boy are they gonna catch it huh lou said brilliantly howard frank didnt answer he didnt need to because the shout rang out again louder and closer this time lou made it out with no trouble at all we want to go home the roar was ragged but unmistakable a moment later here it came once more louder still we want to go home oh good god lou said if that wasnt mutiny major frank jumped to his feet and hurried to the window in his office lou followed more sedately with corset and cane he couldnt hurry but he wished he could now and here they came around the corner toward the command center there might have been fifty or sixty of them most were privates but lou saw several corporals and at least one sergeant we want to go home they bawled again quite a few of them carried picket signs as if they were on strike against say an autoparts factory and damned if some of the signs didnt say unfair others said why are we here and demanded how come were dying after the surrender we want to go home the unhappy soldiers yelled one more time theyd attracted mps the way a magnet attracted iron filings but once attracted the snowdrops stood around trying to figure out what to do next they had billy clubs on their belts some carried grease guns others tommy guns but the soldiers they confronted werent rioting they were demonstrating both went against orders but you couldnt beat demonstrators or shoot themcould you lou imagined the headlines if the mps tried by the unhappy look on the military policemens faces they were imagining the headlines too we want to go home some of the gis probably had struck at autoparts plants or the like the line they formed in front of the command center seemed highly practiced they chanted in rough unison the picket signs bobbed up and down we want to go home what are they gonna do lou asked hoarsely meaning not the demonstrating soldiers but the mps and the top brass major frank understood him perfectly i dont know he answered theyve gotta do something if they dont the nuts are running the loony bin yeah lou nodded that was one way to put it all right another way was that if the brass and the mps didnt do something and do it pretty goddamn quick the us army in germany wouldnt be an army any more it would be a mob the door to the command center opened an officer came out and said something to the gis marching in front of the place they stopped chanting long enough to listen to whatever he came out with when he stopped they hesitated but not for long we want to go home it rocked him back on his heels maybe hed thought he would get them arguing among themselves or something no such luck they were more united and more determined than hed figured it wasnt the first time the powers that be had underestimated the rank and file when the officer spoke again the soldiers quieted long enough to hear him out then they gave forth with their much louder counterblast we want to go home okay you asked for it the officer didnt say that but lou read it in every line of his body he gestured to the mps they waded in with their billy clubs just about all of them by then had slung their submachine guns some of the demonstrating soldiers tried to resist they used the handles on their picket signs to hit back at the military police but while the ordinary soldiers had shown pretty good discipline for protesters they couldnt match the welltrained military policemen the mps grabbed and handcuffed as many gis as they could clobbering them whenever they thought they needed to some of the soldiers who threw away their picket signs ran and escaped the others were quickly overcome how long in the stockade dyou think theyll earn lou asked as the demonstration came to pieces before his eyes depends on what they charge em with major frank said if its making a mutiny thats not the stockade thats leavenworthif theyre lucky urk lou said you can draw the death penalty for making a mutiny cant you dont ask me ive got nothing to do with the judge advocates office and im damn glad i dont having denied everything frank pontificated anyway but i think you can at least during wartime is this wartime lou asked i mean yeah the nazis surrendered and all but whats the shooting about if its not those guys can figure that out too having pontificated frank started denying again only thing i know is weve got a mess on our hands yeah like we didnt before i wish lou said okay weve got a bigger mess on our hands now major frank said there you happier no id be happier if heydrich was dead id be a hell of a lot happier if i was going home lou said only difference between me and those dumb assholes is i know better than to lay my neck on the block if we kill heydrich maybe we do get to go home frank said if congress kills the budget maybe we get to go home any which way lou said howard frank frowned but didnt try to contradict him lou wished he would have xxii well boys here i am again harry truman said one eyebrow quirked up toward where his hairline had been once upon a time youve got to have more fun talking with me than you do with joe martin my god that man makes oatmeal look like its made out of chili peppers along with the rest of the press corps tom schmidt chuckled truman knew what he was talking about all right joe martin wasnt the most exciting man god ever made all the samehow does it feel to be working with a republican house and senate somebody called im going to do something a good democrat probably shouldnt im going to quote abraham lincoln president truman replied he said he was like the boy whod got a lickinghe was too big to cry but it hurt too much to laugh more chuckles fdr would never have told a cornpone story like thattom was sure of it but fdr was a year and a half gone more than that now truman was on his own by all appearances he was in over his head too he was the only one who didnt seem to think so what will you do if congress passes a bill cutting off funds for us soldiers in germany another reporter asked veto it truman said calmly and they know i will what if they override the man pressed they havent got the votes the president said even with a few democrats who cant see their nose in front of their face they havent got em so let them try he sounded like a tough little terrier roosevelt would have stuck out his chin but roosevelt had more of a chin to stick out than roundfaced truman roosevelt never had to deal with a republican congress either maybe hed picked the right time to die or he probably would have what about the soldiers strikes in germany sir tom asked when truman nodded at him what about em the president said some of our boys drank some bad schnapps if you want to know what i think a little more than that going on isnt there tom said marches picket signs petitions sounds like more than drunken foolishness to me oh its foolishness all right trumans eyes flashed behind his spectacles he wasnt fdrnot even closebut in his own way he was also nobody you wanted to mess with hed make you sorry if you tried eyes still snapping he went on you know what wouldve happened if american boys tried that kind of nonsense in tell us tom urged along with two other reporters i will tell you by god they wouldve got drumhead courtsmartial they wouldve got blindfolds and cigarettesmiserable french gitanes that tasted like horse manureand pow that wouldve been that good riddance to bad rubbish can we quote you mr president someone asked tom swore under his breath hed intended to quote truman any which way but the president nodded again go right ahead the armys not a factory you dont have the right to strike against the united states of america anybody who thinks he does doesnt think very well hes going to be sorry pretty darn quick thats just the way things are and thats how theyll stay so do you think we ought to shoot these strikers tom asked do you think the communists got to them or maybe the nazis i dont know who got to them i dont know if anybody did truman said all that will come out in the courtsmartial im sure the military judges will do what the evidence suggests what will you do if some of the soldiers get sentenced to death somebody else beat tom to the question which pissed him off will you let the sentence be carried out or will you commute it im not going to judge anyone in advance truman answered i dont have all the evidence in front of me now ill see what the courtsmartial decide and how they decide it then ill do some deciding of my own a reasonable responseto tom no friend of the administration too reasonable to be of much use well he could turn the story however he needed it to go another reporter asked a question about the civil war in china truman said he hoped chiang kaisheks forces would do better that wasnt useful either who didnt hope chiangs soldiers would do better getting them to do better was the problem then the questions turned to domestic policy and tom almost stopped listening as far as the tribune was concerned he was there to hold trumans feet to the fire about germany westbrook pegler had been tearing the democrats a new one on domestic issues for years at last truman said thats all for today boys byebye donkey one of the reporters said as they trooped out of the press room the elephants gonna be living here as soon as the voters send harry t back to missouri dewey taft stassen who do you figure tom asked whoever makes the most noise about bringing the boys back the other reporter answered right now id put my two bucks on taft but its early days yet they arent even around the first turn yeah tom nodded then he grinned i think ive got the lead for my next column he wrote it down so he wouldnt lose it if you had to be anywhere in january los angeles was a pretty good place to be the sun beamed down from a bright blue sky it was over seventy lawns were still green flowers bloomed every now and then diana mcgraw saw a butterfly birds chirped as if it were spring diana even spotted a hummingbird at some of the flowers in front of union station my god she said to the man whod organized this protest rally why does anybody live anywhere else beats me sam yorty answered the california assemblyman was a democrat not only that hed served in the army air force during the war that made him a doubly terrific catch for mothers against the madness in germany he went on i was born in the midwest myself but the only way theyll get me out of california again is feet first what if they send you to washington diana asked would you go there if the voters send me to washington id have to go yorty said youve got to listen to them he might not just listenhe might do some talking of his own and if he did they might well listen to him he was pushing forty with a handsome face a fine head of curly hair and a wry almost impish sense of humor truman isnt listening he added and look whats happening to him not just to him to the country diana said sure i know assemblyman yorty nodded more and more people know more and more people want to do something about it we were going to hold this rally in the angelus temple but in the what diana broke in then the name rang a bell and not one she cared for isnt that where aimee semple mcpherson sam yorty nodded again she started it but shes gone remembershe died during the war anyway the place only holds people thats not enough so weve moved things to gilmore field wheres that diana asked unlike the angelus temple shed never heard of it in hollywood its a ballparkthe stars play there pacific coast league yorty said diana nodded the indianapolis indians of the american association were the hoosier heroes yorty went on anyway we can put people in there that ought to do the job i hope so diana said i never dreamt when i started out that so many people would get behind me im only sorry you had to start out yorty said he remembered about pat then not everybody did even though diana talked about her son almost every time she spoke gilmore field was on beverly boulevard it wasnt that far up and over from her downtown hotel the rally organizers got diana earlier than she thought they needed to when she saw the traffic she understood this was a big city even if it all looked like suburbs picketers marched outside gilmore fields grandstand cops kept them from going any farther and from mixing it up with the people filing into the ballpark heil hitler the picketers yelled at diana and heil heydrich and communist and all the other endearments shed heard from one coast to the other by now the cheers she got when she went out onto the field warmed her so did the weather which was still perfect from what the locals said you couldnt count on that in january even in los angeles but god or the weatherman or somebody was smiling on the rally before diana got to talk sam yorty burned some time introducing celebrities who agreed with her shed never imagined she would meet an actor like ronald reagan but there he was waving up at the people in the stands and blistering truman in three wellspoken minutes several other performers did the same and now yorty said at last the lady who started this ball rolling lets hear it for mrsdianamcgraw diana got another hand louder this time if those picketers were still out there this one was loud enough to make them grind their teeth thank you very much she said into the microphone between second base and the pitchers mound i think ive already been upstaged but thats okay were all on the same side here today right thats right the cry rolled down on her from all around the singledecked grandstand she felt as if shed hit a pennantwinning grand slam in the bottom of the ninth on the last day of the season my son pat would be proud of you she said he went to europe to fight to keep us free he helped win the waror he thought he did but after everybody said it was over he got killed and for what for nothing thats all these poor kids who get murdered every day in germany are dying for for nothing because harry trumans too pigheaded to bring them home thats why theres no other reason at all was this what a ballplayer heard when he did something special and won a big game if it was it was worth playing for all by itself any money the player raked in after that seemed only a bonus germany cant hurt the united states any more we knocked it flat even if we hadnt weve got france and england and the ocean in between diana went on and weve got the atom bomb and the germans all know it if they even think about making trouble we can knock them even flatter anybody with his eyes open can see that right too bad the president of the united states keeps his shut more cheers diana knew they were as much for what she was sayingfor what needed sayingas for her ideas she hardly cared they were as warming as the bright california sun it was snowing back home did it ever snow here congress is heading our way maybe that will push truman in the right direction maybe but how many more american boys will get blown up on occupation duty that doesnt need doing before the president sees the light too many even one more would be too many thats right if anything the roar from the packed seats was even louder than it had been before diana finished her speech she waved and flashed a twofinger v for victory as she stepped away from the mike sam yorty wrapped things up remember to give folks if you havent given already changing peoples minds costs money i wish it didnt but it does please be generous show you support our cause they did with everything from nickels to twentyand even fiftydollar bills quite a few silver dollars ended up in the donation buckets the government hadnt minted them since but they still circulated out west diana had seen that on other trips across the rockies she couldnt remember the last time shed had a big silver cartwheel in her hand back in anderson probably not since before the war i think we did a heck of a job yorty said when diana saw what theyd taken in she wouldnt have dreamt of arguing with him the motherfuckers were ordered to surrender all their munitions dammit the red army lieutenant colonel was almost comically outraged vladimir bokov looked down his nose at himnot easy not when the red army was several centimeters taller but he managed and youre all of a sudden surprised because the fascists didnt comrade theyve had mortars and antitank rockets all along when they figured out something new to do with artillery shells of course it figured theyd start pulling those out of their dicks too well why dont you miserable bluecaps stop them then the lieutenant colonel shouted what the hell good are you if you cant do something like that what was your name again comrade bokov asked softly a question like that from an nkvd man should have turned the red army officer to gelatin it didnt which made him either very brave or very stupid kuznetsov boris aleksandrovich kuznetsov he growled if you have to blame me go ahead even a camps a better bet than going down some of these german roads maybe that proved he didnt know much about camps on the other hand the way things were these days maybe it didnt that possibility worried bokov he said were not the only ones with the problem the americans have it too by the way they squawk they have it worse americans always squawk its what theyre good forthat and jeeps and trucks and spam kuznetsovs bulging belly said hed probably put away a lot of spam since bokov liked it too he couldnt mock the red army man kuznetsov went on this is just a fucking mess they blow us up and theres nobody around to avenge ourselves on what kind of chickenshit way to fight is that a damned nasty one bokov answered lieutenant colonel kuznetsov blinked bokov continued what do you want us to do we shoot people by the thousands weve shipped so many to siberia pretty soon everybody north of the arctic circle will speak german weve captured the devils grandmothers worth of nazi artillery this nazi officer we captured used to intercept our signals he said that whenever we started talking about the devils relatives it was a sure sign things were really fucked up kuznetsov said looks like he was right huh was all bokov said so even the germans knew that before he had to come up with anything more an explosion rocked the alreadybattered building in which he worked all the windows rattled one of them fell in with a tinkle of shattering glass only luck it hadnt speared him and kuznetsov with flying shards frigid february air streamed in through the sudden new opening bozhemoi kuznetsov burst out and then loosed a stream of mat that proved zeks in the gulag didnt know everything there was to know about cussing he finished that was too cocksucking close no shit bokov jumped to his feet im going to see what happenedand if i can help well you talk like a soldier even if youve got that blue band around your cap kuznetsov said instead of wanting to deck him as he should have vladimir bokov felt obscurely pleased the two men dashed out of bokovs thirdstory office together they couldnt get down the stairs as fast as they would have wanted because other nkvd and red army men clogged them some would be useful when they got to the bomb site others would just stand around rubbernecking bokov had seen that before the crater was in a small square a couple of blocks away a market of sorts had sprung up there berliners traded whatever happened to have come through the war in one piece for food and firewood sometimes women who didnt have anything else traded themselves more than anything else that was what drew red army men to the place and the red army men had drawn the truck it was a truck part of the chassis was still recognizable even after blast and fire the stink of cordite or some high explosive much like it filled the cold airthat and burned rubber and burnt flesh bokov did some swearing of his own his obscenity wasnt so inspired as boris kuznetsovs but it would have to do the motionless bodies and pieces of bodies he didnt have to worry about they were beyond worry now the red army men and locals down and moaning were a different storyif anything a sadder story because they were still suffering what had happened seemed all too obvious now bokov had to do what little he could in its wake lieutenant colonel kuznetsov spoke in a voice like iron this kind of shit has happened too fucking often weve got to get a handle on it weve got to goddammit if we dont those nazi cunts will run us out of germany yet that kind of defeatist talk could get him sent to a camp too but looking at the crater the bomb had blown in the pavement at the bodies at the freshly shattered apartment blocks around the edges of the squarea couple of them on firebokov had trouble feeling anything but defeatist himself they havent tried one so close to us for a while moisei shteinberg might have appeared out of nowhere he sounded altogether dispassionate as he surveyed the scene im surprised they did they dont seem to have got enough for their bomb youre a coldblooded prick of a zhid arent you kuznetsov said i try to think with my head not with my belly shteinberg answered calmly chances are its lucky for you that i do too bokov stooped to bandage a red army sergeant with gashes in one arm and the other leg here it was going on two years since berlin fell and he still routinely carried wound dressings in a pouch on his belt what did that say for sure nothing good spasibo comrade captain the sergeant managed something between a grimace and a wry grin fuck me if i ever come here looking to get my cock sucked again i dont blame you bokov said did you notice the truck before the bomb went off nah the young underofficer shook his head i was just looking for a woman who wasnt old enough to be my mother ambulances and fire engines screamed into the square tires screeching sirens wailing the men on one of the fire trucks swore horribly when they discovered the bomb had broken a water main they got a pathetic pissy dribble from their hose nothing more the ambulance drivers and their helpers started loading the injuredred army men firstinto their vehicles with help from bokov the wounded sergeant hopped toward the closest one his mangled leg wouldnt bear his weight bokov hoped he would keep it the sergeant managed one more word of thanks as he flopped into the back of the ambulance the bomb hidden in a jeep at the edge of the square blew up then next thing bokov knew he was on his hands and knees his trousers tore the cement scraped his legs dirt and pebbles and bits of broken glass dug into his palms he felt as if someone had banged his ears with garbagecan lids or maybe with hatch covers from a stalin tank and the ambulance had shielded him from the worst of the blast it hadnt flipped over onto him either which was a major piece of good fortune it would have squashed him like a cockroach if it had as if from very far away he heard people screaming shaking his head like someone whod been suckerpunched he lurched upright he needed two tries but he made it colonel shteinberg had a cut on his forehead and seemed to be missing the bottom of one ear blood dripped onto his tunicear and scalp wounds were always gory even when they werent serious whatever had clipped his ear might have taken off the top of his head had it flown a few centimeters to one side no sooner did that thought cross bokovs mind than he got a look at lieutenant colonel kuznetsov or what was left of him not much not from the eyes up the red army mans blood pooled on the pavement bokov gulped it wasnt that he hadnt seen blood or spilled it before but how much a man held always surprised you kuznetsovs steamed in the cold shteinberg shouted something at bokov cupping a hand behind his ear bokov shouted back what the jew cupped a hand behind his ear too that was how he discovered he was missing part of it he looked absurdly astonished limping over to bokovone of his knees didnt seem to work righthe bawled in the ear the junior officer had cupped nazi swine planned it this way when bokov heard that he knew he was hearing truth it was just the kind of things the germans would do it had their complicated cleverness all over it use one blast to create chaos wait a bit let rescuers and firemen gather then take them out with a second bomb german tanks were far more complicated than soviet ts they were easier to drive they had better firecontrol systems but they broke down more often too in tanks in submachine guns in strategic plans the soviet option was usually the simple one the one that reliably did what was needed complicated gadgets and plans had so many more ways to go wrong when they went right though they could go spectacularly right this one had something else occurred to bokov more cars here is a third bomb waiting he had to say it three times before moisei shteinberg understood the nkvd colonel clapped a hand to his foreheadand found out he was cut there too we have to make them pay he said boris aleksandrovich kuznetsov would have agreed but kuznetsov was dead so werehow many other russians how many germans the heydrichite hyenas didnt care about that they only cared out hurting the occupiers they were much too good at it too the budget was usually about as exciting aswell the budget you voted for it or you voted against it you tried to fish something out of the pork barrel for your districtor your state if you were a senator jerry duncan had played the game and played it well ever since he came to congress not even he could claim hed got excited about it this session of congress things were different the gop held the majority it ran the ways and means committee the budget started there and the republicans were bound and determined that the war departments appropriation would start without one thin dime for the occupation of germany oh how the democrats screamed actually some of them didntmore than a few southerners and some others were sick of the occupation too and some northeastern republicans wanted to leave the troops in place but the fight came closer to republicans versus democrats than anything else the republicans were less than sympathetic jerry watched the fur fly you people made this mess the ways and means committee chairman said now youre blaming us for trying to get the country out of it youre getting the country into a worse mess and youre too blind to see it the ranking democrat retorted do you want to fight the nazis again in twenty years do you want to fight the russians sooner than that we dont want to fight anybody any more and we dont have to the chairman said that includes wasting thousands of lives and billions of dollars on an unwar that the administration has proved incapable of ending and we dont have to fight anybody either not in a big way in the atom bomb we have teddy roosevelts big stick if weve got to use it again we will thats all what happens when somebody uses it on us the ranking democrat demanded jerry duncans hand shot up mr duncan the chairman said last year general groves testified before the senate that russia had next to no uranium and was at least twenty years away from making one of these bombs jerry said hed had people beat him over the head with leslie groves now he got to quote the general himself that was a lot more enjoyable and what about the germans the democrat inquired will they sit quietly like good boys and girls the way they did from to he got a laugh the chairmans gavel stifled it will they sit quietly the way theyre still doing now who said the surrender in almost two years ago now was the end of the war in europe wasnt that mr truman jerry said how right was he how right has he been about anything that isnt what you were talking about you were talkingi should say not talkingabout the chances the nazis would get the atom bomb if we ran away from germany the democrat said they already used one remember or close enough on frankfurt even cleaning up the mess there will take years it wasnt an atom bomb it used radium not uranium the only explosive was tnt for somebody whod never heard of uranium before august for somebody whod practiced law before going into politics jerryd learned a hell of a lot since well so had plenty of other people but hed learned more than most you cant call it an atom bomb not if you want to tell the truth by the way he said it he didnt think his congressional opponent gave a damn said opponent only shrugged okay fine say it wasnt an atom bomb what if they drop one just like it on midtown manhattan best thing that could happen to the place went through jerrys head but that was smalltown indiana talking the press would crucify him if he said it out loud so he didnt he did say how would they get it over here theres an ocean in the way weve got fighter planes weve got radar to watch for bombers okay fine the democrat repeated and shrugged again suppose one of these radiumnotatom bombs goes off inside a freighter in new york harbor jerrys ears got hot youre being ridiculous the secretary of the navy sure doesnt think so then hes jumping at shadows jerry said if the germans tried a stunt like that wed blast their country off the face of the earth you know it i know it they know it too so why are you talking silly talk unless youre just trying to scare the american people mr chairman the democrat raised his voice in appeal in congresses gone by that would have been plenty to get jerrys ears pinned back here in the eightieth congress the chairman came from the gop too sounds like a reasonable question to me he said debateno argumentwent on but both sides knew what would happen long before it did the appropriations bill with no money in it for the us occupation of germany would come out of the ways and means committee it would pass the house if the democrats in the senate wanted to filibuster they could then theyd get blamed for holding up the peoples business sooner or later a bill pretty much like the one the republicans wanted would hit the presidents desk and harry truman would veto it hed already promised that and then the fun would really start no noise from overhead no explosions echoing down the long lovingly concealed mineshafts reinhard heydrich breathed a little easier no repair crews rushing to check the latest damage or to repair the ventilation system after the confounded americans screwed it up had the amis known which shafts were blind holes which ones led to mines that were nothing but mines and which ones led to paydirtbut they didnt and they were unlikely to find out the jews and other camp scum whod expanded this old mine probably hadnt had any idea why they were digging here just to stay on the safe side afterwards theyd been exterminated anyhowall of them as far as heydrich knew and their ss guards had gone to the eastern front once this little stint was over not many of them were likely to survive either business as usual then at the same old stand well almost as usual the german freedom front had to do without a whole mines worth of munitions and small arms two valleys over the miserable americans had collapsed the whole thing when they touched off their damned charges up near the surface that should never have happenedwhoeverd designed that storage system had screwed up in a big way which didnt mean heydrich could do anything about it now the struggle went on regardless most ways it went pretty well the fellow whod come up with the bright idea of using exploding trucks and cars in sequence to do more damage would win himself a knights cross that scheme was a beautyit could hardly work any better heydrich had no authentic knights crosses to hand out but he could improvise it wasnt as if he hadnt done it before an iron cross second class with the proper ribbonwhich he did havewould do the job just fine everyone would know it stood for a real ritterkreuz besides a medal truly wasnt iron and ribbonit was a reminder of what the holder had done to earn it heydrich touched the knights cross that hung at his own throat even if he werent wearing it he would know he had it and why that was the only thing that mattered he went through the latest pile of newspapers and magazines from the outside world that hans had left on his desk the french were still vowing to rebuild the eiffel tower de gaulle had made another speech before their chamber of deputies another story in the international heraldtribune told how the english apparently without any political speeches were already rebuilding westminster abbey and st pauls reinhard heydrich nodded to himself if he hadnt come upon a fundamental difference between the two races there he didnt know when he ever would the english monuments had been bombed later he had no doubt they would rise again first but then on an inside page he found a story that interested him even more the american congress a vaguely obscene name for a parliament hed always thought was still wrangling about whether to pay for keeping us soldiers in germany signs were that congress didnt want to but the president still did heydrich knew what he would do in harry trumans place the leaders of congress who didnt want to go along with him would get a visit fromwhat did the amis call their gestapo from the fbi that was it then they would see things trumans way if they didnt their funerals would no doubt be well attended if truman had plans along those lines the heraldtribune didnt talk about them it wouldnt of course but heydrich didnt believe truman would do the obvious necessary thing americans were fools they were rich fools fools with enormous factories but fools all the same the factories let them smash the wehrmacht still they had no stomach for what came after even a victorious war or did they a german magazine had a glowing article about the police force the amis were organizing in their zone heydrich already knew about that naturally but getting the american slantfor what else was the magazine but an american propaganda rag was interesting very interesting in fact before the collapse the writer had worked for the volkischer beobachter heydrich recognized his name well hed landed on his feet he claimed that this new police corps would protect order and guard against extremism whether from the left or the right he also claimed the amis were building it up to be strong enough and reliable enough to do its duty under any conceivable political circumstances any heydrich murmured that was a large claim to say the least and heydrich also knew enough to translate it from journalese into plain german the writer obviously hoped most of his readers didnt if the americans decided to hop on their planes and boats and go back across the atlantic where they belonged the new police corps would stay behind as their surrogates during the war germany had set up plenty of police outfits like that the french milice fought the french resistance harder than any german outfits in france ever did latvian and lithuanian policemen cheerfully delivered jews to the germans for disposal general nedics militia in serbia harried the titoists all of those police forces fell apart when the german military might supporting them waned did the amis think the same thing wouldnt happen to their sheep dogs after they went home if they did they really were fools and did they think their fancy new police corps wasnt riddled with traitors heydrich shook his head with true german patriots he thought it depended on how you looked at things though some of nedics men had warned titos followers what their outfit was up to some members of the milice played a double game with the resistance some members of the americans german police were in touch with the forces that aimed to restore the reich to greatness too heydrich usually knew what the wouldbe oppressors had in mind before they tried it none of their moves had hurt him yet he had to be carefulthe americans werent too naive to plant false informationbut so far hed outsmarted them how many men from the milice had de gaulles french forces shot or imprisoned what had the titoists done to nedics militia how had the russians treated germanys latvian and lithuanian collaborators heydrich slowly smiled none of that would be a patch on the revenge he aimed to take on the german police who cozied up to the americans revenge on the usa too he said as if reminding himself von braun and the other sliderule soldiers at peenemunde had made rockets that could hit london from the continent theyd planned much bigger beasts rockets that could hit america from europe only the collapse kept the scientists from building them a lot of those scientists were twiddling their slide rules for the united states these days others were working for the russians but some remained in germany and the reich still had plenty of scientists and engineers who could learn rocketry if they needed to which they would a rocket that could reach new york city with an atom bomb in its nose would teach the americans they couldnt tell germany what to do any more and rockets like that could also reach far into russiafarther than the wehrmacht ever got as soon as germany built them stalin would have to think twice before he started any new trouble heydrich could hardly wait xxiii lou weissbergs mother had talked about how good it felt not to have to wear a corset when they fell out of fashion after world war i lou always nodded what were you supposed to do when your mother went on about something that wouldnt matter to you in a million years except now it did hed escaped his own canvasandmetal contraption not long before his leg didnt bother him too much either he wasno not quite good as new but getting there anyway on this second anniversary of ve day that wasnt so bad it was a bright spring morning sunshine puffy white clouds drifting across the sky vibrant greens songbirds chirping their heads off storks nesting on chimneytops wherever chimneys still stood and the stink of undiscovered bodies buried in rubble the stink that never seemed to disappear from nuremberg but did fade in the chilly wintertime howard frank snorted when lou remarked on it yeah well those are the krauts we dont have to worry about frank said ha lou said around a mouthful of scrambled eggs and hash browns dont i wish that was funny i know i know major frank lit a cigarette at ten oclock we get to listen to general clay telling us how wonderful everythings going oh boy lou had no trouble restraining his enthusiasm general eisenhowerd gone back to the states at the end of the year before staying any longer would have tarnished his reputation as the man whod won the war in europeassuming the war in europe had been won germany was lucius clays baby now and a damned ugly baby to find on your doorstep it was too next interesting question is whether the fanatics mortar us while were listening to clay tell us how wonderful everything is frank said youre chipper today arent you lou said in lieu of answering his superior smoked his chesterfield down to a tiny butt stubbed it out and lit another one german cops on street corners stiffened to attention as the two american officers went to listen to general clay the policemen wore their blackdyed american uniforms some of them had on american helmets too others wore what had been firemens helmets with an aluminum crest to change the outline of what otherwise looked the same as the standard german stahlhelm and with shortages everywhere some of the cops did wear the wehrmachtissue steel helmet pointing to one of those guyswho also carried a usmade submachine gunlou said that still gives me the willies yknow howard frank didnt need to ask what in particular was eating him the major only nodded yeah me too he agreed but what are you gonna do they may see action and its a damn good helmet when we switched from the limeystyle tin hat to the one we use now first scheme was to make stahlhelms and just paint em a different color fuck im glad we didnt that thing screams nazi at me since the kaisers engineers had devised the shape in the last war lou knew that wasnt completely rational he didnt care hitlers bastards had been trying to kill him not the kaisersexcept for some retreads no doubt he gave the next german cop he saw a fishy stare other thing is how many of these bastards are ratting on us to heydrich bound to be some hopefully not too many howard frank sounded somewhere between cynical and resigned a couple of other guys in dyedblack us uniform came by they werent german police they had on armbands that said dp they sure as hell were displaced persons they talked to each other in some slavic languagerussian polish ukrainian czech serbocroatian bulgarian full of consonants and ys one of them carried a grease gun like the cops the other wore a luger on his belt at least they dont have german helmets lou thought with more and more american soldiers heading home dps were doing a hell of a lot of the cooking and cleaning and fetching and carrying the way things were going the occupation would probably fall apart without them on the eastern front the germans had used russian powshiwis they called them a contraction from their term for volunteer assistantsthe same way and for the same reason to stretch their combat manpower now they were getting it done to them instead serves em right too better not to inquire about what happened to any hiwis who fell into soviet hands lou might want to work more closely with the russians against the heydrichites that didnt mean he thought they were nice people but they werent on the nazis side which also counted a perimeter of barbed wire concrete barriers and machinegun nests protected the americans gathering to hear general clay from german kamikazes driving trucks full of tnt mortarslou shook his head hed already worried about mortars once if they started coming in hed hit the dirt that was all even as clay stepped up to the microphone several enlisted men bawled we want to go home clay looked at them he had bushy dark eyebrows that told what he was thinking without his saying a word if he wasnt thinking stockade right this minute loud never seen anybody who was he had a raspy voice that spoke of a million cigarettes or maybe a million and one i want to go home too he said we all want to go home i dont know of a single soldier in uncle sams army who wants to stay in germany but weve got what they used to call a job of work to do and were going to do it when he paused some of the soldiers yelled we want to go home again they didnt give a damn about a general or anybody else they were draftees they sure didnt give a damn about winning the war before they left the way earlier crops of dogfaces had after all the war in europe had been over for two yearshadnt it if it hadnt why were they all standing around on this nice may morning why werent they out trying to pick up german broads with chocolate bars but if the war in europe had been over for two years why all the tank barriers and machinegun positions and barbed wire yeah why lou wondered his own thoughts pretty barbed too general clay charged into that question headon we beat the german army we walloped the waffenss too you know it boys some of you helped do it and some of you saw what the nazis did while they were on top you know why we had to lick them if we hadnt one of these days before too long they would have done that stuff to our friends and neighbors and families damn straight howard frank muttered beside lou lou nodded as far as he was concerned lucius clay was preaching to the choir hed never yet heard of a jewish soldier who went around shouting we want to go home jews understood in their kishkas what this war was all about but there werent enough jews to go around goddammit and they still want to clay went on thats the funny thing about this whole business plenty of people back home march around and wave signs and bang drums and yell and scream and shout that we ought to pack up and get the devil out of germany but not one of them says the germans are good guys all of a sudden not one of them says the nazis wont take over again if we do run away lou craned his neck he didnt see any of the german policemen in their black gi uniforms inside the american perimeter how hard would they fight the fanatics after the americans went home some of them had spent time in concentration camps under the third reich those guys would give heydrichs goons a smack in the teeth if they could the rest well who could say and even if the new kraut cops were willing to mix it up with the nazis would they stay that way after a sniper picked off their wife or mother or twoyearold that was already starting to happen or suppose a truck full of explosives blew up a police barracks in the middle of the night that had already happened more than once too what would it do to the cops morale lost in those gloomy reflections lou realized hed missed some of what general clay was saying thinks we need to be here clay declared then he said the president is the commanderinchief of the armed forces of the united states so lou figured out what was going on as long as the commanderinchief thinks we need to stay in this country we will the sooner our friends and our foes understand that the better it sounded good it would have sounded even better if one of the fedup gis hadnt hollered not if congress doesnt give him the cash as if on cue several other men called we want to go home again congress will do whatever congress does the president will do whatever he feels he has to do and we will do whatever the president and our superiors tell us to do clay stuck out his chin and so will i and so will every one of you too he stepped away from the microphone some of the soldiers assembled to listen to him applauded lou and major frank both made sure they didbut then they had their reasons lou assumed mps had kept an eye on the hecklers and would give them whatfor afterwards he hoped so anyway even if they did though so what the mouthy draftees might spend some time in the stockade for disrespect or whatever other charges had a chance of sticking while they were there theyd still have plenty to eat and somewhere soft and dry to sleep heydrichs thugs wouldnt be trying to bump them off either if all you wanted to do was come home in one piece the stockade didnt look half bad when lou said as much major frank answered sure if thats all you want but it goes on your record too it wont look so good when youre trying to land a job once you get home how many of these guys give a damn lou said how many of em think that far ahead howard frank looked as if hed put down several too many a while ago and his head was banging like buddy richs drums mazeltov he said sourly for what lou asked for nailing the usa down tight in two goddamn questions thats for what frank answered neither one of them had much else to say on the way back to their offices as far as bernie cobb was concerned the krauts knew way more about tanks and machine guns and beer than anybody in the united states had ever imagined the panzer ivs and panthers and tigers lions and tigers and bears oh my were out of business thank god you still had to look out for fanatics with mgs but not right this minute also thank god as for the beer bernie had a big old stein of it in front of him hed already emptied the mug several times he expected to empty it several more before the day or the night or whatever the hell was through a bunch of gis packed the tavern in the alpine village with the unpronounceable name as hed discovered there were a lot of alpine villages with unpronounceable names this one was more unpronounceable than most which wasor would have beensaying something thank you kindly toby benton had taken on a considerable alcoholic cargo too the sergeant sounded mushmouthed any old timethat was what coming from oklahoma did to you when he was also drunk you could hardly understand him at all goin home bernie didnt sound like anybody from the speech and debate team either man aliveyou are a man alive sure am the demolitions expert nodded sure as hell am didnt know if i was gonna make it through specially with the way they went an kept stretchin our hitches an stretchin em an every guy in the joint growled profane agreement with that even the fellows who hadnt been over here since before the shooting was supposed to be over way my points added up i figured id make it back in november or december of bernie said im still here a year and a half later god only knows when theyll turn me loose long as you dont go home in a box thats the only thing that matters another gi said he raised his voice a little anybody here not know somebody who got it after fucking ve day no one claimed to not even a couple of kids whod been here only a few weeks its a bastard all right sergeant benton said aint we lucky we won the war some luck bernie cobb peered lugubriously into the bottom of his seidel i dont even have any beer left you can do something about that you know the dogface sitting next to him said oh yeah bernie needed reminding he waved to the barmaid hey sweetheart he wouldnt have called her sweetheart anywhere else and not without a few under her belt either she was somewhere in her midthirties she wasnt uglyshe wasnt half bad in fact and she had a shape like a coke bottle even drunk though he wasnt tempted to put a move on her she looked tough was what she looked he wondered if shed been through a denazifying trial if somebody told him shed been one of the nasty female guards at a german camp he would have believed it which didnt keep her from filling up his beer mug again she had serious muscles in her forearms from hauling around so many steins and pitchers he gave her a dime ja she said softly as she made the small silver coin disappear would the old man with the gray mustache behind the bar see any of that bernie shrugged it wasnt his worry gonna get me a job where the most explosive thing i gotta mess with is the carburetor off an old ford benton was saying gonna forget all the shit they learned me aint gonna study war no more like it says in the good book wow two or three gis said together longing in their voices the americans in the tavern amassed an impressive amount of lethal hardware nobody went anywhere unarmed these days you might as well tie a bullseye and a shoot me sign to your back you know what sarge a soldier said pretty soon well all be coming home regardless of points or whether the army likes it or any of that crap congressll figure we wasted enough time fucking around over here and thatll be that wouldnt bother me none benton answered nobody likes the damn nazis but nobody wants to get his dick shot off neither we want to go home several men chorused then they started laughing fit to bust discipline here was still pretty goodnot great but pretty good from what bernie heard some places hardly anybody obeyed orders he didnt happen to like toby benton called for more beer one bad thing about goin home he said is ill have to drink the horse piss they put in bottles back in the states bernie wasnt the only guy who noddednot even close the stuff they brewed over here had been a revelation to him beer didnt just get you blasted after you poured down enough of it it could taste good too who wouldve thunk it the barmaid came over and filled up bentons stein he gave her a kration can and a pack of luckies ja she said as she had after bernie handed her the dime only she sounded a lot happier this time in a cautious experimental way as if he were defusing a mine sergeant benton patted her on the ass all the americans in the tavern tensed the other halfsloshed gis mustve thought the same thing bernie did if you messed with this babe shed knock your block off which only went to show you never could tell the barmaid plopped herself down in the demolitions experts lap threw her arms around his neck and gave him the kind of kiss the hays office wouldnt let you film bernie wondered if shed screw him right there where he sat but she didntquite hot damn benton said when he finally came up for air ill miss the easy nookie they got over here too sure as hell cant get an american girl to put out for beef stew and a pack of smokes our side didnt lose the war bernie said who says theirs did sergeant benton regretfully untangled himself from the barmaid she didnt seem anywhere near so tough any more you know what i mean bernie persisted other thing is girls back home dont know what all weve been through and every goddamn bit of it the past coupla yearsall the bombs all the rockets all the snipers all the crapits been nothin but a waste of time benton said you fuckin wait an see were gonna chuck it in over here were gonna go home an let the jerries do whatever they want were gonna pay the price for it down the line if we do bernie said benton shruggedand almost fell off his chair yeah hed taken on a lot of beer itll be somebody elses headache then he said long as it aint chewing on the guys whore in right now they wont care whether benton was drunk or not that seemed like a pretty good bet to bernie cobb and now that the ice had been broken so did the barmaid harry truman looked hopping mad since coming back to washington tom schmidt had seen the president angry plenty of times truman delighted in sticking out such chin as he had and telling the world where to go and how to get there he could be funny at the same time he made tom laugh and tom got paid for writing unkind things about him but today he just looked ticked off overhead lights flashed off his spectacle lenses as he glared out at the assembled reporters i called a press conference this afternoon so i could tell the american people why im vetoing this joke of a budget bill that has landed on my desk i warned the republicans who head up this new congressand i warned the democratic leadership toothat i would veto any bill that looks like this they sent me one anyway and i am sending it backairmail special delivery nice of him to get his own party mad at him too schmidt whispered to the guy sitting next to him the other fellow barely had time to nod before truman went on im especially unhappy with the socalled democratic leaders in the senate no he didnt care if he antagonized them they told me this was the best they could doa bill that cuts off funds for our boys in germany at the end of the year instead of right away if this is the best they can do im here to tell them it isnt good enough why not a reporter called ill take questions when im done with my statement the president said but since i was coming to why not anyway itll look like im answering this one congress has got no business tying american foreign policy by the purse strings can you imagine what would have happened after pearl harbor if congress told president roosevelt youve got to win the war by the end of or we wont give you any more money to fight it can you imagine he quivered with indignation if congress did something that stupid why hitler would be holding a press conference here in the white house right now for heavens sake several reporters laughed then newsreel cameras ground away one day soon people all across the country would see him when they went to the movies is it really the same thing mr president tom called youd better believe it is truman snappedso much for taking questions after his statement we will do what we need to do it may take longer than we expect right now it may cost more we will do it anyway since hed got one answer schmidt tried for another but if you think we need to do this sir and congress and most of the american people think we need to do that im the president truman said i didnt want the job i wish franklin roosevelt god love him were still here to do it just by the way i believe hed do it the same way i am but thats neither here nor there for as long as i am president im going to do things the best way i know how and that includes keeping american soldiers in germany to hold down the nazis and hold back the russians if you do that you wont stay president long said another member of the white house press corps chance i take truman answered calmly if i leave ill leave knowing i did the right thing and if whoever the republicans pick does something else hell prove pretty darn quick how right i was he didnt lack for confidence by all accounts he never had how much good did that do when he was so out of step with the rest of the country herbert hoover had been confident too and look how much good it did him you could be confident you knew a road but all the confidence in the world wouldnt help you if you drove off a cliff youd go smash at the bottom any which wayand so would all the other people you were driving and let me tell you boysand you ladiessomething else truman wagged a finger at the reporters you think you know what america thinks well ive got news for you there are a devil of a lot of americans who dont march around with placards on their shoulders they keep their mouths shut and go to work every day and pay their taxesoh they dont like paying them who does but they do it and even though they dont kick up a fuss and get their photographs in the newspapers they have the sense to know that we are doing the right thing in germany and that we need to stay the course there i wouldnt be surprisedno sir i wouldnt be one bit surprisedif there were more of them than there are of the noisy kind tom schmidts shorthand scribbles barely kept up with the angry president as truman finally paused to draw breath tom wrote his own comment under the other mans words silent majority good luck then he eyed the phrase and nodded to himself it wouldnt make a bad leadmight even do for a headline after that deep breath truman returned at last to his prepared remarks he lambasted the republican congress for everything except violating the mann act if you listened to him everything was congress fault he hadnt made a single mistake himselfnot one not in all his born days if you listened to him how likely were the american people to do that looking at the folks theyd sent to congress maybe not very truman finally got around to taking the questions hed planned to take all along does being an accidental president hinder you a reporter asked is it harder to do your job knowing nobody elected you to do it not even a little bit truman said people elected roosevelt president four different times this last time he and the democratic party chose me as his running mate there is always the chance that a president of the united states will die in office in it was an open secret that president roosevelt was not a well man whoever ran with him might have to succeed him i wish that hadnt happenedi wish it with all my heart but it did and im just as much president as if id been elected unanimously so i have to do my best like i say and that is what i am doing no red meat there tom judged anybody in the same spot would say the same thing too bad why do you think its so important to stay in germany when everybody else is sick of being there another reporter asked i told you before not everybody is harry truman said tom underlined silent majority truman went on anybody who wants to risk seeing the nazis come back to power needs to have his head examined too toms hand flew up after a pause truman nodded his way how dangerous can they be in a country that got stepped on he asked i was over there till till you got thrown out and for good reason too truman broke in i dont think believing in freedom of the press is a good reason to expel a man sir tom said with dignity truman only sniffed believing in getting a better byline is more like it if you ask me but to get back to your question how dangerous can the nazis be why dont you ask the english while they clean up london why dont you ask the french after four years of occupation why dont you ask the russiansthe survivors i should say the only question is whether they lost twenty million or thirty million in the war pennsylvania plus california plus maybe illinoisgone gone to graveyards when people got buried at all so how dangerous can the nazis be what about the atom bomb tom and three other reporters asked the question at the same time two of those others worked for papers that normally favored the administration which wasinteresting anyhow yes we have it truman said the first thing the nazis do will be to try to get it on their own the radium treatment they gave to innocent civilians in frankfurt is proof of that the next thing theyll do is theyll try to find a way to throw it at us they could reach london with the v though that isnt strong enough to carry an atom bomb they had plans on the drawing board for a rocket that could reach our east coast from europe how long do you suppose it will be before they dust off those plans and start building rockets like that a rocket that could reach the east coast from europe it sounded like science fiction the stuff in the cheap pulp magazines with the lurid covers of course up until august the atom bomb itself had sounded the same way so maybe truman and the german engineers knew what they were talking about on the other hand maybe they didnt another reporter beat tom to the question he wanted to ask how do we know this is true how do we know this isnt just you talking mr president to try to justify the mess in germany truman glared at the man i am giving you the information ive got wilbur he said sometimes i cannot give you all the information ive got because that might help the enemy but i am not lying to you i am not making things up and if you say i am you can go the phrase he used would not be printed in any family newspaper in the united states love you too mr president wilbur said which got a laugh from the press corps and even a chuckle from harry truman the reporter went on after all the stuff the administration has tried to hide about the way things in germany are going can you blame us for having our doubts about the things you say blame you damn right i can blame you truman answered you are trying to make me run the country by gallup poll i am here to tell you that does not work by the nature of things it cant work sometimes you have to stick it out even when things dont look so good at the moment and not everybody likes what youre doing if nobody pays any attention to what may happen in the long run youve got yourself a problem truman doesnt care about democracy tom wrote it wasnt a completely fair summary of what the president said but it wasnt completely unfair either if truman thought he had the right to override the will of the people whenever he felt like it what were the checks and balances in the constitution worth not even the paper they were printed on what will you do if congress sends you another appropriations bill like this one somebody asked veto it again truman said promptly what will you do if congress passes the bill over your veto the reporter asked what will i do ill be very surprised thats what truman said if congress somehow manages to sabotage our foreign policy in that way it will be a sad day in the history of the united states im the one whos right im the one with all the answers that might not be what truman was saying but that was what he meant tom schmidt wrote it down a big part of his job was telling people what he thought the president did mean regardless of what truman actually said ed mcgraw flipped to the editorial page of the indianapolis times hed rarely bothered with it before pat got killed he grunted heres a column by your friend schmidt he said and then let me have some more coffee willya sure diana poised the pot over eds cup and poured he dumped in sugar and pet condensed milk diana let him take a sip before she asked what does tom say shed never figured she would be on a firstname basis with national reporters but she was her husband grunted again to show he noticed how strange that was too then he read out loud harry s truman thinks he knows best he thinks he can run the country on the basis of what he thinks he knows regardless of how the american people feel about it how does that make him any different from joseph stalin for that matter how does it make him any different from adolf hitler wow diana said appreciatively thats strong stuff she felt as if shed poured a slug of brandy into her own morning coffee wait theres more let me give you the best part ed paused for a moment then resumed truman claims a silent majority backs the steps he is taking in germany and his stubborn refusal to cut his lossesour lossesand come home the reason this socalled majority is silent appears to be that it is not there most things that are not there make very little noise how about that babe yeah how about that i want to applaud diana said what is truman accomplishing in germany anything anything at all ed read the longer this pointless occupation goes on the less likely that seems thousands of men dead billions of dollars wasted down a rathole what will happen when the united states finally gives up and comes home the same thing that would have happened if wed come home right after ve day everybody knows it even harry truman probably knows it by now the trouble is hes too pigheaded to admit it thats about the size of things all right silent majority diana scoffed the idea to scorn well have to show truman where the majority is and well have to show him how much noise it can make too you do that babeand i know darn well you will her husband let the paper flop down onto the kitchen table me i gotta go to work he grabbed his lunch bucket pecked diana on the cheek and headed out the door in the driveway the pontiac started up with a whir and a groan ed backed out put it in first and drove off to the delcoremy plant alone in the house diana sighed very quietly now that shed met so many harddriving men ed mcgraw seemedwell just a little dull or more than just a little oh he made a decent enough living and he loved her and he was as reliable as the out of indianapolis and while he looked at pretty women she knew hed never do more than look butthe only way ed would ever show any spark was if he got struck by lightning diana hadnt known she missed that till she saw it in other men arent i entitled to a little spark every once in a while she wondered some women faced with a question like that took direct action they went out and found the spark they thought they were looking for some took indirect action they quietly started emptying the cooking sherry or the brandy or the bourbon or whatever along those lines happened to be handy if they put out the spark in themselves they wouldnt miss it in anyone else and some like diana worked harder than ever at what they were already doing if they stayed too busy to notice the spark wasnt there not having it almost didnt matter almost she grabbed the newspaper and reread the column ed had read out loud it just made her madder the second time around silent majority she snorted then because no one else was there to hear her she added my ass and then she put down the paper picked up the telephone and got cracking the mcgraw household had a new phone line these days one paid for with funds from mothers against the madness in germany that was the one diana parked herself in front of shed never imagined making so many longdistance phone calls all the local longdistance operators recognized her voice one had had a son wounded in austria so almost all of them were on her side over and over again across the country she summarized tom schmidts column for the movement leaders who hadnt seen it yet several already had and were just as stirred up about it as diana was silent majority she fleered again and again do we have time to organize rallies on the fourth of july well show truman where the majority is well show him it isnt silent too and well show him it isnt on his side by the time she got hungry enough to think about lunch shed made plans to turn the country upside down and inside out shed run up the phone bill by god only knew how much but so what it wasnt her money she still kept careful track of every penny of itall those years in the pta had ground that into herbut she didnt worry about it any more she raided the icebox for leftovers and heated them on top of the stove as she ate she read the rest of the paper two more poor gis blown up when a roadside artillery shell went off as their jeep drove byanother soldier wounded too she shook her head such a senseless waste she wished she hadnt had that exact thought eds face appeared in her mind when she did that wasnt fair and she knew it theyd had a lot of good years together theyd raised two good kids if pat had come home right after ve day everything would still be fine everything still was fineunless she decided it wasnt why did ed have to look so much like a de soto with a dented fender and a broken taillight nothing wrong with ed not a single solitary thing she said there where nobody else could hear but that wasnt what bothered her what bothered her was there wasnt enough right with ed she got on the phone again the busier she stayed the less time shed have to look at things like that xxiv berlin broken capital of the third reich quadruply occupied symbol of allied solidarity even when there wasnt a hell of a lot of allied solidarity to go around a place where heydrichs fanatics pulled off enough bombings and other atrocities to generate more allied solidarity than there would have been otherwise lou weissberg stared at the wreckagesome of it mighty grandiose wreckage toofor all the world like a tourist behind him howard frank also did some tall rubbernecking lou lit a cigarette smoking helped you not notice the other thing that remained in the air even two years and more after the fighting was said to be over a lot of people had died here and not so many of them lay in graves his superior smoked away with him major frank puffed like a steam engine on an uphill grade maybe well bring it off this time he said a blackbird chirped sounding like a robin back home like those good old american robins blackbirds ate worms what the worms atewas perhaps better left uncontemplated in berlin maybe we will if lou sounded as if he didnt believe it that was only because he didnt we tried it in and they blew up the palace of justice in nuremberg we tried it in and frankfurt is still waddayacallitradioactive so what the hell will they do here we got the nazi big shots here thats something anyhow frank said i wouldntve given good odds wed manage that chances are heydrichs waiting till they go on trial lou said then his merry men will try something really juicy know what i mean merry men my ass but franks greenpersimmon pucker said he knew just what lou meant no matter how much he wished he didnt he glanced east trials gonna be in the russian zone so the security monkeys off our back anyway unless they holler for help lou said dont hold your breath howard frank said they wouldnt do that unless they were in deeper shit than they are now i guess lou said scuttlebutt said that back in when things looked black for the ussr stalin asked fdr and churchill for american and british divisions to fight alongside the red army on the eastern front scuttlebutt even said hed promised to let them keep their own command structure which for a russian leader was like handing over the crown jewels and the key to whatever he used instead of fort knox the angloamerican troops didnt go trucks and avgas and spam and ammo did by the bazillions of tons and uncle joe found enough soviet bodies to make hitler blow his brains out and that was what so many of them turned into toobodies to this day you could smell them and the germans theyd taken with them in berlin lou and major frank smoked their cigarettes down to teenytiny butts before tossing them away and lighting new ones the tobacco scroungers were on those little spitsoaked dogends like dracula on a pretty girls neck tobacco fueled what was left of the german economyand you could even smoke it labor gangs shifted rubble one broken brick at a time old people women whod probably been chic once upon a time and shabby demobilized soldiers labored side by side everybody was skinny the ration was supposed to be up to calories a day which wasnt saying much youd lose weight doing nothing on calories a day doing hard physical labor considering what the germans had done in occupied europe lou had trouble working up much sympathy he suspected the red army men in the russian zone found it even tougher howard frank was also eyeing the skinny krauts now if we sent everybody who looked at us sideways off to a camp wed be just like the russians and just like the nazis lou finished for him but were not hell we cant even keep our own guys here last gi in germany close the door on your way out frank agreed gotta admire congress dont you god must love idiots or he wouldnt have made so many of them lou said which might have been an answer or might not yeah but how come so many of em got elected frank said you ready to go back to the states yet a lot of me is ive been away from my family way too goddamn longi mean way lou said hate to leave feeling like i didnt do my job though if i could punch heydrichs ticket before i climbed on a plane or a boat or a unicycle or whatever the hell i got a picture of you on a unicycle i got a picture of you back in the hospital after you fall off the fuckin unicycle too frank said lou weissberg not the most graceful of men maintained a dignified silence during the war thered been a german propaganda photo of a soldier raising the swastika flag over the ruins of stalingrad that didnt quite work out for hitlers crew right before ve day stalin got his answer a photo of a red army man planting the hammer and sickle on the reichs chancellery in berlin the wehrmacht gave up a few days later and everything was supposed to be hunkydory from then on out well theory was wonderful getting into the russian zone to see the chancellery wasnt easy you had to clear a checkpoint sign a log show your id and get patted down you also had to talk to a red army lieutenant who spoke american english like a native and probably was one okayyouse guys are legit the guy said a turn of phrase lou heard all the time from new jersey highschool kids in his english classes the red army soldier went on we gotta keep our eyes open yknow damn fascist hyenas try and pull all kinds of sneaky stunts sure lou said hed heard that hyena line toomostly from people who read the daily worker it came from russia there and it came from russia here if anything the russian zone in berlin looked worse than the american zone it was the eastern part of the city and the part where the fighting had been heaviest the labor gangs here were guarded by russian soldiers with submachine guns that looked as if theyd been made in somebodys basement for all lou knew they had the chancellery and the other fancy buildings from which the nazis had run the reich were all smashed wreckage lou took out a brownie and clicked away thesell remind me they got some of what was coming to them anyhow he said he wasnt the only allied soldier photographing the ruins either amateur shutterbugs nodded to one another all probably thinking the same kinds of thoughts americans you have any money you have any cigarettes the guy who asked spoke yiddish not german he rolled up a sleeve on his frayed shirt to show a number tattooed on his upper arm hed lived through the death camps then his face was all nose and staring eyes even now more than two years after hed been liberated he looked as if a strong breezehell a weak breezewould blow him away here buddy lou handed him a pack of luckies and five bucks and half a dration chocolate bar he had in a jacket pocket major frank was similarly generous beat it he told the displaced person after giving him stuff somebodyll knock you over the head if you hang around thank you both if i still believed in god i would ask his blessings on you the dp said he disappeared like a cockroach vanishing down a crack in the floor if i still believed in god lou echoed in yiddish and then in english it sounded just as bad either way but when youd been through what the dp had when millions of people who went into the camps came out only as smoke from a crematorium chimney when godif there was a godsat there and watched without doing anythingthe chosen people chosen for what for this lou had done his best not to think about it if you did think about it how could you go on believing lou started to ask howard frank about that then seeing the look on the other jews face he didnt frank was wrestling with the same demons when you did start to think how could you help it one way was to stop thinking about it they got their chance and in a hurry other beggars had seen them give to the jewish dp they might have marked themselves with the brand sucker hungry people in threadbare clothes converged on them from all directions hands outstretched voices shrill and desperate yes they all needed food yes they were all broke but there were too many of them for two us army officers to help much even if they stripped themselves naked lou wasnt inclined to do that anyway that almost all the beggars were germans did nothing to endear them to him any further major frank said no so did lou then they said hell no then they said go away finally it was fuck off and lou wondered if hed have to draw his sidearm to show he meant business before he did a couple of russian soldiers came over to see what the yelling crowd was all about that got the beggars moving did it ever they didnt want the russians to pay any special attention to them oh no the russians understood bits of german lou explained what had caused the fuss stupid to give to a german one russian said by the look on his face he wouldnt have been impressed had lou told him hed given to a jew lou didnt try he just spread his hands and said ja sehr dumm that gave the russians nothing to chew on having broke up the crowd they went on their way aint this fun major frank said oh boy lou nodded some fun vladimir bokov didnt know a single nkvd man who wasnt nervous twice now the united states had failed to try the leading german war criminals the first failure had cost the court building and most of the jurists who would sit in judgment on the nazis and the city of frankfurt hadnt recovered from the second nor would it for years so it was up to the soviet union to do things right this time around it was up to the soviet union to give the thugs who almost overran the world what they deserved high time for that long past time and if everything went well the ussr would get the credit for doing what the usa couldnt but if things failed to go well the ussr would get the blame marshal stalin had made one thing unmistakably plain he did not wish the workers paradise to be seen as blameworthy in any way if blame accrued to the soviet union blame would also accrue to the men who should have kept the trial running smoothly stalins blame would accrue to the nkvd no wonder bokov was nervous no wonder his colleagues twitched if anyone looked at them sidewise or even if no one did theyd found what had been a minor municipal courthouse still standing near the eastern edge of the soviet zone in berlin most of the buildings around it had already been leveled theyd finished the job for a kilometer around in all directions and theyd fortified that twokilometer circle in ways that would have made the soviet generals who planned the fieldworks for the battle of kursk jealous the best estimategiven by people who had reason to know such thingswas that it would cost any enemy tanks or a couple of divisions of infantry to batter through those fortifications to the courthouse and that was before the nkvd and the red army started throwing in reinforcements bokov was still nervous he wasnt the only one either moisei shteinberg didnt just twitch he quivered as a jew he had extra reason to want to see goring and ribbentrop and rosenberg and streicher and the rest of the brutes dead and as a jew he had extra reason to fear what would land on him if anything went wrong they cannot get through he said to bokov surveying the fortified belt from the outside no comrade colonel they cant bokov agreed he was a little easier in his mind than shteinberg was he was no jew he was no colonel either less blame for any failure would stick to him he could hope so anyhow he did hope so with all his heart they cant give it to us up the ass either shteinberg went on worrying as if bokov hadnt spoken we have our own generator weve sealed off the water lines weve sealed off the sewer lines weve got our own water tower by the courthouse weve got a sealedoff septic tank to handle the drains the heydrichites cant possibly get at or get into any of that stuff they cant dammit youre right comrade colonel bokov said what else was he supposed to say you couldnt very well go wrong agreeing with your superior officer and as far as he could see colonel shteinberg was right right maybe but not reassured he looked up into the air the only planes there were a couple of the ubiquitous cs they were too far away to let bokov tell if they were american originals or the soviet copies called lis the one had its entry door on the left side of the fuselage the other on the right it hardly mattered either way they sure as the devil werent german even shteinberg saw as much the luftwaffes dead i dont miss those wolves at all he said ever have a stuka bomb your trench no sir bokov hadnt seen frontline service only happened to me once and im not sorry shteinberg said it was early in the war i had to deal with a major who lost his head lost his head probably meant something like retreated without orders and deal with certainly meant something like kill i was going to take him away and this damned thing with a shark mouth painted on its nose screamed down on us andwell i didnt have to worry about the major any more not enough of him left to bury it could have been me it could always be you in the soviet union that was as axiomatic as anything out of euclid the knock on the door the tap on the shoulderit didnt have to be nearly so dramatic as a screaming sharkmouthed dive bomber no wonder shteinberg was so jumpy no wonder everybody with a blue stripe around his cap was another c flew by this one right overhead dont worry too much comrade colonel bokov said well make it work da shteinberg said and then wed better red army sentries discouraged germans from getting too close to the fortified zone they shouted one warningtheyd learned to say heraus after thatusually only seconds after thatthey opened fire they did just that this morning bokov heard the sharp peremptory crygerman was a wonderful language for giving orders he heard the sharp stutter of a threeround burst from the guards ppsh submachine gun when somebody didnt listen to the order no matter how wonderfully peremptory it sounded and he heard a screech that said at least one of those rounds connected sure as hell somebody was down and thrashing maybe seventyfive meters outside the perimeter bokov and shteinberg loped over to him he was a halfstarved fellow with a beak of a nose and several days worth of gray stubble on his chin and cheeks at the moment he was clutching his left leg and cussing a blue streak seeing two nkvd men bearing down on him only made him turn his indignation on them that verkakte mamzer went and shot me he exclaimed in what came fairly close to german nu what did you expect him to do give you a big kiss moisei shteinberg replied in the same language bokov could follow it well enough to realize what was going on a jew a dp he thought the guard came up he didnt want to see two nkvd men either anxiously he said he didnt move when i yelled orders are to open fire if they dont move i did what everybody above me told me to do its all right bokov told him youre not in trouble go back to your post with an enormous sigh of relief and a paradeground salute the guard obeyed how bad are you hit colonel shteinberg asked the wounded man the fellow pulled up his trouser leg he had a bloody groove in the outside of his calf shteinberg waved dismissively that isnt worth getting excited about easy for you to say it isnt your leg either the jewno the other jewretorted hurts like shit he didnt say scheisse he said govno chances were hed started out in poland or the soviet union then where hed been since bokov spoke german not yiddish why didnt you clear out when the guard warned you gevalt some warning the dp saidbokov had figured hed be able to follow regular deutsch the fucking nazis couldnt kill me off so now you russian mamzrim try and finish the job for them a kholeriyeh on you mamzrim bokov asked shteinberg it had to be the plural of the earlier insult but bokov didnt know what the insult meant to begin with bastards shteinberg supplied economically he gave his attention back to the dp everybodys got a sob story these days some of them are even true the rest arent good for wiping your ass muttering under his breath the skinny man displayed a tattoo on his arm know what that means you he bit back whatever hed been about to add no doubt a good idea but colonel shteinberg had to nod bokov also recognized a deathcamp serial number this fellow had seen hell on earth all right if he kept mouthing off he might get to compare the nazi and soviet versions of it too and before they shipped me to auschwitz they had me digging their fucking mines for them in the mountains the jew went on i go through all that i live through all that and your miserable shithead puts a hole in my leg the way you talk i should thank him maybe you should shteinberg said he could have hit you in the head wait vladimir bokov said both colonel shteinberg and the dp looked at him in surprise bokov eyed the survivor you say you worked in the mines in the mountains down in the alps thats right the skinny man said what about it were you justdigging out gypsum or whatever it was bokov asked notea with fucking lemon wedges the dp snapped what the devil else would i be doing down there bokov seldom faced such sarcasm not from a man he was interrogating the halfswallowed chuckle that came from colonel shteinberg didnt help either doing his best to ignore sarcasm and amusement bokov asked did the nazis care how much you brought up they cared how much i dug the wounded jew answered if you didnt do enough to suit em you were a goner right there but did they care how muchfuck call it gypsumyou brought up or just how much you dug bokov persisted excitement tingling through him despite his best efforts to hold it down oh shteinberg said softly i know what youre driving at i sure dont the dp said shteinberg had spoken russian not yiddish or german the dp still followed him that didnt surprise bokov not after his earlier guesses just answer my question he snapped this time with an nkvd officers authority in his voice after frowning in memoryand no doubt in pain as wellthe dp said as long as we moved rock they didnt give a shit some of us thought it was funny some of us just thought the nazis were meshigge nuts shteinberg translated adding thats an assendofnowhere dialect of yiddish he talks who me the skinny jew sounded affronted im no dumb litvak who goes fiss like a snake when he means fish shibboleth moisei shteinberg murmured which seemed to mean something to the dp even if it didnt to bokov shteinberg took out a clasp knife and cut some cloth from the dps alreadyragged trouser leg so he could bandage the bloody gouge then shteinberg frisked him he found a small chunk of a dration bar andmuch better hiddena us fivedollar and a tendollar bill whered you get these he asked tell it straight the first time or youll be sorry sorry im already sorry the skinny man said before shteinberg could say anything else he went on yeah i knowill be sorrier you people know how to take care of that the guys who gave me the money were a couple of american soldiers officers even i think they gave me the chocolate too its not so great but it fills you up ive been empty a lot americans eh bokov sounded less suspicious than he would have most of the time his own thoughts were racing in a different direction eyeing the dp he asked were they jews too yeah they talked yiddish to me not german better than him tooone of them sounded just like me the man sneered at shteinberg captain bokov wouldnt have wanted to piss off an nkvd colonel but the dp didnt seem to give a damn they treated me a hell of a lot better all the way around if you want to know what i think fat chance shteinberg said bokov thought exactly the same thing at the same time all the same he asked this place where the nazis had you diggingcould you find it again could you show us where it is he leaned forward waiting for the answer the dp said only it aint in your zone i understand that bokov could be patient when he needed to but could you maybe the skinny jew wasnt about to admit anything not till he knew which way the wind blew shteinberg made a fist and brought it downon the cement next to the fellows wounded leg thenmaybewe wont have to get rough to find out are you still thinking along with me sir bokov asked the colonel smiled a vulpine smile maybe he said the fourth of july had always been diana mcgraws favorite holidaywell except for christmas which was a different kind of thing altogether the fourth went with picnics and beer and sometimes going to the park to listen to bands and patriotic songs and speeches and waiting through the long hot sticky day for nightfall at last and cuddling with ed while fireworks set the sky ablaze above them and the kids went ooooo and here was the fourth come round again here she was in a park again only in indianapolis not anderson the mcgraws had gone to the state capital a couple of times before the war to see if the fireworks were better once they were they werent the next time so the family didnt go back diana looked out at the throng of people in the park with her at the throng of american flags at the throng of placards they stretched from just in front of the speakers platform to too far away to read but the ones she couldnt make out were bound to say the same things as the ones she could if you were here today you wanted harry truman to bring the boys home from germany if you were here todayshe turned to the indianapolis police officer who stood on the platform with her and the other people who would talk in a while how big a crowd to you think weve got today lieutenant offenbacher offenbachers beer belly and double chin said he spent most of his time at a desk he didnt look happy standing here sweating in the sun still he shaded his eyes with a hand and peered out over the stillswelling mass of people from what i can see and from what ive heard from the men on crowdcontrol duty id say mm maybe fifteen or twenty thousand folks experience had taught diana that cops cut the size of crowds by at least halfmore often twothirdswhen they didnt like the cause by now shed had a good deal of practice gauging them too this one looked more like forty or fifty thousand to her but even offenbachers estimate was impressive enough just think she said brightly weve got rallies like this in every big city from coast to coastand in a lot of cities that arent so big too yes maam lieutenant offenbachers voice held no expression whatever they had governors and congressmen and senators speaking at the rallies too it had been less than two years since diana started her movement back then most politicians wanted nothing to do with it or with her jerry duncan bless him was the exception not the rule but things had changed oh yes just a little and they also had actors and actresses speaking it wasnt bad publicity not any more they had singers they had ministers and priestsnext to no rabbis they had baseball players not all of them of course what ted williams told them to do with their invitation wasnt repeatable in polite company it wasnt physically possible either they had writersnewspapermen and novelists they had some of just about every kind of people who could make other people listen no diana hadnt known what she was getting into when she started out she also hadnt known how many others she could bring along with her and they still had people who hated their guts the cops offenbacher led werent just keeping the antioccupation crowd orderly they were also keeping counterdemonstrators from wading into the crowd with their own picket signsand with baseball bats and tire irons and any other toys they could get their hands on some of the chants that rose from their opponents might have made ted williams blush cant your men arrest them for public obscenity diana asked offenbacher well they could the boss cop allowed maybe if things get worse worse how you never know lieutenant offenbacher said diana understood that much too well the indianapolis police sympathized with the counterdemonstrators they wouldnt do anything against them they didnt absolutely have to time to get the show on the road diana stepped up to the microphone welcome ladies and gentlemen she said and paused while cheers and applause drowned out the noise from the oppositions peanut gallery thank you for coming out this afternoon weve got some terrific people lined up to talk to you and weve got one of the best fireworks shows in town waiting for you after the sun goes down more cheers maybe even louder this time as they ebbed diana went on but most of all thank you for being here no matter why you came we still need to show harry truman and all the people in washington with their heads in the sand that there are lots and lots of us and we arent about to go away a great roar swelled up from the crowd thats right it sure is diana said and now its my pleasure to introduce our first speaker city councilman gus van slyke van slyke had a belly even bigger than lieutenant offenbachers hed made a fortune selling used cars he hadnt come down one way or the other on the german occupation till a friends nephew got wounded over there that convinced him that he couldnt stand truman probably didnt hurt we won the war by gosh we did he said his voice was gruff and growly like a bears just waking from hibernation now enough is enough what are we doing over there in europe were getting good young men our best killed and maimed we arent accomplishing anything doing it the fanatics are still there no matter what weve tried and how much money have we flushed away billions and bill when diana heard the sharp pop it didnt register as anything but a backfire but gus van slyke fell over something warm and wet splashed dianas armshe was wearing a sleeveless dress because of the heat it was blood she could smell it she could smell something else toovan slyke had fouled himself his feet drummed on the platform but not for long he lay in a spreading pool of his own gore diana jammed a hand in her mouth to keep from shrieking out in the crowd people did start screaming some of them tried to run away they stepped on other people no they trampled themthey werent being polite about it more screams and yells and wails rang out which only led to more trampling as chaos spread lieutenant offenbacher stepped around the red red pool as he strode to the microphone this assembly is canceled he declared this is a crime scene a murder investigation that didnt stop the panic in the crowd either if anything it made matters worse the fireworks got canceled too official washingtoncelebrated the fourth of july on the mall the president made a speech no doubt it was full of patriotic fervor the fireworks display was second to none with uncle sam footing the bill they could afford to make it lavish tom schmidt wasnt there somebody else was covering president trumans hot air for the chicago tribune unofficial washington gathered in lafayette park across pennsylvania avenue from the white house to tell official washington what it thought of trumans german policy official washington of course was hard of hearing no tom muttered as clark griffith who owned the washington senatorsfirst in boos first in shoes last in the american leaguetore into truman official washington is hard of listening whats that another reporter asked him nothing just woolgathering tom lied he wrote the line down sure as hell it would help the column along griffith finally ran out of words and backed away from the microphone next batter up was congressman everett dirksen of illinois dirksen had kind of fishy features wildly curly hair and the exaggerated gestures of a shakespearean ham actor the combination should have made him ridiculous somehow it didnt his baritone bell of a voice had a lot to do with that so did the genuine outrage that poured from him now out in indiana they are killing uskilling us i tell you he thundered pounding a fist down on the lectern councilman augustus van slyke tried to exercise his rights under the first amendment of our great constitution he tried to peaceably petition our government for redress of grievances and our government has a great many grievances to redress but i shall speak of that another time augustus van slyke tried to tell the truth to the powers that be and what became of him what became of him he was shot dead my friends shot down like a dog in the highway without so much as a bunch of lace at his throat something stirred in tom schmidt as he scribbled notes that was from a poem hed read it in high school the highwayman that was it though he was damned if he could remember who wrote it well he could check bartletts when he got back to the bureau only somebody like dirksen though there wasnt really anybody like dirksenhe was one of a kind would throw a poem into a political speech but it worked the hum that rose from the crowd said it worked half the people there maybe more mustve read the highwayman or heard somebody recite it dirksen might be a crazy fox but a fox he was how dare they how dare they he pounded the lectern again they are no longer content with lying to us no that does not satisfy them any more for they begin to see that we begin to see through the tissue of their lies and so where words will not suffice them they commence to argue with bullets but will even bullets stop us friends no the crowd roared that cry must have rattled windows in the white house harry truman wasnt there to hear ithed be speechifying to his friends right now if he had any friends to his supporters anyhow maybe hed hear it on the mall too hammier than any actor dirksen cupped a hand behind one ear what was that he asked mildly no that oceanic crowdroar came again even louder this time toms ears rang a little nervously he wondered how many people here carried guns some pulp horror writerschmidt couldnt come up with his name either and it wouldnt be in bartlettsonce advanced a rule about raising demons do not call up that which you cannot put down had everett dirksen ever heard of that rule the white house was right across the street if the crowd tried to storm it councilman van slyke wouldnt be the only one who got shot today unhunh not even close they say in indianapolis they have yet to find the murdererto find the filthy assassin dirksen hissed the last word with poisonous relish he shot a man dead in broad daylight before witnesses uncounted and they have yet to find him my friends how hard are they looking another roar rose up from the throng gathered together in the hot sticky july night this one was wordless and all the angrier for that suddenly tom schmidt wasnt just anxious any more he was scared green politics was what you did instead of shooting people who didnt think like you but once you started shooting where did you stop anywhere if the second revolutionor maybe the second civil warstarts here its a hell of a story yeah tom thought but am i gonna live long enough to file it and then he caught a break maybe the whole country caught a breakhe was never sure afterwards but he always thought so over on the mall the superduper fireworks show began the noise was like gunfire but the polychrome flameflowers and torrents of blazing sparks exploding across the velvetblack sky proclaimed by their beauty their peace everett dirksen looked over his shoulder at them that was probably sheer reflex to begin with but he seemed transfixed by the spectaclehe couldnt look away at last he did he lifted his glasses with one hand and rubbed at his eyes with the other then softly at first but with his great voice swelling as the words poured out of him he began to sing the starspangled banner it was a bitch of a song to sing but he did it he raised his hands and the crowd joined in tom schmidt started singing before he quite realized he was doing it he couldnt carry a tune in a sack but it didnt matter right then none of the reporters nearby sounded any better than he did chances were most of the people in lafayette park wouldnt run alfred drake or ethel merman out of business any time soon either that also turned out not to matter added all together they sounded pretty damn good the bombs bursting in air tears ran unashamed down everett dirksens cheek glistening in the spotlights did he mean them or could he bring them on at command with dirksen you never could tell but half the hardbitten newshounds near tom were sniffling too as bombs did burst in air and nobody stormed the white house xxv nkvd lieutenant general yuri pavlovich vlasov wore a permanent scowl i would too vladimir bokov thought warily eyeing vlasovs pinched pulleddown mouth and angry bristly eyebrows the assistant chief of the nkvds berlin establishment was cursed and would be cursed till the day he died with an unfortunate family name red army general andrei vlasov was the worst traitor the ussr had had in the great patriotic war after surrendering to the nazis hed commanded what goebbels called the russian liberation army a fascist puppet force of other soviet traitors and after the wehrmacht surrendered hed been captured and shot and better than he deserved too yuri vlasov had no family connection to him the surname wasnt rare but the stench that went with it lingered no soviet citizen could say the word vlasovite without feeling as if shit filled his mouth vlasov met the problem the same way captain bokov would have were he stuck with it by acting ten times as tough as he would have otherwise so it was no great surprise when yuri vlasovs cold narroweyed glarehe had tartar eyes like bokovs and his were also darkswung from the captain to colonel shteinberg and back again as if he couldnt believe what he was hearing and it was no great surprise when he barked nyet but comrade general we have this excellent informationnew and excellent information moisei shteinberg said we have it and we cant do anything with it ourselves its like having a pretty girl when you cant get it up much less earthy than most russians shteinberg hardly ever cracked jokes like that maybe he shouldnt have cracked this one lieutenant general vlasovs right hand cramped into a whiteknuckled fist his cheeks and ears blazed red had he tried playing games with some german popsy with big tits and come up short whether he had or he hadnt he snarled fuck your mother shteinberg i told you you couldnt go to the american pricks and you goddamn well cant that is an order do you understand it da comrade general shteinberg answered tonelessly the only thing he could say those fierce tartar eyes lit on bokov again he wished they wouldnt have what about you captain vlasov demanded do you also understand the order da comrade general bokov said as shteinberg had before him khorosho but it wasnt good enough to suit vlasov for he rounded on shteinberg once more youre a zhid yourself so you were born sneakyjust like this socalled informant of yours asking if you understand isnt enough will you obey the order bokov didnt know whether the loophole had occurred to shteinberg it had occurred to him a measure of his own rage and desperation he waited to see what shteinberg would say the jew said what he had to say yet again da comrade general he sighed afterwards which did him not a farts worth of good yuri vlasov proceeded to nail things down tight you will obey too captain bokov da comrade general i serve the soviet union bokov did his best to turn the ritual phrase of acknowledgment into a reproach his best wasnt good enough all right then thats settled vlasov said relentless as a bulldozer fuck off both of you theyfucked off once outside ofwell outside ofyuri vlasovs office bokov began id like to wait in line captain im senior to you shteinberg said so many people like him and we beat the hitlerites anyway only goes to show germany was pretty screwed up too but this shmuel bokov kept spluttering phrases we ought to colonel shteinberg took him by the elbow and steered him out of nkvd headquarters before he could splutter a phrase that would cook his goose no shteinberg said regretfully but firmly he gave us an order we promised to obey it if we go back on that he shivered though the day was warm enough and then some even if it worked out well theyd still make examples of us that was such obvious truth bokov didnt waste his breath arguing it he did say that goddamn fathead will be sorry he gave his stupid order one way or another things will even out shteinberg said unless of course they dont a crew of german stevedores in overalls loaded crates into the c first lieutenant wes adams eyed his cargo manifest equipment it said which told him exactly nothing you know what were taking to berlin he asked his copilot buncha boxes and two krauts answered second lieutenant sandor nagyhe inevitably went by sandy the krauts were on the manifest too at the bottom wonder who they paid off to get a lift wes said sandy shrugged beats me they finagled it though one way or another so well haul em and kick em off the plane and say byebye the germans came aboard right on time they were krauts all rightprobably figured somebodyd execute em for showing up five minutes late the guy was pale and skinny in a suit that had been new about when the depression started the woman would have been pretty if not for a scar on one cheek the way she scowled at wes and sandy made the pilot bet shed got the scar in a wartime air raid tough shit lady wes thought he pointed to a couple of folding seats right behind the cockpit sit here buckle yourselves in stay here till we get to berlin kein englisch the guy spread his hands regretfully wes repeated himself this time in rudimentary german ach ja zu befehl the man said and the gal nodded wes eyed him zu befehl was what a jerry soldier said when he got an order the way an american would go yes sir well there werent a hell of a lot of german men who hadnt gone through the mill and he and his lady friend were settling into the uncomfortable seats peaceably enough lets go through the checklist sandy wes said with a mental shrug sure thing boss the copilot replied everything came out green wes set an affectionate hand on the gooney birds steering yoke a c would fly through things that tore a fighter to pieces and take off with all kinds of shit showing up red hed done that kind of thing during the war more often than he cared to remember you didnt have to in peacetime flying which was nice twin horsepower pratt and whitney radial engines fired up as reliably as zippos wes and sandy taxied out to the end of the runway taxiing was the only thing that could get tricky in a c in tight spaces you really needed pilot and copilot both paying close attention but they had plenty of room here when the tower gave clearance wes gunned the engines he pulled back on the yoke as the c got to takeoff speed up in the air it wentsedately because it was a transport and a heavily laden transport at thatbut without the least hesitation if you wanted to fly something from here to there this was the plane to do it they headed up toward feet where theyd cruise to berlin no need to worry about oxygen not lazing along down here like this wes leaned back in his seat this is the life he said over the pratt and whitneys roar beats working sandy agreed the c bounced a little as it ran into some turbulence it was enough to notice not enough to get excited about wes had flown straight through thunderstorms a gooney bird was built to take it because of the engine noise he didnt hear the cockpit door open motion caught from the corner of his eye made his head whip around there stood the german couple they both held pistolsno cutdown schmeissers what the fuck wes said sorry friend the man said he spoke english after all that was wes last startled thought then the submachine guns barked luftwaffe oberleutnant ernst neulen and the former flakhilferin he knew only as mitziwhat you didnt know you couldnt tellpulled the amis bodies out of their seats good job he told her as he settled into the pilots seat himself it was bloody but that wouldnt matter for long vielen dank she said primly as if hed complimented her on her dancing go get your umbrella neulen told her she gave him a smilea twisted one because of that scar then she went back into the cargo compartment the forwardmost crate had a trick side that opened easily if you knew what to do mitzi did she shrugged on the parachute she found inside that done she stepped into the cockpit again for a moment good luck she told him you too he answered his voice far away he was cautiously fiddling with the throttle did it work germanstyle or like the ones in french and italian planes where you had to push instead of pulling and vice versa some young german pilots had bought a plot by forgetting the difference after training on foreign aircraft oberleutnant neulen found out what he needed to know and relaxed im going to bail out now mitzi said right neulen agreed still getting a feel for the plane it was a hell of a lot more modern than the trimotored jus that had hauled cargo and soldiers for the reich he wouldnt have wanted to try to land it though hed heard even coming in wheelsup was a piece of cake for a c but he didnt have to worry about that mitzi disappeared again no doubt heading for the cargo door neulen hoped she would make it down in one piece shed practiced on the ground but shed never jumped out of an airplane before shed never really landed either well all you could do was try and hope for the best he also hoped the americansor was the c over the russian zone by now wouldnt grab her as soon as she touched ground how much did she know too much neulen was sure of that he hoped for the best again german patriots on the ground would do their best for her when she landed anyhow he was sure of that he felt the door open and heard the howl of the wind inside the cargo bay out mitzi went he felt that too luck neulen said softly he flew on toward berlin he was about fifteen minutes outside the city when the radio crackled to life youre a little north of the flight path change course five degrees right five degrees right roger neulen said in english and made about half the change still a little north the american flight controller said you okay wes you sound like you got a cold in the head i am okay neulen answered and said no moreless was better pretty soon the flight controller came back youre still off course and youre up too high too make your corrections dammit is the aircraft all right all fine neulen said he did come downwhy not how fast could they scramble fighters nobody flew top cover over berlin someone was liable to go where he shouldnt and then the russians and angloamericans might start shooting at one another keep them happy as long as he could neulen didnt want them phoning their flak batteries either he was below feet meters he translated mentallywhen he overflew the airport what are you doing man are you nuts the flight controller howled theyre gonna ground your stupid ass forever not that long neulen answered he gunned the c almost straight into the earlymorning sun this time we try the bastards this time we hang the bastards lou weissberg said savagely i want to watch em swing i want to hear their necks crack all of emand especially streichers the antisemitic motherfucker thats not a christian thought howard frank observed damn straightsir lou said im not a christian any more than you are an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth sounds great to me let the nazis turn the other cheekunder a hood in the wind okay frank said ribbentrop and keitel and jodl are the ones i want most the one plotted the war and the other two fought it and goring for the luftwaffe even if he was pretty useless once the fighting started worse than useless didnt he tell hitler he could keep the germans in stalingrad supplied by air lou said thats what ive heard major frank agreed even so he was one of hitlers righthand men when the nazis were coming up if thats not reason enough to put a noose around his neck reason enough for all of them reason enough and then some and this time they will get it oh boy will they ever lou eyed the fortified ring the russians had built around their courthouse he eyed it from a distance of several hundred yards because the russians were liable to start shooting if anybodyanybody at allgot too close one american officer had already got plugged for not reacting fast enough to heraus luckily hed live nobody except maybe the nkvd knew how many germans were wounded or dead major frank was looking the other way pretty soon they go through the maze and in yeah lou nodded soviet stalin tanks us pershings and british centurions would surround the halftracks carrying the accused to justice the road had been widenedthe russians had blown up the buildings to either sideso the heavy armor could do just that demolitions people swept for mines every half hour even the sewers were blocked off as they were around the court no rescue for the nazi big shots wont be long frank said glancing down at his watch in theyll go the judges are already waiting for them uhhuh just like they were back in nuremberg lou ground his teeth together a split second too late to keep the words from escaping that goddamn fanatic with his truck full of explosiveslou counted himself lucky not to have been there when the blast went off too many of the men who would have tried the nazis had died in it kineahora howard frank exclaimed lou nodded vigorously he hadnt wanted to put the whammy on what was about to happenjust the opposite here they come frank said hearing the heavy rumble of approaching motors lou started to nod one more time but he didnt because that heavy rumble was approaching much too fast and it wasnt coming up the widened road either it wasin the air in the air the c thundered over them at treetop height maybe lower the wind of its passage almost knocked lou off his feet what the fuck he choked outhis mouth and eyes and nose were all full of dust and grit that wind had kicked up ahead a few of the red army men guarding the courthouse started shooting at the mad gooney birdbut only a few and too late much too late its gonna horror as well as dust clogged major franks voice he tried again its gonna and then it did it wasnt just a hurtling c crashing into the courthouse somehow the fanatics had loaded the plane with explosives it could carry more than a deuceandahalf could and when the shit went off lou weissberg and howard frank stood more than a mile from the blast it hammered their ears and rocked them all the same lou staggered again as he had only seconds before when the transport roared by overhead the fireball that went up dwarfed the courthouse by then lou had seen newsreel footage of what happened when an atom bomb blew up this wasnt just like that a baby version an ordinary blockbuster lou thought dazedly plenty bad enough gottenyu frank burst out the bastards just took out the judges again and the lawyers and vey iz mir lou clapped a hand to his forehead he heard major frank as if from very far away he wondered if his ears would ever be the same hed wondered the same thing plenty of times before the sadly misnamed ve day it had always come back then maybe it would now he also wondered why he hadnt thought of what frank had because youre punchy dummy the answer supplied itself more slowly than he might have he noticed a rumble and clatter from behind him he turned sure as hell here came the tanks protecting the nazi bonzen on their way to trial on their way tonothing now judges and attorneys had gone up in the fireball but the foulest criminals in the history of the world were fine the way things were going theyd probably die of old age helplessly lou started to laugh and cry at the same time he waited for major frank to slap him silly and tell him to snap out of it that was what happened when you got hysterical right but when he looked over at the other officer he saw frank doing the same goddamn thing vladimir bokov decided the fortifications around the courthouse seemed even more impressive from within than when viewed from the outside standing in a trench along the route by which the war criminals would at last come to justice he couldnt actually see very much even so he knew he was in the middle of that maze of trenches and minefields and concrete antitank obstacles and barbed wire and machinegun nests andeverything under the sun everything anyone could think of including artillery and antiaircraft guns and thousands of red army and nkvd men theyre going to get it this time theyre going to get it and were going to give it to them he spoke with a certain somber pride we are the workers and peasants of the soviet union and the nkvd of course and the angloamericans and even the afterthought that was france but he knew the propaganda line and he needed next to no conscious thought to echo it any soviet citizen had plenty of practice with that and moisei shteinberg nodded well do it right well show the americans how to do it right that also came straight from the propaganda line but then he lowered his voice to something not far above a whisper i wish we could show the americans that fucking stupid pigheaded vlasov captain bokov also whispered because of the soviet traitor taking the nkvd generals name in vain felt extra filthy and if the soldiers around them overheard him theyd think he was cursing the collaborator i shteinbergs head came up as a wolfs would have at an unexpected noise in the forest whats that whatever it was it got louder and closer much too fast mothercocksuckingfuck a red army sergeant shouted and pointed into the sky not very far into the skythe c roared by almost close enough to knock off bokovs cap that was how it felt anyhow colonel shteinberg the damned clever jew was quicker on the uptake than bokov nooo he howleda wail of fury and despairand fired a burst from his submachine gun at the plane here and there a few other chekists and red army men shot at it but most like vladimir bokov watched in frozen surprise one antiaircraft gun opened uponly one as far as bokov could tell whatever its shells ended up hitting they missed the c it slammed into the courthouse at something over kilometers an hour the blast knocked bokov flat even though he was in the trench he and colonel shteinberg fell all over each other in fact and they fell on the foulmouthed sergeant or he fell on them and everybody close by was falling over everybody else and then chunks of masonry and sheet metal and everything else that went into a building and an airplane started falling on them and some of that was on fire squoosh if you dropped a rock on a pumpkin from a thirdstory window it would make a noise like that maybe five meters from bokov a brick plummeting from the devils sister only knew how far smashed in a soldiers skull the poor bastard thrashed like a chicken that had just met the hatchet he was as dead as a chopped chicken too those clappedout cunts they did it again when moisei shteinberg swore like that somebodyd spilled the thundermug into the soup and the heydrichites damn well had bokov ever so cautiously looked out of the trench the courthouse was a sea of flame with black greasy smoke already towering high into the sky over it hadnt an american bomber slammed into the empire state building not so long before maybe that was what gave the bandits the idea for this raid but the empire state building was still standing the architects who designed it must have seen that it might be a target and strengthened it accordingly nobodyd ever imagined a nondescript police courthouse in berlin might get clobbered by an explosivespacked c going flat out who in his right mind would have and it stood no more comrade colonel bokov shouted suddenly thinking of something else that should stand no more he needed to shout several times before he got shteinbergs notice everybodys ears were stunned at last the jew growled what is it he glowered at bokov as if he thought all this was his fault dont get pissed off at me comrade colonel bokov said he had a good notion of whose fault it really was i know what we need to do next you do do you suspicion filled shteinbergs voice and that is sir we need to go have another talk with lieutenant general vlasov moisei shteinberg thought it over slowly he smiled a smile that should have shown sharks teeth instead of his own yellowish set as he smiled he nodded youre right he said we do yet again the angloamericans and the russians to say nothing of the remora french which was what they deserved to have said of them would not get to put on their show trial for the leaders of the third reich and the national socialist german workers party a small cold smile stole across reinhard heydrichs face as he went through newspaper and magazine accounts some of the photos were truly spectacular so were some of the editorials one american writer feared the german resistance would start what he called a reign of terror in the air he imagined fighting men seizing planes full of passengers and flying them into buildings all over europe and maybe even in the states he imagined seizing laden planes and crashing them on purpose he even imagined seizing planes and flying them to say francos spain to hold the passengers hostage till the german freedom fronts demands were met he had one hell of an imagination none of that stuff had occurred to heydrich as far as he was concerned the attack on the berlin courthouse was a oneoff job but he recognized good ideas when somebody stuck them in front of his nose he started taking notes only a handful of these hijackings and atrocities would be needed to throw air transport into chaos all over the world the editorial writer warned would travelers put up with the delays and inconveniences necessary to ensure no one can smuggle weapons or explosives aboard aircraft it seems most unlikely it seemed pretty unlikely to heydrich too he wrote himself more notes throw air transport into chaos all over the world that sounded good to him he didnt know whether grabbing a few planes would have the effect this fellow foretold but he could hardly wait to find out hans klein walked into his office with more papers and magazines weve got em jumping like fleas on a hot griddle herr reichsprotektor the noncom said good thats the idea may they jump out of germany soon heydrich bounced some of the american editorial writers ideas off of klein what do you think he asked respecting the veterans solid common sense can we do these things would they cause as much trouble as the ami thinks they might klein said slowly we dont have many pilots left to aim at buildings but anybody with balls can crash a plane and if you were going to fly to spain instead of crashing you could likely point a gun at the regular pilot and make him take you there well so you could heydrich wrote that down too some men who werent willing to throw their lives away for the reich would be willing to fight for it they might make good hijackersand quite a few people from the third reich had already taken refuge in friendlyeven if officially neutralspain oberscharfuhrer kleins thoughts ran on a different track damn shame that poor mitzi gals chute didnt open when she jumped his mouth twisted too much time to think on the way down ja heydrich said and left it right there at his quiet orders the man whod packed mitzis parachute made sure it wouldnt open why take chances she was much too likely to get captured and grilled after she landed when you issued orders like that you had to do it quietly if it got out that youd thrown away someones lifeespecially a womanson purpose your own people would give you trouble never mind that it was the only reasonable thing to do what you saw as reasonable theyd see as coldhearted and now heydrich wanted to find a discreet way to dispose of the man whod packed mitzis chute as soon as that fellow started pushing up daisies he wouldnt be able to blab to the enemy he wouldnt be able to blab to his own pals either none of which showed on the reichsprotektors face once upon a time the fuhrerd called him the man with the iron heart if you were going to hold a position like his an iron heart was an asset no two ways about it one more embarrassment for the enemy he said with any luck at all it will make the amis squeal even louder than they are already ja klein perked up he was always eager to look in that direction tomorrow belongs to us well of course it does reinhard heydrich said lieutenant general vlasov had looked and acted like a son of a bitch the last time bokov and shteinberg called on him he seemed even less friendly now for twenty kopeks his expression said both the other nkvd men could find out how they liked chopping down spruces in the middle of siberian winter however much he hated them though he couldnt just tell them to fuck off the way he had before he might want to he plainly did want to but the heydrichites had humiliated the soviet union before the world when they crashed that plane into what would have been the war criminals courthouse striking back at them any way at all looked like a good idea it did to captain bokov anyhow and to colonel shteinberg whether it did to yuri vlasovweve got to find out dammit bokov told himself i know what the two of you are here for vlasov rasped youre going to try and talk me into sucking the americans cocks no comrade general no nothing like that shteinberg said soothingly yes comrade general yes just like that vladimir bokov thought fiercely he wanted to watch vlasov squirm maybe they could have kept the crash from happening if only the miserable bastard had put his ass in gear dont bother buttering me up zhid vlasov said nothing but a waste of time however you pleasesir moisei shteinberg held his voice under tight control my next move if you keep dicking around with us is to write to marshal beria and let him know how youre obstructing the struggle against the heydrichite bandits you wouldnt dare general vlasov bellowed yes i would ive already done it shteinberg said and if anything happens to me the letter goes to moscow anyway ive taken care of that toosir fuck your mother hard maybe my father did shteinberg answered calmly but at least i know who he wassir could looks have killed yuri vlasov would have shouted for men to come and drag two corpses out of his office bokov wondered whether the general would try something more direct he also wondered how much good this move would do him and shteinberg even if they turned out to be right he shrugged with luck invisibly if it helped the fight against heydrichs bandits hed worry about everything else later all right all right vlasov spat the words in shteinbergs face take this other kike to the americans then go ahead be my guest theyll probably be a bunch of jews too as far as im concerned he broke off breathing hard yes sir shteinbergs voice was polite even curious bokov was curious too what had vlasov swallowed something like as far as im concerned hitler knew what he was doing with you people bokov wouldnt have been surprised plenty of his fellowrussians felt that way he didnt love jews himself but you could damn well count on them to be antifascist no matter how much rope shteinberg fed vlasov the nkvd general was too canny to hang himself go on he barked if youre going to do it go do itand get the devil out of here if it works hell take the credit bokov warned once they were safely outside nkvd headquarters oh sure shteinberg agreed but hed do that anyway bokov laughed not that his superior was jokingor wrong aye jerry duncan said mr duncan votes aye joe martin intoned and the clerk of the house recorded his vote they werent going to be able to override president trumans veto of the bill that cut off funds for the us occupation of germany they had a solid majority including most republicans and the growing number of democrats who saw that staying on trumans side was lucky not to have cost them their jobs in the last election and that it damn well would get them tossed out next time around a good majority yes but not a twothirds majority too bad jerry thought the roll call droned on sure enough when it finally finished they fell twentytwo votes short of ramming the budget down the presidents throat mr truman has put himself on record as saying he will not sign a war department appropriation without money for continuing the occupation of germany speaker martin said after announcing the results i want to put the house of representatives on record too we will not send him an appropriations bill with that item in it members of the majority jerry duncan loud among them clapped their hands and cheered several congressmen shouted hear hear as if they belonged to the house of commons in london people whod voted against the override booed some of them shook their fists jerry couldnt remember seeing that kind of bad behavior here everybodys temper was frayed maybe things had been like this in the runup to the civil war the trial of wills over the occupation was tearing the country apart now order we will have order the speaker thumped his gavel the sergeant at arms has the authority to take whatever steps may prove necessary to restore order joe martin continued the democratsand a handful of prooccupation republicanswent on booing he banged the gavel again something like order slowly returned out of it sam rayburn bawled mr speaker mr speaker had jerry been up there in the speakers seat he wouldnt have recognized the texas democrat when rayburn was speaker of the house hed made a point of ignoring people whose views he didnt fancy that was one of the perquisites the speaker enjoyed and few speakers had enjoyed it more than rayburn but joe martin said the distinguished gentleman from texas has the floor he clung to courtesy even as it collapsed around him thank you mr speaker rayburn could also be courtly when he felt like itand he could be an ironassed son of a bitch when he didnt he sounded slightly surprised had he expected martin to pretend not to hear him it looked that way to jerry duncan any which way rayburn went on you do realize mr speaker that if you refuse to give the war department the money it needs to keep holding down the nazis you will force us out of germany in spite of the presidents conviction and the us armys that we need to stay there yes mr rayburn i realize that and that is the point after all in their wisdom the framers of the constitution gave congress the purse strings not the president not the us army congress if the president and the army prove unwise as they have here we have the responsibility to exercise wisdom for them joe martin said hear hear this time jerry shouted it at the top of his lungs he was far from the only representative who did opponents of cutting off funds for the occupation yelled back people on both sides took off their jackets and tossed them aside as if expecting theyd be brawling in the aisles any second order there will be order the speaker of the house insisted loudly the microphone made each blow of his gavel sound like a gunshot after what had happened to poor gus van slykewhom hed known for yearsjerry wished that comparison hadnt leaped into his mind but it was the only one that seemed to fit also as if using a gun martin aimed a forefinger at sam rayburn the gentleman from texas may continuewithout i hope any undue outbursts this time i hope the same mr speaker and i do thank you for recollecting i had the floor rayburn said you say you and those who agree with you aim to stop the president and the army from acting unwisely i say just that sir and it is the truth joe martin replied jerry duncan nodded vehemently okay fine you havethe congress hasthis high and fancy responsibility rayburn waited the speaker of the house waved in agreement i say that also and it too is the truth all right then here is my question for you what happens when you exercise that responsibility and it turns out to be the biggest mistake since eve listened to the serpent in the garden of eden sam rayburn demanded ferociously president truman likes the saying the buck stops here when something goes wrong he admits it when the blame lands on youand it will mr speaker it willwhen it lands on you i say will you be man enough to shoulder it if that happens which i do not expect speaker martin began fools never do rayburn planted the barb with obvious relish bang went the gavel you are out of order as you know very well so is the housethe inmates are taking over the asylum bang bang enough joe martin snapped rayburn sat down grinning business resumed jerry wished the texan hadnt asked such a prickly question xxvi president truman had a high raspy annoying voice diana mcgraw had never really thought of it that way till after pat got killed but she sure did now of course for the past couple of years truman had been saying things she didnt like and didnt agree with that made a difference whether she thought so or not we will carry the presidents radio address live at the top of the hour the radio announcer said sounding as proud as if truman were moses about to read the brand new ten commandments on his station even stolid ed snorted at the fellows tone are we supposed to get excited or what its not like truman can do a fireside chat or anything not likely diana exclaimed when fdr said something you wanted to believe him whenever truman opens his mouth you know hes going to lie to you thats all he knows how to do the radio filled up most of the time till the top of the hour with commercials in a way diana supposed that was good it meant there were plenty of things to buy again during the war a lot of normal stuff had been unavailableand a lot of ads went away diana had to admit she hadnt missed them now the stuff was back and so were the pitchmen trying to convince people it was wonderful everybody knew the war was overexcept the stubborn missouri muleno jackassin the white house at last and precisely as if he were selling soap or cigarettes the announcer said and here is the president of the united states a long electric hiss a burst of static cut off almost instantly then harry trumans voice came out of the radio speaker good evening my fellow citizens the nazis still lurking in germany have proved again how dangerous they are laughing at the very idea of justice they flew a c into the building where their captured leaders would have gotten a fairer trial than any they gave their countless victims this c was hijacked in the air as best we can determine the american pilot and copilot were both callously murdered the nazis seem to have been able to smuggle extra explosives onto the airplane we are still investigating how they did it because somebody who shouldve kept his eyes open was asleep at thedarn switch ed mcgraw said anybody can see that if anybody can see it why did you say it diana wonderedone more thought she wouldnt have had before a death in germany turned things upside down and inside out for her all she said out loud was a quick hush i want to hear him much as we wish they werent the nazi fanatics are still dangerous truman went on because they are our soldiers need to stay in germany until we can be sure the country will stay peaceful and democraticthats democratic with a small dafter we go home they wouldnt be fighting if we werent there to give them big fat juicy targets diana burst out some people will say the fanatics wouldnt still be fighting if we werent in germany truman said as if he were sitting in the kitchen with the mcgraws ed chuckled and lit a cigarette they oughta put you in the white house babe how could i do worse diana said it wouldnt be easy the republican party in congress seems to feel that way truman said not just republicans not even close diana said hotly it would be nice if the world were so simple or it would be nice if the republicans werent so simple truman wouldntdidntmiss a chance to throw darts at the opposition but the fact is the nazis have a long history of attacking anybody and everybody they can reach the world knows that to its sorrow weve got the atom bomb they dont diana said if we run away from germany the first thing the nazis will do if they get back into power is start working on an atom bomb the president said they will deny it they will swear on a stack of bibles that they would never do anything like that they told the same lies after world war i and look what happened to the people who believed them thenthe lindberghs and the liberty lobby and the rest of the fools and the second thing the nazis will do if god forbid they get back into power is start working on a rocket that can reach the united states from germany truman said they had one on the drawing board when ve day came and made them shelve their plans if they build a transatlantic rocket with an atom bomb in its nose nobody is safe any more nobody not a single soul not anywhere in the world yeah yeah enough with the buck rogers bullmanure ed said if pigs had wings wed all carry umbrellas diana smiled at him he might not be exciting but his heart was in the right place his head too do the republicans in congress see that harry truman answered his own question they dont they might as well be ostriches not elephants the way theyve stuck their heads in the sand they flatout refuse to put any money in the budget for keeping our armed forces in germany without money we will have to start bringing troops home good diana said thats the idea we should have done it a long time ago if we had maybepatd still be alive her voice roughened at the last few words she still couldnt talk about him without wanting to cry i know hon ed said softly and he sounded husky too there on the radio truman kept chattering away an old proverb talks about being penny wise and pound foolish its so old it goes back to the days before our independence nowadays wed understand it better if it talked about penny wise and dollar foolish the point of it is youre making a mistake if you only worry about whats right in front of you and not about what happens half a mile or a mile or five miles farther down the road and thats exactly what the republicans who are starving our forces in germany are doing myheinie diana had heard an awful lot of bad language the past couple of years shed used more of it herself than she ever did before but she still tried not to when ed could hear her he chuckled now knowingof course what she hadnt said way to go babe you tell em they wont listen to me truman said sadly thats cause theyve got better sense than you do diana also had a lot of practice talking back to politicians on the radio this time the president didnt seem to listen to her trouble is theyre republicans and that just naturally means they arent what youd call good at listening he continued all the same theyd better hear this and hear it loud and clear if they make us clear out of germany if they make us leave long before we really ought to what happens afterwards is their fault theyll be responsible for it i know the situation we have now isnt very pretty what well get if we go their way will be worse and they will be to blame for it a bronx cheer didnt count as cussing diana sent the radio the wettest juiciest raspberry she could ed laughed out loud i wish i didnt have to tell you things like this harry truman said but unlike some people i could name my job is to tell you whats so not what sounds good or what might get me a few extra votes thanks good night that was the president of the united states harry s truman the announcer said as if anybody in his right mind didnt already know hes full ofmalarkey diana declared as ed turned off the radio her husband laughed again you better believe it he bent down and gave her a kiss then he nuzzled her neck so to heck with him for a little while anyways yeah to heck with him diana went upstairs to the bedroom willingly enough you needed to keep a man happy every so often she didnt have anything against ed when it was over and he turned on the nightstand lamp so he could find his cigarettes he had a big sloppy grin plastered across his face diana made herself smile too shed just started to warm up when too soon it was over was that happening more and more these days or was she simply noticing more because she didnt want to make ed angry or upset she didnt say anything about it he finished the cigarette gave her a tobaccoflavored kiss then got up to use the bathroom and brush his teeth five minutes later he was snoring diana lay there in the darkness it should have been better than this shouldnt it once upon a time it had been better than this hadnt it hadnt it she was a long time sleeping lou weissberg wondered what the hell brigadier general rrr baxters initials stood for there they were three rs in a row on the nameplate on baxters desk readin ritin rithmetic baxter it seemed as likely as anything else a companygrade officer couldnt very well come right out and ask a general something like that lou would just have to let his imagination run wild he glanced over at howard frank was the same burning question uppermost in franks mind too the other jewish officer didnt seem to keep glancing at the nameplate the way lou did but did that mean anything baxter had cold blue eyes that bifocals did nothing to warm up he eyed lou and major frank in turn if either man impressed him he hid it goddamn well well he doesnt impress me either lou thought except his initials a star on each shoulder put rrr baxter among the lords anointed in the counterintelligence corps he wouldnt give a rats ass whether he impressed a lonely subordinate or not hows your german boys he asked in that language his own deutsch had a strong american accent but he was plenty fluent ganz gut herr general howard frank said lou nodded figured as much but i wanted to make sure from what i hear german will work well enough baxter said well enough for what sir lou paused filled by a hope he hardly dared believe has the red army finally decided to work with us not the red army baxter replied and lous hope crashed and burned then it rose phoenixlike from the flames for the cic big wheel went on the nkvd the russians wanted to try the top nazis in their zone in berlin cause we screwed it up twice if they did it right they figured they could score propaganda points off of us well they ended up with egg on their face too they dont like that any better than we would theyre proud people after what they went through against the germans prides about all theyve got left lou remarked pride and most of eastern europe rrr baxter pointed out but yeah i know what you mean they paid for everything they gotpaid in blood now theyve got something they cant use themselves thats all i know about it right this minute thats all anybody who isnt a russian knows about it your job is to find out what it is and what we can do with it why us sir frank asked why not somebody with more clout for one thing youve both been heard to say we ought to work more with the russians brigadier general baxter answered lou blinked he had said things like that how closely were people here monitored though if the higherups knew hed said it well that one answered itself didnt it baxter went on and the russians dont want to make a big deal out of this if it doesnt work out the blame wont land on themthats our best guess so they dont want anything more than a midlevel contact not yet anyhow youre it the two of youif youre game of course if you arent youre nothing but a couple of gutless worthless pieces of shit baxter didnt say that but he didnt have to one other thing he might not have said was a couple of gutless worthless jewish pieces of shit maybe such a rude unfair thought never once crossed his mind maybe but plenty of american officers still had their doubts about jews in spite of hitler which was why lou said oh hell yes sir as fast as he couldbut no faster than howard frank said youd better believe it sir rrr baxter nodded smoothly he wasnt a general for nothing lou realizedhe knew how to get people to do what he wanted he sure did glad to hear it gentlemen he said well work out the details of the meeting with the russians and well go from there come on vladimir bokov snapped at shmuel get moving dammit im right here with you the jewish dp said im not going any place but where you tell me to too fucking right youre not you wouldnt last long if you did bokov said maybe there really were snipers with beads drawn on shmuels gray head or maybe bokov would have to plug him if he tried to bug out the nkvd man didnt know for sure shmuel couldnt know either together they crossed to the south side of the wittenbergplatz whoeverd set up this meeting had an evil sense of humor captain bokov suspected yuri vlasov was taking a measure of revenge for having his hand forced the sign above the tavern proclaimed that it was fents establishment and so it wasnow if you looked closely though under fents name you could still make out the smeared letters that spelled out who the former proprietor had been up until berlin fell to the red army this had been alois hitlers tavern from everything bokov had heard the fuhrers halfbrother wasnt a bad fellow with a different last name he would have been indistinguishable from a thousand other saloonkeepers bokov didnt know what had happened to him in the wake of the reichs collapse alois hitler hadnt been important enough in the grand scheme of things for anybody to worry about him shmuel didnt seem to know about the tavern bokov couldnt resist telling him just to see the look on his face it was everything the nkvd man could have hoped for the dp stopped in his tracks i wont go in there like hell you wont bokov said if ive got to youve got to a minute ago you said you werent going anywhere except where i told you to and im damn well telling you to hitlers place shmuel cried in horror hitlers place captain bokov agreed but not that hitler and it hasnt been his place for a couple of years now so get your sorry old ass in gear hitlers place the dp said again shaking his head he went inside with bokov it smelled like tobacco smoke and beer and sweat like the inside of a tavern in other words the light was dim whether the man behind the bar was fent himself or just a hireling he looked nothing like any hitler ever born that was a relief americans were sitting at two or three tables even just sitting there they irritated bokov they had so much and didnt have the faintest idea how well off they were an officer at one of the tables nodded to bokov the nkvd man walked over and sat down again shmuel followed the dp was still muttering to himself a barmaid hurried up she was pretty although on the skinny side bokov thought a lot of german women were skinny which didnt keep him from laying them when he got the urge but this gal was skinny even by german standards he preferred his women with something to hold on to he ordered beer so did shmuel the americans already had seidels in front of them the barmaid hustled away a russian wouldnt have moved so fast not at a noaccount job like that germans did apply themselves no matter what they were up to it was one of the things that made them dangerous both americans looked like jews that matched bokovs briefing the barmaid came back with two more mugs of beer bokov raised his and trotted out the phrase hed been told to use to cooperation between allies to nailing down the ironheart one of the americans returned the proper answer he went on im frank this is weissberg maybe those were real names maybe not bokov hadnt been told to hide his identity so he said bokov he jerked a thumb at the dp and this is shmuel birnbaum he would have identified a newmodel mortar the same wayhe thought of shmuel more as a weapon than as a human being but a newmodel mortar wouldnt have gulped beer as if it would be outlawed tomorrow a newmodel mortar wouldnt have waved to the barmaid for a refill or pinched her on the butt when she brought it she glared at him and got out of there in a hurry and a newmodel mortar wouldnt have said i can talk for myself we saw you before the american called weissberg exclaimed we gave you some chow and some cash you did birnbaum agreed he nodded at bokov this guy and his pal made it all disappear well i got to eat some of the chocolate suspicion sparked in bokov this was bending the arm of coincidence if not breaking it the americans were both scowling at him no doubt for abusing a fellow zhid well the hell with em as if reporting to his own superiors he said this man was shot by a guard for approaching the perimeter around our courthouse too closely the guard might have killed him had another officer and myself not intervened naturally we searched the prisoner naturally we confiscated personal property so youre releasing him now right weissberg said will you give it back not our policy bokov answered which was true enough colonel shteinberg had done whatever hed done with the tendollar bill and bokov had bought himself a fancy dinner and some fine cigars with the five and if the yankees thought birnbaum deserved to have the money they could go fuck themselves if provoked bokov was ready to tell them so weissberg looked as if he wanted to press it the other officerfranksaid something in english weissberg still looked mutinous but he shut up frank spoke directly to the dp you know where the hangmans dug in do you not for sure birnbaum said that took nerve he had to know hed be better off going with the americans than staying in soviet hands if these yanks decided they didnt want him hed never get the chance to pinch another barmaids ass he went on i was digging and digging down in the mountains then they sent me to auschwitz they hadnt got around to killing me before the red army ran em out so i lived you might be grateful bokov said for getting rescued i am for getting shot for getting robbed no offense comrade captain but i couldve done without those the dp said the american called weissberg let out a snide chuckle if you werent snooping around the perimeter nobody would have had any reason to shoot you captain bokov said irritably snooping what snooping i was just walking along when that asshole guard yelled somethinggod knows whatand then he opened up the dumb schmuck shmuel birnbaum said that was his job we were trying to protect the courthouse dammit bokov said you sure did great didnt you birnbaum jeered before bokov could tell him where to head in the yankee called frank said take it easy both of you maybe it all worked out for the best in this best of all possible worlds i dont think so shmuel birnbaum said by the way both americans winced and pulled faces the dp had made a joke vladimir bokov almost asked what it was he didnt get it only one thing held him back the fear of being thought uncultured nye kultyurny was a muscular insult in russian it meant youd just come off the farm with manure on your bootsor more likely on your bare feet it meant drool ran down your chin it meant you picked your nose and ate the boogers in public it meantit meant bokov kept his mouth shut was what it meant weissberg said well want to take him back with us you know hell do a better job going back to the mountains and showing us where he was than he would trying to draw a map or something yes i understand that bokov said i am authorized to turn him over to you i will want a receipt and well expect better cooperation in ussoviet affairs especially if he does you some good youll want us to do more of what you want you mean the jew called frank said which was true enough i cant promise but da da bokov said impatiently neither one of these guys was of a rank where his promise meant anything neither side was dealing at a level like that bokov had hoped the americans would but they werent always as naive as you wished they were a receipt shmuel said what am i a sack of beans youre a sack of hot air is what you are bokov knew him better than the americans did but theyd find out we have to hope youre not a sack full of farts the one thing we know about you is you hate the nazis too this is our chance to get some of your own back against them too little too late the dp said bleakly everybody who ever meant anything to me is deadup the fucking smokestack most i can hope for is to try and keep that shit from happening again thatsbetter than nothing weissberg sounded hesitant about saying even so much and well he might have when his country and his loved ones had come through the war with hardly a scratch here again bokov had more in common with birnbaum and more understanding of him than his fellow jew did frank had set a piece of paper on the tabletop he finished writing on it then passed it and his pen over to weissberg the other american officer read it signed it and slid it across to vladimir bokov bokov had some trouble with it he was familiar with german cursive even using german the americans wrote the roman alphabet in a different way but the nkvd man puzzled it out received from nkvd captain bokov one displaced person by name shmuel birnbaum believed to possess important information concerning the nazi resistance the two signatures followed good enough bokov said i hope this guy does youdoes usdoes everybodysome good i put my dick on the chopping block to get him to you peopleyoud better believe that both americans nodded back at him our nuts are on the line too weissberg said we kept trying to tell people our side and yours needed to work together better against the fanatics theres only one side it looks that way to me too bokov waved to the barmaid fresh ones all around sweetheart when she brought them she made a point of giving shmuel birnbaum a wide berth the dps crooked grin said he knew why and didnt give a fuck captain bokov raised his seidel death to the heydrichites they could all drink to that death to the heydrichites they chorused bokov emptied the mug at one long pull the germans were motherfuckers no doubt about it but they could sure as hell brew beer the captainnavy captain or the equivalent of an army colonellooked at tom schmidt as if he wanted to clean him off the sole of his shoe no the officer said in a voice straight from the south pole i will not authorize your entry into germany you may sail to england or france if you like but if you come under military jurisdiction in germany you will be expelled at once if you dont get tossed in the briguh the stockadeinstead thats not fair tom squawked plenty of other reporters get to go see our boys climbing onto ships a technical term applies here mr schmidt tough shit the fourstriper had the whip hand he knew it and he enjoyed it those members of the press did not violate security arrangements in germany they were not sent home from the country you did and you were and you dont get a second chance you were censoring the news tom exclaimed he sounded more pissed off than he was hed figured the military would hold a grudge for what had happened in germany but taking a shot at captain weyr here for censorship would look good in his column and weyr played straight into his hands saying sometimes censorship is necessary mr schmidt sometimes its even essential yeah sure tom said as any reporter worth his press credential would have it is dammit the navy officer insisted would you have printed a story that told the germans wed hit normandy not calais he sent tom another dogshitonmysole look you probably would have up yours captain tom said evenly captain weyrs jaw dropped his subordinates couldnt tell him stuff like that no matter how much they wanted to but military discipline didnt bind tom and if the military wanted to make a point of screwing him neither did ordinary politeness he went on you make it sound like im not a patriot or something and thats a bunch of crap of course i know why you had to keep the invasion a secret the movie of that poor damn gicunningham that was his namethats a different story you didnt want ordinary americans seeing what was going on in germanyseeing how the occupation was screwing things up for one thing i deny that the occupation is screwed up weyr said then youd better pull your head out of the sand and look around tom said the lions are getting close amusing you should be a writer weyr had a philadelphia main line kind of condescension hed probably been born with plenty of officers were snotty or arrogant but only a blueblood could bring off condescending so well he continued you seem to forget what an important factor in war morale can be bingo tom pounced you seem to forget the wars over you want everybody else to forget it too the secretary of state talked about occupying germany for the next forty years how can we do that if its peacetime how can you imagine the american people will put up with this for the next forty weeks let alone forty years he held up a hand to correct himself the presidential elections a little further than forty weeks offbut only a little i am not the secretary of state you have no business taking his words out of context and trying to put them in my mouth captain weyr said but do you think you did private cunninghams family any favors by making sure that vile film got plastered onto movie screens all over the country tom did feel bad about that even if he hadnt felt bad enough to keep from getting the film back to the states if i thought the brass was sitting on the film to save his familys feelings maybe i wouldnt have done what i did he answered but i dontand neither do you thats twice now youve put words in my mouth weyr said oh give me a break tom rolled his eyes the brass was doing what the brass always does it was trying to hide the bad news sometimes you can get away with that in wartime see i admit it but the wars over and done with harry truman said so he even acted like it rationings dead as a dodo he wants it both ways here though the wars over and done withexcept when the brass says its not the american people arent dumb enough to fall for that captain i take it back you should be a politician mr schmidt not a writer you sure seem to like making speeches weyr said but you can huff and puff as much as you want you still wont blow the pentagon down too big for that all right even flying an airplane into this place wouldnt knock down much of it tom said as if he hadnt spoken captain weyr went on and you can also huff and puff as much as you want here in my office or in your column and you wont get to germany to watch the troops coming home may i speak off the record do you respect that yes i do and yes go ahead tom wasnt happy about it but he meant it if you said something was off the record and then went ahead and used it anyway in nothing flat nobody would talk to you off the record any more and you needed to hear that kind of stuff even if you couldnt use it okay this is ollie weyr talking not captain weyr way it looks to me is guys like you are a big part of the reason congress wont pay for the german occupation any more if you werent pissing and moaning about every little thing that goes wrong over there and every big one tom broke in shut up im not done maybe germanyll be fine once we get out i dont know you cant know ahead of time but its like the president said on the radio not long ago if things go wrong if the nazis get back in i know where a bunch of the blame lands and you say i make speeches tom laughed in the navy captains face you ought to look in a mirror some time at least im working for my country weyr said so am i last time i looked the first amendment was part of what we were fighting for tom retorted too much to expect anybody from the government to understand that yeah you hot reporters go on and on about the first amendment all ive got to say is youre using it to help guys whod stamp it out first chance they got we had those sobs squashed a couple of years ago you wish you did tom interrupted in your dreams you did if they start running germany again it wont be because the military failed weyr said itll be because the press and the pressure groups made it impossible for us to do our job can i quote you on that as soon as tom asked he wished he hadnt now hed given weyr a chance to say no and weyr did or close enough that was still ollie talking not captain weyr if you want to say its a military officers personal opinion go ahead its not the navys official opinion i cant speak for the army but ive never heard anything to make me think its their official opinion either but a lot of their people believe it too tom suggested captain weyr only shrugged you said that i didnt too bad tom thought bernie cobb walked through bad tolz looking for a place where he could buy a beer the town sat in the foothills of the alps south of munich the old quarter where he was lay on one side of the isar the new district on the other side of the river was a lot more modern mineralwater springs were what brought people herepeople who werent gis with a few days leave from prowling through alpine passes anyway and there had been a training school for ss officer candidates here too that was out of business nowbernie hoped cobb called another dogfaceno the guy was a threestriper sergeant corvo bernie said jesus i figured they woulda shipped you back to the states a long time ago not me carlo corvo shook his head as usual he talked out of the side of his mouth also as usual a cigarette dangled from one corner draft sucked me in yeah but ive gone regular army i got better chances in uniform than i ever would back in hobokenbet your ass i do you nuts bernie said you got better chances of stopping a bullet or getting your balls blown off nah corvo shook his head i dont exactly come from the good part of townnot that hobokens got much of a good part i dont exactly hang around with the nice kind of people neither i shoot somebody over here i dont gotta worry about cops on my tail or spending time in the slammer mob connections bernied always wondered about that with corvo the swarthy sergeant still wasnt exactly saying so not exactly no but it sure sounded that way meanwhile corvo asked how come you aint back inwhere was it arizona new mexico bernie answered not enough points im young im single i was out of action for a while after the bulge cause of my feet so i missed out on a couple of campaign stars and besides the cocksuckers keep bumping up how many a guy needs before they ship him out a little luck though it wont be too much longer you mean the money cutoff sergeant corvo said bernie nodded what else if they bring everybody home they cant very well leave me here all by my lonesome hope like hell they cant anyway stupid fuckin assholes cant even see the ends o their pointy noses let alone past em corvo said we bail out now well just hafta fight the jerries again later on later on suits me fine bernie said maybe my number wont come up then i dont owe uncle sam one thing more and he owes me plenty carlo corvo sighed always useta think you had pretty good sense i do im not gonna catch heydrich on my own so why should i care more about the army than the army cares about me ive been away from home more than three years now enough is enough im looking out for number one bernie paused im looking for some beer too you know any decent joints by the way corvo hesitated knowing where to drink in bad tolz wasnt the question for him whether he wanted to drink with bernie was at last with another sigh the noncom nodded yeah cmonill show you if you dont wanna be no lifer cant hardly blame you for thinkin like you do i guess love you too ace bernie said he followed corvo down the narrow winding street xxvii to shmuel birnbaum krations and us army field kitchens were the greatest inventions in the history of the world he ate and ate and never once worried whether what he was eating had pork in it i quite caring about that during the war he told lou weissberg if its food you eat it what with the little you got after the nazis came through who could blame you lou said sympathetically oh the nazis sure but i meant the last war sonny one other thing the dp had made the acquaintance of was a safety razor with a limitless supply of blades his cheeks were as smooth as lous these days but the stubble hed had when lou first met him was gray heading toward white as was his hair since a wara revolutiona civil wara time to watch yourselfanother warbeen a long long time since i made a fuss about what i got as long as i got something you embarrass me because i had it easy in america lou said your folks were smartthey got out if id been smart i wouldve got out too birnbaum said but i thought its not so bad its even getting a little better maybe maybe not too for sure not the way things worked out well take you to a different valley tomorrow lou said maybe this will be the one where they made you dig maybe nothing alevai this will be the one where they made you dig lou thought the us army had been giving birnbaum a guided tour of all the alpine valleys in southern germany so far he hadnt found the right one lou hoped there was a right one you never could tell what youd get when you dealt with the russians hed wanted to for a long time now that he had would captain bokov of the nkvd sit in his berlin office and laugh his ass off because a noaccount dp was getting fat on us army chow had birnbaum ever been in one of these valleys no doubt hed been in auschwitz lou had seen too many of those tattoos to doubt that this one was authentic but that wasnt reason enoughthe army in its infinite wisdom had decided it wasnt reason enoughto be especially nice to him if he didnt come throughwell whats the worst they can do to me discharge me and ship me home to jersey which when you got right down to it would be a hell of a lot more fun than what he was doing here but he hated getting played for a sucker he didnt want the nkvd to do it and he didnt want a noaccount jew who said he hadnt had a square meal since to do it either he wantedheydrichs head on a plate he muttered i hope i can give him to you shmuel birnbaum said they didnt tell us what we were doing they just told us to dig and they got rid of anybody who didnt dig fast enough to suit em then they sent the rest of us to auschwitz also for disposal just dumb luck they didnt get around to me before the red army came sure lou said birnbaums story sounded good it felt good which might have counted for even more lou had heard a lot of bullshit since he got to the continent he didnt think this was more of the same piled higher and deeper but hed never know for sure unless the dp delivered birnbaum looked at him you dont think i can do it i hope you can do it i hope like anything you can lou said heydrich birnbaum tasted the name it wouldnt be enough theres no such thing as enough not for that but it would be something anyway and after so much nothing somethings not too bad yeah lou nodded youre right he was sure what germany would be like if heydrich and his pals took over the way it had been when hitler was running it only trying to find a place in a new tougher more suspicious world that wasabout as bad as things could get as far as he was concerned suppose they squashed the heydrichites what would germany turn into then lou had no idea that politicianadenauerhad thought it could turn into a civilized democracy like england and france and america maybe but lou had trouble believing it if germany could turn into a democracy like that wouldnt adenauer still be alive shmuel birnbaum stopped shoveling food into his face lets go he said it wasnt so simple of course one jeep could rattle along the winding roads that slid through valleys and climbed the passes between them it might get through if heydrichs goons decided it looked harmless or if they were off making pests of themselves somewhere else it would but there was no guaranteenot even close and in these parts it wasnt just heydrichs goons you needed to worry about deserters and brigands and bandits prowled the mountainside sometimes singly sometimes in platoon strength you wanted to show enough firepower to make them decide not to bother you three jeeps withcaliber machine guns two m armored cars with mm guns with luck that kind of convoy would be enough to persuade werewolves and freelance brigands to leave them alone the heavy machine guns and the cannon outranged anything the jerries were likely to pack themselves all the soldiers had garands or m carbines or grease guns too and so did shmuel birnbaum when lou first gave him the submachine gun he asked if birnbaum knew how to use it the dp gave back a lizards stare i point i pull the trigger if it doesnt shoot i fiddle with the safety till it does it doesnt even have a safety lou said all right then so i shoot what else do i need to know anything birnbaum asked for the kind of fighting hed need to doif he needed to do anyhe didnt need to know anything else lou shut up they rolled past a monument to american ineptitude a burntout ammo dump it had gone up in fire and smoke a couple of months earlier and taken half a dozen gis with it back home it probably hadnt made more than page four except in the dead mens home towns too many other things were going on in germanythis was just small change from a guerrilla war birnbaums gaze flicked to the sooty craters and scattered shell casings that marked the remains of the dump howd they do it he asked if i knew i would tell you lou answered if wed known ahead of time we might have stopped them the dp grunted they need stopping not just for this for everything youre right they do lou agreed do i hear straight are you americans really starting to go home from germany birnbaum asked you hear straight i wish you didnt but you do meshigge birnbaum said and lou smiled in spite of himself the dp spoke the same funny yiddish dialect he did himself with most of the vowels shifted forward in the mouth it still meant crazy however you pronounced it and if i dont come through the dp asked bleakly what happens then you give me a kigel most people would have pronounced that kugel it meant literally a noodle to german guards slave laborers and camp inmates it also meant a bullet in the back of the neck no we dont do that we wont give you back to the russians either lou sighed but vey iz mir i want heydrich dead if anything will show the folks back home what were doing here is worthwhile thats it me i just want heydrich dead and all the rest of those shmuel birnbaum broke off shaking his head i cant find a word bad enough pogroms purges i didnt know what trouble was till the nazis came though that campwhat i saw there he rubbed at the place where the tattooed number he would wear the rest of his life lay under his sleeve whatever his eyes were looking at it wasnt the latest alpine valley hesitantly lou said i saw dachau and belsen practice birnbaum said scornfully the shitheads did those for practice once they got it figured outfuck what do you know what can you know dont expect me to tell you like i say there are no words whats the old fart going on about sir asked the driver who couldnt have been over nineteen sounds nasty whatever it is hearing english jolted lou halfway out of helpless horror the murder camps the nazis built in poland he answered he lived through one they really did that shit they really did lou said solemnly you wouldve come over here after the surrender wouldnt you uh yes sir all i wanna do is get my ass back to dayton in one piece too right lou couldnt talk to the driver any more than birnbaum could talk to him no reason for the kid to have visited any of the camps in germany he wouldnt have seen the corpses and the shambling diseased living skeletons he wouldnt have smelled what a place like that was like and he probably wouldnt believe there were worse places how could you believe that in a world where god had anything to do with anything and if this guy had trouble believing it over here what about all the safe tens of millions across the atlantic what was reinhard heydrich to them but a name what were dachau and belsen and auschwitz and all the others but names lou shivered if the army did punch heydrichs ticket would the folks back home decide the job was really done now and figure it was one more reason to yank the boys out of there and forget the nasty mess ever happened but if killing heydrich made the fanatics give upgotta try lou muttered whats that birnbaum asked him lou realized hed used english again the dp understood yes and no and shit and fuck but not much more lou returned to yiddish maybe the nazis will quit once we get rid of their leader maybe they willbut its about as likely as snow is black birnbaum said lou snorted hed heard that one from his old man more times than he could count they passed into another valley this one wasnt the one where birnbaum had been made to dig either hell lou said with a sigh they drove on moses had wandered in the wilderness for forty years the way germany was unraveling lou wasnt sure he had forty days and forty nights that waswhat noahs flood but lou thought this one was flowing the wrong way when soldiers came home from europe right after ve day they came back to the united states in triumph pretty girls greeted them with flowers and kisses they paraded through the streets the same for the gis and marines coming back from the pacific it wasnt like that now harry truman wasnt bringing men home from germany because he wanted to he was doing it because congress was giving him no choice he was dragging his heels and grabbing at things as the new antioccupation majority forced him down this road and he and all the branches of government he could still command were doing their level best to pretend none of this was happening no press releases announced when troopships brought soldiers home from germany no welcoming committees waited for the returning troops if the war department could have disguised them with false noses and false names it would have diana mcgraw didnt think that was right or fair the way things had gone wrong in germany wasnt the soldiers fault if the american government hadnt put them in an impossible situationbut it had even if it was still too stubborn to believe as much and so she waited for a liberty ship chugging into new york harbor with her were local leaders of the movement to bring the troops home and since it was new york city with them were more reporters and cameramen than you could shake a stick at the press didnt bother her she kept looking back over her shoulder toward the buildings behind the harbor though any sniper lurking there had a clean shot all right the warm wetness of gus van slykes blood splashing her armshe shivered though the autumn day was mild enough for several years after ed came back from over there hed wake up shrieking from nightmares where he revisited what hed been through now diana understood why what exactly are you doing here today a reporter from the new york times asked her she was ever so glad to get away from her own thoughts our troops deserve a proper welcome she answered they havent done anything wrong instead of a picket sign she carried a big american flag today her colleagues had flags too the reporter eyed the tiredlooking ship which tugs were nudging into place against the pier soldiers crowded the deck they were staring at the amazing new york city skyline diana understood that even if shed looked at the buildings in a different way you thought you could stay blase about how new york looked after all youd seen it a million times in the movies right but the difference between the movies and the genuine article was about like the difference between a picture of a steak dinner and the real thing on the table in front of you after a bit the reporters gaze slid from the gis to their welcoming committee dont you think they would have liked to see people closer to their own age he asked diana looked at the people on the pier in a new way most of them like her had been born in the nineteenth century and those were definitely twentiethcentury men on the ship i suppose they would she admitted which made the man from the times blink but if we werent here they wouldnt see anybody at all that would be wrong no matter what truman thinks so here we are she wasnt quite right at the base of the pier stood a big olivedrab tent with mps flanking it a sign above the open flap said us army deprocessing center and in smaller letters just below entry required of course there would be paperwork to finish before soldiers could set foot in the united states again but the soldiers or clerks or clerksoldiers inside the tent werent what a returning gi wanted to see and hear the tugboats pulled away from a liberty ship sailors pushed through the soldiers so they could lower the gangplank the far end thudded down onto the pier the young men in olivedrab cheered and whooped welcome home diana and the rest of the welcomers shouted waving their flags welcome back still in neat army single file the soldiers tramped past them toward the deprocessing center who are you folks anyways one of them asked were the people who got you out of germany thats who diana answered proudly moses might have told the children of israel im the person who got you out of egypt in the same tone of voice and the way the returning soldiers face lit up told her she hadnt wasted her time with him much obliged maam he exclaimed and marched on several other young men thanked the welcomers too but a skinny kid with curly brown hair and a nose like the business end of a churchkey opener stopped in front of diana and said youre mrs mcgraw arent you diana smiled thats right she said not without pride well you can geh kak afen yam the kid told her she didnt know what it meant but it didnt sound like a compliment and it wasnt because the soldier went on youve gone and messed up the whole country thats what youve done we need to be in germany we need to stay there if the nazis grab it again thatll be the worst thing in the world we arent stopping the nazis diana said we sure were slowing em down the soldier said once were all gone she went on as if he hadnt spoken all we were doingare doingover there is bleeding for no reason shed had this argument dozens of times before she was ready to have it again ready she was eager and so was the returning gi its not for nothing he insisted hotly its the guy behind him who was half again his size gave him a shove and cut him off cmon izzy move it man this aint the place for politics i wanna go get my ruptured duck darn it having ladies around kept even most soldiers talking clean izzy plainly thought it was a perfect place for politics but the momentum of the crowd swept him down the pier he was bound for the deprocessing center whether he wanted to go there or not hearing what the bigger soldier called him made a light go on in dianas head oh she said i shouldve known several of the new yorkbased activists nodded wisely you cant expect those people to be reasonable a man said the new yorkers nodded again almost in unison well diana said and then a beat later most regular americans appreciate what were doing anyway i should hope so the man agreed he waved his flag more and more soldiers coming home from germany clumped by them hans klein had set the international heraldtribune right in the middle of reinhard heydrichs desk the picture on the front page was plenty to seize the reichsprotektors attention there was a long file of marching us soldiers photographed with new york citys skyscrapers in the background gis leaving occupation duty the headline read heydrich stared and stared a picture of a beautiful woman was nothing next to this he hadnt felt so splendid sincewhen since that czechs gun jammed more than five years ago now he thought wonder filling him so much had happened since so very much not all of it was what hed expected not much of it was what hed wanted and so many things had yet to happen the reich and the party would be redeemed klein came in had he been skulking in the corridor waiting for heydrich to pick up the marvelous newspaper his grin said he had how about that he said how about that heydrich echoed and his thin lips also shaped a smile like so many whipped dogs theyre running running that was the idea all along the oberscharfuhrer reminded him aber naturlich heydrich said but getting them to do it i thought we would have to keep going longer than this but the americans pulled as much as we pushed more we never came close to hurting them enough to make them go and the american government didnt shoot those people marching and squawking klein said im damned if i understand why not since heydrich didnt either he only shrugged you use your enemys weaknesses against him thats the whole idea in war thats how we beat france we made a big showy threat in holland and belgium and the french and english couldnt run fast enough to fight there then the real thrust came through the ardennes where france was weak and the wehrmacht paraded under the arc de triomphe the french wont want to get out of their zone now hans klein predicted yes i know that france had an occupation zone in germany still infuriated heydrich the usa the uk the ussrtheyd earned the right to try to hold down the reich anyhow but what had the french done ridden on other peoples coattails and damn all else the reichsprotektor pulled his thoughts back to what needed doing next now that the amis are going i dont think the tommies will stick around much longer england isnt what it used to be when america spits the english go swimming i like that klein grinned again and if we hold two zonesheydrich pursued his own train of thoughtwe have enough of the reich to do something worthwhile with not the grossdeutsches reich maybe but a deutsches reich again i like that too but hans klein hadnt finished for he asked how much will the russians like it though automatically heydrichs head swung toward the east here deep underground directions should have been meaningless for all practical purposes they were all the same heydrich might have had a compass implanted behind his eyes he knew from which direction the red army would come if it came they wont like it he admitted even so i dont think theyll invade as long as we walk soft for a while once we get in theyd better notthats all ive got to say klein replied we sure as hell cant stop em if they do heydrich grunted i know he said gruffly believe me trading the amis for the ivans is the last thing i want and wasnt that the sad and sorry truth the german freedom fighters had probably hurt the russians worse than theyd hurt the americans but the red army wasnt going away dammit the russians hunkered down in their occupation zone and fought back well herr reichsprotektor what do we do about it then klein turned heydrichs title into a sour joke what good was a reichsprotektor who couldnt protect the reich my bet is the americans wont let stalin move all the way to the rhine heydrich answered they look weak leaving germany themselves they wont be able to afford to look weak twice in a row here especially not when the reds in china are kicking the crap out of the nationalists all we have to do is make sure we look like the lesser of two evils hitler never had figured that out right up to the end hed expected the angloamericans to join him in the crusade against bolshevism but hed scared them even worse than stalin did and soheydrich led the resistance from a hidden mineshaft god only knew how many meters underground klein threw back his head and laughed like a loon sweet suffering jesus sir but thats funny we make the americans run away and then we use them to keep the russians from coming in oh my he laughed some more it is strange i know it should work though if we play our cards right or do you see it differently heydrich asked a couple of foreign ministry staffers were down here to advise him on such things hed talked with them but he also respected kleins judgment the foreign ministry people had brains and education klein thought with his gut and the plain good sense that made him win money whenever he sat down to play skat or poker you needed the whole bunch if you were going to get anywhere the oberscharfuhrer considered yeah we might bring that off if were careful the ivans are scared of the atom bomb hell so am i heydrich said as soon as were able to we get our own and we have to get to work on our rockets again too once we can blow moscow and washington off the map were back in business klein finished for him damn right we are heydrich agreed vladimir bokov neither spoke nor understood english he had no trouble at all with german though all the berlin papers those from the russian zone and the ones printed in the zones the other allies held were full of news and pictures of the american pullout he wouldnt have believed it if he werent seeing it with his own eyes even seeing he had trouble believing theyre going comrade colonel he mourned the stupid motherfuckers are really going is that why we handed them the dp we handed them the dp so general vlasov could bust our balls with it for the rest of our lives moisei shteinberg answered hell do it toohes just the type too right he is bokov was gloomily aware he was the one whod pushed hardest for working with the americans he wouldnt be the only one who remembered either everybody who wanted to get ahead of him and everybody who wanted to hold him down would throw it in his face after a while nobody would have to the whole worldthe whole world of the nkvd anyhow which was the only world that mattered to himwould know he was a fuckup both the officers who took birnbaum were jews you said if anything gives me hope that does shteinberg said theyll push things im sure they want heydrichs scalp comrade colonel but how much will they be able to do when everythings going to pieces around them bozhemoi you cant even be sure theyre still on this side of the ocean bokov said dont remind me shteinberg scowled i just wish i could know wed take care of things ourselves once the americans all disappear whats to stop us bokov demanded if the fascists grab power in the western zones of course well run them out and kill as many of them as we can they cant even slow us downwed be on the rhine in a week of course we would if we were only fighting the heydrichites moisei shteinberg said but the americans dont want us on the rhine neither do the french fuck the french fuck the americans too the first part of what bokov said came out fiercely his voice faltered when he tried the second curse colonel shteinberg gave back a sad nod you begin to see what i mean the french are nothingby themselves but the americans are a different story you can despise them but you cant ignore them they have those damned bombs and they have the big bombers that can carry them into the motherland if they say no you cant do this then we cant not till we have atom bombs of our own fuck the americans bokov said again this time as savagely as he wanted to fuck them in the ass if they walk away from their worry when its our worry too and then they dont let us clean it up yes what then what can we do about it shteinberg asked those bastards bokov whispered in lieu of admitting the soviet union couldnt do a damn thing those cocksucking bastards they have to want to see the fascists reestablish themselves if they walk out and they dont let us walk inwhat other explanation is there bokov had made a career out of looking for plots against the ussr he didnt need to look very hard to see one here do you know what the really mad thing is volodya shteinberg said everything bokov raged no the really mad thing is that every intelligence report ive seen says the american officers here in germany dont want to leave the soldiers do but who cares what soldiers think the officers are all furious they dont want to see the nazi monster come back to life neither does truman he fought against the germans in the last war bokov figured truman had basically the same powers as stalins then he should arrest the fools who are screwing up his policies do they want to fight three german wars they dont think theyll have to theyve got the bomb and theyve got those planes and they think thats all theyll ever need shteinberg answered truman should drop the bomb on them then bokov said why doesnt he put them all behind barbed wire or else two meters down in the ground americans are soft would they be walking away from germany if they werent shteinberg said not alwaysthey fought well enough before the surrender took them long enough to do it bokov said scornfully hed heard that the americans lost only dead against germany and japan combined for the red army that was a campaign not a war yes it did almost took them too longalthough the angloamerican attack on sicily and italy helped us a lot after kursk because hitler took troops away from the east to fight them shteinberg looked annoyed at himself but thats not what i was talking about theyre soft with one another too they dont have a strong secret police force and they dont clean out their troublemakers with purges theyll live to regret it bokov said and then no some of them wont live to regret it and theyll regret it while theyre dying i understood you shteinberg said bokov would have been surprised if his superior hadnt he had little use for jews but nobody could say they werent a brainy bunch that was how they got by so many of the old bolsheviks had been jewsbut however brainy they were the purges nailed almost all of them sooner or later are you sure the americans wont let us go in and clean up their mess bokov asked hoping against hope and painfully aware the ussr hadnt cleaned up its own heydrichite mess sure im not sure of anything colonel shteinberg tapped a shoulder board which showed the two colored stripes and three small stars of his rank these dont turn me into a prophet im just telling you how things look to me ill tell you something else too i hope im wrong so do i sir bokov said but shteinberg was a brainy jew maybe not a prophet but his take on the shape of things to come felt as real to bokov as if hed already read it in red star or pravda another goddamn alpine valley lou weissberg thought as the jeep chugged to the top of another goddamn alpine pass then the driver amazed him by waving at the vista ahead and saying wow thats mighty goddamn pretty yknow lou looked at it with new eyes all of a sudden it wasnt just a place he had to get into get through and get out of in one piece it wasnt a part of work he was doing it wasnt one more place much like too many other places hed visited lately and too much like too many more hed probably visit soon youre right he said and listened to the surprise in his own voice that is mighty goddamn pretty a village lay far below the steeproofed houses and the church spire looked like toys a stream ran by the village silvery as mercury in the sunlight the fields were a vibrant green the meadows above them were a different vibrant green specks of gray and brown moved slowly across the meadows not lice and fleas but sheep and cattle and maybe horses above the meadows were fir forests they too were green but another green altogether a green that knew what cold and death were and yet a green that would stay green after fields and meadows went gold and then gray and above the firs black jagged rock streaked with snow and ice and a sky as blue as a bruise on gods cheek mighty goddamn pretty lou repeated sounding even more surprised the second time he said it shmuel birnbaum stirred beside him vus the dp asked more than a little irritably he didnt speak english so he didnt know the vista was mighty goddamn pretty lou told him birnbaum looked down the valley he looked back at lou as if wondering about the size of his brainpan pretty its got germans in it right well yeah but this time lou listened to himself floundering i mean it didnt get bombed or anything true no craters marred the meadows complexions what bomber pilot in his right mind would have wasted high explosives on fusswaschendorf or whatever the village was called birnbaum delivered his own twoword verdict too bad american jews seeing what the nazis had done to their european kinsfolk were shocked and appalled and grimly determined no such catastrophe should ever befall jewry again eastern european jews or the relict of them remaining after hitlers blooddrenched tide rolled back often made their american cousins seem paragons of meekness and mercy they hadnt just seen what the nazis were up to theyd gone through it as with so many things experience made all the difference the convoy of jeeps and armored cars drove down into the valley lous heart thumped harder as the kid behind the machine gun swung the muzzle back and forth through a long arc nobodyd fired on them yet lou approved of that he wanted it to continue for oh the next six or eight million years this place look familiar he asked shmuel birnbaum shook his head nah just another fucking valley where i come from its flat never imagined there were so many mountains and valleys in the whole world let alone one corner of one shitty country uhhuh lou said the alps stretched over way more than a corner of one country giving birnbaum geography lessons struck him as a waste of time it might turn out to matter though if they had to cross into the american zone in austria hed need to try and deal with a whole new military bureaucracy the prospect did not delight his heart or even his descending colon they stopped in the village for lunch the locals stared at them as if theyd fallen from the moon some of the stares were because they wore american uniforms which likely werent much seen in these parts others were aimed more specifically at lou and birnbaum arent those a couple of one villager said to another not realizing the strangers could follow his language dont be silly his friend answered we got rid of them lous laugh came straight out of a horror movie dont believe everything you hear fool he said in german in a voice from beyond the grave a moment later he wished he hadnt thought of it like that countless jews in the grave or dead and denied even the last scrap of dignity but he scared hell out of the krauts they edged around him and shmuel birnbaum as if they were seeing ghosts he and the dp were heavily armed ghosts too mess with them and you might end up talking from the back side of beyond yourself out of the village through the valley some of the germans up on the meadows were bound to be herdsmen others were more likely bandits whether on heydrichs team or not the convoy moved fast enough and had enough weaponry to keep them from causing trouble up the next pass the jeeps climbed like mountain goats the armored cars labored but managed once past the crest they got another mighty goddamn pretty view beside lou shmuel birnbaum gasped and stiffened this one he choked out xxviii california again diana mcgraw had never gone to the west coast before poor pat got killed now shed lost track of how many times shed come out here it wasnt surprising she sometimes lost track of where she was shed get off a train or wake up in a hotel bed and think wait this is then it would come to her but she still got those weird moments of dissociation she got them more often as she traveled more in fact no danger of that here though she hadnt taken the train to san francisco shed flown in a big droning dc from st louis anyhow shed taken the train to get that far the plane didnt give her as much room as a pullman berth would have but it got where it was going much faster and the ride was surprisingly smooth except for some turbulence climbing over the rockies well be fine folks the pilot said over the intercom as the airliner bumped through air pockets i flew the hump during the war next to that this is a piece of cake people sheepishly smiled at one another diana felt embarrassed about her jitters the dc went right on flying so here she was talking to a sea of people in golden gate park about as far west as she could go if she didnt want to start swimming she could smell the pacific ocean it smelled different from the atlanticcleaner somehow she didnt think that was her imagination not when shed been in new york city not long before the breeze that blew off the ocean tugged at her hair and pulled wisps loose in spite of everything bobby pins could do this fight started two years ago now she said when we set out nobody thought we had a prayer the government was going to do whatever it was going to do listen to people who thought it was doing things wrong fat chance applause rolled up from the crowd like rising surf the sun came out from behind a cloud the day got warmer the breeze from the pacific felt friendlier it was somewhere in the sixties tonight it would be somewhere in the fifties diana knew she was in san francisco all right but she couldnt tell by the weather if it was march or may august or october or december we made harry truman listen he didnt want to but he had to she said and the crowds cheers got louder he said he knew best we showed him he didnt he said he wanted to go on wasting lives in germany we told him he couldnt he said hed do it anyway we elected a congress that wouldnt let him thats right several people in the front rows shouted the same thing at the same time diana couldnt make out all the other cries of approval but she had no doubt that was what they were she remembered the big slug of gin that kindly neighbord given her the day she got the war department telegram it had done a lot for her but the noise that meant a lot of people agreed with her about something importantno that a lot of people followed her over something importanthad a kick gin couldnt come close to it had kick enough to let her forgetpart of the timethat some people who didnt follow her had guns she got nervous whenever she thought about gus van slyke had that bullet been aimed at her and we did it we the people of the united states we did it diana didnt show her nerves she liked to quote the constitution whenever she could it made the blockheads who still called her antiamerican have a harder time our boys are coming home before too much longer well be out of germany for good no other family will have to go through what too many families have gone through already and that will be good for the whole country it sure will the cry rose up from the thousands out there on the grass but we arent finished yet diana went on weve only started that stubborn man in the white house still wants to do all the things the eightieth congress wont let him do hes started to show his cards hes going to campaign against congress next year hes going to try to bring back enough people who think like him so he can do all the foolish things he wants to folks hes going to campaign against the little people hes going to campaign against us will we let him get away with it nooo this time the crowds reply was a long wolf howl diana wished it would carry all the way to washington maybe not now come november next year it would no is right we know what we want and we know how to get it diana said after we send harry truman homeand bess and margaret and margarets pianowell go right on forming our more perfect union we can do it we will do it we are the people we are the people the crowd roared as diana stepped away from the microphone she waved to them they shouted louder than ever some of them cried out her name if shed grinned any wider the top of her head would have fallen off who needed ginwho needed anything elsewhen you could havethis i dont know whether i want to go on after that said the san francisco politico who followed her to the mike the sympathetic laugh he got was enough to let him launch into his speech he ripped into the truman administration even harder than diana had the crowd loved it policemen prowled the edge of the crowd to keep proadministration hotheads from starting trouble diana hoped theyd do more good than they had in indianapolis pickets who followed the truman line did march beyond the cops perimeter they shouted and heckled but they were a long way from the speakers platform and there werent very many of them diana marveled at that when she was first starting out opponents outnumbered and outshouted allies as often as not no more the country had swung her way she shook her head standing up there in the cool breeze off the pacific shed made the country swing her way the sun was going down toward the sea when the rally broke up diana went to dinner with some of the locals whod spoken in the park the cliff house looked out over the sea you could watch the sun set have a couple of drinks and eat fish and clams and scallops that had been doing whatever they did in the ocean only a few hours before you could also watch the sea lions and water birds on seal rocks diana didnt think shed ever seen wild seals before these beasts werent real wild they hardly moved at all a big white bird lit on one sea lions back the animal just sat there on the rock maybe it was asleep and the bird didnt wake it up can i drive you back to your hotel the politico whod come on after diana asked when dinner was done his name was marvin something she couldnt remember what she also couldnt remember if he was a city councilman or a county supervisor she wasnt sure it made any difference the city of san francisco filled all of san francisco county thanks thats nice of you she said and it was the palace hotel was way over on the other side of town near the bay san francisco was a compact city but even so marvin drove a packard diana tried not to hold it against him she was still biased in favor of general motors cars traffic had started to thin out he didnt take long to get to the hotel at the corner of new montgomery and market the palace was famous for among other things endings before the big earthquake of a king of hawaii had died there afterwards and after a rebuilding it was the place where president harding breathed his last funny diana said i wasnt anywhere near so sorry when harding passed away as i was when fdr died i dont think anybody was i know i wasnt marvin said but roosevelt was special and harding was just kinda there if you know what i mean you didnt feel like your fatherd just died thats what it was all right except roosevelt was everybodys father diana said shed had so much land on her in a few months in the presidents death which really did feel like a family members and then poor pats she wondered how shed got through it marvin found a parking space right by the hotel if that wasnt a miracle it came close he jumped out hurried around the hood and held her door open so she could get out can i buy you a drink he asked as she did im kind of tiredbut sure why not she said sometimes you needed an extra onemaybe an extra twoto come down from the excitement a good rally stirred up help me sleep tonight there you go marvin agreed after that drink diana said im getting tight because it wasnt just a drink how many had she had at the cliff house she couldnt remember which probably wasnt a good sign but marvin said bird cant fly on one wing and waved to the bartender again diana snickered it wouldnt have seemed so funny if she hadnt had a good deal already but she had so it did following that train of logicif it was a train and if it was logicseemed pretty funny too she wobbled when she got up and headed for her room somehow she wasnt surprised when marvin came with her they walked right past the house dickhe couldnt have been anything elseon the way back to the elevators he nodded and touched the brim of his fedora and didnt stir from the chair where he lounged his job was to keep outoftown businessmen from bringing hookers up to their rooms a respected local civic leader a dignitary whod led a rally he didnt think twice about letting them by diana didnt think twice about it either not till she found that marvin had walked into the room with her that turned out to be a little too late he was nuzzling her neck and nibbling her ear and then he was kissing her she could have yelled she could have clouted him maybe she would have if shed been sober and maybe she would have if ed had left her happier the last few times theyd slept together dont i deserve something better than that she thought even though she wasnt sure whether marvin was it she lay down with him to find out he surprised her well of course he didshe didnt know what he was going to do before he did it the way she had with ed the past umpteen years and he did some things ed would never have dreamt of doing diana discovered she enjoyed them and wondered why the devil ed hadnt thought of them then she stopped thinking about ed she stopped thinking at all as she discovered that enjoyed was much too mild a word in due course marvin grunted and quivered then he grinned how about that he said as he slid away he sounded indecently pleased with himself and that was exactly the right word how about that diana echoed she was delighted at what had just happenedshe was too honest with herself to have any doubts on that score but she was also angry at herself for being so delighted and which counted for moreshe was damned if she could say marvin fortunately didnt hang around afterwards why should he hed got what he wanted he quickly dressed knotted his tie with fussy precision slipped on his jacket grinned one more time as he blew her a kiss and he was gone which left diana all alone in the fading afterglow i didnt come here for this she told the hotel room it didnt say anything it wasnt that it didnt believe her it flat didnt care how many times from how many people had it heard the same thing before she jumped off the bed the stories it could have toldshe didnt want to hear them but shed have to sleep in it tonight unless she curled up on the floor and just because she hadnt come there for that didnt mean it hadnt happened now she had to try to figure out what it meant and what she was supposed to do about it vladimir bokov didnt love paperwork but he was good at it interrogation reports intelligence estimates disposition reports all the minutiae of totalitarianism in actionhow could you know what youd done to people or how many of them youd done it to unless you kept careful records someone somewhere someday would pay attention to all the paperwork he turned out it might be colonel shteinberg who had to subsume bokovs reports into his own or it might be someone back in moscow someone who would decide whether bokov rose or fell because of the documents he produced he intended to rise good paperwork and good connections were the road to higher ground in the soviet union he was detailing the lies a captured heydrichite tried to palm off as gospel truth when an explosion almost lifted him out of his chair and dropped him on the floor his first automatic response was annoyance how was he going to get anything done if people kept blowing things up around him only afterwards did he wonder what the fascist bandits had blown up this time if that wasnt a truck exploding hed never heard one maybe nkvd and red army security had made the hapless driver touch off his allwheeldrive bomb far from its intended target maybe it had happened before but it hadnt happened very often bokov had his doubts a telephone rang in an office down the hall somebody answered it listened and let fly with an impassioned stream of mat the phone slammed down hard enough to break it if not it wasnt from lack of effort a roar of pure rage followed fuck their mothersthe cunts got the red army monument bokov sprang to his feet with a foulmouthed furious shout of his own someones head would roll in the dust for that the monument had been unveiled on november to commemorate the anniversary of the october revolution a name that showed how the julian calendar had complicated life in prerevolutionary russia it was made of marble from the wreckage of the reichs chancellery and topped with a bronze of a soviet soldier with bayoneted rifle flanked by what were supposed to have been the first two red army tanks into berlin colonel shteinberg burst into bokovs office you heard the senior nkvd man asked i heard bokov agreed grimly shall we go find out just what they did to it not till were ordered to shteinberg answered theyve got that trick of using one blast to draw more people in then touching off another one why run into a trap well youre right bokov saidthe heydrichites would try that whenever they thought they could get away with it something else occurred to him would even two and a half tonnes of explosives blow up that monument beats me shteinberg said they wouldnt do it any good though he paused his face suddenly thoughtful rather than angry or resigned wait a minute didnt you write the memo about alertness last year to make sure we protected that monument i did comrade colonel bokov said nobody would be able to claim he hadnt done his part paperwork wasnt just for giving enemies of the state what they deserved if youd served the soviet union the way you should have and if you had the papers to prove it you were bulletproof but of course that was last year no one could expect a unit to stay alert for a whole year sarcasm dripped from shteinbergs voice like juice from a ripe peach after you took a bite then he paused again of course i dont know if the same unit still has the duty all the same though that memo went everywhere in the soviet zone didnt it thats what i heard sir bokov didnt have the paperwork to prove it had not at his beck and call somebody would people could find out exactly where it had gone if it was supposed to have gone everywhere and hadnt people could find out whod dropped the ball a sergeant stuck his head into bokovs office he looked relieved when he saw moisei shteinberg a telephone call for you comrade colonel im coming shteinberg hurried away he came back about ten minutes later bokov couldnt read his expression the colonel asked do you knowdid you knowa lieutenant colonel named surkov a tanks officer surkov bokov had to think before he answered wasnt he one of the men with the armored regiment in the division that guarded the monument last year i talked to him aboutabout tricks the heydrichites might try it came back to him now why sir because as soon as the monument went up he took his service pistol out of the holster stuck it in his mouth and blew off the top of his head ohdamnation bokov muttered poor surkov must have decided killing himself looked like a better bet than whatever the red army and the nkvd would do to him he might not have been wrong either remembering what hed talked about with the newly dead officer bokov said dont tell me the heydrichites used one of our tanks to get the explosives to the monument colonel shteinberg jerked in surprise then froze into catlike immobility how did you know that volodya when i only found out about it myself just now he asked his voice ominously quiet i didnt know sir but surkov and i talked about that kind of trick he knew it was a possibility or he knew a year ago but he and his men must have slacked off and stopped worrying about it when nothing happened then something didand he wouldve remembered he shouldve been on his toes and since he wasnt bokov mimed shooting himself i see yes that makes good sense colonel shteinberg lifted his cap in salute mockingly bokov was damned if he could tell shteinberg went on your deduction is fine indeed you should be sherlock bokov not vladimir bokov had read his share of sherlock holmes stories in translation many russians had unlike so many english and american authors arthur conan doyle was ideologically inoffensive all the same he said how much good does it do to know who the criminal is when you cant catch him because hes blown himself to smithereens a point the senior nkvd officer admitted but only some of a point these fascist jackals run in packs sometimes the trail of one will lead you to the next sometimes it will yes sir only sometimes it wont bokov hesitated then hurried on so that what he said came from his mouth and not shteinbergs doesnt look like the americans have done anything with that damned dp we gave them for instance shteinberg couldnt blame him for that if hed already blamed himself he hoped shteinberg couldnt anyhow the jew stayed silent so long bokov started to worry at last though shteinberg said dont lose any sleep over that one volodya if it doesnt work out then it doesnt but the world wont end if one single solitary cat happens to land by a bowl of cream would he have said the same thing had the man they let go been an antifascist german not another jew vladimir bokov had his doubts by the nature of things he had to keep them to himself and besides shteinberg added and not another word but when he puffed out his cheeks narrowed his eyes and glowered he did a remarkable impression of lieutenant general yuri vlasov maybe there was a mike hidden in bokovs office maybe not there was no cinema camera nobody but the two of them would ever know hed just wordlessly said theyd given the eviltempered general a finger in the eye and bokov couldnt prove a thing if they stole a tank they couldnt have done it with one lone man bokov said did we know where they did it yet do we know how we may i dont moisei shteinberg sighed something went wrong somewhereyou can count on that we forgot about a machine or we figured the germans couldnt make it start because we couldnt or a guard got drunk and passed out or the heydrichites knocked somebody over the head or somebody who spoke russian had forged papers or he spread his hands as if to say he could go on some of the schemes he proposed struck bokov as more likely than others but any one of them was possible why do we fuck up like this all the time bokov burst out its not as though the rest of the allies havent got bitten too the other nkvd man gave such consolation as he could and the germans lost the big war so they arent immune either what does that mean bokov answered his own question the whole human race is fucked up thats what one of shteinbergs dark eyebrows rose a few millimeters and this surprises you because joe martin nodded to jerry duncan the chair recognizes the gentleman from indiana the speaker of the house said thank you mr speaker jerry said i rise to discuss the administrations flawedno i should say failedpolicy in germany youve got no right to do that sam rayburn growled from the other side of the aisle the administration cant carry out its policy in germany because you people wont let it running away and giving the place back to the nazis is your policy not the presidents bang speaker martin brought down his gavel with obvious relish the gentleman from texas is out of order as i am sure he knows perfectly well ill tell you whats out of order rayburn said this idiotic retreat youre ramming down everybodys throat is out of order thats what bang bang that will be quite enough of that mr rayburn quite enough martin often repeated himself for emphasis diana mcgraw does the same thing jerry thought then he wondered if he did it himself without noticing the speaker of the house went on mr duncan has the floor you may continue mr duncan thank you again mr speaker jerry said its nice to have somebody on my side up there im still getting used to that a ripple of laughter ran through the not especially crowded house chamber even sam rayburn smiled gruffly while he was up on the dais he hadnt been on jerrys side and he didnt give two whoops in hell who knew it we had the wrong troops in the wrong places and they were trying to accomplish the wrong mission jerry went on other than that everything was fine with president trumans policy most republicans in the chamber applauded along with the growing number of antioccupation democrats catcalls and boos rose from the proadministration democrats and from the republicans mostly in the northeast who couldnt see their way clear to agreeing with the majority in their own party we tried everything we knew how to do did we manage to stop the german partisans or even slow them down very much we did not jerry said no ones been able to slow them down very much the way they blew up the russians monument in berlin proves that if the russians cant keep them from doing things like that nobodys going to be able to the russians are tough evil bastards they can do all the stuff we havent got the stomach to do ourselves jerry didnt come right out and put that in his speech but it lay below and behind his words by the way several congressmen nodded they heard what he wasnt sayingheard it loud and clear isnt it time we deal with what weve got instead of what we wish we had he asked let the damned nazis come out in the opennot because we love them because we know theyre there once they are out in the open they wont be able to cause nearly so much trouble tell it to frankfurt sam rayburn said how many years before itll be fit for human beings to live there again mr duncan has the floor the speaker said and used the gavel again thank you mr speaker the partisans werent out in the open when they attacked our poorly guarded compound in frankfurt jerry said when they come out of hiding well know who they are and where their strength lies and we will sit over them with our planes and our bombs and we will make sure they stay inside their own borders till one of their rockets lands on new york cityor washington rayburn said oh come off it jerry rolled his eyes i do believe the distinguished gentleman from texas has been pawing through too many of those magazines with the bugeyed monsters on the cover he got a laugh but it was a more nervous laugh than he would have liked and rayburn said the gentleman from indiana had better tell that to london and antwerp anybody who hit london yesterday will be able to hit new yorkand moscowtomorrow jerry was saved not by the bell but by the gavel the gentleman from texas is out of order as ive reminded him before joe martin said its also my opinion that his argument forgets all about where we are today martin got a much bigger much deeper laugh than jerry duncan had when the speaker of the house cracked a joke congressmen who knew what was good for them found it funny some speakers had long memories for slights of any kind sam rayburn had when he was on the rostrum in front of the house you crossed him at your professional peril joe martin seemed more easygoing than the dour texan but he might yet find he needed to toughen up one of these days now he nodded to jerry you may continue mr duncan hopefully you may continue without further interruptions from the peanut gallery he glanced in sam rayburns direction rayburn looked back unrepentant thank you mr speaker i was almost done jerry said i did want to add for the record that im proud the person who first publicly pointed out that the presidents german policy has no clothes on is from my district the whole country owes mrs diana mcgraw a vote of thanks she has a lot to answer for all right but thats not the same thing rayburn said speaker martin gaveled him into silenceabout a dozen words too late to suit jerry by now bernie cobb had seen too goddamn many german alpine valleys the most excitement hed ever got was when the blast that sealed one mineshaft touched off an underground collapse when they stuck him in the back of a truck and hauled him off on what he figured was another wildgoose chase he just shrugged most of the other soldiers under the canvas roof pissed and moaned right from the start one of them even asked him why arent you bitching like the rest of us whats the use bernie answered were going where they tell us to and well do what they say once we get there thats whats wrong the other gi said its the fuckin army this is how it works bernie said more patiently than hed expected besides would you rather be back in nuremberg or munich or somewhere like that out in the open at least youve got a chance of seeing the fanatics before they start shooting at you i dont want to be here at all the other soldier said several more men nodded the guy doing the talking went on damn war was supposed to be over almost two and a half years ago only reason were still fucking around in this miserable country is that harry trumans a goddamn jerk his friends nodded some more the sentiment had its points bernie had said things not very different himself hearing it from a punk who plainly hadnt seen germany before ve day only pissed him off though you better remember the jerries dont know you dont wanna be here he said you dont keep your eyes open theyll punch your ticket for you toot sweet or else youll be the star in one of their movies and then well find whats left of you by the side of the road so keep your eyes open and your mouth shut huh sorry general the new draftee said his friends snickered they would all have edged away from bernie except the truck was too tightly packed to make edging away possible let alone practical bernie barely had room to snake a pack of cigarettes out of his jacket pocket after he lit up one of the guys whod made it plainest that he thought bernie was an idiot tried to cadge a smoke from him bernie was tempted to tell him to shove it the other guy likely would have done that to him but hed learned you always shared in the fieldif you ran out of this or that somebody else would share with you he couldnt help saying i dont look like such a jerk now that ive got something you want huh yeah well the fellow did manage to seem faintly embarrassed he held the chesterfield out to bernie can you give me a light too jeez louise bernie said but he did after a while the truck stopped at a checkpoint an mp with a grease gun eyed the soldiers in the back with a look that said he thought they were all ss men in disguise who won the american league pennant in he demanded fiercely the browns only time theyve ever done it bernie answered before anybody else could i was already over here by then but i know that he figured the mp would shut up but the guy didnt did they win the series the snowdrop asked one of you other clownsnot him no said the soldier who didnt want to be in germany at all the cards beat em inwas it seven games six bernie said okay now the mp was satisfied you guys are americans all right you can go on what the hell are we getting into bernie asked you think they tell me whats going on the mp said the pfc driving the truck put it back in gear it rolled down into the valley wonder what they woulda done if we didnt know baseball said one of the gis in the back fucked us over and wasted a bunch of everybodys time bernie said then when it finally did get straightened out they wouldve acted like it was our fault for being such a dumb bunch of cocksuckers you dont like mps do you the soldier asked him gee howd you figure that out bernie said deadpan almost everybody back there laughed it got warmer as the truck went down into the valleynot warm but warmer bernie munched on part of a dration bar the damn thing tasted the way hed always thought a chocolateflavored candle would it was too waxy to be enjoyable but a whole bar would keep you running all day drats were supposed to have all the vitamins and stuff you needed bernie didnt know about that he did know they were the perfect antidote for prunes if you had to live on them for two or three days the memory among other things lingered for quite a while afterwards but it was what he had on him unlike these new guys he didnt feel like scrounging from people he didnt know after a while the truck stopped ritz hotel the driver shouted all ashore thats going ashore funny guya fuckin comedian bernie said he should take it on the radioand then stuff it there you go man said the kid who didnt want to be there they agreed about something anyhow one by one the gis hopped out it wasnt the ritz it was a bunch of olivedrab tents set down in the middle of the valley a barbedwire perimeter and machinegun nests protected by thick layers of sandbags protected the camp from direct assault what the fuck is all this said one of the soldiers whod got out of the truck with bernie whatever it is i dont like it it feels like a trap bernie said the other soldier gave him a funny look but he set his jaw nodded and waved to the mountains reaching up to the sky on either side fucking fanatics want to throw stuff down on us whos gonna stop em high ground counts for a lot he spoke from experience which was something the other guy probably didnt have a captain came out of a tent followed by an older guy in blackdyed fatigues without any insigniasome kind of civilian attached to the army its not a trap on account of we hold the heights the captain said by the way he talked he came from new york or new jersey or somewhere around there we hold this whole goddamn valley matter of fact and somewhere under it i hope like hell is reinhard heydrich were gonna dig the son of a bitch out how many other nazis has he got with him asked one of the other fellows just off the deuceandahalf they gonna shoot it out with us he didnt sound delighted at the prospect however many pals he has thats their tough luck weve got what we need to blast em all the captain answered he was skinny and sharpnosed a jew bernie judged so was the fellow in black fatigues unless he missed his guess no wonder the officerd stayed so gungho then bernie wasnt sure he had himself then the captain said theres a million bucks on heydrichs head remember a cool million and youll never hear from the irs think about that guys they thought about it they liked itbetter than they had before anyhow bernie looked down the valley other encampments were in place andhe started laughing whats funny the captain snapped sorry sir he said but i been here beforepatrol last year he remembered the farmhouse with the dirty pictures maybe i walked on heydrichs grave the captains grin made him look years younger yeah he said maybe you did xxix there was a graveyard up on the mountainside the americans in the valley paid it no attention why should they by the tumbled headstones and leaning crosses over the graves it had been there a long long time no one shot at the amis from the position no one down on the valley floor seemed to remember it was around all of which suited reinhard heydrich fine one of those leaning crosses was a dummy it concealed a periscope from which an observer surveyed the scene below heydrich admired the conceit hed filched it from a russian field fortification the waffenss somehow smoked out this was an improved version the observer had a field telephone he wasnt actually in a grave but in a passage that led down to the main mine if he saw trouble coming he could get away explosives in the passage would make sure nobody followed him they keep bringing in more troops and more digging equipment herr reichsprotektor he said now his voice tinny in heydrichs ear it sure looks like they know something what are we going to do heydrich didnt want to believe the amis could know where his hideout lay theyd come through here before done some superficial damage and gone on their way theyd treated this valley no differently from two dozen others in the alps they were treating it differently now dammit how heydrich wondered why had they found one of the drops where his people communicated with the outside world he couldnt believe it the drops were well sited and everybody who knew about them had the discipline to use them discreetly a traitor heydrich was sure that would have been hans kleins guess and it wasnt unlikely worse luck somebody who decided a million dollars would set him up for life could cause a lot of trouble but everyone who was supposed to be underground here was accounted for some men in jochen peipers underground center knew where this one was they would have betrayed both of them though and there was no sign peipers center was in trouble one of the outside connections then even if the worst happened here heydrich hoped the pigdog wouldnt live to enjoy his foul loot ora new thoughtcould one of the laborers whod dug most of this place out of the living rock have survived in spite of everything could he have figured out what hed been working on could he have gone to the amis with the story would they have believed somebody like that heydrich shook his head impossible he muttered the extermination camps were most efficient he knew that he damn well should have hadnt he set the einsatzgruppen in motion against the jews of eastern europe hadnt he organized the wannsee conference which got all the antisemitic forces in the reich moving on parallel tracks against the jewish enemy so no surviving laborers were anything but likely but the observer in the graveyard heard him which he hadnt intended its not impossible herr reichsprotektor i only wish it were but theyre really here the man said what will we do what can we do that was a better question than heydrich wished it were he and his men had escape routes they would have sufficed to let the germans give most bands of attackers the slip but the american net was cast wider than heydrich had ever dreamt it could be decision crystallized in the reichsprotektors mind for now we sit tight he answered they may have a good notion were here but they cant be sure finding us wont be easy neither will digging us out i sure hope youre right sir the observer said and rang off heydrich hoped he was right too the generators would run out of fuel before too longor maybe hed have to turn them off to keep their noise from betraying itself to listening devices the mines had good natural ventilation but even so heydrich tried to imagine running the war for the liberation of the reich by candleand lantern light napoleon had fought his wars that way so had clausewitz and even moltke none of them though had tried to do it from hundreds of meters underground the sun rose every day for them it never rose for heydrich when the candles and lanterns ran low klein he called yes sir the oberscharfuhrer wasnt far away heydrich hadnt thought he would be the decision that had crystallized broke up and reformed looks to me like well have to try to break out the reichsprotektor said we havesome people who wont be able to fight or to keep up you know who im talking about he waited for klein to nod then went on good i want you to see thats taken care of all right hans klein nodded again ill make sure of it too bad nicht wahr such a waste after we went to all the trouble to grab them it is isnt it heydrich sighed he wanted an atom bomb as fast as he could get one after the reich was free again germany needed that weapon why dont you leave wirtz and diebner for now we can always tend to them later if we have to the othersit is too bad but theyd better disappear right you are herr reichsprotektor klein sketched a salute and hurried away reinhard heydrich sighed once more he didnt know how or why things had gone wrong in the valley but they had not everything worked out the way you wished it would he patted his tunic he had a cyanide capsule in his breast pocket and others in other places about his person everybody down here did even if the amis caught him they wouldnt question him or make sport of him or try him he just had to bite down if himmler had done it heydrich was sure he could too there captain shmuel birnbaum pointed to what had been a mineshaft till an explosive charge closed up the front of it that one heads straight down you could do like the people in the jules verne story and go straight to the center of the earth i read that book when i was a kid lou weissberg said hed read it in english of course birnbaum would have seen it in russian or maybe yiddish or possibly even german and it was really written in french ideas bounced across the world like rubber balls the main idea in lous head now was seeing heydrich dead maybe if you chopped off the german freedom fronts head the body would flop like a chicken that met the hatchet and then fall over and die maybe alevai lou muttered to himself please god dont you owe us a little something anyway it wasnt exactly a prayermore a bitter question when the nazis efficiently went about the business of murdering jews by the million god showed hed got out of the habit of listening to prayers if god wouldnt take care of things or if god wasnt there to take care of things which lou found much too likely mere mortals would have to do their goddamnedest lou waved to the crews of the waiting bulldozers and steam shovels come and get em he yelled as if he were calling them to dinner they rumbled forward on their tracks filling the pure mountain air with the stink of diesel exhaust dozer blades and the steam shovels buckets dug into the mountainside earth and stones went into piles off to either side of the closed shaft this place wouldnt be nearly so scenic after the excavators got through maybe that bothered the germans who lived here lou was no tourist he hadnt come for the view along with the dirt and boulders the earthmoving equipment also dislodged timbers that had helped support the sides and roof of the shaft over the blat of his engine a dozer jockey shouted damn things look like theyve been here since bc you sure were in the right place captain lou wasnt sure of anything the people working under him needed to know that like they needed a hole in the head though he didnt even look back at shmuel birnbaum as he nodded this is all camouflage he declared cmonyou know the germans do shit like that hope youre right sir the dozer driver said and plunged forward again so do i lou thought if this didnt work out the way he hoped it would if he didnt come up with a big burrow full of nazis if not with the reichsprotektors head on a platter the army would be only too happy to separate him from the service and boot his butt back to new jersey chances were it would throw howard frank out too they would get exactly what eighty percent of the soldiers in germany craved most a ride home it was naturally the last thing either of them wanted if that wasnt the army way of doing things lou couldnt imagine what would be the earthmovers were tearing the living crap out of the opening to the mineshaft lou wondered if they would just peel back the whole mountainside to get at whatever it concealed wouldnt they fill the valley floor below with rocks and dirt if they did but the guys who ran the growling farting grinding machinery were more purposeful than that they stayed on the old mines trail before long the dozer blades and the steam shovels steel jaws clanged off some serious boulders here and there they had to back out so demolition crews could make big ones into well littler ones anyhow that dozer driver said big old honking landslide i bet this woulda closed the place down better than our charge of dynamite just keep going goddammit lou had the courage of his convictions of course hitler had also had the courage of his now am i right or nothing but a stubborn jackass is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock lou wondered one way or the other ill find out bulldozers and steam shovels kept banging through rocks the drivers shouted to one another lou couldnt always make out what they said that was bound to be just as well when one of them jerked a thumb in his direction and then spun an index finger in a circle next to his temple lou couldnt stay in much doubt about what the gi meant neither could shmuel birnbaum they think youre crazy the dp said so they think im crazy too yeah well fuck em all lou answered long as they do what i tell em to who gives a rats ass what they think birnbaum gave him a look lou had no trouble translating itsomething like youre the champion of democracy and in a weird way lou was but democracy and army life mixed like water and sodiumthey caught fire when they touched what did democracy give rise to in the army we want to go home and damn all else the system might stink but it worked the sun sank lower and lower toward the pass in the west shadows stretched a chilly breeze started moaning then one of the dozer drivers urgently waved to the rest that had to mean hang on his cry of amazement pierced the diesel roar fuck me up the asshole he pointed to something lou couldnt make out after scuttling like a pair of ragged claws to position himself better lou did see what had astonished him a black hole driven straight into the side of the mountain sure as shit the mine went on after the supposed cavein which meantwell theyd have to see what it meant one thing it meant was that shmuel birnbaum wasnt crazyor not on account of that anyway lou was about to send men into that hole when explosive charges went off somewhere deep inside the black opening fell in on itself a great cloud of dust and more than a few rockssome up to fistsized and beyondflew out they clattered off the olivedrab machinery one smashed a steam shovels windshield another caught a bulldozer driver in the shoulder his howl said it sure didnt do him any good but what those mine blasts saidlou put it into plain everyday english weve got the motherfuckers night black night black as the inside of an elephant cold too bernie cobb wished he had an overcoat not just his thin crappy eisenhower jacket he laughed at himself why dont you wish for a hotel room and a bottle of bourbon and a naked blonde with legs up to there if you were gonna wish you should wish it might be dark but it wasnt quiet way down the mountainside from where he crouched in the gloom army engineers tore away at the blocked mineshaft something was sure as hell going on down there bernie still thought that was funny as hell hed been there when the demolitions guy closed that hole in the first place if it turned out to be important now the krauts had done a fuck of a job of disguising it well they were good at that stuff hed seen as much since the minute he got to europe generators grunted down there powering spotlights that bathed the work scene in harsh white light bernie looked every which way but that one when he watched what was going on down there his eyes lost their dark adaptation he wondered how many of the guys scattered over the mountainside with him would think of that odds were most of em were rubbernecking for all they were worth he thought about passing the word to be careful about it only one thing stopped himthe likelihood the other gis would tell him to fuck off they knew everything there was to know about soldiering or if they didnt they didnt want to hear about it chances were it wouldnt matter if the germans were trapped down there they wouldnt be coming out then again even critters knew better than to dig a burrow with only one opening didnt jerry he could be an arrogant bastard maybe hed figured nobody would ever find his perfect hideyhole or maybemaybe the american troops whod combed this territory had missed some escape hatches that might not be so good here and there soldiers on the mountainside were smoking bernie could see the glowing coal at the end of a cigarette for a surprising distance and when somebody lit a match or flicked a zippo the yellow flare drew the eye like a magnet most of the other guys didnt believe anything bad could happen bernied been through the mill he was a confirmed pessimist he shivered and wished for an overcoat again the blonde the booze and the bed might be more fun but the coat was more practical his watchgi issuehad glowing hands those wouldnt give him awayyou couldnt see them from farther than about six inches he held the watch up to his face shit he muttered another hour and a half before somebody came to relieve him he undid his fly and relieved himself that sadly didnt get him out of being stuck here he tramped along once he tripped over a rock he never saw he flailed frantically and almost dropped his grease gun only his army boots saved him from a twisted ankle any kraut in the neighborhood could have plugged him so could any soldier allegedly on his side hed made enough noise to let them all know right where he was if any of them had been as jittery as he wasbut nobody fired at him all the americans assumed he was only a clumsy gi which he was but they shouldnt have thought that way and then on the slopes across the valley from him the balloon really did go up mortars and machine guns and rifles all opened up at the same time the incoming fire was aimed at the tiny area the spotlights lit up almost in slow motion a driver tumbled off his seat atop a bulldozer he started to clutch at himself as he fell but never finished the motionhe must have been hit as bad as anyone could be when he hit the ground he didnt move fuck bernie said the krauts were way the hell up the mountains over therehe could see where their muzzle flashes were coming from his submachine gun was as useless as a bow and arrow it didnt have a fraction of the range he needed all he could do up here was watch the fur fly the germans were out and fighting in at least company strength bernie did some more swearing they hadnt come out in those numbers since the surrender and where the devil did they come out from from up out of the ground dumbshit he answered his own question sure as hell the american patrols that came through here hadnt found anywhere near all the hidden doorways jerryd dug for himself somebody at the opening to the mineshaft had his head on straight no more than thirty seconds after the americans there started taking fire the spotlights went out plunging the whole valley into blackness the mortars and mgs would still have the range but they couldnt see what they were shooting at any more that had to make a big difference lets go help em a guy not far from bernie yelled he knew which way to run anyhow bernie was all set to go stumbling down the side of the mountain too but somebody else farther away said no sit tight with an officers snap to his voice the man went on if they popped up over there they can pop up here too that attack may be a diversion hold your ground and see what happens nextthats an order maybe it was a smart order maybe it was stupid or even cowardly no way to know till things played out the americans had more than just bulldozers and steam shovels down closer to the valley floor armored cars started shooting at the german mortar and machinegun positions a mm gun wasnt much but it was a hell of a lot better than nothing and how could the krauts hurt the armored cars unless they dropped a mortar bomb right on top of one cmon guys bernie said as if his team were trying to rally in the late innings then he found out what the krauts could do a streak of rocket fire lit up the night and slammed into one of those armored cars panzerschreck or panzerfaust bernie couldnt tell from up here it hardly mattered anyhow both weapons were designed to pierce the frontal armor on a main battle tank no wonder the armored car went up in a fireball jesus whered that asshole come from bernie said how many secret holes did the germans have he had the bad feeling his side was liable to find out lou weissberg barely noticed when the first couple of mortar bombs came in the earthmovers made so much noise the only thing that told him what was up was a graceful fountain of earth rising into the airand a sharp steel fragment whining past his ear and clanking off a trucks fender a split second later machinegun bullets cracked by him when they hit metal they sounded like pebbles banging on a tin roof when they hit flesha man tumbled from a bulldozer thumped down onto the ground and never moved again the bullet that got him in the head might have been a baseball bat smacking into a clay jug full of water lou knew he would remember that sound the rest of his days however much he tried to forget it holy shit theyre shooting at us someone yelled get down somebody else added that struck lou as some of the best advice hed ever heard he flattened out on the ground and wriggled toward the closest vehicle if he could put it between him and the deadly spray of bulletsit might not matter much since the truck wasnt armored halfway there though he had a rush of brains to the head douse the lights he sang out as loud as he could for a wonder somebody who could do something about it heard him blackness thudded down that didnt stop the machinegun bullets from snarling by or the mortar bombs from hissing in and going bam the way hed hoped it would but then what he knew about real combat would have fit in a kration can if not on the head of a pin that was or had been the advantage of cic work it was real soldiering you tried to find out what the bad guys were up to and to stop them from doing it you mostly didnt go out there to shoot and get shot yourself except now lou did he hadnt shit himself he was moderately proud of that lying there with bullets and pieces of jagged metal flying every which way all around him he didnt have much else to be proud of hey birnbaum you there he shoutedin english because he knew damn well his own side would figure yiddish was german and would try to liquidate him if he used it here the dp answered the word was as near identical as made no difference in all three languages good lou said another cognate though in the yiddish dialect he and shmuel birnbaum shared it came out more like geet birnbaum must have been through more combat than he had himselfa lot more odds were the dp knew what to do to try to stay alive his reply hadnt come from more than three inches off the ground when the american armored cars started shooting back at the germans on the mountainside lou let out a war whoop sitting bull would have been proud of shell bursts stalked the machine guns malignant muzzle flashes he whooped again when two mgs fell silent in quick succession then an armored car blew up by the light of the fireballand by the flame trail from the antitank rocket that had killed itlou spotted a kraut trying to slide back into the night he opened up with his carbine he couldnt do anything to the germans farther away this son of a bitchlou wasnt the only guy spraying lead at him the jerry went down whether he was hit or trying to avoid fire lou couldnt have said he also had no idea whether hed personally shot the german he knew he never would somebody running forward tripped over lou and fell headlong shit lou said at the same time as the other guy was going motherfuck the heartfelt profanity convinced each of them the other was a yank so neither opened up the light from the blazing car let the other guy recognize lou well you got it right captain he saidhe was the driver whod thought this whole exercise was a waste of time goddamn krauts were down there oh maybe a few lou said dryly which startled a laugh out of the driver another german let fly with panzerfaust or panzerschreck this one missed the armored car it was aimed at it blew up when it hit something else a hundred yards beyond shrieks said it hurt people too but the armored car kept blasting away at the enemy on the mountainside which counted for more how long till the cavalry gets here the driver asked that made lou think of sitting bull again it also made him cuss some more the first thing he should have donewell maybe the second after killing the lightswas to tell the radioman to scream for help dammit he wasnt a frontline officer he didnt think that way he could hope the radioman had done it on his own for that matter he could hope the radioman had stayed alive to do it but he should have made sure of it himself combat was an unforgiving place how many lives would one small mistake cost and the more immediately crowding question will one of them be mine reinhard heydrich spoke into a microphone german freedom front radio code four german freedom front radio code four german freedom front radio code four he pushed the mike away all right they know its an emergency if we get away we get away if we dont he made himself shrug peipers a solid man hell carry on hell with him hans klein said i dont plan on dying now any more than i did when those czech bastards tried to bump you off good heydrich didnt plan on dying either that might have nothing to do with the price of beer worse luck faintly echoing down the corridors and shafts from very far away gunfire said the diversionary force was punishing the americans in the short run that would make them stop excavating in the very slightly longer run it would show them they needed to tear everything in this valley to pieces the mountainsides included the move then was to take advantage of the short run and not to stick around for the very slightly longer run now to bring it off heydrich pulled a panel off the wall behind the panel was a red button heydrich pushed it lets go he said a certain amount of urgency in his voice right you are sir klein grabbed a different microphone one hooked up to the pa system achtung his voice echoed through the mine get your lanterns and torches lights going outnow logically they didnt have to do that as long as the last few hundred meters of the escape passage were dark nothing else made any difference but sometimes logic had nothing to do with anything if you were leaving forever a place that had served you well for a long time it was dead to you after that and being dead it should be seen to die the generators sighed into silence the lights went out for a split second the blackness was the deepest heydrich had ever known then good old reliable klein flicked on his torch the beam speared through the inky air when god said let there be light he must have seen a contrast as absolute as this reinhard heydrich never had not till now he turned on his own torch that was better somebody not too far away let out a horrible yell probably a poor claustrophobic bastard who thought the darkness was swallowing him whole if he didnt cut that out quick theyd have to knock him over the head and leave him here one way or another he shut up heydrich was glad he didnt have to find out how when he went out into the corridor more torch beams flashed up and down it he wondered if all the men gathering there recognized him hed left his usual uniform and ritterkreuz behind his outfit said he was a sturmmanna lancecorporal so did his papers but his voiceeveryone down here knew his voice we will use tunnel three he said crisply as some of you will know the diversion on the far side of the valley is going well the undisciplined americans will surely rush every man they have into the fight against such a large obvious enemy grouping and that will clear the escape area for us any questions no one said a word kurt diebner stared owlishly through his thick glasses he wore a sergeants uniform though no one could have made a less convincing soldier wirtz played another lancecorporal and seemed slightly better suited to the role theyd been told the other physicists were evacuated earlier maybe they believed that maybe not what they believed counted for little now some of you dont have greatcoats klein said go get em itll be cold on the mountainside diebner was one of the men who needed a coat heydrich might have known he would be a real ss noncom went with him as he got it to make sure he didnt try to disappear when we get over the mountains there will be people to take us in heydrich promised well split up well stay hidden and before too long well be with our friends again once we are well give the amis the horselaugh for nowlets move they moved the only ones who seemed uncertain of the way were the physicists the others had been down here longer than wirtz and diebner and unlike the sliderule boys the ss personnel were encouraged to explore their underground world they might have needed to try an escape far more desperate than this one heydrich thought he could have done it in absolute darkness without even a match to light the way if you knew where to run your hand shallow direction markers on the walls would guide you along he was glad he didnt have to try it though like the other escape tunnels three was carved out of the living rock it wasnt prettied up the way the main body of the command center was it didnt resemble barracks and offices heydrichs boots thunked off stone as he hurried along he led from the front he might be dressed as a sturmmann but he didnt act like one heydrich grunted in satisfaction when his torch showed the stairs ahead they led to the camouflaged mountainside doorway that would let him slide out of this trap as hed slid out of the one the amis set when he rescued the german physicists he climbed the stairs there it was the underside of the stainlesssteel escape hatch it would have dirt and grass on top of it it also had a periscope beside it if someone needed to come out here by daylight he could make sure it was safe heydrich pushed up the periscope now too but he couldnt see a goddamn thing either the diversionary partys attack had knocked out the americans lights or the amis had had the sense to turn them off themselves well it wouldnt matter kill your torches he said when the others had he undogged the escape hatch and pushed up it was heavy he felt and heard roots and shoots tearing as he shoved then the hatchway swung open cold grassscented outside air poured into the tunnel come on he said north and west once were out how will we know which way that is diebner asked plaintively i can steer by the stars if there are stars and if there arent i have a compass heydrich didnt bother hiding his scorn now up move it he might have been a drill sergeant at physical trainingexcept a drill sergeant wouldnt murder a man who couldnt keep up while heydrich intended to one by one the germans emerged heydrich looked around no moon but some stars once his eyes got used to nearly full dark again hed be fine bernie cobb sat on a boulder watching the firefight down below he wished like hell he were on his way down there to give the guys on his side a hand he could slip off in the darkness and that officer would never be the wiser how many other gis had already done just that more than a few unless he missed his guess for the moment discipline held bernie here for the moment when they asked him why he hadnt helped out what would he say i was only following orders maybe that didnt cut it bernie knew it didnt theyd already hanged plenty of deathcamp guards who tried singing that song shit he muttered and then fuck and then motherfucking son of a bitch none of which helped he stood up and took a couple of steps down the mountainside drawn by the racket of automatic weapons and bursting shells then he heard a much smaller noise behind him there werent supposed to be any noises back there it might have been another american soldier heading down toward the fight it might have been yeah but it didnt quite sound like that next thing bernie knew he was flat behind that boulder the grease gun cradled in his hands his index finger on the trigger he didnt know what was going on up there and he didnt want to find out the hard way the noise went on it got louder it sounded like somebody or something trying to push up through the grass from below unless it was the worlds biggest fucking gopher did they even have gophers over here that should have been impossible outside of a horror movie it should have been unless abruptly the noise cut off what followed was a perfectly human grunt of satisfaction and what sounded like footsteps on stone or concrete then the footsteps were on dirt instead and then somebody spoke in a low voicebut unmistakably in german even as bernie grabbed for a grenade more people came up out of well whatever the hell that place was an escape tunnel he supposed he waited hed only get one chance at this he had to do it right the first time how many of those assholes were there anyway was it the whole fucking reichstag nothe other house was over on the far slope of the valley making life miserable for the americans down below at last after what seemed like twenty minutes longer than forever he didnt hear any more footfalls on stone the krauts milled around on the grassy mountainside muttering in soft voices sorting out what to do before they do it bernie thought yeah theyre germans all right any second now though theyd go do it instead of talking about it if he was gonna get em best to do it while they were still bunched up as quietly as he could he pulled the grenades pin then he rose up onto his knees and flung it into their midst he heard a thump a startled exclamation a blam and all the screams he couldve hoped for he fired a short burst from his grease gun more screams jerries he yelled at the top of his lungs whole buncha fuckin jerries he squeezed off another burst and bellyflopped down behind the boulder again just in time too quite a few of the germans had to be hurt they all had to be discombobulated all the same some of them were pros bullets from one of their nasty assault rifles spanged off the boulder in front of bernie and snarled by overhead he slid to the left and returned fire again more to give the krauts something new to worry about than in the serious expectation of hitting them if too many gis had ignored the officers orders he was screwed the germans would flank him out and slaughter him like a fat hog on barbecue day sure as shit here came urgent running footsteps around toward the right side of the boulder hardly even looking bernie twisted and fired his magazine ran dry but not before he won himself a screech and a moan from the jerries and then fire started coming in on the krauts from both sides ms and grease guns could put a lot of lead in the air thank you jesus bernie murmuredhe did still have friends in the neighborhood after all with those friends raking the germans they had too much on their plate to care about finishing him off he stuck another magazine on his submachine gun and banged away at them again it wasnt aimed fire but it didnt have to be if you spat out enough bullets some of them were bound to bite and even the ones that didnt scared the crap out of people they just missed surrender somebody shouted in english following it with hande hoch damned if that wasnt the officer whod told everybody to sit tight hed turned out to be percent rightprobably right enough to win himself a medal bernie wasnt sure any germans were left to surrender but someone called waffenstillstand bitte waffenstillstand they wanted a truce they even said please no matter what they wanted or how polite they were bernie didnt stand up xxx when lou weissberg heard the shooting start on the mountainside above him he thought he was really and truly screwed how many troops had the nazis hidden in this stinking subterranean fortress of theirs a divisions worth that had to be impossibledidnt it but the shooting up there didnt last long as soon as it stopped he forgot about it because the diehards on the far slope were still doing their goddamnedest to murder him and then off in the distance he saw the headlights of a truck convoy coming down from the head of the pass he breathed a long heartfelt sigh of relief as soon as the reinforcements arrived his ass was saved and a great burden slid off his shoulders he might have fucked up but the radioman hadnt as long as somebodyd kept his head the story would probably have a happy ending not right away though they better kill those lights or the krautsll knock the shit out of em when they get a little closer said a gi not far from him sure as hell mortar bombs did start dropping near the oncoming trucks one of them took a direct hit caught fire and slewed off the road the other drivers suddenly got smart almost in unison their headlights went out the trucks stopped close enough to let lou hear the order the officer in charge gave his men were going up that hill and were gonna clean those assholes out then he said one more thing come on they went every so often one of them would shoot at something that let the diehards know they were on the way machinegun tracers stabbed through the night toward them other tracers repliedthe new guys had machine guns of their own and they had a mortar crew lou cheered when red sparks rose steeply into the air but the american bombs burst short of the enemy positions the germans damn them had more range because they were shooting downhill even so they could see the writing on the wall they quit pounding the men by the mineshaft a couple of mgshitlers saws the russians called the vicious german machine gunskept spraying death at the americans advancing upslope what were the fanatics not manning those machine guns doing trying to get away unless lou had lost his marbles he hardly cared jesus he said i think i lived through it he realized how much he wanted a cigarette he also realized a sniper still might ventilate his brainpan if he lit up regretfully he didnt he discovered he had a hunk of dration bar in the same pocket as his luckies gnawing on the hard chocolate wasnt the same but it was better than nothing he knew the jerries jig was up when the mgs stopped ripping the air apart maybe their crews were dead or maybe those men were trying to escape too again he had trouble caring nobody was trying to shoot him right this minute that he cared about a few spatters of gunfire went on up there on the mountainside when germans and americans got too close to one another but the main event was done part of lou wanted to sleep for a week the rest wondered whether hed ever sleep again with so much adrenaline zinging through him shaking his head he stood up and started trying to think like an officer once more do what you can for the wounded he told the men whod gone through the fight with him we should have medics here real soon nowdocs too i hope some of these guys are bleeding bad sir a gi said out of the night they dont get plasma or something pretty damn quick they aint gonna make it yeah lou said unhappily he didnt know what else to say because he couldnt do one single thing about it then he heard footsteps coming down from above dont shoot nobody someone called in accents surely american i gotta talk to the guy in charge of diggin out this mine thats me lou called whats up the yank thumped closer or was he an englishspeaking german with an explosive vest intent on vengeance dr freud would call that paranoia lou thought but youre not paranoid when theyre really after you he retorted to himself and then all that silly fluff blew out of his head because the guy said weve got heydrichs body up there somebodys one rich motherfucker heydrich lou said dazedly for sure no shit looks just like himweve all seen enough posters to know his face aint hardly tore up at all the gi answered papers on the body say hes some horseshit noncom but you know what that kinda craps gonna be worth and theres another german noncom still breathin who says its him heydrich lou said again he could hardly believe it even if it was exactly what hed been trying to accomplish take me to him this i gotta see he stumped uphill after the soldier he stumbled in the darkness a couple of times but he didnt fall before long he was breathing hard a desk job with the cic didnt keep him in great shape but he would have walked up the side of mt everest on his hands to see reinhard heydrich dead no more shooting on this slope up ahead a couple of flashlight beams marked the place where the gi was taking him he saw american soldiers and guys in feldgrau milling around all the germans kept hands above head here comes the captain his escort called so nobody would get jumpy he wants to see the body lots of german corpses in uniform lay in a compact knot with others out around the fringes looks like a bunch of em got taken by surprise lou remarked yes sir the soldier agreed they came out right behind one of our guys he chucked a grenade into em and then he started shooting em up good for him lou said the air stank of blood and shit and smokeless powder one of the gis shone a flashlight at him he waved the beam swerved away he was judged all right he raised his voice a little show me heydrich over here sir another man called he had a flashlight too and pointed it at a pale still face on the ground this bastard lou bent down the dead mans pale narrow eyes were still open but he wasnt seeing anything the face was long and thin so was the nose which had a slight kink in it son of a gun lou whispered i think it really is him he undid the corpses tunic whoever this guy was hed taken grenade fragments and bullets in the chest and belly shine it under his arm lou told the gi with the light i want to check his blood group he had to wipe away blood before he could make out the tattoo it was an ajust what he wanted to see well the soldier asked yeah lou felt as if hed swallowed a big slug of straight bourbon it matches he paused remembering the guy who brought me up here said youd captured another jerry in noncoms clothes who could id him thats right sir the other american turned away for a moment hey manny bring that cocksucker over here the captain wants him sure said somebodypresumably manny he spoke a couple of words of rudimentary german du komm unlike heydrich the man who came over to lou blinked when the gi shone a flashlight in his eyes he looked like a guy whod been a noncom for a long timeput a different uniform on him and he would have made a perfect american tech sergeant who are you lou asked he pointed to the dead man how do you know this is heydrich i am oberscharfuhrer johannes klein the noncom answered i was the reichsprotektors driver and then his aide when we went underground wow lou said kleins name was on his list tooon all kinds of cic lists nobody seemed to know what he looked like well here he was in the flesh quite a bit of flesh too whatever the diehards had been doing underground they hadnt been starving lou dragged his attention back to the business at hand so what happened here what went wrong for you he made a mistake klein answered matteroffactly he sounded like an american noncom giving an officer the back of his hand too he thought the diversionary attack would pull your men off this side of the mountain he turned out to be wrong we had just come out when he spread his hands one of them had blood on it but it wasnt his another german came over he stared down at heydrichs body for a long time so he is truly dead he muttered more to himself than to lou what difference does it make to you who are you anyway lou asked him auf deutsch i am karl wirtz the man answered in fluent british english for a second the name didnt mean anything to lou then it did the physicist he exclaimed wirtz nodded lou tried to ask something that wasnt too dumb the best he could come up with was where are your uh colleagues poor professor diebner lies over there sadly he is dead wirtz said the othersi do not know what has happened to the others he nodded toward klein but i believe the oberscharfuhrer may how about it lou said johannes klein only shrugged wirtzs grimace told what he thought of that lou thought the same thing soyou disposed of them did you klein shrugged again at the reichsprotektors order they could never have kept up during the escape his shoulders went up and down one more time fat lot of good it turned out to do do you always kill people on your own side lou didnt ask it however much he wanted to he was too sure klein would look at him and say something like of course i do if my superior tells me to hed already been down that road with too many other germans so he stuck to what might be immediately useful where were you going to go after you came out of your tunnel we were to split up and head for safe houses in the next valley klein said the only one i know of is the one i was to go to and then he stopped then what come ontalk lou said he didnt believe klein knew about only one safe house either if he was heydrichs aide wouldnt he have found out about plenty of them well you will have heard this by now im sure the oberscharfuhrer seemed to be talking himself into talking so to speak after a moment he went on sooner or later jochen peipers people would pick us up and take us to his headquarters ah lous ears quivered and came to attention and wheres that i have no idea i never tried to find out i suppose the reichsprotektor must have known but i dont think anyone else down belowklein stamped his foot on the mountainsidehad any idea what we werent told we couldnt give away if we got caught huh lou said well see about that the kraut gave a much more elaborate denial here than he had about the safe houses maybe that meant he was bullshitting on the other hand maybe it meant he was telling the exact truth some remorseless squeezing of everybody left alive whod come up out of the ground would tell the tale lou tried another question what do you know about peiper only that the reichsprotektor thought he was an able man klein said lou grunted he didnt know as much about jochen peiper as he wished he did nobody outside the fanatics shadowy network did peiper had been a promising and rapidly rising young panzer officer in the waffenss till he dropped out of sight late in since ve day heydrich had been the german freedom fronts visible face could peiper step out of the shadows and keep the enemy fighting lou hoped like hell the answer was no the ground under his feet rumbled and jerked what was that professor wirtz yipped explosives and incendiaries klein said calmly the reichsprotektor started the timer before we left no one will learn anything from what we could not bring even now he sounded proud of heydrich aw shit lou said wearily germanic thoroughness could drive you nuts it could also screw you to the wall not wanting to think about that he switched to english and asked wheres the guy who jumped on the jerries after they came out of their hole in the ground ats me the dogface who came up looked likea dogface names bernie cobb watcha need sir well cobb theres a jewish dp down by the mineshaftlou hoped like anything that birnbaum was still in one piecewhos got a pretty fair claim to part of the reward for heydrich id say youre oddson for the rest holy fuck cobb started to laugh wasnt so long ago i told a buddy id never catch the asshole on my own shows what i know dont it sure does lou sad but you were on the ball and it paid off when the shooting started we wanted to go down and give you guys a hand cobb said but one of our officers held us in position thats why i was at where i was at he oughta get a chunk maybe he will lou said cobb pointed at him and what about you captain werent you the guy in charge of digging these fuckers out thats who jonesy went to get sounds like you have a claim on some yourself me lous voice hadnt broken like this since he was seventeen you gotta be kidding theyre gonna give it to somebody bernie cobb said if you flushed out dickhead herehe nodded toward heydrichs corpseyou deserve a chunk do i want any lou wondered how many jews how many americans did that son of a bitch murder can i take money because of a man like that but can i turn down a big part of a million bucks wouldnt my wife murder me if i did wouldnt any jury in the world acquit her if she did fuck it well sort it out later he said dawn was starting to lighten the eastern sky a new day was coming tom schmidt hadnt seen president truman so chipper sincewhen he couldnt remember ever seeing truman so chipper the president beamed at the reporters filing into the white house press room we killed the blackhearted son of a bitch truman announced without preamble reinhard heydrich who earned the lovely nicknames of butcher hangman and man with the iron heart got what he deserved in the bavarian alps last night the head of the lie called the german freedom front died trying to escape his underground headquarters as american troops were digging him out most of the other people in that hole in the groundmaybe all of themwere also captured or killed he grinned out at the assembled reporters how about that boys they all tried to shout questions at once who got him seemed to be the one that came most often truman glanced down at his notes the man who seems likeliest to have done it is private bernard cobb he comes from new mexico a little town near albuquerque are they sure its heydrich tom asked before anybody else could get in a different question how do they know its really him tom no matter how much that disappoints you and the tribune the president jabbed and his grin got even wider an officer who knows what he looks like identified him at the scene german prisoners confirmed his identity his bloodgroup tattoo matches heydrichs grouphis blood type wed say here and his fingerprints match too the nazis could pull a lot of stunts but i dont see how they could manage that tom didnt see how they could either no matter what harry truman thought he wasnt sorry heydrich was dead anybody whod spent any time at all in postsurrender germany knew reinhard heydrich was indeed a blackhearted son of a bitch whether he was sorry the truman administration was taking credit for heydrichs longoverdue demise might be a different story howd we finally catch him another reporter asked truman beamed at him because the bastards own past came back to bite him thats how the nazis used slave laborers to dig their hideouts then they killed themdead men tell no tales but this man lived through auschwitz eventually soviet intelligence learned he had important information the russians passed him on to us because heydrichs hole was in our zone we found it and heydrich was in it and now we dont have to worry about him any more we worked with the russians the reporters yelledexcept for the ones who yelled the russians worked with us thats right truman nodded happily we sure did they sure did when it comes to the damn nazis everybody works together against them everybody in the whole world near as i can see except the republicans in congress and some chuckleheads whove started a silly movement that means well but cant see whats important in the long runoh and some reporters who want us to fail in germany because they think writing snotty stories sells papers to tom and at least half a dozen other people in the press room that was waving a red flag in front of a bull well we got him even though were bringing our troops home right another reporter said we didnt catch him because were bringing them home we caught him in spite of that the president snapped if wed learned of this a few months from now we wouldnt have had the manpower to do anything about it heydrich would still be down there thumbing his nose at us now that hes dead you expect the german freedom front to fold up and die with him right somebody else called before tom could we hope it will all of a sudden truman turned cagey we dont know that for a fact we ought to leave men in germany in case it doesnt wait a minute tom said a minute ago getting rid of heydrich was the greatest thing ever now it may not mean anything dont you want it both ways i want to make sure americans can stay safe and secure why do you have trouble seeing that truman said because lots of americans keep getting killed in germany because the german freedom front hasnt gone away tom suggested how does that make us safe and secure the president let out an exasperated sniff because we arent getting ready to fight the third world war against the germans thats how shall we declare victory and then pull out i couldnt look the american people in the eye if we pulled a stunt like that but if the fanatics quiet down now that heydrichs dead doesnt that mean we dont need to stay any more not if theyre playing possum till were gone truman answered they arent fools unlike some people i could name he stared hard in toms direction love you too sir tom said and got a chuckle from truman heydrichs goneso what tom scribbled in his notebook if he couldnt build a column around that he wasnt half trying fuck me in the mouth they got him vladimir bokov exulted they did colonel shteinberg agreed i wouldnt have bet on it when you gave them that birnbaum but they did now we find out how much difference it ends up making its got to make some bokov said we havent been the same here since the nazis poisoned so many officers at the new years eve celebration only stands to reason that losing their top leader will hurt them too well yes when you put it like that theyre bound to be less efficient for a whilemaybe less dangerous too shteinberg paused to light a cigarette before adding but thats not the point comrade colonel bokov said in lieu of well what is the point dammit he knew how much rope the jew gave him and the answer here was not enough for that moisei shteinberg inhaled blew out smoke inhaled again and finally said after the heydrichites pulled off the new years eve massacre what did we do we went after them what else bokov knew hed never forget the benzedrine buzzor the grippe it battled he also knew hed never forget how flattened hed been getting over both of them at once there you go volodya if shteinbergs nod said bokov was slower than he might have been it also said hed got where he needed to go shteinberg continued thats the point we didnt give up we didnt figure wed lost and run away like a litter of scared puppies the way the americans are now bokov put in yes but colonel shteinberg brushed that aside so now we have to see what the heydrichites do without heydrich if they say we cant go on without the reichsprotektor and they forget about their weapons and go back to being farmers and shopkeepers and factory workers weve won but if they have the spirit to keep fighting under a new commanderin that case we didnt do as much as we would have wanted to reluctantly bokov nodded back well youre right comrade colonel he allowed part of his reluctance involved admitting to himself that shteinberg really was a clever jewmore clever than he was himself dammit and part involved acknowledging that the fascist bandits really might regroup and keep harassing soviet authoritiesand incidentally the angloamericans bozhemoi but i want them to fold up like a concertina oh so do i volodya if i prayed thats what i would pray for colonel shteinberg blew out a long stream of smoke and ground out the cigarette but were men now yes not children i mean you dont get what you wish for and youd better remember it you get what you get and you have to make the best of it whatever it turns out to be thats what a man does am i right or am i wrong bokov couldnt very well say he was wrong it might be a coldbloodedno a coldheartedway to look at the world but if you looked at it any other way youd end up dead or in a camp in short order what bokov did say was lets see general vlasov make the best of this oh he will shteinberg said but the way he smiled said how little he loved yuri vlasov himself bokov doubted whether vlasovs mother could have loved him if she had wouldnt the son of a bitch have come out better colonel shteinberg said hell show his superiors that he authorized the transfer of prisoner birnbaum to the americans and that it turned out well he doesnt need any more than that to cover his own worthless ass da bokov said resignedly theyd both known from the beginning that vlasov would do something like that if handing birnbaum over gave good results bokovs anger flared anyhow he should have done it sooner the pigheaded son of a bitch of course he should but saying no is always easier so is doing nothing if you do nothing you cant very well do anything wrong all you have to say is you were exercising due caution shteinberg made the wordswhich bokov himself had used more often than he suddenly cared to remembersound faintly or perhaps not so faintly obscene bokov lit a cigarette of his owna good russian belomor not an american brand he needed it the white sea tasted the way a cigarette ought to you took a drag on one of these you knew you were smoking something the name of the brand commemorated the opening of the white sea canal before the war most soviet citizens knew it had opened and were proud of that they knew no more bokov did but not even the nkvd captain knew how many tens of thousands of zeks had given up the ghost digging the canal with picks and shovels in weather that made leningrads look tropical well none of them would trouble the states security again which led to another security question comrade colonel what do we do when the americans finish clearing out the english wont be far behind them either that damned atom bomb moisei shteinberg said as he had the last time bokov asked the same question it was more urgent less hypothetical than it had been then but that damned atom bomb remained a complete and depressing answer till the soviet union had its ownwhich would of course be used only in the cause of peacemarshal stalins hands were tied how long bokov demanded as if security would let an ordinary nkvd colonel learn such things and naturally shteinberg just shrugged when we dothats all i can tell you no wait he caught himself theres one thing more heydrich was hiding the german physicists he kidnapped in his headquarters theyre all supposed to be dead or captured so that will slow the fanatics down even if worse comes to worst he shrugged again this time in a very jewish way as if to say its not so good but maybe it could be worse bokov knew what if worse comes to worst meant too it meant a revived fascist state in western germany and damn all the ussr could do about it that was about as bad as things could get all right lets hope they do give up now that heydrichs dead and gone he said yes shteinberg said lets jochen peiper hadnt wanted to go down into a hole in the ground and pull it in after him that was putting it mildly the waffenss hadnt had many better panzer officers hed scared the shit out of the ivans and well he might have the last thing hed looked for was a peremptory order from reinhard heydrich hed taken his careermaybe his lifein his hands and gone over heydrichs head to heinrich himmler all that got him was an even more peremptory order to shut up and do what heydrich told him to so he did as the reich crumbled into ruin he slowly realized he was doing something worthwhile even if it wasnt what hed had in mind when he signed up for the ss if germany was going to rebuild itself if it wasnt going to get slammed into an american or russian mold it had to hold on to its own spirit and do its best to drive the occupiers nuts fighting the long underground war was less exciting than a panzer battle it turned out to be more intricate more exacting was it more interesting peiper didnt want to admit that even to himself he did what he could to help the cause of german liberty he did what the reichsprotektor told him to do he quit complaining no one would have listened to him any which way he didnt even complain about being a spare tire like any good commander heydrich had run the resistance movement his own way as there had been only one fuhrer before him there was only one reichsprotektor and now im it peiper thought the radio the newspapers and the magazines in americanoccupied germany were full of gloating glee because heydrich had fallen in service of the cause hed been photographed dead more often than he ever was alive the german freedom fronts front man is no more a typical headline proclaimed proudly jochen peiper assembled the men who shared the underground secondary headquarters with him were fighting a war and when you fight a war you go on even if you lose your general he said the man whos next in line steps up and you go on the reichsprotektor was a great german well miss him he gave us hope for freedom even in the blackest days he inspired the werewolves to remind the enemy germany wasnt altogether beaten the best way to honor his memory is to go on and free our country from the invaders yoke he eyed them a few of the fighters didnt want to meet his gaze they fearedor else they hoped which would be worsethe struggle had died with the reichsprotektor but most of the ss men and soldiers seemed ready to keep on soldiering that was what peiper most wanted to see he had to hope he wasnt seeing it regardless of whether it was there or not we can do this we can dammit he insisted weve already got the americans on the run we have to show them they havent cut the heart out of us reinhard heydrich was a great man a great german a great national socialist no one would say anything different but when great men fall the ones they leave behind have to keep up the battle and the reichsprotektor had some ideas he didnt live to use well see how wild they can drive the enemy what kind of ideas a man inquired well for instance peiper talked for some little while he could have kissed the noncom whod asked the question if the troops were interested in what to try next they wouldnt brood because theyd lost their longtime commander or peiper could hope they wouldnt anyhow but then another man asked can the americans sniff us out now after a moments hesitation peiper answered anything that can happen can happen to you heinz they were supposed to use up all the workers who dug out the reichsprotektors headquarters but it sounds like somebody got through in spite of everything thats just bad luck i dont think its likely that that kind of thing could crop up here too but its possible unlike heydrich hed had no direct role in eliminating untermenschen hed been a combat soldier before his superiors tapped him for this slot but he wasnt naive about what the reich had been up to he talked about it in the same allusive elusive oddly dispassionate way someone whod served in an extermination camp might have if you talked about it that way you didnt dwell on what you were actually doing workers got used up not killed the survivor got through he didnt live jochen wished to god the bastard hadnt lived heinz had another awkward question what will we do without the physicists the reichsprotektor liberated the best we can peiper spread his hands i dont know what else to tell you well be able to find other scientists who know some of what they knew and well find more people who can learn were germans other people would come here to study before the war there are bound to be men who can do what we need remember we know its possible now and we didnt during the war heinz nodded apparently satisfied peiper wasnt satisfied himselfnot even close he knew too well that losing those physicists meant germany would take longer to build atom bombs and he knew the resurgent reich would need those bombs to keep it safe from the americans and the russians but as hed told the junior officer all you could do was all you could do he wasnt even sure the fighters outside this headquarters would obey his orders he had to nail that down first if they wouldnt follow him the amis and tommies and ivans had won after all after keeping up the fight for so long despite the surrender of wehrmacht and government giving up now would be tragic he went back to his office to draft a proclamation the struggle continues he wrote the hope for national socialism the hope for a revived german folkish state does not lie in any one man a man may fall adolf hitler did now reinhard heydrich has as well but the cause goes on the cause will always go on because it is right and just we shall not rest until we free our fatherland sieg heil he looked it over then nodded to himself yes it would definitely do he signed his name after another moments hesitation he added reichsprotektor below the signature even though heydrich had originally had the title because he governed the protectorate of bohemia and moravia it also suited a partisan leader trying to shield germany from the foes who oppressed her the headquarters had a small print shop with a hand press not much different from the ones martin luthers printers would have used that would be plenty to get out a few hundred copies of the proclamation sympathetic printers in the us and british zones could make thousands more once it reached them word would spread which raised another question peiper wondered whether his fighters ought to stay quiet for a while it might lull the enemy into a false sense of security it would let peiper consolidate his own authority within the german freedom front everybodyd known and known ofand fearedheydrich by the nature of things the number two man in any outfit was far more anonymous peiper drummed his fingers on the desk nein he muttered heydrich hadnt made the americans start bailing out of their zone by acting meek and mild hed harried them so harshly that they were glad to go the best way to keep them on the run was to keep goosing them and the russians no russian ever born had ever admired meekness and mildness the only way to get ivans attention was to hit him in the face and to keep on hitting him till he had to notice you peiper had fought the red army out in the open till he was recruited for the twilight struggle running it out of the soviet zone wouldnt be easy he knew that but not fighting against the russians meant giving up hed found his answers he knew what kind of orders to give whether anyone would listen to themhe shook his head and said nein again louder this time some people would always follow a superiors commands he could use them to eliminate the fainthearts no to eliminate a few of them that should scare the rest back into obedience fear was as much a weapon as an assault rifle it all seemed simple and straightforward peiper laughed at himself if everything were as simple and straightforward as it seemed the reich would never have got itself into this mess well the job of getting it out had landed on his shoulders hed do his damnedest xxxi when the phone rang it was the mothers against the madness in germany line it usually was these days diana mcgraw diana said in her crisp public voice hi mrs mcgraw e a stuart here from the times the reporter replied in her ear hello ea how are you diana said only the indianapolis times not the one from los angeles let alone new yorks well she lived next door to indianapolis and other papers would pick up whatever she said to stuart shed got used to having people all over the world pay attention to what she thought she liked it in fact im fine thanks yourself unlike reporters from far away ea knew her well enough to chitchat for a bit before he got down to business he might have thought it would soften her up and he might have been right doing all right diana wasnt lyingtoo much her conscience still gnawed at her for that san francisco night she did feel bad about itand she felt worse because shed felt so good while it was going on i was drunk she told herself i didnt know what i was doing the first part of that was true the rest shed known what she was doing all right and shed gone and done it and shed enjoyed it like anythingthen afterwards was a different story afterwards commonly was she ducked away from the worries what can i do for you this morning well i was wondering if you wanted to comment on the death of reinhard heydrich im glad the miserable skunk is dead diana said at once so many people have called me a nazi and its a filthy lie you know its a lie ea the maniacs that evil soandso led murdered my pat if wed caught him alive idve been glad to string him up myself to hang the hangman stuart asked diana nodded which the reporter couldnt see thats right she said thats just right okay by the pause e a stuart was likely nodding too how do you think his death changes the situation in germany since dianad been thinking about that ever since the news broke she could answer without the least hesitation it just gives us one more reason to keep bringing our troops back to america weve been saying all along that we wanted him dead that we needed him dead that he was the most dangerous man in the world and i dont know what all else fine now hes dead now the fanatics cant cause anywhere near as much trouble as they could before that means weve got even less excuse for sticking around the sooner all the soldiers come home the better hang on stuart said she could hear him scribbling notes even though he took shorthand shed got ahead of him then he asked what would have happened if all the american soldiers were out of germany before we found out where heydrich was hiding out diana scowled at the telephone doggone it ea youre supposed to be on my side but she didnt say it out loud he would have to deny it and he might have to go out of his way to show it wasnt true that wouldnt be so good maybe we would have gone back after him ive never said we shouldnt get rid of him she answered or maybe the german police could have dug him out on their own mm maybe stuart didnt sound as if he believed it he tried a different kind of question how do you feel about president truman taking credit for bumping him off if wed caught heydrich right after ve day he wouldve been entitled to some diana said tartly now were only a couple of months away from its not just about time heydrichs deadits way past time hang on e a stuart said once more and then okeydoke got it thanks a lot mrs mcgraw bye he hung up so long diana set the phone down too she heated up the coffee took the pot off the stove and poured herself a cup it wasnt as good as it had been when she made it right after she and ed got up but it wasnt too much like battery acid yet and she was too lazy to fix a fresh pot battery acid she shook her head would the comparison even have occurred to her if ed hadnt worked at the delcoremy plant since the year one how many car and truck batteries did they turn out there every year zillionsthat was all she knew the phone rang again this time it was a reporter from the st louis postdispatch he wanted to find out what she thought of heydrichs untimely demise too she was still all for it he asked almost the same questions as e a stuart had later on she got a call from the boston globe and one from the los angeles mirrornews do you feel like youve got revenge for your son now the reporter from the mirrornews asked that was a moreinteresting question than she usually got i dont know she said slowly when its your own flesh and bloodno its not revenge or not enough revenge i dont think there can be enough revenge for your own child im still glad heydrichs dead though you and everybody else well thanks the reporter didnt even say goodbye he just went off to write up his piece in between phone calls life went on diana sliced potatoes and carrots and chopped onions and put them into a pan with a pot roast if a few tears fell she could blame them on the onions supper went into the oven ed got home about twenty to six the way he always did he took a burgie out of the icebox drank it faster than he was in the habit of doing and then opened another one you all right diana asked you dont do that very often ever since she got back from san francisco shed watched him more closely than usual he let out a wordless grunt and got to work on the second beer that alarmed her everything alarmed her these daysa sure sign of her guilty conscience that same guilty conscience had made her extra accommodating in the bedroom since coming home if only it had made her take more pleasure in what went on there doggedly she tried again everything all right at the plant fine ed said he poured down the burgermeister he opened another one to go with supper youll get snockered diana warned she remembered too well what had happened when she got snockered ed just shrugged he killed the beer and killed one more while she was doing the dishes that seemed to get him where he needed to go while she dried the last fork and put away the dish towel he sat there waiting its a mess isnt it he said sounding sad and resigned at the same time what is her voice by contrast was a thin nervous squeak us he said and then as if that werent comprehensive enough everything what were fine i love you the lady doth protest too much methinks diana hadnt read any shakespeare since high school why did that particular line have to come back to her right now why because she was protesting too goddamn muchwhy else yeah well ed turned toward the icebox as if to get one more burgie but he didnt his smile was sad too sad and sweet at the same time youve got your head turned babe it took a while but you do what are you talking about diana wouldnt have sounded so scared if she hadnt known precisely what he was talking about he spelled it out for her anyhow you go here you go there you go all over the darn place reporters call you all the time how many calls you get today on account of heydrichs kicked the bucket four automatically she answered with the truth uhhuh ed nodded and you hang around with big shots when you go traveling congressmen and mayors and lord knows who all and they figure youre a big shot too cause youve got all this clout you made for yourself and thats great and i bet they hit on you tooyoure a darn goodlookin gal i oughta know huh and then you come home im glad to come home diana said and she always had been till this last trip ed went on as if she hadnt spoken you come home and waddaya got me foreman at delcoremy aint gonna be anything more than foreman at delcoremy if i get as old as methuselah and it isnt enough any more i can tell how she whispered did she have a scarlet a on her chest did she remember highschool lit classes better than shed ever thought she could she sure did but why for gods sake how her husband snorted ive known you for thirty years thats how im not smart like a big shot but im not blind either diana started to cry i didnt want this to happen i didnt want any of this to happennot any of it if pat was alive she cried harder ed hadnt really guessed she hadnt really admitted anything either but how much difference did that make hed nailed everything else down tight hadnt he just what are we going to do she wailed his shoulder went up and down in a tried shrug i dunno babe what are we gonna do when it came to american foreign policy she found answers with the greatest of ease and she was always sure they were right here here she had no answers at all she started crying again hes dead good riddance to him jerry duncan said on the house floor and now god willing the fanatics in germany will see that their cause is hopeless and i note this is all happening even though our troops are coming home from europe the world hasnt fallen to pieces and it wont fall to pieces in spite of the doomsayers croakings in this very house congressmen who agreed with him clapped and cheered congressmen who didnt were much less polite boos catcalls shaken fistsjerry didnt seen any upraised middle fingers this time which was progress of a sort he did hear several insistent shouts mr speaker mr speaker mr speaker joe martin pointed the chair recognizes the representative from california thank you mr speaker helen gahagan douglas said maybe martin had recognized her because her voice stood out among those of the democrats clamoring for his notice and well it mightnot only was she a woman but shed also sung opera so she had impressive volume when she needed it or maybe hed thought she would be milder than most of her colleagues if he had he was unduly optimistic now that the wartime consensus lay dead nobody saw much point to mildness any more and congresswoman douglas proved as much saying many years ago chancellor bismarck remarked that god loved children drunkards and the united states of america the way things are these days i hesitate to speak well of any german but it seems to me that bismarck knew what he was talking about the distinguished gentleman from indiana wouldnt be celebrating reinhard heydrichs death today if hed got his own hearts desire a few months earlier if we didnt have any men on the ground to dig him out once we learned where he hid hed still be down there sneering at us people on her side applauded people on jerrys side were at least as rude to helen gahagan douglas as people who agreed with her had been to him the first thing that ran through his mind was well fuck you bitch he didnt say it consensus might have expired but civility though hospitalized still breathed and she wasnt a bitch and jerry knew it perfectly well when he wasnt pissed off himself she was a highly capable congresswoman who disagreed with him on the presidents german policy the way things went these days the distinction seemed ever more academic mr speaker jerry said you have the floor mr duncan joe martin replied thanks mr speaker how many of our young men did the fanatics murder and torture while we lingered in germany because president truman couldnt see we didnt belong there are they a fair trade for heydrich jerry asked attacking the president was easier and more likely to be profitable than swinging directly at helen gahagan douglas she didnt mind swinging right at him if someone makes a habit of murdering and torturing our young menand thats what the nazis do no doubt about itisnt it better to make sure he cant do it any more than to run away from him she demanded i would say yes except the army has made it much too plain they cant do that either jerry answered how do you expect it to when youve been doing everything you could to hamstring it since ve day helen gahagan douglas said youve been blaming the administration for chiang kaisheks losses in china but when the administration tries to blame this congress for our losses in germany you dont think thats fair it isnt fair jerry snapped our losses in germany started long before republicans gained the majority we gained it not least because of american losses in germany and those losses started almost before the ink dried on the socalled surrender the army in germany had full wartime appropriations in as i am sure the distinguished representative from california recalls his tone declared he was sure of no such thing even with those full appropriations even with that flood of manpower the us army had no better luck against partisan warfare than the wehrmacht did in france or russia or yugoslavia mr speaker congresswoman douglas exclaimed its outrageous to compare the united states army to hitlers murder machine outrageous i wasnt comparing them except to point out that even the wehrmacht couldnt stamp out partisans the red army isnt having much fun trying it either and if you cant hope to win a fight like that why keep flushing blood down the toilet trying jerry said neither helen gahagan douglas nor any of the other proadministration representatives wanted to listen to him they yelled and fussed and carried on so did the congressmen on jerrys side up on the rostrum joe martin banged his gavel and not for the first time looked as if he had no idea why hed ever wanted to become speaker of the house flashbulbs burst like artillery shells blinking lou weissberg tried to hide a shiver he knew more about bursting shellsor at least mortar bombsthan hed ever wanted to find out up there on the platform with him stood bernie cobb shmuel birnbaum in black fatigues with dp armband and second lieutenant mark davenport the young officer whod stopped cobb and his buddies from leaving their position so theyd been there when heydrich and company came out also on the platform stood general lucius d clay lou had figured the only way hed get to meet the commander of american forces in germany was by monumentally screwing up hed never dreamt he could do something right enough to draw a fourstar generals notice life was full of surprises clay stepped over to the microphone more flashbulbs went off reporters got out notebooks and poised themselves to report a movie camera recorded the event for posterityand for the newsreel before next weeks tworeeler or maybe week after nexts looking straight into the camera general clay said these four brave men with me today are most responsible for ridding the world of reinhard heydrich wouldbe fuhrer of the nazi diehards and war criminal beyond compare the us army and the government of the united states take pride in honoring them and rewarding them for their courage lou translated clays remarks into lowvoiced yiddish for shmuel birnbaum then clay called the dps name lou stepped up to the mike with him to go on interpreting clay said we offered a million dollars for help leading to heydrichs capture or death mr birnbaum who was forced to help excavate the nazi leaders headquarters and who later narrowly escaped the murder that would have silenced him forever gave information that led us to him his share of the reward will be reporters and soldiers gave birnbaum a hand shyly his head bobbed up and down as he acknowledged the applause what will you do with the money somebody called lou translated the question i want to go to palestine the dp answered without hesitation everybody else has a homeland jews should have one too after lou also translated that the mostly american crowd nodded englishmen wouldnt have the uk wasnt having much fun trying to keep its old league of nations mandate from exploding into civil war an ordinary jewish dp would have had a devil of a time even getting british permission to enter palestine for the man whod fingered reinhard heydrich thoughand for a man with a quarter of a million smackers in his pocketmany more things were possible birnbaum and lou stepped back lieutenant mark davenport lucius clay said davenport strode forward and delivered a paradeground salute sir he said he was skinny and blond and looked about seventeen for your cool head for your gallantry on the mountainside and for your vital role in ensuring that heydrich could not escape after coming out of his shelter i am pleased to promote you to first lieutenant to present you with a silver star in recognition of your courage and to reward you with congratulations thank you very much sir davenport sounded as if he couldnt believe what was happening to him well if he didnt who could blame him as if to compound the surreal atmosphere clay personally pinned the silver star on his chest private bernard cobb before cobb could even salute him general clay corrected himself sergeant bernard cobb thanks sir bernie cobb did salute then lou had got to know him a little the past few hectic days cobb had had as much of the army as he wanted and then some three stripes on his sleeve wouldnt impress him neither would a silver star even if lucius clay presented it with his own hands a quarter of a million dollars were bound to be a different story what will you do next a reporter asked soon as i get out of the army im going back to new mexico cobb answered ill buy me a house buy a car maybe go to school find a girl find a job settle down no offense to anybody but ive worn a uniform as long as i want to the army needs men like you but i have to admit i understandand i sympathize general clay said then he turned to lou captainno majorlouis weissberg sir lou blinkedhe hadnt expected the promotion down in the crowd howard frank grinned and waved and gave him a thumbsup lou wasnt sure he deserved a silver star either unlike bernie cobb or lieutenant davenport hed spent a hell of a lot more time in heydrichs valley getting shot at than shooting then lucius clay said you earned your share of the reward for ending reinhard heydrichs career not just in the valley last week but also in your relentless pursuit of him and of other war criminals since ve day as i told sergeant cobb the army needs more men like you well done thank you sir lous salute was as snappy as he could make it he felt about ready to bust his buttons with pride if america wasnt the greatest country in the worldno it damn well was and that was all there was to it his folks had come through ellis island with nothing but the clothes on their backs he wished they could see him now collegeeducated and exchanging salutes with a fourstar general if something like this wasnt the dream of every hardworking immigrants son what would be hey captainuh major a reporter called youre in the counterintelligence corps right well yeah lou said uncomfortably the one thing wrong with getting your name in the paper was that you werent so useful to the cic after you did a wellknown spy was your basic contradiction in terms the reporter didnt careor more likely didnt even think about it those nazi soandsos gonna dry up and blow away now that heydrichs dead and gone he asked poising pencil above notebook to wait for lous reply a good storythat he cared about lucius clay leaned toward lou too anxious to hear his answer it wasnt an enormous showy lean only an inch or so two at the most but any lean at all from the straightspined general seemed remarkable with clay leaning lou picked his words with even more care than he would have otherwise nobody knows whats coming upi figure thats how come everybody spends so much time guessing and hoping about it he said so the most i can give you now is a guess and a hope my guess is weve got a decent chance that theyll quit and you can bet i hope like anything im right what was a decent chance thirty percent eighty percent lou didnt say because he had no idea the reporter didnt notice and wrote down what he did say general clay on the other hand recognized bullshit when he heard it he made a point of straightening up again lou showed he didnt have any better notion than clay did himself lou wished he could have sounded surer hell he wished he could have been surer too bad life didnt work that way bernie cobb was drunk he was drunk as a lordin factor he thought so even if no lords were around for comparison he couldnt remember ever buying drinks for so many other guys before either of course hed also never had a quarter of a million bucks burning a hole in his pocket before he didnt exactly have a quarter of a million bucks now in spite of the fancy ceremony with general clay the money was going into a stateside bank account for him the idea was to keep him from blowing the wad before the army shipped him home whoeverd decided on that knew what he was doingand knew bernie much too well so what he was spending was back pay and poker winnings and whatever other cash he could scrape together you had to throw some kind of bash when came your way didnt you bernie thought so and the silver star didnt hurt so when do they turn you loose and send you back asked one of his many newfound close friends that set bernie laughing right now almost anything would but this was really funny yknow the medal they pinned on me even with the way theyre bumping up points that gave me enough for my ruptured duck so as soon as they find me a ship or a plane i am fucking gone people laughed and cheered and pounded him on the back why not he was still slapping money down on the bar somebody else asked him did you know it was heydrich when you opened up on those jerries shit no bernie answered all i knew was they were germans and they werent supposed to be there i figured i better get em while they were still all bunched up like so i did sometimes youd rather be lucky than good the other gi sounded jealous and he had a quarter of a million reasons to sound that way no a quarter of a million and one because bernie had a ticket home too well the way things were going everybodyd be heading back from germany soon bernie didnt know if he liked that but he liked going home himself just fine engines roaring the big tripletailed constellation rolled down the runway outside of amsterdam the twa airliner took off smooth as you please it would stop at paris to let passengers off and take on new ones and to top up its fuel tanks then it would cross the atlanticeight or ten times as fast as the fastest ocean linerand land at new york city over the intercom the pilot explained all that in english and french and dutch before the war he surely would have used german too he didnt think he needed to now konrad could follow english and dutch after a fashion but it didnt matter regardless of what the pilot thought the flight would be doing konrad and his friends had other plans konrad and max carried dutch passportsor excellent forgeries of dutch passports anyhow a couple of rows farther back arnold and hermann flew on belgian passportsor equally excellent forgeries along with the false documents all four men had also brought cutdown schmeissers onto the plane but the submachine guns werent on display not yet a steward came down the aisle with a tray of drinks it was almost empty by the time it got to konrad and max plenty of people needed help forgetting they were three or four kilometers up in the air max took a cocktail konrad didnt they landed at orly airport like the rest of the people going on to new york konrad and max and arnold and hermann sat tight while other stylish men and women got off and on if you couldnt afford stylish clothes odds were you couldnt afford a plane ticket either after the layover the l took off again the pilot came on the intercom to brag in his three languages about the meals twa would be serving then he explained how to fold the seats down into reasonable approximations of beds no matter how much faster than a ship it was the airliner would still take a long time to get to new york city it would take far longer than the pilot expected but he didnt know that yet time he found out ready konrad asked quietly max nodded konrad twisted and looked back over his shoulder he caught arnolds eye and hermanns they nodded too all four germans took their schmeissers out of their travel cases no one had searched them before they boarded except for a few panicky editorial writers no one had seen the need even after the german freedom front flew that captured c into the russians berlin courthouse a stewardessquite a pretty girl reallywas drawing near when konrad and max arnold and hermann all stood up at the same time whats going on she asked sounding more curious than alarmed then she saw the schmeissers her eyesgreen as jadeopened so wide konrad could see white all around the irises as he might have with a spooked horse on the eastern front crash the tray of drinks hit the floor dont do anything dumb konrad saidhe was lead man in this operation not least because he knew english take us to the cockpit whatwhat will you do the girls voice quavered which was hardly a surprise nobody will get hurt if people do what we say konrad answered which committed him to nothing he gestured sharply with the schmeissers muzzle now go on move when the cockpit door opened the pilot grinned at the stewardess hey beautiful whats going on then he saw the four men with submachine guns behind her his jaw dropped what the hell i will shoot you if you do not do everything i tell you konrad said the plane will crash everyone will die if you do what i tell you i think everyone can live is it a bargain who the hell are you the pilot demanded that was a fair question he meant are you a pack of crazy people if he decided konrad and his friends were he wouldnt see any point to dealing with them he might think crashing the plane now would be the best thing he could do so they wouldnt try to make him fly it into a building or something since konrad didnt want to die he spoke quickly we belong to the german freedom front we were soldiers in the war we still fight to liberate the fatherland pilot and copilot looked at each other neither seemed to like the answer very much what do you want us to do the pilot asked after a considerable pause fly this airplane to madrid land there konrad replied we willhow do you say it use the airplane and the passengers as poker chips to move our cause forward we will not shoot unless you try to overpower us everyone in that case will be very unhappy when we go off course the radar will see it the pilot said theyll call us up and ask us whats wrong what are we supposed to tell em tell them the truth tell them you have men from the german freedom front on your airplane tell them these men require you to fly to spain konrad answered the pilot eyed him you son of a bitch you want everybody to know aber naturlich konrad said the world must learn we are still fighting for a free germany and we are serious in what we do as he had with the stewardess he let a twitch of the schmeissers muzzle make his point for him nowto madrid right to fucking madrid the pilot muttered the l swung from west to south not five minutes later a voice on the radio said twa flight this is paris control why have you changed course over the pilot grabbed the microphone paris control this is twa we have four men from the german freedom front aboard they are all armed and they have directed us to fly to madrid to keep our passengers and crew safe we are obeying over he clicked off the mike and looked back over his shoulder at konrad there happy now you did what was needed that is good konrad answered the pilots eyebrows said he didnt think so jesus christ paris control burst out say that again twa at konrads nod the pilot did jesus paris control repeated then he asked have the assholes hurt anybody negative they say they wont if we play along with em you might watch what you call em since theyre in the cockpit with us erroger that paris control said a different voice came over the air shall we scramble fighters negative say again negative the pilot replied not unless you aim to shoot us down what else can fighters do a long silence followed at last paris control said you may proceed we will inform spanish air officials of the situation thank you the pilot said he looked disgusted paris control had sounded disgusted some of the angloamericans had wanted to clean out francos spain after the wehrmacht surrendered they hadnt done it though even if spain sheltered more than a few german refugees and other europeans whod supported the reichs crusade against bolshevism maybe they remembered that franco hadnt let the fuhrer come in and run the english out of gibraltar all by itself that had gone a long way toward costing germany the war can we tell the passengers whats going on the copilot asked theyre bound to be wondering by now go ahead konrad said and then in german to his comrades if anybody back there makes trouble kill him word went out over the airliners intercom the copilot warned people not to do anything silly and nobody did the constellation flew on almost at right angles to its planned course after a while konrad saw the peaks of the pyrenees ahead the l flew high above them the land on the other side was spain he and his fellow hijackers grinned at one another everything was going according to plan the spanish groundcontrol man who came on the radio hardly spoke english he and the pilot went back and forth in french konrad didnt know any but max and hermann did they nodded to show nothing was wrong spanish planes came up to look the airliner over son of a bitch the pilot exclaimed thought id never seen another goddamn messerschmitt again to konrad the german design carried happier associations we sold many of them to spain he said the spaniards must use them yet i guess the pilot still sounded shaken he wasnt too shaken to land smoothly though tanks rolled toward the constellation they were also germanoutdated panzer iiiswhich did nothing to reassure konrad tell them to go away or the passengers will answer for it he said sharply the american relayed the message the tanks pulled back people are hungry may i serve a meal the stewardess asked ja go ahead hermann keep an eye on things konrad said hermann smiled and nodded plainly he was happy to keep an eye on the cute stewardess that wasnt what konrad had meant but the lead hijacker turned back to the pilot you can talk to the control tower yes yes the man said they finally found a guy who really knows some english too good very good get in touch with him when the pilot had konrad took a folded sheet of paper out of his inside jacket pocket send to the tower the just demands of the german freedom front tell the tower to send these demands on to the troops unlawfully and improperly occupying germany have you got it take it easy let me give em that much before i start forgetting the pilot said konrad waved agreement the pilot spoke into the microphone then he looked back to the hijacker to find out what came next konrad was only too happy to oblige him first all demands must be met within seventytwo hours after that we cannot answer for the safety of the passengers youll start shooting people you mean the pilot observed bleakly ja konrad said if we do not do this no one pays attention to us send the warning after the pilot had konrad resumed we demand the immediate liberation of all prisoners captured while resisting the unlawful occupation we demand also an end to the unlawful ban against national socialist participation in german political life and we demand maybe you should start shooting now the pilot said they wont give you any of that stuff konrad hefted his schmeisser you had better hope they do xxxii had lou weissberg tried for a year he would have had trouble coming up with a photo he less wanted to see on the front page of the international heraldtribune there was the big fourengined airliner parked at the edge of a runway in madrid there was the doorway open there was a faint view of a nazi bastard with a submachine gun standing in the doorway and there on the tarmac below the doorway lay a crumpled corpse in a spreading pool of blood motherfuckers even picked a jew to murder first lou snarled in helpless frustrated furythe story beside the photo said the dead mans name was david levinsky probably the only jew on the plane but they found him all right sure they did howard frank agreed after everything youve seen since you got here how come youre surprised now lou sighed and lit a cigarette maybe cause theyre still exactly the same assholes they were before even though heydrichs dead why did clay bother giving me a medal and all that cash if killing the bastard didnt change anything he must have hoped it would too major frank said and if you dont want the money ill take it off your hands i bet i can figure out something to do with it you know what you can do with itsideways lou said chuckling frank lit up too lou went on and the goddamn spaniards just stand around watching with their thumbs up their asses portuguese too major frank said a dc had been hijacked to lisbon the nazis aboard that plane hadnt started shooting hostages yet yeah the portuguese too we shoulda gone into both countries after ve day then the krauts wouldnt have anywhere to hidei dont think you can fly nonstop from europe to buenos aires lou said but you know the real pisser howard frank suddenly seemed fascinated by the glowing coal on his cigarette at last without much wanting to he said nu the real pisser is were still loading gis onto troopships and taking them home lou said that hasnt slowed down one goddamn bit i mean why should it we knocked the crap out of the nazis so they arent dangerous any more sure makes sense to me must make sense to you too right riiight frank stretched out the word like a train whistle fading in the distance go close the door to my office willya huh how come lou said major frank just looked at him okay okay all right already lou walked over and shut it by the time he got back frank had produced an almostfull pint of bourbon from nowheremore likely from a desk drawer he took a knock and handed lou the bottle here get the taste out of your mouth thanks lou was glad to drink it wouldnt help the poor sobs in madrid or lisbon but it made him feel better ahh youre a mensh well i try major frank tilted the pint back again not so far this time russians have the same worry we dojust before you came in with the paper i heard on the radio that theres a hijacked plane in prague fuck lou said that made him want more bourbon himself so he took some fanatics have a new toy dont they howard frank nodded looks that way but what can they accomplish lou asked no matter how many hostages they kill we wont do what they say thatd be asking for even more trouble if such a thing is possible and theyve gotta know the russiansll tell em to piss up a rope sure frank nodded again the kind of publicity theyre getting thoughyou cant buy headlines like that and if theyre pulling this crap on regular airline flights theyll make us start patting people down and going through everybodys luggage and stuff like that itll cost millions of dollars and flush even more millions of manhours down the shitter lord will it ever lou exclaimed picturing the mess in his mind millions and millions of dollars uhhuh major frank eyed the bourbon longingly this time though he didnt pick it up and i guess thats why nobodys stormed the planes in madrid and lisbon if a bunch of hostages get shot who do we blame franco and salazar right thats how theyre bound to see it anyway lou grunted he also wanted another snort and also hung back makes sense i almost wish it didnt but it does but if the fucking ss men are shooting hostages anyway hey its happening in europe a bunch of the people on those planes are bound to be foreigners so its nothing anybody in the united states needs to worry about is it frank said of course not but lou reached for the bourbon after all vladimir bokov had all kinds of reasons not to want to go to the prague airport hed had plenty of work on his plate back in berlinimportant work too not just stuff to make time go by dealing with czechoslovakian officials was still tricky too many of them thought they could restore the bourgeois republic theyd had before the war they didnt see that with soviet troops occupying their country it had to accommodate itself to the ussr and dealing with the nazi terrorists whod hijacked this li and ordered it flown here might be even trickier none of which had anything to do with anything when bokov and colonel shteinberg got orders to drop everything to go to prague and to recapture the passenger plane without making concessions they went what other choice did they have none and bokov knew it which didnt keep him from complaining why us he groused peering at the li through captured german binoculars better than any the soviet union made why us volodya moisei shteinbergs chuckle said he was amused to find such naivete in a fellow nkvd officer you mean you dont know if i did would i be pissing and moaning like this bokov answered irritably ill tell you why then and shteinberg proceeded to do just that lieutenant general vlasov thats why we did well giving birnbaum to the americans after he didnt want us to so now he gives us this mess if we dont make a hash of it we solve his problem for him and if we do hes even with us and he writes something good and foul on our fitness report well fuck me bokov said and not another word he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand as if to admit he should have seen that for himself and he should have as soon as shteinberg pointed it out to him he knew it was true in yuri vlasovs shoes bokov would have done the same thing all the troops ringing the li belonged to the red army the czechoslovakians had grumbled about that which did them no good whatever the plane was russian that gave the soviet commandant in prague all the excuse he needed to use his own men if some pimp of a czech colonel whod probably get purged once the other shoe here dropped didnt like it too goddamn bad the radio crackled to life do you read me prague airport one of the nazi hijackers asked we hear you yes bokov answered in german youd better get cracking on our demands then the fanatic said times running short if we dont know for sure that youre freeing prisoners and moving soldiers out of the vaterland its too bad for the people on this plane we are doing what you told us to do bokov lied not even the americans were stupid enough to yield to the hijackers demands if you did that even once you set yourself up for endless trouble down the line wed better see some sign of it or we start shooting the german warned theres no hope for you if you do bokov said that was true but thered been no hope for the fanatics once they commandeered the airplane maybe not but theres no hope for your important people either the nazi said the passengers were important officers engineers agricultural officials a prominent violinist no one but important people flew not in soviet airspace but that also had nothing to do with anything a red army lieutenant handed colonel shteinberg a note he read it and nodded to bokov dont do anything hasty bokov told the fanatic well do what you want and well get you the evidence you need out he made sure hed switched off before asking shteinberg everythings ready the jew nodded again bokov switched frequencies on the radio and said one word in russian now three mm shells slammed into the lis cockpit they blew off most of the planes nose a truck with a scaling laddertaken from a prague fire enginesped down the runway the ladder went up red army men with submachine guns swarmed into what was left of the cockpit another truck raced over to the lis rightside doorway this one needed a shorter ladder the first soldier up it sprayed the lock with bullets from his ppsh then he threw the door open and sprang into the plane the rest of his squad followed it was all over in less time than it took to tell the russians threw two hijackers bodies out of the lis shattered nose one more corpse came out through the side door they were bound to be dead already but men on the ground filled them full of lead anyway just to stay safe then live soldiers and passengers started coming out another lieutenant hurried back to the tower to report to shteinberg and bokov your plan worked very well he said saluting the nkvd men the sons of bitches only had time to shoot three men and one of them isnt badly hurt oh and shell fragments killed the pilot and wounded the copilot and one passenger too bad but its the cost of doing business bokov said colonel shteinberg nodded cheaper than dealing with hijackers any day a moment later the li caught fire blasting the cockpit had pretty much wrecked it anyway the red army soldiers and the surviving people whod been aboard pulled away in a hurry vladimir bokov impassively watched the fat column of black smoke rise into the sky the plane was part of the cost of doing business too and as for lieutenant general yuri pavlovich vlasovgo fuck yourself yuri pavlovich bokov thought happily the senior nkvd man had given bokov and shteinberg this assignment hoping they would botch it shteinberg was bound to be right about that but they hadnt theyd done as well with it as anyone could reasonably hope to do theyd given no concessions the hijackers were dead and most of the passengers were alive if vlasov didnt like itdrop dead cuntface bokov grinned maybe hed said it out loud because moisei shteinberg smiled too or maybe the jew was just thinking along with him after what theyd managed here together that wouldnt surprise him at all seeing what his hijackings had wrought jochen peiper was more happy than not one thing was clear taking over a russian plane didnt yield enough to make it worthwhile the russians as he already had painful reason to understand proved at least as remorseless and relentless as his own people to them the hijacked aircraft and the people aboard it were expendable as long as they got rid of the hijackers they didnt care about anything else all right peiper muttered we wont mess with them again not like that anyhow but the plane that landed in madrid and the one that came down in lisbonboth of those were successes no two ways about it the german fighting men aboard had killed a few fat rich fools theyd got wonderful publicity every airline that flew anywhere in western europe was frantically revamping security procedures that would cost piles of dollars or pounds or francs or whatever currency they used it would also cost them endless wasted time and uncountable passenger goodwill the team in madrid had even managed to torch their constellation as they walked out they were in jail now as were the hijackers whod gone to lisbon the usa and uk and france were all screaming for their heads jochen peiper didnt think theyd get them the reich still had friends in high places in spain and portugal even if those friends had to work quietly and discreetly these days his best guess was that the hijacking teams would stay locked up till the foofaraw died down and then without any fuss someone would open the door shove them out through it and do his goddamnedest to pretend the whole thing never happened that suited peiper fine he didnt think he would have any trouble recruiting people for more hijackings and the rest of the german freedom fronts business seemed to be going well enough most important the amis hadnt brought bulldozers and steam shovels into this valley to dig out peipers headquarters nobody the enemy had caught when they dug out heydrich must have known where this place was peiper had hoped that would prove true but hed known too well there was no guarantee either heydrich had paid proper attention to security or luck meant no one who knew what he shouldnt had survived peiper didntcouldntknow which but either would do roadside bombs sabotaged vehicles and railroad lines poisoned liquor brave men in explosive vests who could take out a platoon of amis or tommies or ivans if they pressed the button at the right timeall that was the small change of partisan warfareunless you had to try to stop it peipers side had had to do that in russia and polandand yugoslavia and greece and france and the low countries and norway unfortunately the reich hadnt made a popular overlord now the germans got to jump up and down on the other pan in the scale if the angloamericans and the russians oh yesand the french too didnt like it let them have the joy of figuring out what to do about it the americans had already decided they didnt know the english werent likely to be far behind and then then what peiper wondered but he knew then we take over thats what the angloamericans would leave behind political parties and policemen to try to keep the national socialists from reclaiming the power that was rightly theirs peiper chuckled how long would that last not bloody long in the germanoccupied east how many russian policemen had also served the red army or the nkvd way too goddamn manyjochen peiper knew that for sure and how many german policemen in the occupied reich also served the german freedom front quite a fewpeiper also knew that for sure the fight goes on he murmured and nodded to himself whoever has the most patiencehe wins he nodded again the americans and the english had already seen more trouble than theyd ever wanted before too long the french would too without the angloamericans to prop them up they werent much the russiansjochen peiper grimaced the russians were a different story against the russians you had to look a lifetime down the line if you were going to accomplish anything but a free and independent and national socialist deutsches reich in western germany would do for a start peiper thought they could win that much pretty soon anybody could go to new york city to interview troops coming home since tom schmidt couldnt go to germany he didnt want to go to new york yes lots of peopleand lots of reportersdid but wasnt that the point what were your chances of finding an interesting story if you did the same thing as everybody else pretty goddamn slim thats what and so tom went to baltimore instead it was a major port nobody else except people from there gave two whoops in hell about it and it was only a little more than an hour by train from washington how could you not like the combination it was chilly and rainy there as it had been when he set out from union station winter wasnt on the calendar yet but it sure was in the air he stood under an umbrella a few paces beyond the tent that called itself a deprocessing center and waited for demobilized soldiers to come by out at the end of the pier squatted the peter gray as unlovely a rustbucket as shipfitters had ever slapped together tom wondered who the liberty ship was named for not the onearmed outfielder on the browns surely but what other even slightly famous pete gray had there been mps discouraged him from getting to the returning soldiers before they went through the deprocessing center that irked him i happen to know other people have been able to talk to them beforehand he fumed all he got back from the sergeant in charge of the mps was a shrug and a dismissive sorry sir the threestriper didnt sound one bit sorry tacking insult on to injury he added you understandweve got our orders so did the guards at dachau and belsen tom almost said it he would have if hed figured it would do him any good but the boss mps dull eyes and blunt features argued that he would have made a pretty good concentrationcamp guard himself that being so hearing himself compared to one would have pissed him off all the more he had no real reason to run tom in which might not stop him from inventing one sometimes the smartest thing you could do was keep your mouth shut here came a soldier proudly wearing a shiny new ruptured duck on his lapel talk to you a minute tom asked tom schmidt from the chicago tribune taking notes he realized would be a bitch it was like driving the hills of san francisco where you needed one foot on the gas one on the brake and one on the clutch here he needed one hand for the umbrella one for the pencil and one for the notebook as things turned out he didnt need pencil or notebook this time the gi shook his head and kept walking sorry mac all i wanna do is haul ass for the train station get aboard and head for home where is home tom was nothing if not persistent it did him no good this time the soldier or exsoldier or whatever he was shook his head again he splashed every time his army boots came down on the concrete that had to be better than slopping through mud though slowly as if in a hollywood dissolve the curtain of rain made him disappear here came another tiredlooking gi tom took another shot at it tom schmidt chicago tribune can i talk to you for a little bit the gione stripe on his sleeve made him a pfcpaused okay why not you gonna put me in the paper tom nodded thats the idea whats your name atkins gil atkins where you from gil if tom held both the notebook and the umbrella in his left hand he could take notesafter a fashion sioux city iowa how about that tom said one of the rare phrases you could use with almost anything hed been to sioux city it was a place where nobody died of excess excitement what did you do there shortorder cook were you a cook in the army too not fuckin likely i lugged a bar did you get to germany before ve day or after after not that it made much difference krauts may have said they gave up but that didnt mean shit and everybody knew it im just glad i made it home in one piece the kids face clouded over bunch of my buddies didnt im sorry tom said gil atkins only shrugged maybe he recognized purely polite sympathy when he heard it tom tried again so youre glad to come home from germany then oh hell yes nothing wrong with atkins sincerity whats the best thing about being back in the states lord where do i start quite seriously the returning pfc ticked off points on his fingers lets see when i get on the train i wont have to worry that the fanatics have planted a block of tnt on the tracks when i get into a jeepsorry i mean a cari wont have to watch the bushes by the side of the road to make sure no cocksucker with a rocket or a machine gun can blow it up when i walk down the street i wont have to worry somebodyll chuck a grenade under my feet and run away i wont have to wonder if the guy coming past me has dynamite and nails on under his coat i wont have to think the pretty gal pushing the baby carriage has maybe got a big old mine in there instead of a baby i wont have to be scared somebodys gonna bomb the place where im sleeping if i buy myself a shot i wont have to wonder whether some asshole poisoned it i wontshit buddy i could go on a lot longer but youve got the message doncha i just might yeah tom mimed writers cramp which made atkins chuckle what do you think about the people who dont think we ought to be pulling out of germany well that depends there were some of those guys over there and you gotta respect them i mean hell they were laying it on the line like everybody else yknow so that was okay but the people back here the safe fat happy people who wouldnt be in any danger regardless of what goes on in germanyfuck them and the horse they rode in on those clowns are ready to fight to the last drop of my blood thats how it looks to me anyways gil atkins chuckled again this time in mild embarrassment youre gonna have to take out some words before you can put this in your paper huh thats part of the business tom said thanks for taking the time to talk to me you helped a lot only time i ever got in the paper before was on account of a car crash atkins said and that one wasnt even my faultother guy was drunk and he sideswiped me he bobbed his head and tramped off before long no doubt hed find the station hed ride back to sioux city and start scrambling eggs and frying bacon and flipping hamburgers hed have a regular job again hell hed have his life back again try as tom might he couldnt see what was so bad about that tom had his own job too hi im tom schmidt from the chicago tribune can i talk to you for a minute this guy with his shiny ruptured duck walked past him as if he didnt exist try againwhat else could you do hello my names tom schmidt im from the chicago tribune auld lang syne came out of the radio guy lombardos orchestra was playing in the new year the same as usual over the music the announcer said in less than a minute now the lighted ball in times square will drop it will usher out and bring in another year to look forward to ed mcgraw looked down at his wristwatch boy im a whole year fast he said buster neft laughed so did betsy stan looked around wideeyed hed stayed up way past his bedtime but new years eve was special he would be three pretty soon which seemed impossible to his grandmother diana mcgraw only smiled at eds joke he made it about every other new year and when he wasnt a year fast he was a year slow yeah diana had heard it before too many times shed heard just about everything from him too many times the ball is dropping the announcer said happy new year happy new year ed lifted his beer all the grownups had drinks of one kind or another even stan had a glass of grape juice if he wanted to pretend it was winewell why not betsy raised her highball in dianas direction heres to you mom if anybody made what it was youre the one thanks diana said along with the rest of her family she drank the toast it was true enough american soldiers were coming home from germany most of them were already back and the ones who werent would be before long diana had had a lot to do with that and now it wasliterally was this past minute or solast years news the second phone line here didnt ring as often as it had even a couple of months earlier the withdrawal wasnt controversial any more it was an accomplished fact by the nature of things accomplished facts werent news the world was starting to forget about diana mcgraw and mothers against the war in germany why not theyd won pretty soon shed go back to being just another housewife from anderson indiana up till pat got killed she hadnt thought about being anything else she still wished shed never had any reasonwell never had that reason anyhowto think about anything else but shed got used to going all over the country for the cause shed got used to fielding phone calls from reporters and congressmen and other important people shed got used to being an important person herself and she could watch that fade like a cheap blouse the first time it met bleach once youd been famouseven a little bit famoushow did you get used to ordinary life baseball players had to deal with it so did actors who had one or two hit movies and then saw their careers fizzle out some managed gracefully others grabbed the limelight a little while longer by doing something disgraceful diana might have managed that if news of her tryst with marvin she still couldnt remember his last name had made the papers everybody on the other side would have been delighted to see her exposed as a woman without any morals to call her own but nobody knew about that little encounter except the parties involved she had no idea whether marvins conscience bothered him she would have bet against it he was a man after all men took what they could get and tried to get it even when they couldnt women werent supposed to do things like that which didnt mean they didnt only that they werent supposed to what bothered diana most about ending up in bed with marvin whoozis was how much fun shed had while it was going on marvin had casually shown her more varieties of delight in half an hour than ed had since the end of world war i darn it when ed went over there couldnt a mademoiselle from amentieres have taught him a little something evidently not and having a better idea of what she was missing only left diana more frustrated when ed wanted to lay her down he still hadnt figured out exactly what was wrong even if he knew something was she had no idea how to tell him either if she suddenly wanted him to start doing this and that when hed never doneprobably never even imagined doingthis and that before what would he think most likely that some other guy had done this and that with her while she was on one of her junkets hed be right too if only this and thatespecially thatdidnt feel so good if only she hadnt got smashed with marvin if onlyfame werent rolling away like the afternoon train bound for indianapolis which brought her back to where shed started full circle she realized betsyd

answering yawn was pretty much authentic can we hold off a day im really sleepy and i dont have to pretend im not the way stan does ed chuckled hes a corker all right yeah itll keep a day sure he was accommodating which meant shed have to be accommodating tomorrow night and shed lie there thinking about what marvin knew and he didnt and stop that she told herself firmly but herself didnt want to listen hey babe he said more anxiety than he usually showed in his voice itll be okay right sure ed she might have been soothing little stan how she wondered again you did what you set out to do im proud of you ed said i just wish id never set out to do it i wish id never had to diana said and that was nothing but the truth if pat were alivebut he wasnt and he never would be she started to cry shed been doing that a lot lately ed took her in his arms he thought he knew all the reasons he was soothing her lou weissberg was taking papers out of filing cabinets and stuffing then into boxes when howard frank came in to see how he was doing lou was glad for the chance to stop for a couple of minutes last man out of germanyis me or maybe you he said major frank winced its not quite that bad he said close enough goddammit lou said a garrison in berlin a few air bases and a little bit of armorjust enough to make the red army think twice about marching inif were very very lucky not enough to hold down the goddamn fanatics and fat chance well ever bring any guys back to take care of that the christian democrats and the social democrats say they can whip the nazis in any halfway honest election the german police say they can fight the bastards off they get a lot of the equipment were leaving behind frank insisted yeah all the other parties were so wonderful at stopping hitler in too lou said which made his friend flinch again and how many german cops still get up on their hind legs and whinny every time they hear the horst wessel lied some sure not too many i hope major frank spread his hands weve done the best we could considering yeah considering lou made an ordinary word sound extraordinarily foul unless you want to stay here as a civilian were heading for home day after tomorrow frank said in its infinite wisdom congress has decided thats the best thingthe very best thingthe united states can do oh yeah every fucking american jew ever born is dying to be a civilian in germany dying is just what id do here you bet lous loud opinion of congress and its infinite wisdom would have got him shot for treason in any totalitarian countryand in about half the democracies currently in business too all howard frank did was sadly wag an index finger and say naughty naughty a moment later he added you must be slipping man ive called those assholes way worse than that well goody for you lou said you gonna resign your commission after we get back to the states this time major frank looked genuinely sorrowful he nodded anyway yeah after we go and do this i dont see any point to staying in you same here lou said back to my family back to teaching english back to being a civilian and ill spend the rest of my days hoping i can live out the rest of my days before things blow up again know what i mean dont i wish i didnt frank exclaimed now that youve cheered me up ill go back and cram more of my crap into boxes the records will all be on fileif anybody ever bothers to look at em yeah lou said if two days later trucks and halftracks pulled up in front of the commandeered nuremberg hotel to take departing soldiers and the paperwork of an occupation gone bad north to the sea and to the ships waiting to carry them across the atlantic outside the building lou smoked a last cigarette and shot the shit with one of the german gendarmes whod be taking over the place once the americans were gone rolf was a pretty good guy hed been a corporal during the warbut wehrmacht not waffenss in his dyedblack us fatigues and american helmet he looked nothing like a german soldier so lou tried to tell himself anyhow we will miss you when you go the gendarme said you are the only thing standing between us and chaos you guys will do fine on your own lou answered you always reassured a sickroom patient evenespeciallywhen you didnt think hed make it i fear the new parties will not have the moral authority they need to oppose the old order rolf said i fear wethe policewill not have the weapons to hold back the fanatics sure you will said lou who feared the very same things somebody yelled at him from a halftrack he cussed under his breath then handed rolf what was left of the pack of chesterfields good luck to you my friend danke schon the gendarme happily pocketed the smokes lou trotted over to the halftrack and clambered up and in the cic convoy protected not only by armored cars but also by sherman tanks rumbled away from the hotel away from nurembergand soon away from germany rolf halbritter coughed from the dust the retreating convoy kicked up he shook his head in wonder not far from awe the amis were really and truly goingno really and truly gone which meanthe had a badge pinned on the underside of his collar where it didnt show now he could wear it openly again it was round with a red outer ring that carried a legend in bronze letters nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei the white inner circle held a black swastika every party member had one just like it pretty soon theyd all be showing it too historical note there really was a german resistance movement after ve day it was never very effective it got off to a very late start as the nazis took much longer than they might have to realize they werent going to win the straightup war and it was hamstrung because the wehrmacht the ss the hitler youth the luftwaffe and the nazi party all tried to take charge of itwhich often meant that for all practical purposes no one took charge of it by it had mostly petered out perry biddiscombes two important books werewolf the history of the national socialist guerrilla movement toronto and the last nazis ss werewolf guerrilla resistance in europe stroud gloucestershire and charleston sc document what it did and failed to do in the real world i have tried to imagine circumstances under which the german resistance might have been much more effective the man with the iron heart is the result in the real world of course the attack on reinhard heydrich that failed in this novel succeeded jozef gabcik and jan kubis were the assassins they both killed themselves under attack by the ss on june the ss also wiped the czech village of lidice off the map in revenge for heydrichs murder a good recent biography of heydrich is mario r dederichs geoffrey brooks translator heydrich the face of evil london and st paul how would we have dealt with asymmetrical warfare had we met it in the s in europe rather than in the s in vietnam or in the present decade in iraq conversely how would the soviets have dealt with it i have no certain answersby the nature of this kind of speculation one cant come up with certain answers sometimesas here i hopeposing the questions is interesting and instructive all by itself german nuclear physicists really were brought to england for interrogation and then returned to germany as described here and the germans really did leave ten grams of radium behind in hechingen jeremy bernstein hitlers uranium club the secret recordings at farm hall woodbury ny is the indispensable source for the episode to this day no one seems to know what became of the radium unwary readers may suppose that no congressman would say a president wanted to send troops anywhere to get their heads blown off for his amusement words ive put in a republican congressmans mouth aimed at president truman but as reported in the october los angeles times california democratic representative pete stark did say that aiming the charge at president bush truth really can be stranger than fiction a motion to censure congressman stark failed but he did subsequently apologize
