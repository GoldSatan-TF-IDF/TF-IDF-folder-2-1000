michael connelly the closers book in the harry bosch series to the detectives who have to look into the abyss part one blue religion within the practice and protocol of the los angeles police department a twosix call is the one that draws the most immediate response while striking the most fear behind the bulletproof vest for it is a call that often has a career riding on it the designation is derived from the combination of the code radio call out meaning respond as soon as possible and the sixth floor of parker center from which the chief of police commands the department a twosix is a forthwith from the chiefs office and any officer who knows and enjoys his position in the department will not delay detective harry bosch spent over twentyfive years with the department in his first tour and never once received a forthwith from the chief of police in fact other than receiving his badge at the academy in he never shook hands or spoke personally with a chief again he had outlasted several of themand of course seen them at police functions and funeralsbut simply never met them along the way on the morning of his return to duty after a threeyear retirement he received his first twosix while knotting his tie in the bathroom mirror it was an adjutant to the chief calling boschs private cell phone bosch didnt bother asking how they had come up with the number it was simply understood that the chiefs office had the power to reach out in such a way bosch just said he would be there within the hour to which the adjutant replied that he would be expected sooner harry finished knotting his tie in his car while driving as fast as traffic allowed on the freeway toward downtown it took bosch exactly twentyfour minutes from the moment he closed the phone on the adjutant until he walked through the double doors of the chiefs suite on the sixth floor at parker center he thought it had to have been some kind of record notwithstanding the fact that he had illegally parked on los angeles street in front of the police headquarters if they knew his private cell number then surely they knew what a feat it had been to make it from the hollywood hills to the chiefs office in under a half hour but the adjutant a lieutenant named hohman stared him down with disinterested eyes and pointed to a plasticsealed couch that already had two other people waiting on it youre late he said take a seat bosch decided not to protest not to make matters possibly worse he stepped over to the couch and sat between the two men in uniform who had staked out the armrests they sat bolt upright and did not smalltalk he figured they had been twosixed as well ten minutes went by the men on either side of him were called in ahead of bosch each dispensed with by the chief in five minutes flat while the second man was in with the chief bosch thought he heard loud voices from the inner sanctum and when the officer came out his face was ashen he had somehow fucked up in the eyes of the chief and the wordwhich had even filtered to bosch in retirementwas that this new man did not suffer fuckups lightly bosch had read a story in the times about a command staffer who was demoted for failing to inform the chief that the son of a city councilman usually allied against the department had been picked up on a deuce the chief only found out about it when the councilman called to complain about harassment as if the department had forced his son to drink six vodka martinis at bar marmount and drive home via the trunk of a tree on mulholland finally hohman put down the phone and pointed his finger at bosch he was up he was quickly shuttled into a corner office with a view of union station and the surrounding train yards it was a decent view but not a great one it didnt matter because the place was coming down soon the department would move into temporary offices while a new and modern police headquarters was rebuilt on the same spot the current headquarters was known as the glass house by the rank and file supposedly because there were no secrets kept inside bosch wondered what the next place would become known as the chief of police was behind a large desk signing papers without looking up from this work he told bosch to have a seat in front of the desk within thirty seconds the chief signed his last document and looked up at bosch he smiled i wanted to meet you and welcome you back to the department his voice was marked by an eastern accent depahtment this was fine with bosch in la everybody was from somewhere else or so it seemed it was both the strength and the weakness of the city it is good to be back bosch said you understand that you are here at my pleasure it wasnt a question yes sir i do obviously i checked you out extensively before approving your return i had concerns about your shall we say style but ultimately your talent won the day you can also thank your partner kizmin rider for her lobbying effort shes a good officer and i trust her she trusts you i have already thanked her but i will do it again i know it has been less than three years since you retired but let me assure you detective bosch that the department you have rejoined is not the department you left i understand that i hope so you know about the consent decree just after bosch had left the department the previous chief had been forced to agree to a series of reforms in order to head off a federal takeover of the lapd following an fbi investigation into wholesale corruption violence and civil rights violations within the ranks the current chief had to carry out the agreement or he would end up taking orders from the fbi from the chief down to the lowliest boot nobody wanted that yes bosch said ive read about it good im glad you have kept yourself informed and i am happy to report that despite what you may read in the times we are making great strides and we want to keep that momentum we are also trying to update the department in terms of technology we are pushing forward in community policing we are doing a lot of good things detective bosch much of which can be undone in the eyes of the community if we resort to old ways do you understand what i am telling you i think so your return here is not guaranteed you are on probation for a year so consider yourself a rookie again a bootthe oldest living boot at that i approved your returni can also wash you out without so much as a reason anytime in the course of the year dont give me a reason bosch didnt answer he didnt think he was supposed to on friday we graduate a new class of cadets at the academy i would like you to be there sir i want you to be there i want you to see the dedication in our young peoples faces i want to reacquaint you with the traditions of this department i think it could help you help you rededicate yourself if you want me to be there i will be there good i will see you there you will sit under the vip tent as my guest he made a note about the invite on a pad of paper next to the blotter he then put the pen down and raised his hand to point a finger at bosch his eyes took on a fierceness listen to me bosch dont ever break the law to enforce the law at all times you do your job constitutionally and compassionately i will accept it no other way this city will accept it no other way are we okay on that we are okay then we are good to go bosch took his cue and stood up the chief surprised him by also standing and extending his hand bosch thought he wanted to shake hands and extended his own the chief put something in his hand and bosch looked down to see the gold detectives shield he had his old number back it had not been given away he almost smiled wear it well the police chief said and proudly i will now they shook hands but as they did so the chief didnt smile the chorus of forgotten voices he said excuse me chief thats what i think about when i think of the cases down there in openunsolved its a house of horrors our greatest shame all those cases all those voices every one of them is like a stone thrown into a lake the ripples move out through time and people families friends neighbors how can we call ourselves a city when there are so many ripples when so many voices have been forgotten by this department bosch let go of his hand and didnt say anything there was no answer for the chiefs question i changed the name of the unit when i came into the department those arent cold cases detective they never go cold not for some people i understand that then go down there and clear cases thats what your art is thats why we need you and why you are here thats why i am taking a chance with you show them we do not forget show them that in los angeles cases dont go cold i will bosch left him there still standing and maybe a little haunted by the voices like himself bosch thought that maybe for the first time he had actually connected on some level with the man at the top in the military it is said that you go into battle and fight and are willing to die for the men who sent you bosch never felt that when he was moving through the darkness of the tunnels in vietnam he had felt alone and that he was fighting for himself fighting to stay alive that had carried with him into the department and he had at times adopted the view that he was fighting in spite of the men at the top now maybe things would be different in the hallway he punched the elevator button harder than he needed to he had too much excitement and energy and he understood this the chorus of forgotten voices the chief seemed to know the song they were singing and bosch certainly did too most of his life had been spent listening to that song bosch rode the elevator just one flight down to five this too was new territory for him five had always been a civilian floor it primarily housed many of the departments mid and lowlevel administrative offices most of them filled with nonsworn employees budgeters analysts pencil pushers civilians before now there had been no reason to come to the fifth there were no placards in the elevator lobby that pointed the way to specific offices it was the kind of floor where you knew where you were going before you stepped off the elevator but not bosch the hallways on the floor formed the letter h and he went the wrong way twice before finally finding the door marked there was nothing else on the door he paused before opening it and thought about what he was doing and what he was starting he knew it was the right thing it was almost as if he could hear the voices coming through the door all eight thousand of them kiz rider was sitting on a desk just inside sipping a cup of steaming coffee the desk looked like a place for a receptionist but bosch knew from his frequent calls in the prior weeks that there was no receptionist in this squad there was no money for such a luxury rider raised her wrist and shook her head as she checked her watch i thought we agreed on eight oclock she said is that how its going to be partner you waltzing in every morning whenever you feel like it bosch looked at his watch it was five minutes after eight he looked back at her and smiled rider smiled and said were over here rider was a short woman who carried a few extra pounds her hair was short and now had some gray in it she was very dark complected which made her smile all the more brilliant she slipped off the desk and from behind where she had perched she raised a second cup of coffee to him see if i remembered that right he checked and nodded black just like i like my partners funny ill have to write you up for that she led the way the office seemed to be empty it was large even for a squad room serving nine investigatorsfour teams and an oic the walls were painted a light shade of blue like bosch often saw on the screens of computers it was carpeted in gray there were no windows at the positions on the walls where there should have been windows there were bulletin boards or nicely framed crime scene photos from many years back bosch could tell that in these black and whites the photographers had often put their artistic skills ahead of their clinical duties the shots were heavy on mood and shadows not many of the crime scene details were apparent rider must have known he was looking at the photos they told me that writer james ellroy picked these out and had them framed for the office she said she led him around a partial wall that broke the room in two and into an alcove where two gray steel desks were pushed together so the detectives who sat at them would face each other rider put her coffee down on one there were already files stacked on it and personal things like a coffee mug full of pens and a picture frame at an angle that hid the photo it held a laptop computer was open and humming on the desk she had moved into the squad the week before while bosch was still clearing customscustoms being the medical exam and final paperwork that brought him back onto the job the other desk was clean empty and waiting for him he moved behind it and put his coffee down he suppressed a smile as well as he could welcome back roy rider said that made the smile break through it made bosch feel good to be called roy again it was a tradition carried by many of the citys homicide detectives there was a legendary homicide man named russell kuster who had worked out of hollywood division many years back he was the ultimate professional and many of the detectives working murders in the city today had come under his tutelage at one point or another he was killed in an offduty shootout in but his habit of calling people royno matter their real namewas carried on its origin had become obscure some said it was because kuster once had a partner who loved roy acuff and it had started with him others said it was because kuster liked the idea of the homicide cop being the roy rogers type wearing the white hat and riding to the rescue making things right it didnt matter anymore bosch knew it was an honor just to be called roy again he sat down the chair was old and lumpy guaranteed to give him a backache if he spent too much time in it but he hoped that would not be the case in his first run as a homicide detective he had lived by the adage get off your ass and knock on doors he didnt see any reason that should change this time around where is everybody he asked having breakfast i forgot they told me last week that the routine is that on monday mornings everybody meets early for breakfast they usually go over to the pacific i didnt remember until i got in here this morning and found the place dead but they should be back here soon bosch knew the pacific dining car was a longtime favorite with lapd brass and the robberyhomicide division he also knew something else twelve bucks for a plate of eggs i guess that means this is an overtimeapproved squad rider smiled in confirmation you got that right but you wouldnt have been able to finish your fancy eggs anyway once you got the forthwith from the chief you heard about that huh i still have an ear out on six did you get your badge yeah he gave it to me i told him what number youd want did you get it yeah kiz thanks thanks for everything you already told me that partner you dont need to keep saying that he nodded and looked around their space he noticed that on the wall behind rider was a photo of two detectives huddled beside a body lying in the dry concrete bed of the los angeles river it looked like a shot from the early fifties judging by the hats the detectives wore so where do we start he asked the squad breaks the cases up in threeyear increments it provides some continuity they say you get to know the era and some of the players in the department it overlaps it also helps with identifying serials in two years theyve already come up with four serials nobody ever knew about bosch nodded he was impressed what years did we get he asked each team has four or five blocks since were the new team we got four she opened the middle drawer of her desk took out a piece of paper and handed it across to him bosch studied the listing of years for which they would be responsible he had been out of the city and in vietnam for most of the first block the summer of love he said i missed it maybe thats whats wrong with me he said it just to be saying something he noticed that the second block included the year he had come onto the force he remembered a call out to a house off of vermont on his second day on the job in patrol a woman back east asked police to check on her mother who was not answering the phone bosch found her drowned in a bathtub her hands and feet bound with dog leashes her dead dog was in the tub with her bosch wondered if the old womans murder was one of the open cases he would now be charged with solving how was this arrived at i mean why did we get these years they came from the other teams we lightened their caseload in fact they already started the ball rolling on cases from a lot of those years and i heard on friday that a cold hit came in from eightyeight were supposed to run with it starting today i guess you could say its your welcomeback present whats a cold hit when a dna stamp or a latent we send through the computers or the doj makes a blind match whats ours i think its a dna match well find out this morning they didnt tell you anything last week i could have come in over the weekend you know i know that harry but this is an old case there was no need to start running the minute a piece of paper came in the mail working openunsolved is different yeah how come rider looked exasperated but before she could answer they heard the door open and the squad room started filling with voices rider stepped out of the alcove and bosch followed she introduced bosch to the other members of the squad two of the detectives tim marcia and rick jackson bosch knew well from previous cases the other two pairs of partners were robert renner and victor robleto and kevin robinson and jean nord bosch knew them as well as abel pratt the officer in charge of the unit by reputation every one of them was a topnotch homicide investigator the greeting was cordial and subdued a bit overly formal bosch knew that his posting in the unit was probably viewed with suspicion an assignment on the squad would have been highly coveted by detectives throughout the department the fact that he had gotten the posting after nearly three years in retirement raised questions bosch knew as the chief of police had reminded him that he had rider to thank for the job her last posting had been in the chiefs office as a policy analyst she had cashed in whatever markers she had accrued with the chief in order to get bosch back inside the department and working openunsolved cases with her after all the handshakes pratt invited bosch and rider back into his office for a private welcomeaboard speech he sat behind his desk and they took the sidebyside chairs in front of it there was no room in the closetsized space for other furnishings pratt was a few years younger than bosch on the south side of fifty he kept himself in shape and carried the esprit de corps of the vaunted robberyhomicide division of which the openunsolved unit was just one branch pratt appeared confident in his skills and his command of the unit he had to be the rhd took on the citys most difficult cases bosch knew that if you did not believe you were smarter tougher and more cunning than the people you were after then you didnt belong what i really should do is split you two up he began make you work with guys already established here in the unit because this is different from what youve done in the past but i got the word from six and i dont mess with that besides i understand you two have a prior chemistry that worked so forget what i should do and let me tell you a little bit about working openunsolveds kiz i know you already got this speech last week but youll just have to suffer along okay of course rider said first of all forget closure closure is bullshit closure is a media term something they put in newspaper articles about cold cases closure is a joke its a fucking lie all we do here is provide answers answers have to be enough so dont mislead yourself about what you are doing here dont mislead the family members you deal with on these cases and dont be misled by them he paused for reaction got none and moved on bosch noticed that the crime scene photo framed on the wall was of a man collapsed in a bulletriddled phone booth it was the kind of phone booth you only saw in old movies and at the farmers market or over at phillippes without a doubt pratt said this squad is the most noble place in the building a city that forgets its murder victims is a city lost this is where we dont forget were like the guys they bring in in the bottom of the ninth inning to win or lose the game the closers if we cant do it nobody can if we blow it the game is over because were the last resort yes were outnumbered weve got eight thousand openunsolveds since nineteen sixty but we are undaunted even if this whole unit clears only one case a monthjust twelve a yearwe are doing something were the closers baby if youre in homicide this is the place to be bosch was impressed by his fervor he could see sincerity and even pain in his eyes he nodded he immediately knew that he wanted to work for this man a rarity in his experience in the department just dont forget that closure isnt the same as being a closer pratt added got it bosch said now i know you both have long experience working homicides what you are going to find different here is your relationship with the cases relationship bosch asked yes relationship what i mean is that working fresh kills is a completely different animal you have the body you have the autopsy you carry the news to the family here you are dealing with victims long dead there are no autopsies no physical crime scenes you deal with the murder booksif you can find themand the records when you go to the familyand believe me you dont go until you are good and readyyou find people who have already suffered the shock and found or not found ways to get past it it wears on you i hope you are prepared for that thanks for the warning bosch said with fresh kills it is clinical because things move fast with old cases it is emotional you are going to see the toll of violence over time be prepared for it pratt pulled a thick blue binder from the side of his desk to the center of his calendar blotter he started to push it across to them then stopped another thing to be prepared for is the department count on files being incomplete or even missing count on physical evidence being destroyed or disappeared count on starting from scratch with some of these this unit was put together two years ago we spent the first eight months just going through the case logs and pulling out openunsolveds we fed what we could into the forensics pipelines but even when weve gotten a hit we have been handicapped by the lack of case integrity it has been abysmal it has been frustrating even though there is no statute of limitations on murder we are finding that evidence and even files were routinely disposed of during at least one administration what i am saying is that you are going to find that your biggest obstacle on some of these cases may very well be the department itself somebody said we have a cold hit that came out of one of our time blocks bosch said hed heard enough he just wanted to get moving on something yes you do pratt said well get to that in a second let me just finish up with my little speech after all i dont get to make it that often in a nutshell what we try to do here is apply new technology and techniques to old cases the technology is essentially threefold you have dna fingerprints and ballistics in all three areas the advancements in comparative analysis have been phenomenal in the last ten years the problem with this department is that it never took any of these advances and looked backward at old cases consequently we have an estimated two thousand cases in which there is dna evidence that has never been typed and compared since nineteen sixty we have four thousand cases with fingerprints that have never been run through a computer ours the fbis dojs anybodys computer its almost laughable but its too fucking sad to laugh about same with ballistics we are finding the evidence is still there in most of these cases but it has been ignored bosch shook his head already feeling the frustration of all the families of the victims the cases swept away by time indifference and incompetence you will also find that techniques are different todays homicide copper is just plain better than one from say nineteen sixty or seventy even nineteen eighty so even before you get to the physical evidence and you review these cases you are going to see things that seem obvious to you now but that werent obvious to anyone back at the time of the kill pratt nodded his speech was finished now the cold hit he said pushing the faded blue murder book across the desk run with that baby its all yours close it down and put somebody in jail after leaving pratts office they decided that bosch would go get the next round of coffee while rider started in on the murder book they knew from prior experience that she was the faster reader and it didnt make sense to split the book up they both needed to read it front to back to have the investigation presented to them in the linear fashion in which it occurred and was documented bosch said he would give her a good head start he told her he might drink a cup in the cafeteria just because he missed the place the place not the coffee then i guess that gives me a few minutes to go down the hall she said after she left the office for the restroom bosch took the page listing the years that were assigned to them and put it into the inside pocket of his jacket he left and took the elevator down to the third floor he then walked through the main rhd squad room to the captains office the captains office suite was broken into two rooms one room was his actual office and the other was called the murder room it was furnished with a long meeting table where murder investigations were discussed and its walls on two sides were lined with shelves containing legal books and the citys murder logs every homicide that had occurred in los angeles going back more than one hundred years had a listing in these leatherbound journals the routine over the decades was to update the journals every time one of the murders was cleared it was the easy reference in the department for determining what cases were still open or had been closed bosch ran his finger along the cracked spines of the books each one simply said homicides followed by the listing of the years the book recorded several years fit into each of the early books but by the s there were so many murders committed in the city that each book contained the accounts of only one year he then noted that the year was reported in two books and he suddenly had a very good idea why that year had been assigned to him and rider as the new members of the openunsolved unit the high point for murders in the city would certainly also mean the high point for unsolved cases when his finger found the book containing cases from he pulled the tome out and sat down with it at the table he leafed through it skimming the stories hearing the voices he found the old lady who was drowned in her bathtub it was never solved he moved on through and then he went through the book containing and he read about charles manson and robert kennedy he read about people whose names he had never heard or known names that were taken away from them along with everything else theyd had or would ever have as he read through the catalogs of the citys horrors bosch felt a familiar power begin to take hold of him and move in his veins again only an hour back on the job and he was already chasing a killer it didnt matter how long ago the blood had fallen there was a killer in the wind and bosch was coming like the prodigal son returning he knew he was back in his place now he was baptized again in the waters of the one true church the church of the blue religion and he knew that he would find his salvation in those who were long lost that he would find it in these musty bibles where the dead lined up in columns and there were ghosts on every page harry bosch jarred by the intrusion bosch slammed the book closed and looked up captain gabe norona was standing in the doorway of the inner office captain welcome back he came forward and vigorously shook boschs hand good to be back i see they already have you doin your homework bosch nodded just sort of getting acquainted with it new hope for the dead harry bosch is on the case again bosch didnt say anything he didnt know if the captain was being sarcastic or not its the name of a book i read once norona said oh well good luck to you get out there and lock em up thats the plan the captain shook his hand again and then disappeared back into his office and closed the door his sacred moment ruined by the intrusion bosch stood up he started returning the heavy murder catalogs to their places on the shelves when he was finished he left the office for the cafeteria kiz rider was almost halfway through the murder book when bosch got back with the fresh round of coffees she took her cup directly out of his hand thanks i need something to keep me awake what youre going to sit there and tell me that this is boring compared to pushing paper in the chiefs office no its not that its just all the catching up the reading weve got to know this book inside and out weve got to be alert for the possibilities bosch noticed she had a legal tablet next to the murder book and the top page was almost full of notes he couldnt read the notes but could see that most of the lines were followed by question marks besides she added im using different muscles now muscles i didnt use on the sixth floor i get it he said all right if i start in behind you now be my guest she popped open the rings of the binder and pulled out the twoinchthick sheaf of documents she had already read through she handed them across to bosch who had sat down at his desk you got an extra pad like that he asked i just have a little notebook she sighed in an exaggerated way bosch knew it was all an act and that she was happy they were working together again she had spent most of the last two years evaluating policy and troubleshooting for the new chief it wasnt the real cop work that she was best at this was she slid a pad across the desk to him you need a pen too no i think i can handle that he put the documents down in front of him and started reading he was ready to go and he didnt need the coffee to stay charged the first page of the murder book was a color photograph in a plastic threehole sleeve the photo was a yearbook portrait of an exotically attractive young girl with almondshaped eyes that were startling green against her mocha skin she had tightly curled brown hair with what looked like natural blonde highlights that caught the flash of the camera her eyes were bright and her smile genuine it was a grin that said she knew things nobody else did bosch didnt think she was beautiful not yet her features seemed to compete with one another in an uncoordinated way but he knew that teenage awkwardness often smoothed over and became beauty later but for sixteenyearold rebecca verloren there would be no later nineteen eightyeight would be her last year the cold hit had come from her murder becky as she was known by family and friends was the only child of robert and muriel verloren muriel was a homemaker robert was the chef and owner of a popular malibu restaurant called the island house grill they lived on red mesa way off of santa susana pass road in chatsworth at the northwest corner of the sprawl that made up los angeles the backyard of their house was the wooded incline of oat mountain which rose above chatsworth and served as the northwest border of the city that summer becky was between her sophomore and junior years at hillside preparatory school it was a private school in nearby porter ranch where she was on the honor roll and her mother volunteered in the cafeteria and often brought jerk chicken and other specialties from her husbands restaurant for the faculty lunchroom on the morning of july the verlorens discovered their daughter missing from their home they found the back door unlocked though they were sure it had been secured the night before thinking the girl might have gone for a walk they waited worriedly for two hours but she did not return that day she was scheduled to go to the restaurant with her father to work the lunch shift as an assistant hostess and it was well past the time to leave for malibu while her mother called her friends hoping to locate her her father went up the hillside behind the house looking for her when he came back down the hill without finding a sign of her they decided it was time to call the police patrol officers from the devonshire division were called to the home they found no evidence of a breakin at the house citing this and the fact that the girl was in an age group with one of the highest runaway rates the disappearance was viewed as a possible runaway situation and handled as a routine missingpersons case this was against the protests of the missing girls parents who did not believe she had run away or left their home of her own volition the parents were proved horribly correct two days later when the decomposing body of becky verloren was found hidden beside the fallen trunk of an oak tree about ten yards off an equestrian trail on oat mountain a woman riding her appaloosa had gone off the path to investigate a bad smell and came across the body the rider might have ignored the odor but had earlier seen signs posted on telephone poles about the missing girl from the area becky verloren had died less than a quarter mile from her house it was likely that her father had passed within yards or even feet of her body when he was hiking the hillside and calling out her name but on that morning there had been no odor yet to draw his attention bosch was the father of a young girl though she lived far away from him with her mother she was never far from his thoughts he thought now of a father climbing a steep hillside calling for a daughter who would never come home he tried to concentrate on the murder book the victim had been shot once in the chest by a highpowered pistol the weapon a caliber colt semiautomatic was lying in the leaves by her left ankle as bosch studied the crime scene photos he saw what appeared to be a burn from a contact shot on the fabric of her light blue nightgown the bullet hole was located directly above the heart and bosch knew by the size of the gun and the entry wound that death was likely immediate her heart would have been shattered by the round as it blasted through her body for a long time bosch studied the photographs of the body as it had been found the victims hands were not bound she was not gagged her face was turned in toward the trunk of the fallen tree there were no indications of defensive wounds of any nature there was no indication of sexual molestation or any other assault the police misinterpretation of the girls disappearance was initially compounded by the misinterpretation of the death scene the assessment at the scene resulted in the death being viewed as a probable suicide as such the case was kept by the local divisions homicide squad and the two detectives who rolled on the body call ron green and arturo garcia devonshire division was at that time and still is the lapds quietest station representing a large bedroom community with high property values and mostly uppermiddleclass residents devonshire always had crime tables that were among the lowest in the city inside the department the station was known as club dev it was a highly soughtafter posting by officers and detectives who had put in many years and were tired or had simply seen enough action devonshire division also represented the part of the city closest to simi valley a quiet relatively crimefree community in ventura county where hundreds of lapd officers chose to live a posting at devonshire made the commute a breeze and the workload the lightest in the department the club dev pedigree played in the back of boschs mind as he read the reports he knew part of his task here was to make a judgment on green and garcias work to determine if they had been up to the task he did not know them and had no experience with them he had no idea what level of skills and dedication they had brought to the case there was the initial misinterpretation of the death as a suicide but by the appearance of the records the two investigators seemed to recover quickly and move on with the case their reports seemed to be well written thorough and complete they seemed to have taken the extra step wherever possible still bosch knew that a murder book could be manipulated to give this impression the truth would be revealed as he delved deeper and continued his own investigation he knew there could be a vast difference between what was recorded and what was not according to the murder book green and garcia quickly reversed investigative directions when suicide was dismissed after the autopsy was completed and the gun found with the body was analyzed the case was reclassified as a homicide that had been disguised as a suicide bosch first came to the autopsy findings in the murder book he had read a thousand autopsy protocols and had attended several hundred of the procedures as well he knew to skip all the weights and measurements and descriptions of the actual procedure and go right to the summary section and the attendant photographs unsurprisingly he found the cause of death listed as a gunshot wound to the chest the estimated time of death was between midnight and am on july the summary noted that no witness reported hearing the shot so the time of death estimate was based solely on measuring loss of body temperature the surprises were in the other findings rebecca verloren had long thick hair at the right side of the base of her neck beneath the fall of her hair the medical examiner found a small circular burn mark that was about the size of a button off an oxford shirt two inches from this mark was another burn mark much smaller than the first high white cell counts in the blood surrounding these wounds indicated that both had been sustained close to but not at the time of death the report concluded that the burns were caused by a stun gun a handheld device that emits a powerful electric charge and renders its victims unconscious or incapacitated for several minutes or longer depending on the charge normally a charge from a stun gun would leave two small and almost unnoticeable marks on the skin indicating the location of the twin contacts but if the contact points of the device were held unevenly against the skin the electric charge would arc and often burn the skin in the manner seen on becky verlorens neck the autopsy summary also noted that an examination of the victims bare feet found no soil deposits or cuts or bruises which would be evident had the girl walked barefoot up the mountainside in the dark bosch drummed his pen on the report and thought about this he knew this was a mistake made by green and garcia the victims feet should have been examined at the scene and they should have made the jump right then to the idea that the suicide was a setup instead they missed it and they lost two days waiting for the autopsy on a weekend those days plus the two days lost when patrol wrote the parents call off as a runaway case added up to a bad number in a murder investigation there was no doubt that the case was slow out of the blocks bosch was beginning to see how badly the department had let rebecca verloren down the autopsy report also contained the results of a gunshot residue test conducted on the victims hands while gsr was found on becky verlorens right hand there was no indication of it on her left even though verloren was righthanded bosch knew that the gsr test was an indicator that she had not actually fired the gun that killed her experienceno matter how limitedand common sense would have told the investigators that the girl would have needed to use both hands to properly hold the heavy gun pointed against her own chest and to pull the trigger the result would have been gsr on both her hands there was one more notable point in the autopsy summary the examination of the body determined that the victim had been sexually active and scarring on the walls of the uterus was indicative of a recent gynecological dilation and curettage procedure to eliminate a pregnancy the deputy coroner who conducted the autopsy estimated that this had occurred four to six weeks prior to her death bosch read the first investigators summary report which was written and added to the book after the autopsy green and garcia had now classified the death as a murder and established the theory that someone had entered the girls bedroom while she was sleeping incapacitated her with a stun gun and then carried her from the room and the house she was carried up the mountainside to the location by the fallen oak tree where the murder was committed and clumsily disguised as a suicide in what was possibly a spurofthemoment decision by her killer the report was filed monday july five days after rebecca verloren had been left dead on the hillside bosch moved on to the firearm analysis report though the autopsy had produced more than convincing evidence of staged suicide the study of the gun and the attendant ballistics further confirmed the investigative theory the gun was found to be devoid of fingerprints except for those from becky verlorens right hand the fact that there were no prints from her left hand or smudges of any kind on the pistol indicated to the investigators that the weapon had been carefully wiped clean of prints before being placed and held in beckys hand then turned toward her chest and fired it was likely that the victim was unconsciousfrom the stun gun assaultat the time this manipulation occurred the bullet casing ejected from the pistol when the fatal shot was fired was recovered six feet from the body there were no fingerprints or smudges on it an indication that the weapon had been loaded with gloved hands the investigations single most important piece of evidence was recovered during the analysis of the gun itself it was actually found inside the gun the weapon was the mark iv series model manufactured by colt in two years before the murder it featured a long hammer spur which was notable because the gun had a reputation for leaving a tattoo injury on the shooter if the weapon was not handled properly while firing this usually occurred when a twohanded grip on the weapon pushed the primary shooting hand up high on the grip and too close to the hammer spur the primary hand could then receive a painful stamp when the trigger was pulled the weapon fired and the slide automatically came backward to eject the bullet casing as the slide returned to firing position it would pinch the skin of the shooters handusually the webbing between the thumb and forefinger often taking a piece of skin back with it inside the gun all of this occurred in a fraction of a second the novice shooter often not even knowing what had bitten him that was exactly what had happened with the gun used to kill becky verloren when a firearms expert broke open the weapon he found a small piece of skin tissue and dried blood on the underside of the slide it would not have been noticeable to someone examining the exterior of the gun or wiping it clean of blood and fingerprints green and garcia added this to their investigative theory in the second investigators summary report they wrote that evidence indicated that the killer wrapped becky verlorens hand around the gun and then pressed the muzzle to her chest the killer used one or both of his own hands to steady the weapon and push or pull her finger over the trigger the gun fired and the slide tattooed the killer taking a piece of his skin with it inside the gun bosch noted to himself that green and garcia made no mention of another possibility in their investigative theory that being that the tissue and the blood found inside the weapon was already there on the night of the murder that the weapon had tattooed someone other than the killer when it was fired at some point before the killing regardless of that potential oversight the blood and tissue was collected from the weapon and while it was already known from the autopsy that becky verloren had no wounds on her hands a routine blood comparison test was conducted the blood collected from the gun was type o becky verlorens blood was type ab positive the investigators concluded they had the killers blood on the weapon the killer was blood type o but in the use of dna comparison in criminal investigation was still years away from common and more important courtaccepted practice in california databases containing the dna profiles of criminal offenders were only on the verge of being funded and created during the course of the investigation the detectives were left to compare blood type only to potential suspects as they arose and no one emerged as a primary suspect in the verloren killing the case was worked hard and long but ultimately without an arrest ever being made and it went cold until now bosch said out loud without realizing it what rider asked nothing just thinking out loud you want to start talking about it not yet i want to finish reading first youre done just about you know who we have to thank for this dont you bosch asked she looked at him quizzically i give up mel gibson what are you talking about when did lethal weapon come out right around this time right i guess but what are you talking about those movies were so farfetched thats my point thats the movie that started all of this holding the gun sideways and with two hands one over the other we got blood on this gun because the shooter was a lethal weapon fan rider shook her head dismissively you watch bosch said im going to ask the guy when we bring him in okay harry you ask him mel gibson saved a lot of lives all those sideways shooters they couldnt hit shit we ought to make him like an honorary cop or something okay harry im going to go back to reading okay i want to get through this yeah okay me too shortly after the lapds openunsolved unit began operation the dna evidence from the verloren case was forwarded to the california department of justice it was delivered to the dna lab along with evidence from dozens of other cases drawn from the units initial survey of the departments unsolved murders the doj operated the states primary dna database the backlog of comparison requests to the underfunded and undermanned lab was running more than a year at the time but thanks to the tide of requests from the new lapd unit it took almost eighteen months before the verloren evidence was retyped by doj analysts and compared to thousands of dna profiles in the state data bank it produced a single match a cold hit in the parlance of dna work bosch looked at the singlepage doj report unfolded in front of him it stated that twelve of a possible fourteen markers matched the dna from the weapon used to murder rebecca verloren to a now thirtyfiveyearold man named roland mackey he was a native of los angeles whose last known address was in panorama city bosch felt his blood start moving a little faster as he read the cold hit report panorama city was in the san fernando valley not more than fifteen minutes from chatsworth even in bad traffic it added a level of credibility to the match it was not that bosch didnt believe the science he did but he also believed you needed more than the science to convince a jury beyond a doubt you needed to bolster the scientific fact with connections of circumstantial evidence and common sense this was one of those connections bosch noticed the date on the cover letter of the doj report you said we just got this he asked rider yeah i think it came in friday why the date on it is from two fridays ago ten days rider shrugged bureaucracy she said i guess it took its time getting down here from sacramento i know the case is old but youd think theyd move a little faster than that rider didnt respond bosch dropped it and read on mackeys dna was in the doj computer base because all offenders convicted of any sexrelated crime in california were forced under state law to submit blood and oral swabs for typing and inclusion in the dna data bank the offense that resulted in mackeys dna going into the bank was on the far margin of the state mandate two years earlier mackey was convicted of lewd behavior in los angeles the doj report did not offer details of the crime but stated mackey was placed on twelve months probation an indication that his was a minor offense bosch was about to write a note on his pad when he looked up and saw rider closing the murder book on the second half of the documents done done now what i figured that while you were finishing the book id go over to the esb and pick up the box bosch had no trouble remembering the meaning of what she said he had slipped easily back into the world of acronyms and copspeak the esb was the evidence storage building over at the piper tech compound she would go there to pick up the physical evidence that would have been stored from the case items like the murder weapon the victims clothing and anything else accumulated while the case was initially worked it was usually stored in a taped cardboard box and put on a shelf the exception to this was storage of perishable and biological evidencesuch as the blood and tissue recovered from the verloren murder weaponwhich was stored in lab vaults in the scientific investigation division sounds like a good idea bosch said but first why dont you run this guy through dmv and ncic and see if we can get a location already did that she turned her laptop around on her desk so bosch could see the screen he recognized the national crime index computer template on the screen he reached across and started scrolling down the screen his eyes scanning the information rider had run roland mackey through ncic and gotten his criminal record his conviction two years earlier for lewd behavior was only the latest in a string of recorded arrests dating back to when he was eighteenthe same year as rebecca verlorens murder anything prior would not be listed because juvenile protection laws shielded that part of his record most of the crimes listed were property and drugrelated crimes beginning with car theft and a burglary at eighteen and leading to two drugpossession raps two driving under the influence arrests another burglary charge and a receiving stolen property hit there was also an early solicitation of prostitution arrest overall it was the pedigree of a smalltime criminal and drug user it appeared that mackey never went to state prison for any of his crimes he was often given second chances and then through plea agreements was sentenced to probation or to short stints in county jail it appeared that the longest he ever stayed in stir was six months served after pleading guilty to receiving stolen property when he was twentyeight years old he served his time at the countyrun wayside honor rancho bosch leaned back after he was finished scrolling through the computer records he felt uneasy about what he had just read mackey had the kind of record that might be seen as a pathway to murder but in this case the murder came firstwhen mackey was only eighteen years oldand the petty crimes came after it didnt seem to quite fit what rider asked sensing his mood i dont know i thought thered be more i guess its backwards this guy goes from murder to petty crime doesnt seem to hold well this is all hes ever gotten popped for doesnt mean its all he ever did he nodded juvenile he asked maybe probably but well never get those records now theyre probably long gone it was true the state went out of its way to protect the privacy of juvenile offenders crimes rarely tailed offenders into the adult justice system nevertheless bosch thought that there had to be childhood crimes that would fit better with the seemingly coldblooded murder of a sixteenyearold girl who had been incapacitated with a stun gun and abducted from her home bosch began to have an uneasy feeling about the cold hit they were working he was beginning to sense that mackey was not the target he was a means to the target did you run him through dmv for an address he asked harry thats oldschool you only have to update your drivers license every four years you want to find somebody you go to autotrack she opened the murder book and slid a loose piece of paper across to him it was a computer printout that said autotrack at the top rider said it was a private company the police department contracted with it provided computer searches of all public records including dmv public utility and cable service databases as well as private databases such as credit reporting services to determine an individuals past and current addresses bosch saw that the printout contained a listing of roland mackeys various addresses dating back to when he was eighteen his current listing on all current data including drivers license and car registration was the address in panorama city but on the page rider had circled the address ascribed to mackey when he was eighteen through twenty years oldthe years through it was an apartment on topanga canyon boulevard in chatsworth this meant that at the time of the murder mackey was living very close to rebecca verlorens home this made bosch feel a little better about things proximity was a key piece to the puzzle boschs misgivings over mackeys criminal pedigree aside knowing that he was in the immediate vicinity in and therefore could have seen or even known rebecca verloren was a large check mark in the positive column make you feel any better harry a little bit good im going then ill be here after rider left bosch jumped back into his review of the murder book the third investigators summary focused on how the intruder got into the house the door and window locks showed no signs of having been compromised and all known keys to the home were accounted for among family members and a housekeeper who was cleared of any suspicion the investigators theorized that the killer came in through the garage which had been left open and then entered the house through the connecting door which was usually not locked until after robert verloren came home from work at night according to robert verloren the garage was open when he came home from his restaurant about tenthirty on the night of july fifth the connecting door from the garage into the house was unlocked he entered his home closed the garage and locked the connecting door the investigators theorized that by then the killer was already in the house the verlorens explanation for the open garage was that their daughter had recently received her drivers license and was on occasion allowed to use her mothers car however she had not yet acquired the habit of remembering to close the garage door upon leaving or coming home and had been chastised by her parents on more than one occasion for this late in the afternoon before her abduction rebecca was sent on an errand by her mother to pick up dry cleaning she used her mothers car the investigators confirmed that she picked up the clothing at pm and then returned home it was believed by the investigators that she once again forgot to close the garage or lock the connecting door after returning her mother said she never checked the garage that night assuming wrongly that it was closed two residents in the neighborhood canvassed after the murder reported seeing the garage door open that evening this left the house easily accessible until robert verloren came home bosch thought about how many times over the years he had seen someones seemingly innocent mistake turn into one of the keys to their own doom a routine chore to pick up clothes may have led to the opportunity for a killer to get inside the house becky verloren may have unwittingly engineered her own death bosch pushed his chair back and stood up he had finished the review of the first half of the murder book he decided to get another cup of coffee before taking on the second half he asked around in the office if anybody needed anything from the cafeteria and got one order for coffee from jean nord he took the stairs down to the cafeteria and filled two cups from the urn then paid for them and went over to the condiments counter to get nords cream and sugar while he was pouring a shot of cream into one of the cups he felt a presence next to him at the counter he made room at the station but no one reached for any condiments he turned toward the presence and found himself looking at the smiling face of deputy chief irvin s irving there had never been any love lost between bosch and deputy chief irving the chief had at various times been his adversary and unwitting savior in the department but bosch had heard from rider that irving was on the outs now he had been unceremoniously pushed out of power by the new chief and given a virtually meaningless posting and assignment outside of parker center i thought that was you detective bosch id buy you a cup of coffee but i see you already have more than enough would you like to sit down for a minute anyway bosch held up both cups of coffee im kind of in the middle of something chief and somebodys waiting for one of these one minute detective irving said a stern tone entering his voice the coffee will still be hot when you get to where you have to go i promise without waiting for an answer he turned and walked to a nearby table bosch followed irving still had a shaved and gleaming skull his muscular jaw was his most prominent feature he took a seat and held his posture ramrod straight he didnt look comfortable he didnt speak until bosch sat down the pleasant tone was back in his voice all i wanted to do was welcome you back to the department he said he smiled like a shark bosch hesitated like a man stepping across a trapdoor before answering its good to be back chief the openunsolved unit i think that is the appropriate place for someone of your skills bosch took a sip from his scalding cup of coffee he didnt know if irving had just complimented or insulted him he wanted to leave well well see he said i hope so i think i better irving held his hands out wide as if to show he wasnt hiding anything thats it he said you can go i just wanted to say welcome back and to thank you bosch hesitated but then bit thank me for what chief for resurrecting me in this department bosch shook his head and smiled as if he didnt understand i dont get it chief he said how am i supposed to do that i mean youre across the street in the city hall annex now right what is it the office of strategic planning or something from what i hear you get to leave your gun at home irving folded his arms on the table and leaned in close to bosch all pretense of humor false or otherwise evaporated he spoke strongly but quietly yes that is where i am but i guarantee you that it will not be for long not with the likes of you being welcomed back into the department he then leaned back and just as quickly adopted a casual manner for what he delivered as casual conversation you know what you are bosch you are a retread this new chief likes putting retreads on the car but you know what happens with a retread it comes apart at the seams the friction and the heattheyre too much for it it comes apart and what happens a blowout and then the car goes off the road he nodded silently as he let bosch think about that you see bosch you are my ticket you will fuck upif you will excuse my language it is in your history it is in your nature it is guaranteed and when you fuck up our illustrious new chief fucks up for being the one who put a cheap retread on our car he smiled bosch thought that all he needed was a gold earring to complete the picture mr clean all the way and when he goes down my stock goes right back up im a patient man ive waited for over forty years in this department i can wait longer bosch expected more but that was it irving nodded once and stood up he quickly turned and headed out of the cafeteria bosch felt the anger rise in his throat he looked down at the two cups of coffee in his hands and felt like an idiot for having sat there like a defenseless errand boy while irving had verbally punched him out he got up and threw both cups into a trash can he decided that when he got back to room he would tell jean nord to get her own damn coffee with the unease of the irving confrontation still lingering bosch took the second half of the murder book over to his desk and sat down he thought the best way to forget about the threat that irving posed was to immerse himself in the case again what he found left in the file was a thick sheaf of ancillary reports and updates the things investigators always lumped into the back of the book the reports that bosch called the tumblers because they often seemed disparate but nevertheless could unlock a case when seen from the right angle or put together in the right pattern first was a lab report stating that testing was unable to determine exactly how long the blood and tissue sample taken from the murder weapon could have been in the gun the report said that while most of the sample was preserved for comparison purposes an examination of selected blood cells indicated decomposition was not extensive the criminalist who wrote the report could not say the blood was deposited on the gun at the time of the killingno one could but he would be prepared to testify that the blood was deposited on the gun close to or at the time of the killing bosch knew this was a key report in terms of mounting a prosecution of roland mackey it might also give mackey the opportunity to build a defense around having had possession of the gun before the murder but not at the time of the murder it would be a risky move to admit being in possession of the murder weapon but the dna match dictated that it was a move he would likely have to make with the science unable to pinpoint exactly when the deposit of blood and tissue on the gun occurred bosch saw a gaping hole in the prosecutions case the defense could clearly jump through it again he felt the certainty of the cold hit dna match slipping away science gives and takes at the same time they needed more next in the murder book was a report from the firearms unit which had been assigned the ownership trace of the murder weapon the serial number on the colt had been filed down but the number was raised in the lab with the application of an acid which accentuated the compressions in the metal where the number had been stamped during manufacture the number was traced to a gun purchased from the manufacturer in by a northridge gun shop it was then traced through its sale that year to a man who lived in chatsworth on winnetka avenue the gun had then been reported stolen by the owner when his home was burglarized june just a month before it was used in the murder of rebecca verloren this report helped their case somewhat because unless mackey had a relationship with the guns original owner the burglary compressed the time period during which mackey would have had possession of the gun it made it more likely that he had the gun on the night becky verloren was taken from her home and murdered the original burglary report was contained in the file the victim was named sam weiss he lived alone and worked as a sound technician at warner bros in burbank bosch scanned the report and found only one other note of interest in the investigating officers comments section it was stated that the burglary victim had recently purchased the gun for protection after being harassed by anonymous phone calls in which the caller threatened him because he was jewish the victim reported that he did not know how his unlisted number fell into the hands of his harasser and he did not know what had brought on the threats bosch quickly read through the next report from the firearms unit which identified the stun gun used in the abduction the report said the inch span between contact pointsas exhibited by the burn marks on the victims fleshwas unique to the professional model manufactured by a company called safetycharge in downey the model was sold over the counter and through mail order and there were more than twelve thousand professional models distributed at the time of the murder bosch knew that without the actual device in hand there was no way to connect the marks on becky verlorens body with an ownership trail that was a dead end he moved on leafing through a series of x photos taken in the verloren house after the body was found up on the hillside behind it bosch knew these were coveryourass photos the case had been handledor mishandledas a runaway situation the department did not go full field with it until after the body was found and an autopsy concluded the death was a homicide five days after the girl was reported missing the police came back and turned the house into a crime scene the question was what was lost in those five days the photos included interior and exterior shots of all three doors to the housefront back garageand several closeups of window locks there was also a series of shots taken in becky verlorens bedroom the first thing bosch noticed was that the bed was made he wondered if the abductor had made it thereby further selling the suicide or beckys mother had simply made the bed at some point during the days she hoped and waited for her daughter to come home the bed was a fourposter with a whiteandpink spread with cats on it and a matching pink ruffle the bedspread reminded bosch of the one that had covered his own daughters bed it seemed to be something that a child much younger than sixteen would like and he wondered if becky verloren had kept it for nostalgic reasons or as some sort of psychological security blanket the beds ruffle did not uniformly skirt the floor it was a couple inches too long and so it bunched on the floor and alternately fluffed out or tucked under the bed too far there were photos of her bureau and bed tables the room was festooned with stuffed animals from her younger years there were posters on the walls from music groups that had come and gone there was a poster of a john travolta movie three comebacks old the room was very neat and orderly and again bosch wondered if this was how it had been on the morning rebecca verloren was discovered missing or if her mother had straightened the room while awaiting her daughters return bosch knew the photos had to have been taken as the first step of the crime scene investigation nowhere did he see any fingerprint powder or any other indication of the upset that would come with the intrusion of the criminalists the photos were followed in the murder book by a packet of summaries from interviews the detectives conducted with numerous students at hillside prep a checklist on the top page indicated that the investigators had talked to every student in becky verlorens class and every boy who attended the upper grades of the school there were also summaries from interviews of several of the victims teachers and school administrators included in this section was a summary of a phone interview conducted with a former boyfriend of becky verlorens who had moved with his family to hawaii the year before her murder attached to the summary was an alibi confirmation report stating that the teenagers supervisor had confirmed that the boy had worked in the car wash and detail facility at a maui rentacar franchise on the days of and after the murder making it unlikely that he could have been in los angeles to kill her there was a separate packet of summaries of interviews with employees of the island house grill the restaurant owned by robert verloren his daughter had just started a parttime summer job at the restaurant she was an assistant hostess during lunch her job was to lead customers to their tables and to put down the menus though bosch knew restaurants often drew a variety of drifters to the lowlevel kitchen jobs robert verloren avoided hiring men with criminal records instead drawing on the population of surfers and other free spirits who flocked to the beaches of malibu these people would have had limited contact with rebecca who worked in the dining room but they were interviewed just the same and seemingly dismissed by the investigators there was also a victims chronology in which the investigators outlined rebecca verlorens movements in the days leading up to her murder in july fourth fell on a monday rebecca spent most of the holiday weekend at home except for a sundaynight sleepover with three girlfriends at one of their houses the attached summaries of interviews with these three girls were long but contained no information of investigative value on monday the holiday she stayed home until she and her parents went to balboa park to watch a fireworks display it was a rare night off for robert verloren and he insisted that the family stay together much to beckys reported upset at missing out on a friends party in the porter ranch area on tuesday the summer routine began again with rebecca going to the restaurant with her father to work the lunch shift as a hostess at three oclock her father drove her home he stayed at home through the afternoon and then headed back to the restaurant for the dinner shift at about the same time rebecca used her mothers car to run the errand of collecting the dry cleaning bosch saw nothing in the schedule that raised suspicions nothing that was missed by the original investigators he next came to a transcript of a formal interview with the parents it was taken at devonshire division on july more than a week after their daughter was discovered missing by this point the detectives had accumulated a lot of case knowledge and were specific with their questions bosch carefully read this transcript as much for the answers as for the insight it would give to the investigators view of the case at that point case no verloren rebecca dod io a garcia pm devonshire homicide garcia thank you for coming in i hope you dont mind but we are recording this so we will have a record how are you managing robt verloren about as well as expected were devastated we dont know what to do muriel verloren we keep thinking what could we have done to prevent this from happening to our little girl green were truly sorry maam but you cant blame yourself for this as far as we can tell it was nothing you did or didnt do it just happened dont blame yourself blame the person who did this garcia and we are going to get him you dont have to worry about that now we have some questions we need to ask some of these might be painful but we need the answers if we are going to get this guy robt verloren you keep saying guy is there a suspect do you know it was a man garcia we dont know anything for sure sir were mostly going with the percentages there but also you have that steep hill behind your house becky was definitely carried up that hill she wasnt a big girl but we definitely think it would have to be a man muriel verloren but you said she wasnt that there was no sexual assault garcia that is true maam but that does not preclude this from being a sexually motivated or related crime robt verloren how do you mean garcia we will get to that sir if you dont mind let us ask our questions and then we will get to your questions if you would like robt verloren go ahead please im sorry its just that we cannot understand what has happened its like we are underwater all the time garcia that is completely understandable as i said you have our deepest sympathy from the department too we have the upper echelon of this department watching over this case very closely green we would like to start by going back before her disappearance maybe a month before did your daughter go away at all during that time robt verloren what do you mean away garcia was she away from you at any time robt verloren no she was sixteen she was in school she didnt go away on her own green what about a sleepover with her friends muriel verloren no i dont think so robt verloren what are you looking for green was she sick at all in the month or two prior to the disappearance muriel verloren yes she had the flu the first week after school ended it delayed her going to work for bob green was she in bed sick muriel verloren a lot of the time i dont see what this has to garcia mrs verloren did your daughter go to see a doctor at this time muriel verloren no she just said she had to rest to tell you the truth we thought she just didnt want to go to work in the restaurant she didnt have a fever or a cold we just thought she was being lazy green she didnt confide in you at this time that she had been pregnant muriel verloren what no robt verloren look detective what are you telling us green the autopsy revealed that becky had had a procedure called a dilation and curettage about a month before her death an abortion our guess is that she was resting and recovering from this procedure when she told you she had the flu garcia would you two like to take a break here green why dont we take a break well step out and get all of us some water break garcia okay were back i hope you understand and forgive us we do not ask questions or attempt to shock you to hurt you we need to follow procedure and employ methods that allow us to collect information that is unfettered by preconceived perceptions robt verloren we understand what you are doing its part of our life now whats left of it muriel verloren you are saying our daughter was pregnant and chose to get an abortion garcia yes thats right and we think there is a possibility that it could have a bearing on what happened to her a month later do you have any idea where she would have gone for this procedure muriel verloren no i had no idea about this neither of us green and as you said before she did not go away overnight during that time muriel verloren no she was home every night garcia any idea who the relationship could have been with in our earlier talks you said she had no current boyfriend muriel verloren well obviously i guess we were wrong about that but no we dont know who she was seeing or who could have done this green have either of you ever read the journal that your daughter kept robt verloren no we didnt even know there was a journal until you found it in her room muriel verloren i would like to get that back will i get that back green we will need to keep it through the investigation but you will eventually get it back garcia there are several references in the journal to an individual referred to as mtl this is a person we would like to identify and talk to muriel verloren i dont know anyone with those initials offhand green we looked at the schools yearbook there is one boy named michael lewis but we checked and his middle name is charles we think the initials were a code or an abbreviation it could stand for my true love muriel verloren so there was obviously someone we didnt know about that she kept from us robt verloren i cant believe this you two are telling us we didnt really know our little girl garcia im sorry bob sometimes the damage from a case like this goes deep but its our job to follow it where it goes this is the current we are in right now green basically we need to pursue this aspect of the investigation and find out who mtl is which means we need to ask questions of your daughters friends and acquaintances word about this it will get around im afraid robt verloren we understand this detective we will deal with it as we said on the day we met do what you have to do find the person who did this garcia thank you sir we will end of interview pm bosch read the transcript a second time this time writing down notes on his pad as he went he then moved on to three more formal interview transcripts these were conducted with becky verlorens three closest friends tara wood bailey koster and grace tanaka but none of the girlsgirls at the timesaid they had knowledge of beckys pregnancy or the secret relationship that produced it all three said they did not see her the week after school got out because she was not answering her phone and when they called the houses main number muriel verloren told them her daughter was sick tara wood who was splitting a work schedule as a hostess at the island house grill with becky said that her friend was moody and incommunicative in the weeks prior to her murder but the reason for this was unknown because she rebuffed woods efforts to find out what was wrong the last entry in the murder book was the media file it was where garcia and green kept the newspaper stories that accumulated in the early stages of the case the crime played bigger in the daily news than in the times this was understandable because the news circulated primarily in the san fernando valley and the times usually treated the valley as an unwanted stepchild relegating the news emanating from its environs to the inside pages there was no coverage of becky verlorens initial disappearance the newspapers had obviously viewed it in the same way as the police had but once the body was found there were several stories on the investigation the funeral and the impact the young girls death had at her school there was even a mood piece set at the island house grill this story had been in the times and had apparently been a stab at making the case meaningful to the papers westside circulation base a restaurant in malibu was something the westsiders could relate to both newspapers linked the murder weapon to a burglary that occurred a month before the killing but neither had the antisemitic angle neither reported on the blood evidence recovered from the weapon either bosch guessed that the blood and tissue recovery was the investigators ace in the hole the one piece of evidence held close to the vest to give them the advantage if a prime suspect was ever identified finally bosch noticed that there were no media interviews with the grieving parents the verlorens apparently chose not to hold their loss out for public consumption bosch liked that about them it seemed to him that increasingly the media forced the victims of tragedy to grieve in public in front of cameras and in newspaper stories parents of murdered children became talking heads who appeared on the tube as experts the next time there was another child murdered and another set of parents grieving it all didnt sit well with bosch it seemed to him that the best way to honor the dead was to keep them close to the heart not to share them with the world across the electronic spectrum at the back of the murder book there was a pocket containing a manila envelope with the timess eagle insignia and address in the corner bosch pulled it out and opened it and found a series of x color photos taken at rebecca verlorens funeral one week after her murder apparently there had been a deal cut the photos traded for access bosch remembered making such deals in the past when he was unable because of scheduling or budget to get a police photographer out to a funeral he would promise the reporter working the story that he or she would be in line for an exclusive if the newspaper photographer wouldnt mind running off a complete set of crowd shots of the people attending the service you never knew when the killer might show up to get a rise out of the anguish and grief he had caused reporters always went for the deal los angeles was one of the most competitive media markets in the world and reporters lived and died by the access they had bosch studied the photos but was handicapped in looking for roland mackey because he didnt know what he looked like in the photos kiz rider had pulled up on the computer were from his most recent arrest they showed a balding man with a goatee and dark eyes it was hard to trace that visage back to any of the teenaged faces that gathered to put one of their own in the ground for a while he studied becky verlorens parents in one of the photos they were standing at the graveside leaning against each other as if holding each other from falling tears lined their faces robert verloren was black and muriel verloren was white bosch now understood where their daughter had gotten her growing beauty the mix of races in a child often rose above the attendant social difficulties to achieve such grace bosch put the photos down and thought for a moment nowhere in the murder book had there been mention of the possibility of race playing a part in the murder but the murder weapons coming from the burglary of a man being threatened because of his religion seemed to give rise to the possibility of at least a tenuous link to the murder of a girl of mixed races the fact that this was not mentioned in the murder book meant nothing the aspect of race was always something held close to the vest in the lapd to commit something to the paperwork was to make it known within the departmentinvestigative summaries were reviewed all the way up the line on hot cases it could then be leaked and turned into something else something political so its absence was not seen by bosch as a taint on the investigation not yet at least he returned the photos to the envelope and closed the murder book he guessed that there were more than three hundred pages of documents and photos in it and nowhere on any of those pages had he seen the name roland mackey was it possible that he had escaped even peripheral notice in the investigation so many years before if so was it still possible he was indeed the killer these questions bothered bosch he always tried to keep faith in the murder book meaning that he believed the answers usually lay within its plastic sides but this time he was having difficulty believing the cold hit not the science he had no doubt about mackey being matched to the blood and tissue found inside the murder weapon but he believed something was wrong something was missing he looked down at his pad he had taken few notes he had really only composed a list of people he wanted to talk to green and garcia motherfather schoolfriendsteachers former boyfriend probation agent mackeyschool he knew that every note he had taken was obvious he realized how little they had besides the dna match and once again he was uneasy about building a case without anything else bosch was staring at his notes when kiz rider walked into the office she was emptyhanded and unsmiling well bosch asked bad news the murder weapons gone i dont know if youve read the whole book but theres mention of a journal in there the girl kept a journal thats gone too everythings gone they decided that the best way to deal with and discuss bad news was to eat besides that nothing made bosch hungrier than sitting in an office all morning and reading through a murder book they went over to chinese friends a small place on broadway at the end of chinatown where they knew they could still get a table this early it was a place where you could eat well and to capacity and barely go over five bucks the trouble was that it filled up fast mostly with headquarters staff from the fire department the gold badges from parker center and the bureaucrats from city hall if you didnt get there by noon you ordered takeout and you had to sit and eat on the bus benches out front in the sun they left the murder book in the car so as not to disturb other patrons in the restaurant where the tables were jammed as close as the desks in a public school they did bring their notes and discussed the case in an improvised shorthand designed to keep their conversation private rider explained that when she had said the gun and the journal were missing from the esb what she meant was that no evidence carton from the case could be found during an hourlong search by two evidence clerks this was not much of a surprise to bosch as pratt had warned earlier the department had taken haphazard care of evidence for decades evidence cartons were booked and filed on shelves in chronological order and without any sort of separation according to crime classification consequently evidence from a murder might sit on a shelf next to evidence from a burglary and when clerks came through periodically to clear out evidence from cases where the statute of limitations had expired sometimes the wrong box got tossed the security of the esb was also a low priority for many years it was not difficult for anyone with an lapd badge to gain access to any piece of evidence in the facility so the evidence cartons were subject to pilfering it was not unusual for weapons to be missing or other kinds of evidence from famous cases like the black dahlia charles manson and the dollmaker crimes there was no indication in the verloren case of evidence theft it was probably more a case of carelessness of trying to find a box that had been stored seventeen years ago in an acresized room crowded with matching boxes theyll find it bosch said maybe you can even get your buddy up on six to put the fear of god into them then theyll find it for sure they better the dna is no good to us without that gun i dont know about that harry its the chain of evidence you cant go into trial with the dna and not be able to show the jury the weapon it came from we cant even go into the district attorneys office without it theyll throw us right out on our asses look all im saying is right now were the only ones who know we dont have the gun we can fake it what are you talking about dont you think that this is all going to come down to mackey and us in a little room i mean even if we had the gun in evidence we cant prove beyond a doubt that he left his blood in it during the shooting of becky verloren all we can prove is that the blood is his so if you ask me its going to come down to a confession were going to put him in the room hit him with the dna and see if he cops to it thats it so all im saying is we put together a few props for the interview we go to the armory and borrow a colt fortyfive and we pull that out of the box when were in the room with him we convince him we have the chain and he cops or he doesnt i dont like tricks tricks are part of the trade theres nothing illegal about that the courts have even said so i think were going to need more than the dna to turn him anyway me too i was thinking we bosch stopped and waited while the waitress put down two steaming plates bosch had ordered shrimp fried rice rider ordered pork chops without a word he lifted his plate and pushed half of its contents onto her plate he then used a fork to take three of her six pork chops he almost smiled while he did this he was back on the job with her less than a day and they had already dropped back into the easy rhythm of their prior partnership he was happy hey whats jerry edgar up to he asked i dont know i havent talked to him in a while we never really got over that thing bosch nodded when bosch had worked at hollywood division with rider the homicide table had been divided into teams of three jerry edgar had been the third partner then bosch retired and soon after rider was promoted downtown it left edgar still in hollywood feeling isolated and passed over and now that bosch and rider were working again and assigned to rhd there had been only silence from edgar what were you going to say harry when the food came just that youre right well need more one thing i was thinking was that i heard that since nineeleven and the patriot act its easier for us to get a wiretap she ate a piece of shrimp before responding yes thats true its one of the things i was monitoring for the chief our request filings have gone up about three thousand percent the approvals are way up too the words sort of gotten around that this is a tool we can use now how is it going to work here i was thinking we put a tap on mackey and then we plant a story in the paper you know it says were working the case again mention the gun maybe mention the dnayou know something new not that we have a match but that we could get a match then we sit back and watch him and listen to him and see what happens we could follow up by paying him a visit see if that stirs things up any rider thought about this while eating a pork chop with her fingers she seemed uneasy about something and it couldnt be the food what bosch asked who would he call i dont know whoever he did it with or did it for rider nodded thoughtfully while chewing i dont know harry youre back on the job less than a day after three years in the fun and sun and already you are reading things into a case i dont see i guess you are still the teacher youre just rusty from sitting up there behind a big desk on six im serious so am i sort of i think ive waited so long for this that im sort of on full alert i guess just tell me how you see this harry you dont have to make up excuses for your instincts i actually dont see it yet and thats part of the problem roland mackeys name is nowhere in that book and thats a problem starting out the door we know he was in the vicinity but we have nothing connecting him to the victim what are you talking about we have the gun with his dna in it the blood connects him to the gun not the girl you read the book we cant prove his dna was deposited at the time of the killing that single report could blow this whole case out of the water its a big hole kiz so big a jury could drive through it all mackey has to do at trial is get up there on the stand and say yeah i stole the gun during a burglary on winnetka i then went up into the hills and shot it a few times and i was making like mel gibson and the next thing i knew the damn thing bit me took a chunk right out of my hand i never saw that happen to mel before so i got so mad i threw that damn gun into the bushes and went home to get some bandaids the sid reportour own damn reportbacks him up and that is the end of it rider didnt smile during the story at all he could tell she was seeing his point thats all he has to say kiz and hes got reasonable doubt and we cant prove otherwise weve got no prints at the scene weve got no hair no fiber weve got nothing but added to this we do have his profile and if you looked at his sheet before we were on this and knew about the dna you would have never pegged this guy as a killer maybe spurofthemoment or heat of passion but not something like this something planned and certainly not at age eighteen rider shook her head in an almost wistful manner a few hours ago this was given to us as a welcomeaboard present it was supposed to be a slam dunk the dna made everybody jump to a conclusion its whats wrong with the world people think technology is an easy ride theyre watching too much tv is that your weird way of saying you dont think he did this i dont know what im thinking yet so we put a tail on him tap his phone spook him somehow and then see who he calls and how he acts bosch nodded thats what im thinking he said wed need to clear it with abel first we follow the rules just like the chief told me today holy smokethe new harry bosch youre looking at him before we go for the tap we have to finish the due diligence we have to make sure roland mackey was not known to any of the players if that turns out to be the case then i say we go see pratt about the tap sounds right to me what else did you get on the read he wanted to see if she picked up on the undercurrent of race before suggesting it just what was there rider responded was there something i missed i dont knownothing obvious then what i was thinking about the girl being biracial even in eightyeight there would have been people that didnt like the idea of that then you add in the burglary the gun came from the vic was jewish he said he was being harassed thats why he bought the gun rider nodded thoughtfully while she finished a mouthful of rice its something to look for she said but i dont see enough there to hang a lantern on at the moment there was nothing in the book they ate in silence for a few minutes bosch always thought chinese friends had the softest and sweetest shrimp he had ever tasted in fried rice the pork chops as thin as the plastic plates they ate off of were also perfect and kiz was right they were best eaten by hand what about green and garcia rider finally asked what about them how would you grade them on this i dont know maybe a c if i was being charitable they made mistakes slowed things down after that they seemed to cover the bases you same thing they wrote a good murder book but its got cya written all through it like they knew they were never going to break it but wanted the book to look like they turned over every stone bosch nodded and looked down at his pad on the empty chair to the side he looked at the list of people to interview weve got to talk to the parents and garcia and green we need to get a photo of mackey too from when he was eighteen i think we hold back on the parents until we talk to everybody else they might be most important but they should be last i want to know as much as possible before we hit them with this after seventeen years fine maybe we should start at probation he only cleared a year ago he probably was assigned to van nuys right we could go there and then walk over to talk to art garcia you found him hes still around didnt have to look hes commander of valley bureau now bosch nodded he was not surprised garcia had done well the rank of commander put him just below deputy chief it meant he was second in command over the valleys five police divisions including devonshire where years earlier he had worked the verloren case rider continued in addition to our regular projects in the chiefs office each of the special assistants was assigned as sort of a liaison to one of the four bureaus my assignment was the valley so commander garcia and i spoke from time to time most often i dealt with his staff or deputy chief vartan that sort of thing i know what youre sayingi have a highly connected partner you were probably telling vartan and garcia how to run the valley she shook her head in false annoyance dont give me shit about all of that working on six gave me a good view of the department and how it works or doesnt speaking of which theres something i should tell you what is it i ran into irving when i went down to get coffee right after you left rider immediately looked concerned what happened what did he say not a lot he just called me a retread and mentioned that i was going to crash and burn and that when i did i would take the chief down with me for hiring me back then of course when the dust settles mr clean would be there to step up jesus harry one day on the job and you already have irving biting you on the ass bosch spread his hands wide almost hitting the shoulder of a man sitting at the next table i went to get coffee he was there he approached me kiz i was just minding my own business i swear she bent her face down to look at her plate she continued eating without talking to him she dropped her last pork chop half eaten on the plate i cant eat any more harry lets get out of here im ready bosch left more than enough money on the table and rider said she would get the next one outside they got into boschs car a black mercedes suv and drove back through chinatown to the entrance of the northbound they made it all the way to the freeway before rider spoke again about irving harry dont take him lightly she said be very careful i am always careful kiz and i have never taken that man lightly all im saying is hes been passed over twice for the top spot he may be getting desperate yeah you know what i dont get why didnt your guy get rid of him when he came in here i mean just clean house pushing irving across the street doesnt put an end to the threat anybody knows that he couldnt push him irving s got fortyplus years on the job he has a lot of connections that go outside the department and into city hall and he knows where a lot of the bodies are buried the chief couldnt make a move against him unless he was sure there wouldnt be any blowback from it more silence followed the early afternoon traffic out to the valley was light they had kfwb the all news and traffic channel on the radio and there were no reports of problems ahead bosch checked the gas and saw he had half a tank that was plenty they had decided earlier to alternate use of their personal cars a department car had been requisitioned and approved for them to share but they both knew that getting the r ampa was the easy part it would most likely be months if not longer before they would actually get the wheels the department had neither the spare car nor the money for a new one getting the r ampa had simply been a paperwork approval needed before they could charge the department for gas and mileage on their personal cars bosch knew that over time he would probably put so many miles on his suv that the expense payout would likely cost the department more than the approved car look he finally said i know what youre thinking even if youre not saying it its not just me youre worried about you stuck your neck out for me and you convinced the chief to take me back in believe me kiz i know its not just me riding on thison this retread you dont have to worry and you can tell the chief he doesnt have to worry i get it there wont be a blowout there wont be any blowback from me good harry im glad to hear that he tried to think of something that he could say to convince her further he knew words were just words you know i dont know if i ever told you this but after i quit i really sort of liked it at first you know being out of the squad and just sort of doing what i wanted then i started to miss it and then i started working cases again on my own anyway one thing that happened was i started walking with sort of a limp a limp just a little thing like one of my heels was lower than the other like i was uneven well did you check your shoes i didnt need to check my shoes it wasnt my shoes it was my gun he looked over at her she was staring straight ahead her eyebrows set in that deep v she used so much with him he looked back at the road ahead i carried a gun for so long that when i no longer had it on me it threw off my balance i was uneven harry thats a strange story they were going through the cahuenga pass bosch looked out his window and up the hillside searching for his house nestled in among the others in the folds of the mountain he thought he saw a glimpse of the back deck sticking out over the brown brush you want to call garcia and see if we can drop in and see him after we go by probation he asked yeah i willas soon as you get to the point of that story he thought for a long moment before answering the point is i need the gun i need the badge otherwise im out of balance i need all of this okay he looked over at rider she looked back at him but didnt answer i know what i got with this chance so fuck irving and his calling me a retread i wont fuck up twenty minutes later they stepped into one of boschs least favorite places in the city the probation and parole office of the states department of corrections in van nuys it was a singlestory brick building crowded with people waiting to see probation and parole agents to give urine samples to make their courtordered checkins to turn themselves in for incarceration or to plead for one more chance of freedom it was a place where desperation humiliation and rage were palpable in the air it was a place where bosch tried not to make eye contact with anyone bosch and rider had something none of the others had badges it helped them cut through the lines and get an immediate audience with the agent roland mackey had been assigned to after his arrest two years earlier for lewd and lascivious behavior thelma kibble was recessed in a standard governmentissue cubicle in a room crowded with many identical cubicles her desk and the one governmentissue shelf that came with the cubicle were crowded with the files of the convicts she was charged with shepherding through probation or parole she was of medium size and build her eyes were brightly set off against her dark brown skin bosch and rider introduced themselves as detectives from rhd there was only one chair in front of kibbles desk so they remained standing is it robbery or homicide we are talking about here kibble asked homicide rider said then why doesnt one of you grab the extra chair from that cubicle over there shes still at lunch bosch took the chair she pointed at and brought it back rider and bosch sat down and told kibble they wanted a look at the file belonging to roland mackey bosch could tell that kibble recognized the name but not the case it was a lewd and lash probation you caught two years ago he said he cleared after twelve months oh hes not current then well i need to go grab that one in archives i dont rememoh yes i do yes i do roland mackey yeah i rather enjoyed that one how so rider asked kibble smiled lets just say he had some difficulty reporting to a woman of color tell you what though let me go grab the file so we get the details right she doublechecked the spelling of mackeys name with them and left the cubicle that might help bosch said what rider asked if he had a problem with her hell probably have a problem with you we might be able to use it rider nodded bosch saw she was looking at a newspaper article that was tacked to the fiberboard wall of the cubicle it was yellowed with age bosch leaned closer to read it but he was too far away to read anything but the headline wounded parole officer gets heros welcome what is it he asked rider i know who this is rider said she got shot a few years ago she went to some excons house and somebody shot her the convict called for help but then split something like that we gave her an award at the bpo god shes lost a lot of weight something about the story rang a bell with bosch too he noticed there were two photographs accompanying the story one was of thelma kibble standing in front of the doc building a banner welcoming her back hanging from the roof rider was right kibble looked like shed dropped eighty pounds since the photo bosch suddenly remembered seeing that banner across the front of the building a few years back while one of his cases was in trial at the courthouse across the street he nodded now he remembered then something about the second photo caught his eye and memory it was a mug shot of a white womanthe exconvict who lived in the house where kibble had been shot thats not the shooter right he asked no shes the one who called it in who saved her she disappeared bosch suddenly stood up and leaned across the desk putting his hands on stacks of files for support he looked at the mug shot photo it was a blackandwhite shot that had darkened as the newspaper clipping had aged but bosch recognized the face in the photo he was sure of it the hair and eyes were different the name underneath the photo was different too but he was sure he had encountered the woman in las vegas in the past year those are my files youre messing up bosch immediately pulled himself back across the desk as kibble came around it sorry about that i was just trying to read the story thats old news time i took that thing down a lot of years and a lot of pounds ago i was at the black peace officers meeting when you were honored rider said oh really kibble said her face breaking into a smile that was a really nice night for me whatever happened to the woman bosch asked cassie black oh shes in the wind nobodys seen her since she has charges the funny thing is no i mean we violated her because she ran but thats all shes got on her hell she didnt shoot me all she did was save my life i wasnt going to have em charge her for it but the parole violation i couldnt do anything about she split far as i know the guy who shot me mightve got her and buried her out in the desert somewhere i hope not though she did me a good turn bosch was suddenly not so sure the woman he had temporarily lived next to in an airport motel while visiting his daughter in las vegas the year before had been cassie black he sat down and didnt say anything so you found the file rider said right here kibble said you two can have at it but if you want to ask me about the boy then do it now my afternoon slate starts in five minutes if i start late then i have a domino effect running through the whole damn day and i get outta here late cant do that tonight i gotta date she was beaming at the prospect of her date okay well what do you remember about mackey did you look at the file yeah i looked when i was coming back with it mackey was just a pissant weenie wagger smalltime drug user who got racial religion somewhere along the way he was no big thing i rather enjoyed having him under my thumb but that was about it rider had opened the file and bosch was leaning toward her to look into it the lewd and lash was an exposure case he asked actually i think youll find in there that our boy got himself high on speed and alcohola lot of alcoholand he decided to relieve himself in somebodys front yard a thirteenyearold girl happened to live there and she happened to be out front shooting baskets mr mackey decided upon seeing the girl that since he already had his little pud out and about in the wind that he might as well go ahead and ask the girl if she wanted to partake of it did i mention that the girls father was lapd metro division and happened to be offduty and home at the time of this incident he stepped outside and put mr mackey on the ground in fact mr mackey later complained that coincidentally or maybe not so coincidentally he had been put on the ground right on top of the puddle he had just made he was rather unhappy about that kibble smiled at the story bosch nodded her version was more colorful than the case summary in the file and he just pleaded out thats right he got a probation deal and took it he came to me any problems during his twelve months nothing other than his problem with me he asked for another agent and it got turned down and he got stuck with me he kept it in check but it was there underneath you know couldnt ever tell which bugged his ass more me being black or me being a woman she looked at rider as she said this last part and rider nodded the file contained details of mackeys past crimes and life it had photos taken during earlier arrests it would become the baseline resource on their target there was too much in it to go through in front of kibble can we get this copied bosch asked wed also like to borrow one of these early photos if we could kibbles eyes narrowed for a moment you two working an old case huh rider nodded from way back she said like a cold case huh we call it openunsolved rider said kibble nodded thoughtfully well nothing surprises me in this placeive seen people shoplift a frozen pizza and get popped two days before the end of a fouryear tail but from what i remember of this guy mackey he didnt seem to me to have the killer instinct not if you ask me hes a follower not a doer thats a good read bosch said were not sure he is the one we just know he was involved he stood up ready to go what about the photo he asked a photocopy wont be clear enough to show you can borrow that one as long as i get it back i need to keep the file complete people like mackey have a tendency to come back to me know what i mean yes and well get it back to you also can i get a copy of your story there i want to read it kibble looked at the newspaper clip tacked to the cubicles wall just dont look at the picture thats the old me after clearing the doc office rider and bosch crossed the street to the van nuys civic center and walked between the two courthouses to get to the plaza in the middle they sat down on a bench by the library their next appointment was with arturo garcia in the lapds van nuys division which also was one of the buildings in the government center but they were early and wanted to study the doc file first the file contained detailed accounts of all the crimes roland mackey had been arrested for since his eighteenth birthday it also contained biographical summaries used by probation and parole agents over the years in determining aspects of his supervision rider handed bosch the arrest reports while she started going through the biographical details she then immediately proceeded to interrupt his reading of a burglary case by calling out details of mackeys bio that she thought might be pertinent to the verloren case he got a general education degree at chatsworth high the summer of eightyeight she said so that puts him right in chatsworth if he got a ged then he dropped out first does it say from where nothing here says he grew up in chatsworth dysfunctional family poor student he lived with his father a welder at the general motors plant in van nuys doesnt sound like hillside prep material we still need to check parents always want their kid to do better if he went there and knew her and then dropped out it would explain why he was never interviewed back in eightyeight rider just nodded she was reading on this guy never left the valley she said every address is in the valley whats the last known panorama city same as the autotrack hit but if its in here then its probably old bosch nodded anybody who had been through the system as many times as mackey would know to move house the day after clearing a probation tail dont leave an address with the man bosch and rider would go to the panorama city address to check it out but bosch knew that mackey would be gone wherever he had moved he had not used his name on public utility applications and he had not updated his drivers license or vehicle registration he was flying below radar says he was in the wayside whities rider said as she reviewed a report no surprise the wayside whities was the name of a jail gang that had existed for years in the wayside honor rancho in the northern county gangs usually formed along racial lines in the county jails as a means of protection rather than out of racial enmity it was not unusual to find members of the nazileaning wayside whities to secretly be jewish protection was protection it was a way of belonging to a group and staving off assault from other groups it was a measure of jail survival mackeys membership was only a tenuous connection to boschs theory that race possibly played a part in the verloren case anything else on that he asked not that i see what about physical description any tattoos rider rifled through the paperwork and pulled out a jail intake form yeah tattoos she said reading hes got his name on one bicep and i guess a girls name on the other rahowa she spelled the name and bosch started to get the first tingling sense that his theory was coming strongly into play its not a name he said its code means racial holy war first two letters of each word the guys one of the believers i think garcia and green missed this and it was right there he could feel the adrenaline picking up look at this rider said urgently he also has the number eightyeight tattooed on his back the guys got a reminder of what he did in eightyeight sort of bosch replied its more code i worked one of these white power cases once and i remember all the codes to these guys eightyeight stands for double h because h is the eighth letter of the alphabet eightyeight equals hh equals heil hitler they also use one ninetyeight for sieg heil theyre pretty clever arent they i still think the year eightyeight might have something to do with this maybe it does you got anything in there about employment looks like he drives a tow truck he was driving a tow truck when he stopped to take the leak that got him the lewd and lash last time this lists three different previous employersall tow services thats good thats a start well find him bosch looked back down at the arrest report in front of him it was a burglary from mackey had been caught by a police dog in the concessions shop of the pacific drivein theater he had broken in after hours setting off a silent alarm he had pilfered the cash drawer and filled a plastic bag with two hundred candy bars his exit was slowed because he decided to turn on the cheese warmer and make himself some nachos he was still inside the building when a responding officer with a dog sent the animal inside the shop the report said mackey was treated for dog bite injuries to the left arm and upper left thigh at countyusc medical center before being booked the record indicated that mackey pleaded guilty to breaking and entering a lesser charge and was sentenced to time servedsixtyseven days in the van nuys jailand two years probation the next report was a violation of that probation for an assault arrest bosch was about to read the report when rider took the sheaf of photocopies out of his hands its time to go see garcia she said his sergeant said if were late well miss him she stood up and bosch followed they headed toward the van nuys division the valley bureau command offices were on the third floor in nineteen ninety mackey was popped for a burglary at the old pacific drivein bosch said as they walked okay it was at winnetka and prairie theres a multiplex there now that puts it about five or six blocks from where the verloren weapon was stolen a couple years before the burglary what do you think two burglaries five blocks apart i think maybe he liked working that area i think he stole the gun or he was with the person who stole it rider nodded and they went up the stairs to the police station lobby and then took the elevator the rest of the way up to valley bureau command they were on time but still were made to wait while sitting on a couch bosch said i remember that drivein i went there a couple times when i was a kid the one in van nuys too we had our own on the south side rider said they turn it into a multiplex too no its just a parking lot they dont put multiplex money down there what about magic johnson bosch knew the former laker basketball star had invested heavily in the community including opening movie theaters hes only one man one man is a start i guess a woman with p stripes on her uniforms sleeves came up to them the commander will see you now commander arturo garcia was standing behind his desk waiting as bosch and rider were led into his office by the uniformed assistant garcia was in uniform too and he wore it well and proudly he had steel gray hair and a matching bottlebrush mustache he exuded the confidence that the department used to carry and was fighting to recover detectives come in come in he said sit down here and tell an old homicide dick how its hanging they took the chairs in front of the desk thank you for seeing us so quickly rider said bosch and rider had decided that she would take the lead with garcia since she was more familiar with him through her liaison work in the chiefs office bosch also wasnt sure he would be able to disguise his distaste for garcia and the mistakes and missteps he and his partner had made on the verloren investigation well when robberyhomicide calls you make the time right he smiled again we actually work in the openunsolved unit rider said garcia lost his smile and for a moment bosch thought he saw a flash of pain enter his eyes rider had made the appointment through an assistant in the commanders office and had not revealed what case they were working becky verloren the commander said rider nodded how did you know how did i know i was the one who called that guy down there the oic and i told him there was dna on that case and they ought to send it through detective pratt yeah pratt as soon as that unit was up and operational i called him and said check out becky verloren nineteen eightyeight what have you got you got a match right rider nodded we got a very good match who ive been waiting seventeen years for this somebody from the restaurant right this gave bosch pause in the murder book there were interview summaries from people who worked in robert verlorens restaurant but nothing that rose above the routine nothing that indicated suspicion or followup nothing in the investigative summaries that pointed the case toward the restaurant to now hear one of the original investigators voice a longheld suspicion that the killer had come from that direction was incongruous with what they had spent the morning reading actually no rider said the dna matches a man named roland mackey he was eighteen at the time of the murder he was in chatsworth at the time we dont think he worked at the restaurant garcia frowned as though he was puzzled or maybe disappointed does that name mean anything to you rider asked we didnt come across it anywhere in the book garcia shook his head i dont place it but its been a long time who is he we dont know who he is yet were circling him were just starting im sure i would have remembered the name his blood was on the gun right thats what we got hes got a history burglaries receiving drugs were thinking he might be good for the burglary when the gun was taken absolutely garcia said as if his excitement for the idea could make it so we can connect him to the gun no doubt rider said but were looking for the connection to the girl we thought maybe youd remember something have you talked to the mother and father yet not yet youre our first stop that poor family that was it for them you stayed in touch with the parents initially yeah as long as i had the case but once i made lieutenant and went back to patrol i had to give up the case i kind of lost contact with them after that it was muriel mostlythe motherwho i had talked to the father there was something going on with him he didnt do well he left home they divorced the whole thing lost the restaurant last i heard he was living on the street he would show up at the house from time to time and ask muriel for money what made you guess it was somebody from the restaurant when we came in here garcia shook his head like he was frustrated by reaching for a memory he couldnt quite grasp i dont know he said i cant remember it was more like a feeling there was stuff wrong with the case something was hinky about it how so well you read the book im sure she wasnt raped she was carried up that hill and it was made to look like a suicide it was done badly it was really an execution so we werent talking about the random intruder somebody she knew wanted her dead and they either went in that house or sent somebody in that house you think it was related to the pregnancy rider asked garcia nodded we thought that was tied in but we could never nail it down mtlyou never figured that one out garcia looked at her confusion on his face empty l no mtl the initials rebecca used in her journal you mentioned it in the formal interview with the parents my true love remember oh yeah the initials it was like a code we never knew for sure we never found out who that was are you looking for the journal bosch nodded and rider spoke were looking for everything the journal the gun the whole evidence carton is lost somewhere in the esb garcia shook his head like a man who had spent a career dealing with the departments frustrations that is not surprising par for the course right right tell you one thing though if they find the carton there wont be any journal in it why because i gave it back to the parents to the mother like i said i made lieutenant and was shipping out going to south bureau ron green had already retired i was passing the case off and i knew that was going to be the end of it nobody was going to pay attention to it like we did so i told muriel i was leaving and i gave her the journal that poor woman it was like time stood still for her on that day in july she became frozen couldnt go forward couldnt go back i remember i went to see her before i left this was a year or so after the murder she had me look at beckys bedroom it was untouched it was exactly the way it was on the night she was taken rider nodded somberly garcia said nothing else bosch finally cleared his throat leaned forward and spoke hitting garcia with the same question again when we first came in and said we got a dna match you guessed it was somebody from the restaurant why bosch looked at rider to see if she was annoyed that he was entering the questioning she didnt appear to be i dont know why garcia said like i said i always sort of thought that it might have come from that side of things because i never felt we nailed everything down over there youre talking about the father garcia nodded the father was hinky i dont know if you even say that anymore but back then the word was hinky how so rider asked how was the father hinky before garcia could answer the question one of the uniformed adjutants came into the office commander theyre all in the conference room and ready to start okay sergeant ill be there shortly after the sergeant left garcia looked back at rider as if he had forgotten the question there is nothing in the murder book that casts any suspicion on the father rider said why did you think he was hinky oh i dont really know sort of a gut feeling he never really acted like you would think a father would act you know he was too quiet he never got mad never yelledi mean somebody took his little girl he never once took ron or me aside and said i want first shot at the guy when you find him i expected that as far as bosch was concerned everybody was still a suspect even with the cold hit tying mackey to the murder weapon this certainly included robert verloren but he immediately dismissed garcias gut instinct based on the fathers emotional responses to his daughters murder he knew from working hundreds of murders that there was absolutely no way to judge such responses or to build suspicion on them bosch had seen every permutation of it and it all meant nothing one of the biggest criers and screamers he had ever encountered on a case ended up being the killer in dismissing garcias instinct and suspicion bosch was also dismissing garcia he and green had made early mistakes but recovered to conduct a bythenumbers investigation of the murder the murder book bore this out but bosch now guessed that whatever was done well was probably done by green he knew he should have suspected as much when he heard that garcia had given up homicide for management how long did you work homicide bosch asked three years all in devonshire division thats right bosch quickly did the math devonshire would have had a light caseload he figured that garcia had worked no more than a couple dozen murders at the most it wasnt enough experience to do it well he decided to move on what about your former partner he asked did he feel the same way about robert verloren he was willing to give the guy a little more slack than me are you still in touch with him who the father no green no he retired way back i know but are you still in touch garcia shook his head no hes dead he retired up to humboldt county he shouldve left his gun down here all that time and nothing to do up there he killed himself garcia nodded bosch looked down at the floor it wasnt ron greens death that struck him he didnt know green it was the loss of the connection to the case he knew garcia wasnt going to be much help what about race bosch asked again stepping on riders lead what about it garcia asked in this case i dont see it interracial couple biracial kid the gun came from a burglary where the victim was being harassed on religious lines thats a stretch you got something with this mackey character there might be something well we didnt have the luxury of a named suspect to work with we didnt see any aspect of that with what we had back then garcia said it forcefully and bosch knew he had touched a nerve he didnt like to be secondguessed no detective did even an inexperienced one i know its mondaymorning quarterbacking to start with the guy and go backwards rider quickly said its just something were looking at garcia seemed placated i understand he said leave no stone unturned he stood up well detectives i hate to rush this i wish we could kick this around all day i used to put people in jail now i go into meetings about budget and deployment thats what you deserve bosch thought he glanced at rider wondering if she understood that he had saved her from a similar fate when he talked her into partnering with him in the openunsolved unit do me a favor garcia said when you hook up this guy mackey let me know maybe ill come down and look through the window at him ive been waiting for this one no problem sir rider said breaking her stare away from bosch well do that if you think of anything else that might help us with this give me a call all my numbers are on this she stood up placing a business card down on the table ill do it garcia started to go around his desk to head to his meeting theres something we might need you to do bosch said garcia stopped in his tracks and looked at him what is it detective i need to get in that meeting we might try to flush the birds out of the bushes with a newspaper story it might be good if it came from you you know former homicide guy now a commander haunted by the old case he calls openunsolved and gets them to run the dna through the pipeline what do you know they get a cold hit garcia nodded bosch could tell it played to his ego perfectly yeah it might work whatever you want to do just call me and well set it up the daily news ive got connections there its the valley paper bosch nodded yeah thats what we were thinking he said good let me know ive got to go he quickly left the office rider and bosch looked at each other and then followed out in the hallway waiting for the elevator rider asked bosch what he was doing when he asked him about planting the news story hed be perfect for the story because he doesnt know what hes talking about so we dont want that we want to be careful dont worry itll work the elevator opened and they got on no one else was in it as soon as the door closed rider was on him harry lets get something straight right now were either partners or were not you should have told me you were going to hit him with that we shouldve talked about it first bosch nodded youre right he said were partners it wont happen again good the elevator door opened and she stepped out leaving bosch behind hillside preparatory school was a structure of spanish design nestled against the hills of porter ranch its campus was marked by magnificent green lawns and the daunting rise of mountains behind it the mountains almost seemed to cradle the school and protect it bosch thought it looked like a place that any parent would want their child to go he thought about his own daughter just a year away from starting school he would want her to go to a school that looked like thison the outside at least he and rider followed signs that led them to the administration offices at a front counter bosch showed his badge and explained that they wanted to see if a student named roland mackey had ever attended hillside the clerk disappeared into a back office and soon a man emerged his most notable features were a basketballsized paunch and thick glasses shaded by bushy eyebrows across his forehead his hair left the perfect line of a toupee im gordon stoddard principal here at hillside mrs atkins told me you are detectives im having her check that name for you it didnt ring a bell with me and ive been here almost twentyfive years do you know exactly when he attended it might help her with the search bosch was surprised stoddard looked like he was in his midforties he must have come to hillside fresh from his own schooling and never left bosch didnt know if that was a testament to what they paid teachers here or stoddards own dedication to the place but from what he knew about teachers private and public he doubted it was the pay wed be talking about the eighties if he went here thats a long time ago for you to remember yes but i have a memory for the students that have come through most of them i havent been principal for twentyfive years i was a teacher first i taught science and then i was dean of the science department do you remember rebecca verloren rider asked stoddard blanched yes as a matter of fact i do i taught her science is that what this is about have you arrested this boy mackey i mean i guess hed be a man now is he the one we dont know that sir bosch said quickly were reviewing the case and his name came up and we need to check on it thats all did you see the plaque stoddard asked excuse me outside on the wall in the main hallway there is a plaque dedicated to rebecca the students in her class collected the funds for it and had it made it is quite nice but of course it is also quite sad but it does serve its purpose people around here remember rebecca verloren we missed it well look at it on our way out a lot of people still remember her this school might not pay that well and most of the faculty might have to work two jobs to make ends meet but it has a very loyal faculty nonetheless there are several teachers still here who taught rebecca we have one mrs sable who was actually a student with her and then returned here to teach in fact bailey was one of her good friends i believe bosch glanced at rider who raised her eyebrows they had a plan for approaching becky verlorens friends but here was an opportunity presenting itself bosch had recognized the name bailey one of the three friends becky verloren had spent the evening with two nights before her disappearance was named bailey koster bosch knew that it was more than an opportunity to question a witness in the case if they didnt get to sable now she would likely hear about roland mackey from stoddard bosch didnt want that he wanted to control the flow of information on the case to the players involved in it is she here today bosch asked could we talk to her stoddard looked up at the clock on the wall next to the counter well she is in class now but school lets out for the day in about twenty minutes if you dont mind waiting i am sure you could talk to her then thats no problem good i will send a message to her classroom and have her come to the office after school mrs atkins the counter clerk appeared behind stoddard actually if you dont mind rider said wed rather go to her classroom to talk to her we dont want to make her uncomfortable bosch nodded rider was on the same frequency they didnt want a message of any kind going to mrs sable they didnt want her thinking about becky verloren until they were right there watching and listening either way stoddard said whatever you want to do he noticed mrs atkins standing behind him and asked her to report her findings we have no record of a roland mackey as a student here she said did you come across anyone with that last name rider asked yes one mackey first name gregory attended for two years in nineteen ninetysix and seven there was a longshot possibility that it was a younger brother or a cousin it might become necessary to check the name out can you see if there is a current address or contact number for him rider asked mrs atkins looked at stoddard for approval and he nodded she disappeared to go get the information bosch checked the wall clock they had almost twenty minutes to kill mr stoddard are there yearbooks from the late eighties that we could look at while were waiting to see mrs sable he asked yes of course i will take you to the library and get those for you on the way to the library stoddard took them by the plaque rebecca verlorens classmates had put on the wall of the main hallway it was a simple dedication with her name the years of her birth and death and the youthful promise of we will always remember she was a sweet kid stoddard said always involved her family too what a tragedy stoddard used the sleeve of his shirt to wipe the dust off the laminated photograph of the smiling becky verloren on the plaque the library was around the corner there were few students at the tables or browsing the shelves as the end of the day drew near in a whisper stoddard told them to have a seat at a table and then he went off into the stacks less than a minute later he came back with three yearbooks and put them down on the table bosch saw that each book had the title veritas and the year on the cover stoddard had brought yearbooks from and these are the last three years stoddard whispered i remember she went here from grade one so if you want earlier books just let me know theyre on the shelf bosch shook his head thats okay this will be fine for now well come back by the office before we leave we need to get that information from mrs atkins anyway okay then i will leave you to it oh can you tell us where mrs sables classroom is stoddard gave them the room number and told them how to get there from the library he then excused himself saying he was returning to the office before leaving he whispered a few words to a table of boys near the door the boys then reached down to the backpacks they had dropped on the floor and pulled them underneath the table so as to not impede foot traffic something about the way they had haphazardly dropped their packs reminded bosch of the way the boys of vietnam had done itwhere they stood not caring about anything but getting the weight off their shoulders after stoddard had left the boys made faces at the door he had passed through rider took the yearbook ahead of bosch and he took the edition he wasnt expecting to find anything of value now that mrs atkins had knocked down his theory that roland mackey had attended the school at one point but had dropped out before the murder he was already resigned to the idea that the connection between mackey and becky verlorenif it even existedwould be found somewhere else he did the math in his head and flipped through the book until he found the eighth grade photos he quickly found becky verlorens picture she wore pigtails and braces she was smiling but looked like she was just beginning that period of prepubescent awkwardness he doubted she had been happy with her appearance in the book he checked the group photos showing the classs different clubs and organizations and was able to track her extracurricular activities she played soccer and was seen in the photos for the science and art clubs and the homeroom representatives in student government in all the photos she was always in the back row or off to the side bosch wondered if that was where she had been placed by a photographer or where she had felt comfortable rider was taking her time with the edition she was going through every page at one point holding the book up to bosch when she was going through the faculty section she pointed to a photo of a young gordon stoddard who had much longer hair back then and didnt wear glasses he was leaner and looked stronger as well look at him she said nobody should grow old and everybody should get the chance bosch moved on to the yearbook and found that the photos of becky verloren showed a young girl who appeared to be blossoming her smile was fuller more confident if the braces were still there they were no longer noticeable in the group photos she had moved to front and center in the student government photos she was not a class officer yet but she had her arms folded in a takecharge pose her posture and her unflinching stare at the camera told bosch she was going places only somebody had stopped her bosch flipped through a few more pages and then closed the book he was waiting for the bell to ring so they could go interview bailey koster sable nothing rider asked of any value he said its good to look at her back then though in place in her element yes look at this they were sitting across from each other she turned the book around on the table so he could see it she had finally gotten to the sophomore class photos the top half of the page on the right showed a boy and four girls posing on a wall bosch recognized as the entrance to the student parking lot one of the girls was becky verloren the caption above the photo said student leaders below the photo the students were identified and their positions listed becky verloren was listed as student council representative bailey koster was class president rider tried to spin the book back toward herself but bosch held it for a moment studying the photograph he could tell by her pose and her style that becky verloren had left her teen awkwardness behind he would not describe the student in the photograph as a girl she was on her way to becoming an attractive and confident young woman he let the book go and rider took it back she was going to be a heartbreaker he said maybe she already was maybe she picked the wrong one to break anything else in there take a look she flipped the open book around again the two pages were spread with photos from the art clubs trip to france the summer before there were photos of about twenty students boys and girls and several parents or teachers in front of notre dame in the courtyard of the louvre and on a tourist boat on the seine rider pointed out rebecca verloren in one of the photos she went to france bosch said what about it she could have met someone over there could be an international link to this thing we might have to go over there and check it out she was trying to hold back a smile yeah bosch said you put the req in on that send it on up to six boy harry i guess your sense of humor stayed retired yeah i guess so the school bell rang ending the discussion as well as classes for the day bosch and rider got up leaving the yearbooks on the table and left the library they followed stoddards directions to bailey sables classroom along the way dodging students hurrying to leave the school the girls wore plaid skirts and white blouses the boys khakis and white polo shirts they looked into the open door of room b and saw a woman sitting at a desk at the front center of the classroom she did not look up from the papers she was apparently grading bailey sable bore almost no resemblance to the sophomore class president whose photo bosch and rider had just studied in the yearbook the hair was darker and shorter now the body wider and heavier like stoddard she wore glasses bosch knew she was only thirtytwo or thirtythree but she looked older there was one last student in the room she was a pretty blonde girl who was shoving books into a backpack when she was finished she zipped the pack closed and headed to the door see you tomorrow mrs sable goodbye kaitlyn the student gave bosch and rider a curious look as she went by them the detectives stepped into the classroom and bosch pulled the door closed that made bailey sable look up from her papers can i help you she asked bosch took the lead you might be able to he said mr stoddard said it would be all right if we came to your classroom he approached the desk the teacher looked up at him warily are you parents no were detectives mrs sable my name is harry bosch and this is kizmin rider we wanted to ask you a few questions about becky verloren she reacted as if she had just been punched in the gut all these years and it was still that close to the surface oh my god oh my god she said were sorry to hit you with this out of the blue bosch said is something happening did you find who she didnt finish well were working on it again bosch said and you might be able to help us how bosch reached into his pocket and pulled out the mug shot taken from roland mackeys doc probation file it was a portrait of mackey as an eighteenyearold car thief bosch put it down on top of the paper she had been grading she looked down at it do you recognize the person in that photo bosch asked it was taken seventeen years ago rider added about the time of beckys death the teacher looked down at mackeys defiant glare into the police camera she didnt say anything for a long time bosch looked at rider and nodded a signal that maybe she should take over does it look like anyone you or becky or any of your friends may have encountered back then rider asked did he go to school here sable asked no we dont think so but we know he lived in this area is he the killer we dont know were just trying to see if there is a connection between becky and him what is his name rider looked at bosch and he nodded again his name is roland mackey does he look familiar not really it is hard for me to remember back then remember the faces of strangers i mean so he definitely is not someone you knew right definitely do you think becky could have known him without you being aware of it she thought for a long moment before answering well its possible you know it came out that shed gotten pregnant i didnt know about that so i guess i might not have known about him was he the father we dont know unbidden she had jumped the interview forward to boschs next line of questioning mrs sable you know its been a lot of years since then he said if you were sort of sticking up for a friend back then we understand that but if there is more you know you can tell us now this is probably the last shot that anybody is going to take at solving this thing you mean about her being pregnant i really didnt know about it im sorry i was just as shocked as everybody else when the police started asking about that if becky were going to confide in someone about that would it have been you again she didnt answer right away she gave it some thought i dont know she said we were very close but she was that way with a few other girls too there were four of us who had been together since first grade here in first grade we called ourselves the kitty cat club because we all had pet cats at different times and different years one of us would be closer to one of the others it changed all the time but as a group we always stuck together bosch nodded that summer when becky was taken who would you say was closest to her it was probably tara she took it the hardest bosch looked at rider trying to remember the names of the girls becky had been with two nights before her death tara wood rider asked yes thats tara they hung out together a lot that summer because beckys dad owned a restaurant in malibu and they were both working there they were splitting a schedule there it seemed that summer that all they did was talk about it what would they say about it rider asked oh you know like what stars came in there people like sean penn and charlie sheen and sometimes they talked about what guys worked there and who was cute nothing too interesting to me since i didnt work there was there any one guy in particular they talked about she thought a moment before answering not really not that i remember they just liked to talk about them because they were so different they were surfers and wouldbe actors tara and becky were valley girls it was like a culture clash for them was she dating anybody from the restaurant bosch asked not that i knew of but its like i said i didnt know about the pregnancy so there was obviously somebody in her life i didnt know about she kept it a secret were you jealous of them because they worked there rider asked not at all i didnt have to work and i was pretty happy about that rider was going somewhere so bosch let her continue what did you guys do for fun when you got together she asked i dont know the usual sable said we went shopping and to movies stuff like that who had cars tara did and so did i tara had a convertible we used to go up she cut it off when she came to a memory what rider asked i just remember driving up into limekiln canyon a lot after school tara had a cooler in the trunk and her dad never noticed if shed taken some of his beers out of the refrigerator one time we got pulled over up there by a police car we hid the beers under our uniform skirts they worked perfect for that the policeman didnt notice she smiled at the memory of course now that i teach here im on the watch for that sort of thing we still have the same uniforms what about before she started working at the restaurant bosch said drawing the interview back to rebecca verloren she was sick for a week right after school let out did you visit her or talk to her then im sure i did that is when they said she probably you know ended the pregnancy so she wasnt really sick she was just recovering but i didnt know i must have just thought she was sick thats all i cant really remember if we talked that week or not did the detectives back then ask you all of these questions yes im pretty sure they did where would a girl from hillside prep go if she got pregnant rider asked back then i mean you mean like a clinic or a doctor yes bailey sables neck flushed she was embarrassed by the question she shook her head i dont know that was as shocking really as becky being you know killed it made us all think we didnt really know our friend it was really sad because i realized she hadnt trusted me enough to tell me these things you know i still think about that when i remember things back then did she have any boyfriends that you did know about bosch asked not then i mean at the time she had a boyfriend freshman year but he had moved away to hawaii with his family that was like the summer before then the whole school year i thought she was alone you know she didnt go to any of the dances or the games with anybody but i was wrong i guess because of the pregnancy rider said well yeah thats sort of obvious isnt it who was the father bosch asked hoping the direct question might elicit a response with something to pursue but sable shrugged i have no idea and dont think ive ever stopped wondering bosch nodded he had gotten nothing the breakup with the boy who moved to hawaii how was that with her he asked well i thought it broke her heart she took it really hard it was like romeo and juliet how so they were broken up by the parents you mean they didnt want them going together no his dad took a job or something in hawaii they had to move and it broke them up bosch nodded again he didnt know if any of the information they were getting was useful but he knew it was important to cast as wide a net as possible do you know where tara wood is these days he asked sable shook her head we had a tenyear reunion and she didnt come i lost touch with her i still talk to grace tanaka from time to time but she lives up in the bay area so i dont see her too much can you give us her number sure i have it here she reached down and opened a desk drawer and pulled out her purse while she was getting out an address book bosch took the photo of mackey off the desk and put it back into his pocket when sable read off a phone number rider wrote it down in a small notebook five ten rider said what is that oakland she lives in hayward she wants to live in san francisco but it costs too much for what she makes what does she do shes a metal sculptor her last name is still tanaka yes she never married she what she turned out to be gay turned out well what i mean is we never knew she never told us she moved up there and once about eight years ago i went up to visit and then i knew it was obvious obvious did she come to the tenyear high school reunion yes she was there we had fun but it was sort of sad too because people talked about becky and how it was never solved i think thats probably why tara didnt come she didnt want to be reminded of what happened to becky well maybe well change that by the twentieth reunion bosch said immediately regretting the flippant remark sorry that wasnt a nice thing to say well i hope you do change it i think about her all the time always wondering who did it and why they have never been found i look at her picture every day on the plaque when i come into school its weird i helped raise the money for that plaque when i was class president they bosch asked what you said they have never been found why did you say they i dont know he she whatever bosch nodded mrs sable thanks for your time he said would you do us a favor and not talk about this with anyone we dont want people being prepared for us you know what i mean like with me exactly and if you think of anything else anything at all you want to talk about my partner will give you a card with our numbers on it okay she seemed to be in a faroff reverie the detectives said goodbye and left her there with the stack of papers to grade bosch thought she was probably remembering a time when four girls were the best of friends and the future sparkled in front of them like an ocean before leaving the school they stopped by the office to see if the school had any current contact information for former student tara wood gordon stoddard had mrs atkins check but the answer was no bosch asked if they could borrow the yearbook to make copies of some of the photos and stoddard gave his approval im on my way out he said ill walk with you they smalltalked on the way back to the library and stoddard gave them the yearbook which had already been returned to the shelves on the way out to the parking lot stoddard stopped with them once more in front of the memorial plaque bosch ran his fingers over the raised letters of becky verlorens name he noticed that the edges had been worn smooth over the years by many students doing the same thing rider worked the file and the phone while bosch drove toward panorama city which was just on the east side of the and across the devonshire division line panorama city was a district carved off the north side of van nuys many years before when residents there decided they needed to distance themselves from negative connotations ascribed to van nuys nothing about the place was changed but the name and a few street signs still panorama city sounded clean and beautiful and crime free and the residents felt better about themselves but many years had passed and resident groups had petitioned to rename their neighborhoods again and to distance themselves if not physically then imagewise from negative connotations associated with panorama city bosch guessed it was one of the ways los angeles kept reinventing itself like a writer or actor who keeps changing his name to leave past failings behind and start fresh even with the same pen or face as expected roland mackey was no longer at the auto towing company he had worked for while on his most recent stint of probation but also as expected the excon was not particularly smart when it came to covering his trail the probation file contained his entire work history through a life that had largely been spent on probation or parole he drove a tow truck for two other concerns during past periods of state monitoring posing as an acquaintance rider called each of them and easily located his current employer tampa towing she then called the tow service and asked if mackey was working today after a moment she closed the phone and looked at bosch tampa towing he comes on at four bosch checked his watch mackey reported for work in ten minutes lets go by and get a look at him well check his address after tampa and what tampa and roscoe must be across from the hospital the hospital is roscoe and reseda i wonder why they didnt call it roscoe towing funny then what do we do after we get a look at him well we go up to him and ask him if he killed becky verloren seventeen years ago and then he says yes and we take him downtown come on bosch i dont know what do you want to do next we check his address like you said and then i think were ready for the parents im thinking that we need to talk to them about this guy before we set up on him and make a playespecially in the newspaper i say we go by the house and see the mother were already up here might as well you mean if shes still there he said did you run an autotrack on her too didnt have to shell be there you heard how garcia was talking her babys ghost is in that house i doubt shell ever leave it bosch guessed that she was right about that but didnt respond he drove east on devonshire boulevard to tampa avenue and then dropped down to roscoe boulevard they got to the intersection a few minutes before four tampa towing was actually a chevron service station with two mechanics bays bosch parked in the lot of a small strip shopping plaza across the street and killed the engine bosch wasnt surprised when four oclock came and went without any sign of roland mackey he didnt strike bosch as somebody who would be excited to come to work to tow cars at fourfifteen rider said what do you think you think my call could have there he is a thirtyyearold camaro with gray primer on all four fenders pulled into the service station and parked near the air pump bosch had caught only a glimpse of the driver but it was enough for him to know he reached over to the glove compartment and took out a pair of field glasses he had bought through an airline catalog he had read while on a flight to las vegas he slouched down in his seat and watched through the glasses mackey got out of the camaro and walked toward the service stations open garage he was wearing a uniform of dark blue pants and a lighter blue shirt there was an ovalshaped patch over the left breast pocket that said ro he had work gloves sticking out of one of his back pockets there was an old ford taurus up on a hydraulic lift in the garage and a man working beneath it with an air wrench when mackey entered the man with the wrench nonchalantly reached out and gave him a high five mackey stopped while the man told him something i think hes telling him about the phone call bosch said mackey doesnt look too concerned about it he just pulled a cell out of his pocket hes calling the person he probably thinks called him reading mackeys lips bosch said hey did you call me mackey quickly ended the conversation i guess not bosch said mackey put his phone back into his pocket he tried one person rider said must not have much of a social life the name on the patch on his shirt is ro bosch said if his buddy told him that the caller asked for roland then he may have narrowed it down to the one person who calls him that maybe it was dear old dad the welder so whats he doing cant see him he went into the back maybe we should get out of here before he starts looking around come on one call and you think hes going to think somebodys onto him after seventeen years no not for becky im worried about whatever else hes into now we might be stumbling right into the middle of something and not even know it bosch put down the binoculars she was right about that he started the car okay we got our look he said lets get out of here lets go see muriel verloren what about panorama city pc can wait we both know he doesnt live at that address anymore checking it is just a formality he started backing out of the space do you think we should call muriel first rider asked no lets just go knock on the door were good at that in ten minutes they were in front of the verloren house the neighborhood where becky verloren had lived still seemed pleasant and safe red mesa way was wide with sidewalks on both sides and no shortage of shade trees most of the homes were ranch houses that sprawled across the extralarge lots in the sixties the larger properties were what drew people to settle the northwest corner of the city forty years later the trees were mature and the neighborhood had a cohesive feel to it the verlorens house was one of the few that had a second floor it was still the classic ranchstyle home but the roof popped up over the doubleslot garage bosch knew from the murder book that beckys bedroom had been upstairs over the garage and in the back the garage door was closed there was no apparent sign that anyone was home they parked in the driveway and went to the front door when bosch pushed a doorbell button he could hear a chime echo inside a single tone that seemed very distant and lonely to him the door was answered by a woman who wore a shapeless blue pullover dress that helped hide her own shapeless body she wore flat sandals her hair was dyed a color red that had too much orange in it it looked like a home job that didnt go as planned but she either didnt notice or didnt care as soon as she opened the door a gray cat shot out of the opening and into the front yard smoke dont get hit she yelled first then she said can i help you mrs verloren rider asked yes what is it were with the police wed like to talk to you about your daughter as soon as rider said the word police and before she got to daughter muriel verloren brought both hands up to her mouth and reacted as though it was the moment she had learned her daughter was dead oh my god oh my god tell me you caught him tell me you caught the bastard who took my baby away from me rider reached a comforting hand to the womans shoulder its not quite that simple maam rider said can we come in and talk she stepped back and let them in she seemed to be whispering something and bosch thought it might be a prayer once they were in she closed the door after yelling a warning one more time into the front yard to the escaped cat the home smelled as though the cat had not escaped often enough the living room to which they were led was neatly kept but with furniture that was old and worn there was the distinct odor of cat urine in the place bosch suddenly wished they had invited muriel verloren down to parker center for the interview but knew that would have been a mistake they needed to see this place they sat side by side on the couch and muriel rushed to one of the chairs across the glasstopped coffee table from them bosch noticed paw prints on the glass what is it she asked desperately is there news well i guess the news is that we are looking into the case again rider said i am detective rider and this is detective bosch we work for the openunsolved unit out of parker center by agreement while driving to the house bosch and rider decided to be cautious with the information they gave members of the verloren family until they knew the family situation it would be better to take rather than to give is there anything new muriel asked urgently well we are just starting out rider replied were covering a lot of the old ground right now trying to get up to speed we just wanted to come by and tell you we were working the case again she seemed a bit crestfallen she had apparently thought that for the police to show up after so many years there would have to be something new bosch felt a twinge of guilt over withholding the fact that they had a rocksolid dna leada cold hitto work with but at the moment he felt that it was for the best there are a couple things he said speaking for the first time first in looking through the files on the case we came across this photo he took the photo of roland mackey as an eighteenyearold out of his pocket and put it down on the coffee table in front of muriel she immediately leaned down to look at it were not sure what the connection is he continued we thought maybe you might recognize this man and tell us if you knew him back then she continued to look without responding this is a photo from nineteen eightyeight bosch said as a means of prompting her who is he she finally asked were not sure his name is roland mackey hes got a smalltime record for crimes committed after your daughters death were not sure why his photo was in the file do you recognize him did you ask art or ron about it bosch started to ask who art and ron were when he realized actually detective green retired and passed away a long time ago detective garcia is commander garcia now we talked to him but he wasnt able to help us with mackey how about you could he have been one of your daughters acquaintances do you recognize him he could have been there is something about him that i recognize bosch nodded do you know how you recognize him or from where no i dont remember why dont you tell me and maybe that will help jog my memory bosch made a quick side glance at rider this was not totally unexpected but it always complicated things when the parent of a victim was so eager to help that he or she simply asked what it was the police wanted them to say muriel verloren had waited seventeen years for her daughters killer to be brought forward into the light of the justice system it was very clear that she was going to carefully choose answers that would in no way hinder the possibility of that happening at this point it might not even matter if it was a false light the past years had been cruel to her and the memory of her daughter someone still needed to pay we cant tell you that because we dont know mrs verloren bosch said think about it and let us know if you remember him she nodded sadly as if she thought it was yet another missed opportunity mrs verloren what do you do for a living rider asked it seemed to bring the woman in front of them back from her memories and desires i sell things she said matteroffactly online they waited for further explanation and didnt get any really rider asked what things do you sell whatever i can find i go to yard sales i find things books toys clothes people will buy anything and theyll pay anything this morning i sold two napkin rings for fifty dollars they were very old we want to ask your husband about the photo bosch said then do you know where we could find him she shook her head somewhere down there in toyland i havent heard from him in a long long time a somber moment of silence passed by most of the homeless missions in downtown los angeles were clustered at the edge of the toy district several blocks of toy manufacturers and wholesalers even a few retailers it wasnt unusual to find homeless people sleeping in the doorways of toy stores what muriel verloren was telling them was that her husband was lost in the world of floating human debris he had descended from restaurateur to the stars to a homeless existence on the streets but there was a contradiction there he still had a home here he just couldnt stay because of what had happened yet his wife would never leave when were you divorced rider asked we never did get a divorce i guess i always thought robert would wake up and realize that no matter how far you run you cant get away from what happened to us i thought he would realize that and come home it hasnt happened yet do you think you knew all of your daughters friends bosch asked muriel thought about this one for a long moment until the morning she disappeared i did but then we learned things she kept secrets i think that is one of the things that bothers me most not that she kept secrets from us but that she thought she had to i think that maybe if she had come to us things would have been different you mean the pregnancy muriel nodded what makes you think that played into what happened to her just a mothers instinct i have no proof i just think it started with that bosch nodded but he couldnt blame the daughter for her secrets by the time he had been her age bosch had been on his own without real parents he had no idea what that relationship would have been like we spoke to commander garcia rider said he told us that several years ago he returned your daughters journal to you do you still have that muriel looked alarmed i read part of it every night youre not going to take that away from me are you its my bible we need to borrow it and make a copy of it commander garcia should have made a copy back then but he didnt i dont want to lose it you wont mrs verloren i promise well copy it and get it right back to you do you want it now its by my bed yes if you could get it muriel verloren left them and disappeared down a hallway that led toward the left side of the house bosch looked at rider and raised his eyebrows in a whatdoyouthink sort of way rider shrugged meaning that they would talk about it later once my daughter wanted to get another cat bosch whispered my ex said no one was enough now i know why rider was smiling inappropriately when muriel came back in carrying a small book with a flowery cover and the words my journal embossed in gold on it the gold was flaking off the book had been handled a lot she gave it to rider who went out of her way to handle it reverently if you dont mind mrs verloren wed like to look around bosch said to sort of connect what weve seen and read in the book with the actual layout of the house what book oh im sorry thats copspeak all the investigative records from the case are kept in a large binder we call it a book a murder book yes thats right is it all right if we look around i would like to look at the back door and look around out back too she signaled with a raised arm which way they should go bosch and rider got up its changed muriel said it used to be there were no houses up there youd go out our door and walk straight up the mountain but they terraced it now there are houses millions of dollars they built a mansion on the spot where my baby was found i hate it there was nothing to say to that bosch just nodded and followed her down a short hallway and into the kitchen there was a door with a glass window in it it led to the backyard muriel unlocked the door and they all stepped out the yard was on a steep incline that led to a grove of eucalyptus trees through the trees bosch could see the spanishtiled roofline of a large house it used to be all open up there muriel said just trees now there are houses its got a gate they dont let me walk up there like i used to they think im a bag lady or something because i liked to go up there sometimes and have a picnic at beckys spot bosch nodded and thought for a moment about a mother having a picnic at the spot where her daughter was murdered he tried to drop the idea and instead study the terrain of the hillside the autopsy had said becky verloren weighed ninetysix pounds even as light as that it would have been a struggle taking her up that incline he wondered about the possibility that there had been more than one killer he thought of bailey sable saying they he looked at muriel verloren who was standing still and silent her eyes closed she had canted her head so that the late afternoon sun warmed her face bosch wondered if this was some form of communion with her lost daughter as if sensing that they were looking at her she spoke keeping her eyes closed i love this place ill never leave can we look at your daughters bedroom bosch asked she opened her eyes just wipe your feet when we go back inside she led them back through the kitchen and into the hallway the stairway up began next to the door that led to the garage the door was open and bosch caught a glimpse of a battered minivan surrounded by stacks of boxes and things muriel verloren had apparently collected on her rounds he also noted how close the door to the garage was to the stairs he didnt know whether this meant anything but he recalled the summary report in the murder book that suggested the killer had hidden somewhere in the house and waited for the family to go to sleep the garage was the likely place the stairway was narrow because there were boxes of yard sale purchases lining one side all the way up rider went first muriel signaled for bosch to go next and when he passed by her she whispered to him do you have children he nodded knowing his answer would hurt a daughter she nodded back never let her out of your sight bosch didnt tell her that she lived with her mother far out of his sight he just nodded and started up the stairs on the second floor there was a landing and two bedrooms with a bathroom in between them becky verlorens bedroom was to the rear with windows that looked up the hillside the door was closed and muriel opened it when they stepped inside they stepped into a time warp the room was unchanged from the seventeenyearold photos bosch had studied in the murder book the rest of the house was crowded with junk and the detritus from a disintegrated life but the room where becky verloren had slept and talked on the phone and written in her secret journal was unchanged it had now been preserved longer than the girl had actually lived bosch stepped further into the room and looked around silently even the cat didnt intrude here the air smelled clean and fresh this is just how it was on the morning she was gone muriel said except i made the bed bosch looked at the quilt with the cats on it it flowed over the edges and draped down to the bed skirt which flowed neatly to the floor you and your husband were sleeping on the other side of the house right bosch asked yes rebecca was at that age where she wanted her privacy there are two bedrooms downstairs on the other side of the house her first bedroom was down there but when she was fourteen she moved up here bosch nodded and looked around before asking anything else how often do you come up here mrs verloren rider asked every single day sometimes when i cant sleepwhich is a lot of the timei come in here and lie down i dont get under the covers though i want it to be her bed bosch realized he was nodding again as if what she had said made some sort of sense to him he stepped over to the vanity there were photos slid into the frame of the mirror bosch recognized a young bailey sable in one of them there was also a photo of becky by herself in front of the eiffel tower she was wearing a black beret none of the other kids from the art club trip were present also on the mirror was a photo of a boy with becky it looked like they were on a ride at disneyland or maybe just down at the santa monica pier who is this he asked muriel came over and looked the boy thats danny kotchof her first boyfriend bosch nodded the boy who had moved to hawaii when he moved away it just broke her heart muriel added when exactly was that the summer before in june right after her freshman year and his sophomore he was a year older why did the family move do you know dannys dad worked for a rentacar company and he got transferred to a new franchise in maui it was a promotion bosch glanced at rider to see if she picked up on the significance of the information muriel had just given them rider subtly shook her head once she didnt get it but bosch wanted to pursue it did danny go to hillside prep he asked yes thats where they met muriel said bosch looked down at the vanity and noticed a cheap souvenir snow globe with the eiffel tower in it some of the water had evaporated leaving a bubble in the top of the globe and the tip of the tower poking from the water into the air pocket was danny in the art club he asked did he make the trip to paris with her no they moved away before muriel said he left in june and the club went to paris the last week of august did she ever see or hear from danny again he asked oh yes they sent letters back and forth and there were phone calls at first they phoned back and forth but it got too expensive and then danny did all the calling every night before bedtime that lasted almost right up until until she was gone bosch reached up and removed the photo from the mirrors border he looked closely at danny kotchof what happened when your daughter was taken how did danny find out how did he react well we called there and told his father so that he could sit danny down and tell him the bad news we were told he did not take it well who would the father told danny did either you or your husband talk directly to danny no but danny wrote me a long letter about becky and how much she meant to him it was very sad and very sweet everything was im sure it was did he come to the funeral no no he didnt his uh his parents thought it best for him if he stayed there in the islands the trauma you know mr kotchof called and said he wouldnt be coming bosch nodded he turned from the mirror sliding the photo into his pocket muriel didnt notice what about after he asked after the letter i mean did he ever contact you maybe call and talk to you no i dont think we ever heard from him not since the letter do you still have that letter rider asked of course i kept everything i have a drawer full of letters we got about rebecca she was a wellloved girl we need to borrow that letter from you mrs verloren bosch said we also might need to look through the whole drawer at some point why because you never know bosch said because we want to leave no stone unturned rider added we know this is disruptive but please remember what we are doing we want to find the person who did this to your daughter it has been a long time but that doesnt mean anybody should get away with it muriel verloren nodded she had absentmindedly picked up a small decorative pillow off the bed and was clutching it with both hands in front of her chest it looked like it might have been made by her daughter many years ago it was a small blue square with a red felt heart sewn across its middle holding it made muriel verloren look like a target while bosch drove rider read the letter danny kotchof had sent to the verlorens after beckys murder it was a single page filled mostly with his fond memories of their lost daughter all i can tell you is that i am so sorry this had to happen i will miss her always love danny and thats it whats the postmark on it she flipped over the envelope and looked at it maui july twentyninth nineteen eightyeight sure took his time writing it maybe it was hard for him why are you keying on him harry im not its just that garcia and green relied on a phone call to clear him you remember what it said in the book it said the kids supervisor said he was washing cars at the rentacar agency the day of and the day after no time to fly to la kill becky and get back home in time for work yeah so well now we find out from muriel that his old man ran a rentacar there was nothing about that in the murder book did garcia and green know that how much you want to bet that dad was running the place where the son washed cars how much you want to bet that the supervisor who alibied the son was working for the father man i was kidding about going to paris sounds like youre jonesing for a trip to maui i just dont like sloppy work it leaves loose ends we have to talk to danny kotchof and clear him ourselves if thats even possible after so many years autotrack baby that might find him for us it wont clear him even if we knock down his alibi what are you saying that this sixteenyearold kid snuck over here from hawaii knocked off his old girlfriend and then went back without anybody seeing him maybe it wasnt planned like that and he was seventeenmuriel said he was a year older oh seventeen she said sarcastically as if that made all the difference in the world when i was eighteen i got a leave from vietnam to hawaii you were not allowed to go stateside from there once i got there i changed clothes bought a civilianlooking suitcase and walked right by the mps to get on a plane to la i think a seventeenyearold could have done it okay harry look all im saying is that it was sloppy work according to the murder book green and garcia cleared this guy with a phone call theres nothing in there about checking airlines and now its too late it bugs me i understand but just remember we have a logic triangle we have to complete we can connect danny to becky easy enough and the gun connects becky to mackey but what connects danny to mackey bosch nodded it was a good point but it didnt make him feel any better about danny kotchof another thing is what he wrote in that letter he said he said he was sorry that it had to happen had to happenwhat does that mean its just a figure of speech harry you cant build a case on it im not talking about building a case on it i just wonder why he chose to say it that way if hes still alive well find him and youll get to ask him they had crossed under the and were in panorama city bosch dropped the discussion of danny kotchof and rider brought up muriel verloren shes frozen solid rider said yeah its pitiful there was no reason for them to take the daughter up the hill they might as well have killed everybody in the house they did anyway bosch thought that was a harsh way of looking at it but didnt say anything them he asked instead what you said there was no reason for them to take the daughter up the hill you sound like bailey sable i dont know looking at that hill it would have been tough for one person its steep back there yeah i was thinking the same thing two people your idea about spooking mackey is getting better if he was there he could lead us to the otherwhether its kotchof or somebody else bosch turned south on van nuys boulevard and stopped in front of an aging apartment complex that covered half the block it was called the panorama view suites there was a sign that said rental office to the left of the glass doors of the lobby it also announced that units were available on a monthly and weekly basis bosch put the transmission into park besides kotchof what else were you thinking harry i was thinking that i want to track down and talk to the other two friends maybe you can take the lesbian but the father is my priorityif we can find him okay you take the father and ill take the lesbian maybe ill get to go up to san francisco its hayward and if you need help i know an inspector up there who will track her down and save la the cost of the trip you are really no fun harry id like to hang out with the northern sisters did the chief know about you not at first when he found out he didnt care bosch nodded he liked the chief for that what else rider asked sam weiss who is that the burglary victim the one whose gun was used to kill the girl why him they didnt have roland mackey back then might be worth running the name by him check after that i think well be ready to make the play with mackey see how he reacts then lets get this over with and then go talk to pratt they cracked the doors at the same time and got out as bosch came around the suv he could feel her looking at him studying him what he asked theres something else what do you mean with you when you get that little crease on your left eyebrow i know somethings going on my exwife always told me id make a bad poker player too many tells well what is it i dont know yet something about that room back at the house her bedroom you mean like it was creepy her keeping it like that no actually her keeping it was okay with me i think i get that its something else something wrong something different ill grind it out and let you know when i know okay harry thats what youre good at they went through the glass doors into the panorama view suites in ten minutes they confirmed what they knew going in that mackey had moved out soon after he had completed his probation as expected hed left no forwarding address abel pratt was behind his desk eating a concoction of yogurt and cornflakes out of a plastic tub he made both a sucking and crackling sound as he ate and it was getting on boschs nerves they had been sitting with him for twenty minutes updating him on the days progress on the cold hit shit im still hungry he said after finishing the last spoonful what is that the south beach diet rider asked no just my own thing what i need though is the south bureau diet really and what is the south bureau diet bosch could feel rider tense the south bureau encompassed the majority of the citys black community she had to wonder if what pratt had just said was some sort of backhanded racial comment bosch had often seen in the department the elevation of the us versus them ethic to the point that white cops would make racially tinged comments in front of black or latino cops simply because they believed that within the rank and file the color blue superseded skin color rider was about to find out if pratt was one of these cops put down your antenna pratt said all im saying is that i worked in south for ten years and i never had to worry about my weight youre always on the run down there then i got to rhd and gained fifteen pounds in two years its sad rider relaxed and so did bosch get off your ass and knock on doors bosch said that was the rule in hollywood good rule pratt said except its hard when they put you in charge i have to sit in here and hear about how you guys get to knock on doors but you get the big bucks rider said oh yeah this was a joke because as a supervisor pratt could not pull overtime but those on his squad could thereby setting up the possibility that some of his detectives would make more than him even though he was the unit boss pratt turned in his chair and opened a cooler on the floor beside him he took out another tub of yogurt fuck it he said as he straightened up and opened it he didnt add cornflakes this time bosch only had to put up with the slurping as he started spooning the white gunk into his mouth okay back to this pratt said his mouth full of it what you are telling me is that at the end of the day you can tie the gun to this mope mackey he fired this weapon but youve got nobody who ties him to the victim yet and therefore you cannot tie him to the fatal shot that and other things rider said so if i was a defense lawyer pratt continued i would have mackey cop to the burglary because the statute of limitations has long expired he would say the gun bit him when he tried it out so he got rid of the damn thinglong before any murder hed say no sir i didnt kill that little girl with it and you cant prove i did you cant prove i ever laid eyes on her rider and bosch nodded so you got nothing they nodded again not bad for a days work what do you want to do about it we want a wiretap bosch said two maybe three locations one on his cell one on the phone at the gas station and then one on his home once we find it and if hes got a line there we plant a story in the paper that says were working the case again and make sure he sees it then we see if he talks about it with anybody and what makes you think he would talk to someone else about a murder he may or may not have committed seventeen years ago because like we said so far we cant connect this guy to the girl in any way so were thinking there is somebody in the middle in this thing mackey either did this for somebody or he got the gun for that somebody to do it himself there is a third possibility rider added that he helped that girl was carried up a steep hillside it was either somebody big or somebody with help pratt took two spoonfuls of yogurt frowning as he looked down into the tub before responding okay what about the newspaper you going to be able to make a plant we think so rider said were going to use commander garcia of valley bureau he was on the case originally haunted by the one that got away that sort of pitch he says hes got a connection at the daily news okay sounds like a plan write up the warrants and give them to me the captain has to approve them and then they go to the das office for approval before going to the judge its going to take some time once we get a judge to okay it well take the other teams off what theyre doing and put them on the wire while you watch our guy bosch and rider stood up at the same time bosch felt a little charge of adrenaline drop into his blood theres no chance this guy mackey is into something right now is there pratt asked what do you mean bosch asked its just that if we could make a case that he was about to commit a crime we could probably expedite the warrants bosch thought about this we dont have that now he said but we could work on it good that would help rider was the writer she had an ease with the computer as well as the language of law bosch had seen her put these skills to use on several previous investigations so their decision was unspoken she would write the warrants seeking court authorization to trace and listen to calls made by or to roland mackey on his cell phone the office phone at the service station where he worked and his home if an additional phone existed there it would be painstaking work she had to lay out the case against mackey making sure the chain of logic and probable cause had no weak links her paper case had to first convince pratt then captain norona then a deputy district attorney charged with making sure local law enforcement did not run roughshod over civil liberties and finally a judge who had the same responsibilities but also answered to the electorate should he make a mistake that blew up in his face they had one shot at this and they had to do it right rather rider had to do it right but all of that came after the initial hurdle of getting mackeys various phone numbers without tipping the suspect to the investigation taking form around him they started with tampa towing which ran a halfpage ad in the yellow pages that carried two hour phone numbers next a call to directory assistance established that mackey had no hardwired phone listing private or otherwise in his name it meant he either had no phone at his home or he was living in a place where the phone was registered to someone else that could be dealt with later once they established mackeys residence last and most difficult was mackeys cell phone number directory assistance did not carry cell listings to check every cellular service provider for a listing could take days if not weeks because most required a courtordered search warrant before revealing a customers private number instead law enforcement investigators routinely planned ruses in order to get the numbers they needed this often entailed leaving innocuous messages at workplaces so that the cell phone number could be captured upon callback the most popular of these was the standard callbackforyourprize message promising a television or dvd player to the first one hundred people who returned the call however this involved setting up a nonpolice line and could also result in long waiting periods with no guarantee of success if the target had masked his or her cell number rider and bosch did not feel they had the luxury of time they had put mackeys name out into the public they had to move quickly toward their goal dont worry bosch told rider ive got a plan then ill just sit back and watch the master since he knew mackey was on duty at the service station bosch simply called the station and said he needed a tow he was told to hold on and then a voice he believed belonged to roland mackey came onto the line you need a tow either a tow or a jump i cant get it started where the albertsons parking lot on topanga near devonshire were all the way over on tampa you can get somebody closer i know but i live by you guys right off roscoe and behind the hospital okay then what are you driving bosch thought of the car they had seen mackey in earlier he decided to use it to pull mackey off the fence seventytwo camaro restored im working on it it should be about fifteen minutes before im there okay great whats your name ro ro like row a boat like in roland man im on my way he hung up bosch and rider waited five minutes during which bosch told her the rest of the plan and what part she would play in it her goal was to get two things mackeys cell number and his service provider so that a search warrant authorizing the wiretap could be delivered to the proper company following boschs instructions rider called the chevron station and started making a service appointment going into great detail in describing the screeching her cars brakes made while she was in the middle of it bosch called the station on the second line listed in the phone book as expected rider was put on hold boschs call was answered and he said do you have a number i can reach ro on hes coming here to give me a jump and i got it started already mackeys harried coworker said try him on his cell he gave bosch the number and bosch flashed the thumbsup across the desk to rider she finished her call without breaking the act and hung up one down one to go bosch said you got the easy one rider said with mackeys number in hand rider took over while bosch listened on an extension putting a disinterested bureaucratic glaze over her voice she called the number and when mackey answeredpresumably while looking for a stalled camaro in a shopping center parking lotshe announced that she was his at ampt wireless provider and that she had some exciting news for savings over his current longdistance minutes plan bullshit mackey said interrupting her in the middle of her spiel excuse me sir rider replied i said bullshit this is some sort of scam to make me switch i dont understand sir i have you listed as an at ampt wireless customer is that not the case yeah thats not the fucking case im with sprint and i like it and i dont even have or want longdistance service so fuck off can you hear me now he hung up and rider started laughing this is an angry guy were dealing with she said well he just drove all the way across chatsworth for nothing bosch said id be angry too hes with sprint she said im ready to rock and roll on the paper but maybe you should call him so he wont be suspicious about you not calling when the guy in the shop tells him he gave out his number bosch nodded and called mackeys number thankfully it went to a message mackey was probably on the phone angrily telling the guy in the shop he could not find the car he was supposed to tow bosch left a message saying he was sorry but he was able to get his car started and was trying to get it home he closed his phone and looked at rider they talked some more about scheduling and decided that she would work exclusively on the warrant that night and the next day and then babysit it through the approval stages she said she wanted bosch with her when it got to the final approval having both members of the team in the judges chambers would help cement the deal until then bosch would continue to work the field tracking the remaining names on their list of people to be interviewed and putting the newspaper story in motion timing was going to be the issue they didnt want a story about the case in the newspaper until they had taps in place on the phones mackey used finessing all of this would be the key maneuver im going home harry rider said i can get this started on my laptop have a good one what will you do ive got a few things i want to get done tonight maybe go down to the toy district i think by yourself theyre only homeless people yeah and eighty percent of them are homeless because theyve got faulty wiring faulty plumbing the whole bit you be careful maybe you ought to call central division and see if theyll send a car with you maybe they can spare the uboat tonight the uboat was a singleofficer car primarily used as a gopher for the watch commander but bosch didnt think he needed a chaperone he told rider he would be all right and that she could go as soon as she showed him how to use the autotrack computer well harry first you have to have a computer i did it right from my laptop he came around to her side and watched as she went to the autotrack website entered password information and arrived at a template for a name search who do you want to start with she asked how about robert verloren she typed in the name and set parameters for the search how fast does this work bosch asked fast in a few minutes she had located an address trail for rebecca verlorens father but it stopped short at the house in chatsworth robert verloren had not updated his drivers license bought property registered to vote applied for a credit card or had a utilities account in over ten years he was a blank he had disappearedat least from the electronic grid he must still be on the street rider said if hes even still alive rider put the names tara wood and daniel kotchof through the autotrack moves and came up with multiple name hits for both of them but by using their approximate ages and focusing on hawaii and california they narrowed the searches to two address trails they believed belonged to the correct tara wood and daniel kotchof wood may not have gone to her high school reunion but it wasnt because she had moved far away she had only moved from the valley over the hills to santa monica meanwhile it appeared that daniel kotchof had returned from hawaii many years earlier lived in venice for a few years and then returned to maui where his current address was located the last name bosch gave rider to run through the computer was sam weiss the burglary victim whose gun was used to murder rebecca verloren though there were hundreds of hits on the name it was easy to find the right sam weiss he had never left the home where the burglary had taken place he even had the same phone number he had stood his ground rider printed everything out for bosch and also gave him the number for grace tanaka which they had gotten earlier from bailey sable she then gathered what she would need to work on the search warrant at home if you need me give me a page she said as she put her computer into a padded case after she was gone bosch checked the clock over pratts door and saw it was just past six he decided he would spend an hour or so chasing names before heading down to the toy district to look for robert verloren he knew he was just procrastinating over a search through the human throwaway zone that would be certain to leave him depressed so he checked the clock again and promised himself he would spend no more than an hour working the phone he decided to go with the locals first but quickly struck out calls to both tara wood and sam weiss went unanswered and connected him with automated message systems he left a message for wood identifying himself giving his cell phone number and mentioning that the call was in regard to becky verloren he hoped that mentioning her friends name would be enough to intrigue and draw a response from her with weiss he only left his name and number not wanting to forewarn him that the call was about what might be a source of guilt for the man who had indirectly provided the weapon that killed a sixteenyearold girl next he called grace tanakas number in hayward and she answered after six rings from the start she seemed put out by the call as if it had interrupted something important but her gruff manner and voice softened as soon as bosch said he was calling about rebecca verloren oh my god is something happening she asked the department has taken an avid interest in reinvestigating the case bosch said a name has come up this is an individual who may have been involved in the case in nineteen eightyeight and we are trying to figure out if he fit in with becky or her friends in any way whats his name she asked quickly roland mackey he was a couple years older than becky didnt go to hillside but he lived right there in chatsworth does the name mean anything to you not really i dont remember it how was he connected was he the father the father the police said she was pregnant i mean that she had been pregnant no we dont know if he was connected that way or not so you dont recognize the name no he goes by ro for short still dont and youre saying you didnt know about the pregnancy is that right i didnt none of us did i mean her friends bosch nodded even though he knew she couldnt see this he didnt say anything hoping that she might get uncomfortable with the silence and say something that might be of value um do you have a picture of this man she finally asked it wasnt what bosch was looking for yes he said ill have to figure out a way to get it up there for you to look at see if it jogs anything loose can you just scan it and email it bosch knew what she was asking him to do and while he could not do it himself he guessed that kiz rider probably could i think we could do that my partners the computer person and shes not here at the moment though ill give you my email address and she can send me the picture when she comes back bosch wrote the address she recited in his small notebook he told her shed get the email the following morning is there anything else detective bosch knew he could end the call and have rider take a shot at bonding with grace tanaka after the photo was sent to her but he decided not to miss the opportunity to start stirring emotions and memories maybe something would break loose i have just a few more questions uh that summer how would you characterize your relationship with becky what do you mean we were friends id known her since first grade right well were you the closest to her do you think no i think that would have been tara another confirmation that tara wood had been tightest with becky at the end so she didnt confide in you when she found out she was pregnant no i already told you i didnt know about it until after she was dead what about you did you confide in her of course i did everything detective what are you getting at did she know you were gay what did that have to do with anything im just trying to get a picture of the group the kitty kat club i think the four of you called no she said abruptly she didnt know none of them knew i dont think i even knew back then okay detective is that enough im sorry ms tanaka im just trying to get as full a picture as i can i appreciate your candor one last question if becky was at a clinic after going through the procedure and she needed a ride home because she didnt think she could drive who would she have called there was a long silence before grace tanaka answered i dont know detective i would have hoped that it would have been me that i was that kind of friend but obviously it was somebody else tara wood youll have to ask her good night detective bosch she hung up and bosch pulled open the yearbook so he could look at her photo she was a petite asian and the photoso many years olddidnt match the gruff demeanor of the voice he had just heard on the phone bosch wrote a note for rider that contained the email address and instructions to scan and send the photo of mackey he also wrote a short warning about his encountering resistance from tanaka when he brought up her sexuality he slid the note over to her desk so she would see it first thing in the morning that left one last call this one to daniel kotchof who lived according to autotrack in maui where it was two hours earlier he called the number he had gotten from the autotrack search and a woman answered the line she said she was daniel kotchofs wife and told bosch that her husband was at work at the four seasons hotel where he was employed as the hospitality manager bosch called the work number she gave him and was put through to daniel kotchof he said he could only talk for a few minutes and put bosch on hold for five of them while he went to a more private spot in the hotel to talk when he finally came back on the line the call started out unproductively like grace tanaka he did not recognize the name roland mackey he also seemed to treat the call as a nuisance or an intrusion he explained that he was married and had three children and that he rarely thought about becky verloren anymore he reminded bosch that he and his family had moved from the mainland a year before her death but i was led to believe that after you moved to hawaii you two continued to call each other quite often bosch said i dont know who told you that kotchof said i mean we talked especially at first i would have to call her cause she said her parents told her it was too much money for her to call me i thought that was kind of bogus they just wanted me out of the picture is all so i had to call but it was like whats the use i was in hawaii and she was in la it was over man and pretty soon i got a girlfriend herein fact shes my wife nowand i stopped calling beck that was it until you know later when i heard about what happened and the detective called me did you know about it before the detective called yeah id heard mrs verloren called my dad and he broke the news to me i also got some calls on it from some of my friends out there they knew id want to know about it it was weird man this girl that i knew gets wiped out like that yeah bosch thought about what else he could ask kotchofs story conflicted in small ways with muriel verlorens account he knew he would need to square the stories at some point kotchofs alibi also continued to bother him hey look detective i should get going kotchof said im at work is there anything else just a few more questions do you remember how long before rebeccas death it was that you stopped calling her um i dont know somewhere around the end of that first summer something like that it had been a while almost a year bosch decided to try to rattle kotchof and see what came out it was something he would rather have attempted in person but there was no time or money for a trip to hawaii so your relationship was definitely over by the time of her death yes definitely bosch thought the chances of recovering phone records from back then were not very high when you were still calling was it always at a certain time you know like an appointment sort of i was two hours behind so i couldnt call too late i usually called right after dinner and that was right before she was going to go to bed but like i said it didnt last too long okay now i have to ask you something pretty personal did you have sex with rebecca verloren there was a pause whats that got to do with this i cant explain that dan but it is part of the investigation and it could have a bearing on the case do you mind answering no bosch waited but kotchof said nothing else is that your answer bosch finally asked you two never had sex we never did she said she wasnt ready and i didnt push it look i have to go okay dan just a few more im sure you would like for us to catch the guy who did this right yes right its just that im at work yes you said that let me ask you when was the last time you saw rebecca i dont remember the exact date but it was like the day we left when we said goodbye that morning so you never came back from hawaii once your family moved no not at first i mean ive been back since i lived in venice for a couple years after i finished school but then i came back here but not between the time your family moved and the time of rebeccas murder is that what you are saying yes right so if another witness i have spoken to said she saw you in town that weekend of july fourth right before rebecca disappeared then she would be wrong about that yeah shed be wrong look what is this i told you i never went back i had a new girlfriend i mean i didnt even go back for the funeral who told you they saw me was it grace she never liked methat dyke she was always trying to get me in trouble with beck i cant tell you who it is dan just like if you want to tell me something in confidence then i will respect that whoever it is shes a fucking liar kotchof said his voice turning shrill that is a goddamn lie check your records man i had an alibi i was working on the day she was taken and i was working the next day too how could i have gotten there and back whoever told you that is totally fucking bogus its your alibi that is bogus dan your old man could have put your supervisor up to it that was easy a moment of silence passed before there was a response i dont know what you are talking about my father didnt put anybody up to anything and thats a goddamn fact we had the time cards and my boss talked to the cops and that was it now you come along seventeen years later with this shit are you fucking kidding me okay dan take it easy sometimes people make mistakes especially when you are going back all those years this is all i need to be dragged into this man ive got a family over here i said take it easy you arent dragged into anything this is just a phone call just a conversation okay now is there anything else you can tell me or want to tell me to help with this thing no i told you all i know which is nothing and i have to go i mean it this time so were you upset when rebecca told you she was pregnant and it was obvious to you that it was with another guy there was no answer at first so bosch tried to turn the screw a bit especially since she would never have relations with you when you two were together bosch realized he had gone too far and tipped his hand kotchof realized that bosch was playing good cop and bad cop with him all at once when he responded his voice was calm and modulated she never told me that he said i never knew until it came out after really who told you i cant remember one of my friends i guess really because rebecca kept a journal and youre all over it man and she says she told you and you werent too happy about it now kotchof laughed and bosch knew he had really blown it detective you are full of shit youre the one whos lying this is really weak man i mean i watch law and order you know do you watch csi yeah so well we got the killers dna if we match it to somebody theyre going to take a fall dna is the ultimate closer good check mine and maybe this can all be over for me bosch knew he was the one backpedaling now he had to end the call okay then dan well let you know about that meantime thank you for your help one last question whats a hospitality manager you mean here at the hotel i take care of large parties and conferences and weddings and things like that i make sure it all runs smoothly when these big groups come in here okay well ill let you get back to it have a good day bosch hung up and sat at the desk thinking about the call he was embarrassed by how he had let the upper hand slip across the line to kotchof he knew his interviewing skills had largely been dormant for three years but that did not salve the burn he knew he had to get better and it had to be soon aside from that there was a lot of content from the call to consider he didnt read much into kotchofs angry reaction to supposedly being seen in la right before the murder after all bosch had fabricated the witness and kotchofs angry response would certainly be justified but what was notable was how kotchofs anger zeroed in on grace tanaka their relationship might be worth exploring further maybe through kiz rider he also considered kotchofs statement about not knowing about rebecca verlorens pregnancy bosch instinctively believed him all in all it didnt drop kotchof from the suspect list but it at least pushed him to a back burner he would discuss all of kotchofs answers with rider and see if she agreed the most interesting information gleaned from the call was in the conflicts between kotchofs memories and those of muriel verloren the victims mother muriel verloren had said kotchof had called her daughter religiously right up until the time of her death kotchof said he had done no such thing bosch didnt see any reason for kotchof to lie about it if he hadnt then muriel verlorens memory was wrong or it was her daughter who had lied about who called her every night before bed since the girl was hiding a relationship and the pregnancy that came from it it seemed likely that the phone calls did come in every night but they were not from kotchof they were from someone else someone bosch started thinking of as mr x after looking up muriel verlorens number in the murder book bosch called the house he apologized for intruding and said he had a few followup questions muriel said she was not bothered by the call what are your questions i saw the phone on the table next to your daughters bed was that an extension of the house phone or did she have her own phone number she had her own number a private line so when daniel kotchof called her at night she would be the one who answered the phone right yes in her room it was the only extension so the only way you know that danny was calling was because she told you no i heard the phone ring sometimes he called what i mean mrs verloren is that you never answered those calls and you never talked to danny kotchof right thats right it was her private line so when that phone rang and she talked to somebody the only way you would know who it was on the line was if she told you is that correct uh yes i guess that is right are you saying it wasnt danny who called all of those times im not sure yet but i talked to danny in hawaii and he said he stopped calling your daughter long before she was taken he had a new girlfriend you see in hawaii this information was treated with a long pause finally bosch spoke into the void do you have any idea who it could have been that she was talking to mrs verloren after another pause muriel verloren weakly offered an answer maybe one of her girlfriends its possible bosch said anybody else you can think of i dont like this she responded quickly its like im learning things all over again im sorry mrs verloren i will try not to hit you with these sorts of things unless it is necessary but i am afraid this is necessary did you and your husband ever come to any conclusion about the pregnancy what do you mean we didnt know about it until after i understand that what i mean is did you think it came out of a hidden relationship or was it simply a mistake she made one day with you know someone she was not really in a relationship with you mean like a onenight stand is that what you are saying about my daughter no maam i am not saying anything about your daughter i am simply asking questions i do not want to upset you but i want to find the person who killed rebecca and i need to know all there is to know we could never explain it detective she responded coldly she was gone and we decided not to delve into it we left everything to the police and we just tried to remember the daughter we knew and loved you said you have a daughter i hope you understand i think i do thank you for your answers one last questionand there is no pressure on thisbut would you be willing to talk to a newspaper reporter about your daughter and the case why would i do that i didnt before i dont believe in putting it out there for the public i admire that but this time i want you to do it because it might help us flush out the bird you mean it might make the person who did this come out from cover exactly then id do it in a heartbeat thank you mrs verloren i will let you know abel pratt came out of his office with his suit jacket on he noticed bosch sitting at his desk in the alcove using two fingers to type up a report on his telephone conversation with muriel verloren the finished reports on the phone interviews with grace tanaka and daniel kotchof were on the desk wheres kiz pratt asked shes working on the warrant at home she can think better there i cant think when i get home i can only react i have twin boys good luck yeah i need it im going that way now ill see you tomorrow harry okay but pratt didnt walk away bosch looked up from the typewriter at him he thought maybe something was wrong maybe it was the typewriter i found this on a desk on the other side bosch said it didnt look like it was being used by anybody it wasnt most people use their computers now you are definitely an oldschool kind of guy harry i guess kiz usually does the reports but i have some time to kill working late ive got to go over to the nickel fifth street what do you want over there looking for our victims father pratt shook his head somberly another one of those weve seen it before bosch nodded ripples he said yeah ripples pratt agreed bosch was thinking about offering to walk out with pratt maybe have a conversation and get to know him better but his cell phone started to chirp he pulled it off his belt and saw the name sam weiss in the caller id screen i better take this all right harry be careful over there thanks boss he flipped open the phone detective bosch he said detective bosch remembered he had left no information on his message to weiss mr weiss my name is harry bosch i am a detective with the lapd id like to ask you a few questions about an investigation i am conducting i have all the time you need detective is this about my gun the question caught bosch off guard why would you ask that sir well because i know it was used in a murder that was never solved and thats the only thing i can think of that the lapd would want to ask me about well yes sir its about the gun can i talk to you about it if it means you are trying to find who killed that girl then you can ask me anything you want thank you i guess the first thing id like is for you to tell me how and when you knew or were told that the weapon stolen from you was used in a homicide it was in the papersthe murder wasand i put two and two together i called the detective assigned to my burglary and asked and got the answer i wish i hadnt why is that mr weiss because ive had to live with it but you didnt do anything wrong sir i know that but it doesnt make a person feel any better i bought that gun because i was having trouble with a bunch of punks i wanted protection then the gun i bought ended up being the instrument of death for that young girl dont think i havent thought about changing history i mean what if i wasnt so stubborn what if i just pulled up stakes and moved instead of going and buying that damn thing you see what i mean yes i see now that said what else can i tell you detective i have just a few questions calling you was sort of a shot in the dark i thought it might be easier than trying to find my way back through seventeen years of paperwork and department history i have the initial report on the burglary and the investigator is listed as john mcclellan do you remember him sure i remember him did he ever clear the case not as far as i know at first john thought it might have been connected to the punks who had threatened me and was it john told me no but i was never sure the burglars really tore the place apart it wasnt like they were really looking for stuff to steal they were just destroying thingsmy belongings i walked in this place and man i could feel a lot of anger why do you say burglars did the police think it was more than one john figured it had to be at least two or three i was only gone an hourwent to the store one guy couldnt have done all that damage in that time the report lists the gun a coin collection and some cash that was taken anything else come up missing after no that was it that was enough at least i got the coins back and that was the most valuable thing it was my fathers collection from when he was a boy how did you get it back john mcclellan he brought them back to me a couple weeks later did he say where he recovered them from he said a pawnshop in west hollywood and then of course we know what became of the gun but that was not given back to me i wouldnt have taken it anyway i understand sir did detective mcclellan ever tell you who he thought burglarized your home did he have any theories he thought it was just another set of punks you know not the chatsworth eights the mention of the chatsworth eights stirred something in bosch but he couldnt place it mr weiss act like i dont know anything who were the chatsworth eights it was a gang out here in the valley they were all white kids skinheads and back in nineteen eightyeight they committed a number of crimes out here they were hate crimes thats what they called them in the papers back then it was the new term for crimes motivated by race or religion and you were the target of this gang yeah i started getting calls the typical killthejew stuff but then the police told you the eights did not commit the burglary thats right strange isnt it they didnt see any connection thats what i thought at the time but he was the detective not me what made the eights target you mr weiss i know you are jewish but what made them pick you out simple one of the little shits was a kid who lived in my neighborhood billy burkhart was four houses away i put a menorah in my window during chanukah and thats when it all started what happened to burkhart he went to jail not for what he did to me but to others they got him and the others on other crimes they burned a cross a few blocks from me in the front lawn of a black family and they did other things mean things vandalism they tried to burn a temple too but not the burglary at your house thats right thats what the police told me you see there was no graffiti or indication of religious motivation the place was just torn apart so they didnt classify the burglary as a hate crime bosch hesitated wondering if there was anything else to ask he decided he didnt know enough to ask smart questions okay mr weiss i appreciate your time and i am sorry to reawaken bad memories dont worry about it detective believe me they werent asleep bosch closed the phone he tried to think of whom he could call about all of this he didnt know john mcclellan and the chances of his still being in devonshire division seventeen years later were slim then it hit him jerry edgar his old partner at hollywood division had previously been assigned to devonshire detectives he would have been there in bosch called the hollywood homicide table but got the machine everybody had cut out early he called the main detective bureau number and asked if edgar was around bosch knew that there was a signout chart at the front counter the clerk who answered the phone said edgar had signed out for the day the third call was to edgars cell phone his old partner answered it promptly you guys go home early in hollywood bosch said who the hell isharry that you that me hows it hanging jerry i was wondering when id hear from you you start again today the worlds oldest boot and i already got a hot shot kiz and i are working a breaking case edgar didnt respond and bosch knew mentioning rider had been a mistake the gulf between them not only still existed but was apparently frozen over anyway i need to tap into that big brain of yours this is going back to club dev days yeah which day nineteen eightyeight the chatsworth eights you remember them there was silence while edgar thought for a moment yeah i remember the eights they were a bunch of peckerwoods that thought shaved heads and tattoos made them men they did a lot of shit then they got stepped on they didnt last long you remember a guy named roland mackey wouldve been about eighteen back then after a pause edgar said he didnt remember the name who was working the eights bosch asked not club dev man everything with them went straight down the rabbit hole pdu you got it the public disorder unit a shadowy downtown squad that gathered data and intelligence on conspiracies but made few cases back in the pdu would have been under the aegis of then commander irvin irving the unit was not in existence anymore when irving rose to the level of deputy chief he promptly disbanded the pdu with many in the department believing it was a measure taken to cover up and distance himself from its activities thats not going to help bosch said sorry about that what are you working the murder of a girl up on oat mountain the one taken out of her house yeah i remember that one too i didnt work iti had just gotten to the homicide table but i remember that one youre saying the eights were in on that one no just that a name came up that might have a connection to the eights might so does eights mean what i think yeah man eight for h eightyeight for hh and hh for heil hitler yeah i thought so then it struck bosch that kiz rider had been right when she thought the year of the crime might be significant the murder and the rest of the crimes committed by the chatsworth eights had occurred in it was all part of a confluence of seemingly small things coming together and now irvin irving and the pdu were mixed into the soup as well a cold hit match of dna to a loser who drove a tow truck for a living was blossoming into something bigger jerry you remember a guy who worked at devonshire named john mcclellan john mcclellan no i dont remember what did he work i got his name here on a burglary report no definitely not the burglary table i worked burglary before going over to homicide there was no john mcclellan on burglary who is he like i said just a name on a report ill figure it out bosch knew that this meant mcclellan was likely in the pdu at the time and the investigation of the burglary of sam weisss home was folded into the investigation of the chatsworth eights he didnt care to discuss all of this with edgar jerry so you were new on the homicide table back then thats right did you know green and garcia very well not really i just got to the table and they werent there that long after green pulled the pin and about a year after that garcia made lieutenant from what you saw what was your take on them how so as homicide men well harry i was pretty fresh back then i mean what did i know i was still learning but the take on them was that green was the power garcia was just the housekeeper what some people said about garcia was that he couldnt find shit in his own mustache with a mirror and comb bosch didnt respond by labeling garcia a housekeeper edgar was saying that garcia rode his partners coattails green was the real homicide cop and garcia was the guy who backed him up and kept the murder books tidy and up to date a lot of partnerships got sanded down into such relationships an alpha dog and his assistant i guess he didnt need to edgar said didnt need to what find shit in his mustache he was going places man he made lieutenant and was out of there you know hes currently second in command in the valley right yeah i know in fact if you see him you might not want to mention that mustache bit yeah probably not bosch thought some more about what this might have meant to the verloren investigation a small crack was moving under the surface of things that it harry i heard green ate his gun not too long after pulling the pin yeah i heard that i dont remember being surprised he always looked like a guy carrying a full load of somethin you going to take a run at pdu harry you know that was irving s squad dont you yeah jerry i know i doubt im going that way be careful if you do my man bosch wanted to change the subject before hanging up edgar had always been a department gossip harry didnt want his old partners loose lips to spread the word that bosch was taking a run at irving now that he was back with a badge so hows things in hollywood he asked we just got back into the bureau after the earthquake retrofit you missed all of that we were stuck upstairs in roll call for like a year how is it its like an insurance office now we have pods and sound filters between the desks all done up in government gray nice but not the same i know what you mean then they gave the dthrees doublewidesdesks with two sides of drawers the rest of us get one side bosch smiled little slights like that got magnified in the department and the administrators who made such decisions never learned like when most of internal affairs moved out of parker center and into the old bradbury building and the word spread through the ranks that the captain over there had a fireplace in his office so what are you gonna do jerry same old same old thats what im gonna do get off my ass and knock on doors i hear you man watch your six harry always after hanging up bosch sat motionless at his desk for a few moments as he thought through the conversation and the new meanings it brought to the case if there was a connection between the case and pdu then they had a whole new ball game he looked down at the murder book still open to the burglary report and stared at the scrawled signature of john mcclellan he picked up the phone and called the department of operations in parker center and asked the duty officer for an assignment location for a detective named john mcclellan he read mcclellans badge number off the burglary report he was put on hold and expected that he would be told that mcclellan was long retired it had been seventeen years but when the duty officer came back on the line he reported that an officer named john mcclellan with the badge number bosch provided was now a lieutenant assigned to the office of strategic planning the synapse connections in boschs brain started tripping seventeen years ago mcclellan worked for irving in the pdu now the assignment and rank were different but he was still working for him and irving just happened to run into bosch in the parker center cafeteria on the day bosch caught a case with ties to the pdu high jingo bosch whispered to himself as he hung up like a battleship going into a turn the case was slowly surely and unstoppably moving in a new direction bosch could feel something building inside his chest he thought about the coincidence of irving crossing his path if it was a coincidence bosch wondered if the deputy chief already knew at that moment what case they had pulled the cold hit on and where it was going to lead the department buried secrets every day it was a given but who would have thought seventeen years ago that a chemical test run one day in a doj lab in sacramento might put a shovel into the greasy dirt and turn over the past bringing this secret to light driving home bosch thought about the many different tendrils of the investigation that were wrapping around the body of rebecca verloren he knew he had to keep his eyes on the prize the evidence was the key the elements of departmental politics and possible corruption and coverup all amounted to what was known as high jingo it could be threatening and distracting from the intended goal he had to avoid this at the same time that he had to be wary of it eventually he was able to push thoughts of irving s shadow over the investigation aside and concentrate on the case his thoughts somehow led him to rebeccas bedroom and how her mother had left it unchanged by time he wondered if it was the loss of the daughter that did it or was it the circumstances of the loss what if you lost a child by natural causes or accident or circumstances like divorce bosch had a daughter he rarely saw it weighed on him he knew that near or far his daughter left him completely vulnerable that he could end up like the mother who preserved a daughters bedroom like a museum or the father who was long lost to the world more so than this question something about the bedroom bothered him he couldnt quite reach what it was but he knew it was there and it nagged at him he looked from the elevated freeway out across hollywood to his left there was still some light in the sky but the evening was starting darkness had waited long enough searchlights that he knew could be traced down to the corner of hollywood and vine were crisscrossing the horizon to him it looked nice to him it looked like home when he got to his house on the hill he checked the mail and the phone for messages and then changed out of the suit he had bought for his return to the job he carefully hung it in the closet thinking he could wear it at least once more before having to take it in to the cleaners he put on blue jeans black sneakers and a black pullover shirt he put on a sport coat that was fraying on the right shoulder from his cutting corners too close he transferred his gun and badge and wallet then he got back into his car and headed downtown to the toy district he decided to park in japantown in the museum lot so he wouldnt have to worry about the car being broken into or vandalized from there he walked over to fifth street encountering an increasing density of homeless people as he progressed the citys primary homeless encampments and the missions that catered to them lined a fiveblock stretch of fifth street south of los angeles street the sidewalks outside the missions and cheap residence hotels were lined with cardboard boxes and shopping carts filled with the dirty and meager belongings of lost people it was as if some sort of social disintegration bomb had gone off and the shrapnel of damaged disenfranchised lives had been hurled everywhere up and down the street there were men and women yelling their shouts unintelligible or simply eerie non sequiturs in the night it felt like a city with its own rule and reason a hurt city with a wound so deep that the bandages the missions applied could not stop the bleeding as he walked bosch noted that he was not asked once for money or cigarettes or any kind of handout the irony was not lost on him it appeared that the place with the highest concentration of homeless people in the city was also the place where a citizen was safest from their entreaties if nothing else the los angeles mission and the salvation army had major help centers here bosch decided to start with them he had a twelveyearold drivers license photo of robert verloren and an even older photograph of him at his daughters funeral he showed these to the people operating the help centers and the kitchen workers who put free food on hundreds of plates every day he got little response until a kitchen worker remembered verloren as a client who came through the chow line pretty regularly a few years before its been a while the man said havent seen him after spending an hour in each center bosch started working his way down the street stepping into the smaller missions and flop hotels and showing the photos he got a few recognitions of verloren but nothing fresh nothing to lead him to the man who had completely dropped off the human radar screen so many years before he worked it until tenthirty and decided he would return the next day to finish canvassing the street as he walked back toward japantown he was depressed by what he had just immersed himself in and by the dwindling hopes of finding robert verloren he walked with his head down hands in his pockets and therefore didnt see the two men until they had already seen him they stepped out of the alcoves of two sidebyside toy stores as bosch passed one blocked his path the other stepped out behind him bosch stopped hey missionary man said the one in front of him in the dim glow from a streetlight half a block away bosch saw the glint of a blade down at the mans side he turned slightly to check the man behind him he was smaller bosch wasnt sure but it looked like he was simply holding a chunk of concrete in his hand a piece of broken curb both men were dressed in layers a common sight in this part of the city one was black and one was white the kitchens are all closed up and were still hungry said the one with the knife you got a few bucks for us you know like we could borrow bosch shook his head no not really not really you sure bout that boy you look like you got a nice fat wallet on you now dont be holding back on us a black rage grew in bosch in a moment of sharp focus he knew what he could and would do he would draw his weapon and put bullets into both of these men in that same instant he knew he would walk away from it after a cursory departmental investigation the glint of the blade was boschs ticket and he knew it the men on either side of him didnt know what they had just walked into it was like being in the tunnels so many years before everything closed down to a tight space nothing but kill or be killed there was something absolutely pure about it no gray areas and no room for anything else then suddenly the moment changed bosch saw the one with the knife staring intently at him reading something in his eyes one predator taking the measure of another the knife man seemed to grow smaller by an almost imperceptible measure he backed off without physically backing off bosch knew there were people considered to be mind readers the truth was they were face readers their skill was interpreting the myriad muscle constructions of the eyes the mouth the eyebrows from this they decoded intent bosch had a level of skill in this his exwife made a living playing poker because she had an even higher skill the man with the knife had a measure of this skill as well it had surely saved his life this time nah never mind said the man he took a step back toward the stores alcove have a good night missionary man he said as he retreated into the darkness bosch fully turned and looked at the other man without a word he too stepped back into his crack to hide and wait for the next victim bosch looked up and down the street it seemed deserted now he turned and headed on toward his ride as he walked he took out his cell phone and called the central division patrol office he told the watch sergeant about the two men he encountered and asked him to send a patrol car that kind of stuff happens on every block down there in that hellhole the sergeant said what do you want me to do about it i want you to send a car and roust them theyll think twice about doing anything to anybody well why didnt you do anything about it yourself because im working a case sergeant and i cant get off it to do your job or your paperwork look buddy dont be telling me how to do my job you suits are all the same you think look sergeant im going to check the crime reports in the morning if i read that somebody got hurt down here and the suspects were a black and white team then youre going to have more suits around you than at the mens warehouse i guarantee it bosch closed his phone cutting off a last protest from the watch sergeant he picked up his pace got to his car and started back over to the freeway he then headed back up to the valley finding cover with a visual line on tampa towing was difficult both strip shopping plazas located on the other corners were closed and their parking lots empty bosch would be obvious if he parked in either one the competing service station on the third corner was still open and thus unusable for surveillance after considering the situation bosch parked on roscoe a block away and walked back to the intersection borrowing an idea from the wouldbe robbers of less than an hour before he found a darkened alcove in one of the strip plazas from which he could watch the service station he knew the problem with his choice of surveillance was getting back to his car fast enough to avoid losing mackey when he went off shift the ad he had checked earlier in the phone book said tampa towing offered twentyfourhour service but it was coming up on midnight and bosch was betting that mackey who had come on duty at pm would be getting off soon he would either be replaced by a midnight man or would be on call through the night it was at times like this that bosch thought about smoking again it always seemed to make the time go faster and it took the edge off the anxiety that always built through a surveillance but it had been more than four years now and he didnt want to break stride learning two years earlier that he was a father had helped him get past the occasional weaknesses he thought that if not for his daughter hed probably be smoking again at best he had controlled the addiction by no means had he broken it he took out his cell phone and angled the light from its screen away from view of the service station while he punched in kiz riders home number she didnt answer he tried her cell and got no answer again he assumed she had shut down the phones so she could concentrate on writing the warrant she had worked it that way in the past he knew she would leave her pager on for emergencies but he didnt think the news he had gathered during the evenings phone calls rose to the level of emergency he decided to wait until he saw her in the morning to tell her what he had learned he put his phone in his pocket and raised the binoculars to his eyes through the glass windows of the service station office he could see mackey sitting behind a weathered gray desk there was another man in a similar blue on blue uniform in the office it must have been a slow night both of the men had their feet propped up on the desk and were looking up at something high on the wall over the front window bosch could not see what they were focused on but the changing light in the room told him it was a television boschs phone chirped and he pulled it from his pocket and answered without lowering the binoculars he didnt check the display because he assumed it was kiz rider calling after noticing that she had missed his call hey detective bosch it wasnt rider bosch lowered the field glasses yes this is bosch how can i help you this is tara wood i got your message oh yeah thanks for calling back it sounds like this is your cell im sorry to call so late i just got in i thought i was just going to leave a message on your office line no problem im still working bosch went through the same interview process he had employed with the others as he mentioned the name roland mackey to her he checked on mackey through the glasses he was still at the desk watching the tube like rebecca verlorens other friends tara wood didnt recognize the tow truck drivers name bosch added a new question asking if she remembered the chatsworth eights and her memory was vague about that as well lastly he asked if the next day he could continue the interview and show her a photograph of mackey she agreed but told him he would have to come to the cbs television studios where she worked as a publicist bosch knew that cbs was next to the farmers market one of his favorite places in the city he decided he could go to the market maybe eat a bowl of gumbo for lunch and then go see tara wood to show the photo of mackey and ask about rebecca verlorens pregnancy he made the appointment for pm and she agreed to be in her office this is such an old case wood said are you like on a cold case squad we actually call it the openunsolved unit you know we have a show called cold case its on sunday nights its one of the shows i work on im thinking maybe you could visit the set and meet some of your television counterparts i am sure they would love to meet you bosch realized she might be working up some sort of publicity angle he looked through the glasses at mackey staring up at the television and thought for a moment of trying to use her interest in the wiretap play they were going to put into motion he then quickly shelved it concluding that it would be easier to start the play with a newspaper plant yeah maybe but i think that would have to wait awhile were working this case pretty hard right now and i just need to talk to you tomorrow no problem i really hope you find who you are looking for ever since i was assigned to this show ive been thinking about rebecca you know wondering if there was anything happening then out of the blue you called its weird but in a good way ill see you tomorrow detective bosch said good night and hung up a few minutes later at midnight the lights at the service station went out bosch knew that offering twentyfourhour tow service didnt necessarily translate into being open twentyfour hours a day mackey or another driver was probably on call through the night bosch slipped from his hiding spot and hustled down roscoe to the suv just as he got to it he heard the deep thrumming sound of mackeys camaro coming to life he started his engine pulled away from the curb and headed back toward the intersection as he got there and was stopping for the red light he saw the camaro with the graypainted fenders cross the intersection heading south on tampa bosch waited a few moments checked all lanes of the intersection for other cars and blew through the red light to follow mackeys first stop was a bar called the side pocket it was on sepulveda boulevard in van nuys near the railroad tracks it was a small place with a blue neon sign and the barred windows painted black bosch had an idea what it would be like inside and what kind of men would be in there before leaving his car he took off his sport coat wrapped his gun handcuffs and extra clip in it and put it on the floor in front of the passenger seat he got out and locked the door and headed toward the bar pulling his shirt out of his jeans as he went the inside of the bar was as he expected a couple of pool tables a standup bar and a row of scarred wood booths even though smoking inside the place was illegal blue smoke was heavy in the air and hanging like a ghost beneath each table light nobody was complaining most of the men took their medicine straight up meaning they were standing most had chains on their wallets and tattoos ringing their lower arms even with the changes to his appearance bosch knew he would stand out possibly even be advertising that he didnt belong he saw an opening in the shadows where the bar curved under the television mounted in the corner he slipped into the spot and leaned over the bar hoping it helped hide his appearance the bartender a worn woman wearing a black leather vest over a tshirt ignored bosch for a while but that was all right he wasnt there to drink he watched mackey put quarters on one of the tables and wait for his turn to play he hadnt ordered a drink either mackey spent ten minutes going through the assortment of pool cues on the wall racks until he found one he liked the feel of he then stood by waiting and talking to some of the men standing around the pool table it didnt appear to be anything more than casual conversation as though he knew them but only from playing pool on previous nights while he waited and watched nursing the beer and whisky shot the bartender had finally delivered to him bosch at first thought people were watching him as well but then realized they were only staring at the television screen less than a foot above his head finally mackey got his game and he turned out to be good at it he quickly won control of the table and defeated seven challengers collecting money or beers from all of them after a half hour he seemed to tire from the lack of competition and got sloppy the eighth challenger beat him after mackey missed a clean shot at the eight ball mackey took the loss well and slapped a fivedollar bill down on the green felt before stepping away by boschs count he was at least twentyfive dollars and three beers ahead for the night mackey took his rolling rock to a space at the bar and that was boschs cue to withdraw he put a ten under his empty shot glass and turned away never giving mackey his face he left the bar and went back to his car the first thing he did was put the gun back on his right hip grip forward he started the engine and drove out onto sepulveda and then a block south he turned around and pulled to the curb in front of a hydrant he had a good angle on the front door of the side pocket and was in position to follow mackeys car north on sepulveda toward panorama city mackey may have changed apartments after completing probation but bosch expected that he had not moved far the wait this time was not long mackey apparently only drank free beer he left the bar ten minutes after bosch had got in the camaro and headed south on sepulveda bosch had guessed wrong mackey was driving away from panorama city and the north valley this meant bosch had to pull a uturn on a largely deserted sepulveda boulevard in order to follow him the move would be highly noticeable in mackeys rearview mirror so he waited watching the camaro get smaller in his sideview mirror when he saw the turn signal on the camaro start to blink he pinned the accelerator and took the suv into a hard oneeighty he almost lost it by overcompensating on the wheel but then righted the car and took off down sepulveda he turned right on victory and caught up with the camaro at the traffic signal at the overpass mackey stayed off the freeway however and continued west on victory with bosch employing a variety of driving maneuvers to avoid detection mackey drove all the way into woodland hills on mariano street a wide street near the freeway he finally pulled down a long driveway and parked beside a small house bosch drove by and parked further down then got out and doubled back on foot he heard the front door of the house closing and then saw the light over the porch go out bosch looked around and realized it was a neighborhood of flag lots when the neighborhood was first gridded decades before the properties were cut into large pieces because they were meant to be horse ranches and small vegetable farms then the city grew out to the neighborhood and the horses and vegetables were crowded out the lots were cut up one property up front on the street and a narrow driveway running down the side of it to the property in the backthe flagshaped lot it made observation difficult bosch crept down the long driveway watching both the house on the front property and mackeys house on the back piece mackey had parked his camaro next to a beatup ford pickup it meant mackey might have a roommate when he got closer bosch stopped to write down the tag number on the f he noticed an old bumper sticker on the pickup that said would the last american to leave la please bring the flag it was just one more small brushstroke on what bosch felt was an emerging picture as quietly as he could bosch walked down a stone pathway that ran alongside the house the house was built on kneehigh footings which put the windows too far up for him to see in when he got to the back of the house he heard voices and then realized it was television when he saw the undulating blue glow on the shades of the back room he started to cross the backyard when suddenly his phone started to chirp he quickly reached for it and cut off the sound at the same time he moved quickly back down the pathway and to the driveway he then ran up the driveway toward the street he listened for any sound behind him but heard none when he made it to the street he looked back at the house but saw nothing that gave him reason to believe the chirping from his phone had been heard inside the house above the sounds of the television bosch knew it had been a close call he was out of breath he walked back to his car trying to gather himself and recover from the near disaster as with the badly handled interview with daniel kotchof he knew he was showing signs of rust he had forgotten to mute his phone before creeping the house it was a mistake that could have blown everything and maybe put him into a confrontation with an investigative target three years ago before he had left the job it would never have happened he started thinking about what irving had said about his being a retread that would come apart at the seams that would blow out inside the car he checked the caller id list on his phone and saw that the call had come from kiz rider he called her back harry i checked my call list and saw you had called me a little while ago i had my phones off whats up nothing much i was checking in to see how it was going well its going ive got it all structured and most of the writing done ill finish tomorrow morning then ill start it through the channels good yeah im about to call it a night what about you did you find robert verloren not yet but ive got an address for you i followed mackey after he left work hes got a little house by the freeway in woodland hills there might be a phone line in there that youll want to add to the tap good give me the address that should be easy enough to check but im not sure i want you following the suspect alone thats not smart harry we had to find his address he wasnt going to tell her about the near miss he gave her the address and waited a moment while she wrote it down ive got some other stuff too he said i made some calls youve been busy for just a day back on the job whatve you got he recounted the phone calls he made and received after she had left the office rider asked no questions and then was silent after he finished that brings you up to date bosch said what do you think kiz i think there might be a picture coming together harry yeah i was thinking the same thing plus the year nineteen eightyeight i think you were onto something about that maybe these assholes were trying to prove a point in eightyeight the problem is it all went under the door at pdu who knows where all of that stuff ended up irving probably dumped it in the evidence incinerator at the esb not all of it when the new chief came in he wanted a full assessment of everything he wanted to know where the bodies were buried anyway i wasnt involved in that but i knew about it and i heard that a lot of the pdu files were kept after the unit was disbanded a lot of it irving put in special archives special archives what the hell is that it just means limited access you need command approval its all in the basement at parker center its mostly inhouse investigations political stuff dangerous stuff this chatsworth business doesnt really seem to qualify unless it was connected to something else like what like somebody in the department or somebody in the city the latter meant someone powerful in city politics can you get in there and see if any files on this still exist what about your pal on six maybe hed i can try then try first thing what about you i thought you were going out to find robert verloren tonight and now i hear you were following our suspect i went down there i didnt find him he proceeded to update her on his earlier swing through the toy district leaving out his encounter with the wouldbe robbers that incident and the phone fiasco behind mackeys house were not things he cared to share with her ill go back out there tomorrow morning he said in conclusion okay harry sounds like a plan i should have the warrant together by the time you get in and ill check on the pdu files bosch hesitated but then decided not to hold back any warnings or concerns with his partner he looked out the windshield at the dark street he could hear the hiss from the nearby freeway kiz be careful how do you mean harry you know what it means when a case has high jingo yeah it means its got command staffs fingers in the pie thats right and so so be careful this thing has irving all over it its not that obvious but its there you think his little visit with you at the coffee counter wasnt coincidence i dont believe in coincidences not like that there was silence for a bit before rider answered okay harry ill watch myself no holding back though right we take it where it goes and let the chips fall everybody counts or nobody counts remember right i remember ill see you tomorrow good night harry she hung up and bosch sat in the car for a long time before turning the key bosch started the engine pulled a slow uturn on mariano and drove by the driveway that led to mackeys house it appeared to be all quiet down there he saw no lights behind the windows he cut over to the freeway and took it east across the valley and then down into the cahuenga pass on the way he used his cell phone to call central dispatch and run the plate off the ford pickup that mackey had parked next to it came back registered to a william burkhart who was thirtyseven years old and had a criminal record dating back to the late s but nothing else in fifteen years the dispatcher gave bosch the california penal code numbers for his arrests because thats how they were listed on the computer bosch immediately recognized aggravated assault and receiving stolen property charges but there was one charge in with a code that he didnt recognize anybody there with a code book who can tell me what that is he asked hoping things were quiet enough that the dispatcher would just do it herself he knew that copies of the penal code were always in the dispatch center because officers often called in to get the proper citations when they were in the field hold on he waited meantime he exited on barham and took woodrow wilson up into the hills toward his home detective still here that was a hate crime violation okay thanks for looking it up no problem bosch pulled into his carport and killed the engine mackeys roommate or landlord was charged with a hate crime in the same year as the murder of rebecca verloren william burkhart was likely the same billy burkhart whom sam weiss had identified as a neighbor and one of his tormentors bosch didnt know how all of this fit together but he knew it was part of the same picture he now wished he had taken home the department of corrections file on mackey he was feeling too tired to go all the way back downtown to get it he decided he would leave it be for the night and read it cover to cover when he got back to the office the next day he would also get the file on william burkharts hate crime arrest the house was quiet when he got inside he grabbed the phone and a beer out of the box and headed out onto the deck to check on the city on the way he turned on the cd player there was already a disc in the machine and he soon heard the voice of boz scaggs on the outside speakers he was singing for all we know the song competed with the muted sound of the freeway down below bosch looked out and saw there were no searchlights cutting across the sky from universal studios it was too late for that still the view was captivating in the way it could only be at night the city shimmered out there like a million dreams not all of them good bosch thought about calling kiz rider back and telling her about the william burkhart connection but decided to let it wait until the morning he looked out at the city and felt satisfied with the days moves and accomplishments but he was also out of sorts high jingo did that to you the man with the knife had not been too far off in calling him a missionary man he almost had it right bosch knew he had a mission in life and now after three years he was back on the beat but he could not bring himself to believe it was all good he felt that there was something out there beyond the shimmering lights and dreams something he could not see it was waiting for him he clicked on the phone and listened to an uninterrupted dial tone it meant he had no messages he called the retrieval number anyway and replayed a message he had saved from the week before it was his daughters tiny voice left the night she and her mother went traveling far away from him hello daddy she said good night daddy that was all she had said but that was enough bosch saved the message for the next time he needed it and then killed the line part two high jingo at am the next day bosch was back on the nickel he was watching the food line at the metro shelter and he had his eye on robert verloren back in the kitchen behind the steam tables bosch had gotten lucky in the early morning it was almost as if there had been a shift change among the homeless the people who patrolled the street in darkness were sleeping off the nights failures they were replaced by the first shift of homeless the people who were smart enough to hide from the street at night boschs intention had been to start at the big centers again and go from there but as he had made his way into the homeless zone after parking again in japantown he started showing the photo of verloren to the most lucid of the street people he encountered and almost immediately started getting responses the day people recognized verloren some said they had seen the man in the photo around but that he was much older now eventually bosch came across one man who matteroffactly said yeah thats chef and he pointed bosch toward the metro shelter the metro was one of the smaller satellite shelters that were clustered around the salvation army and the los angeles mission and designed to handle the overflow of street people particularly in the winter months when warmer weather in la drew a migration from colder points north these smaller centers didnt have the means to provide three squares a day and by agreement specialized in one service at the metro shelter the service was a breakfast that started at am daily by the time bosch got there the line of wobbling disheveled men and women was extending out the door of the chow center and the long rows of picnicstyle tables inside were maxed out the word on the street was that the metro had the best breakfast on the nickel bosch had badged his way through the door and very quickly spotted verloren in the kitchen beyond the serving tables it didnt appear that verloren was doing one particular job instead he seemed to be checking on the preparation of several things it appeared that he was in charge he was neatly dressed in a white doublebreasted kitchen shirt over dark pants a spotless white apron that went down past his knees and a tall white chefs hat the breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs with red and green peppers hash browns grits and disc sausages it looked and smelled good to bosch who had left home without eating anything because he wanted to get moving to the right of the serving line was a coffee station with two large serveyourself urns there were racks containing cups made of thick porcelain that had chipped and yellowed over time bosch took a cup and filled it with scalding black coffee and he sipped it and waited when verloren strode to the serving table using the skirt of his apron to hold a hot and heavy replacement pan of eggs bosch made his move hey chef he called above the clatter of serving spoons and voices verloren looked over and bosch saw him immediately determine that bosch was not a client as with the night before bosch was dressed informally but he thought verloren might have even been able to guess he was a cop he stepped away from the serving table and approached but he didnt come all the way there seemed to be an invisible line on the floor that was the demarcation between kitchen and eating space verloren didnt cross it he stood there using his apron to hold the nearempty serving pan he had taken from the steam table can i help you he asked yes do you have a minute i would like to talk to you no i dont have a minute im in the middle of breakfast its about your daughter bosch saw the slight waver in verlorens eyes they dropped for a second and then came back up youre the police bosch nodded can i just get through this rush were putting out the last trays now no problem you want to eat you look like youre hungry uh bosch looked around the room at the crowded tables he didnt know where he would sit he knew that these sorts of chow halls had the same unspoken protocols as prisons add in the high degree of mental illness in the homeless population and you could be crossing some sort of line just by the seat you chose come back with me verloren said we have a table in the back bosch turned back to verloren but the breakfast chef was already heading back to the kitchen bosch followed and was led through the cooking and prep areas to a rear room where there was an empty stainless steel table with a full ashtray on it have a seat verloren removed the ashtray and held it behind his back it was not like he was hiding it it was like he was a waiter or a maître d and he wanted his table perfect for the customer bosch thanked him and sat down ill be right back it seemed that in less than a minute verloren brought a plate back loaded with all the things bosch had seen on the serving table when he put down the silverware bosch saw the shake in his hand thank you but i was just thinking will there be enough you know for the people coming through were not turning anybody away today not as long as theyre on time hows your coffee its fine thanks you know it wasnt like i didnt want to sit out there with them i just didnt know where to sit i understand you dont have to explain let me get those trays out and then we can talk is there an arrest bosch looked at him there was a hopeful maybe even pleading look in verlorens eyes not yet bosch said but were getting close to something ill be back as soon as i can eat i call that malibu scrambled bosch looked down at his plate verloren went back to the kitchen the eggs were good so was the whole breakfast no toast but that would have been asking too much the break area where he sat was between the cooking area of the kitchen and the large room where two men loaded an industrial dishwasher it was loud the noise from both directions ricocheting off the gray tiled walls there was a set of double doors leading to the back alley one door was open and cool air came in and kept the steam from the dishwasher and the heat from the kitchen at bay after bosch cleaned his plate and washed it down with the rest of his coffee he got up and stepped into the alley to make a phone call away from all the noise he immediately saw the alley was an encampment the rear walls of the missions on one side and the toy warehouses on the other were lined almost end to end with cardboard and canvas shanties it was quiet these were probably the selfmade shelters of the night people it wasnt that there was no room for them in the mission dormitories it was that those beds came with basic rules attached and the people in the alley did not want to abide by such rules he called kiz riders cell phone number and she answered right away she was already in room and had just finished distributing the wiretap application bosch spoke in a low voice i found the father great work harry you still got it what did he say did he recognize mackey i havent talked to him yet he explained the situation and asked if there was anything new on her end the warrants on the captains desk abels going to push him on it if we dont hear back by ten and then it goes up the chain how early did you come in early i wanted to get this done did you ever get a chance to read the girls journal last night yeah i read it in bed its not much help its high school confidential stuff unrequited love weekly crushes stuff like that mtl is mentioned but no clue to identity he might even be a fantasy figure the way she writes about how special he is i think garcia was right to give it back to the mom its not going to help us is mtl referred to in the book as a he hmm harry thats clever i didnt notice i have it here and ill check you know something i dont know no just covering all the bases what about danny kotchof is he in there in the beginning hes mentioned by name then he drops off and mysterious mtl takes his place mr x listen im going up to six in a few minutes im going to see about getting access to those old files we were talking about bosch noticed that she hadnt mentioned that they were pdu files he wondered if pratt or someone else was nearby and she was taking precautions against being overheard is somebody there kiz thats right take all precautions right you got it good good luck by the way did you find a phone on mariano yes she said theres one phone and its under the name william burkhart must be a roommate this guy is just a few years older than mackey and has a record that includes a hate crime nothing in recent years but the hate crime was in eightyeight and guess what bosch said he was also sam weisss neighbor i mustve left that out last night when we talked too much information coming in yeah you know i was wondering about something how come mackeys cell didnt come up on the autotrack im ahead of you on that i ran a check on the number and its not his its held in the name of belinda messier her address is over on melba also in woodland hills her records clean except for some traffic stuff maybe shes his girlfriend maybe when i get time i will try to track her down im sensing something here harry its all coming together all of this eightyeight stuff i tried to pull the file on the hate crime but public disorder exactly and thats why im going up to six okay anything else i checked with the esb first thing they still havent found the evidence box we still dont have the gun im now wondering if it got misplaced or if it was taken yeah bosch said thinking the same thing if this case went inside the department the evidence could have been purposely and permanently lost all right bosch said before i do this interview lets go back to the journal for a minute is there anything in it about the pregnancy no she didnt write about it the entries are dated and she stopped writing in the book in late april maybe it was when she found out i think maybe she stopped writing in it in case her parents were secretly reading it does she mention any hangouts you know places she would go she does mention a lot of movies rider said not who she went with but just that she saw specific movies and what she thought of them what are you thinking target acquisition they needed to know where mackey and rebecca verloren could have crossed paths it was a hole in the case no matter what the motivation was where did mackey come into contact with verloren in order to target her movie theaters he said it could have been where they intersected exactly and i think all the theaters up there in the valley are in malls that makes the crossing zone even wider its something to think about bosch said he would come into the office after talking with robert verloren and they hung up bosch went back into the break room and the noise from the dishwashing room seemed louder the meal service was almost over and the dishwashers were getting slammed bosch sat down at the table again and noticed that someone had cleared his empty plate he tried to think about the conversation with rider he knew that a shopping mall would be a huge crossroads a place where it would be easy to see someone like mackey crossing paths with someone like rebecca verloren he wondered if the crime could have all come down to a chance encountermackey seeing a girl with the obvious mix of races in her face and hair and eyes could this have incensed him to the point that he followed her home and later came back alone or with others to abduct and kill her it seemed like a long shot but most theories began as long shots he thought about the original investigation and the possibility of it having been tainted from within the department there had been nothing in the murder book that played to the racial angle but in the department would have gone out of its way not to play to it the department and the city had a blind spot an infection of racial animosities was festering beneath the surface in but the department and the city looked away the skin over the seething wound finally broke a few years later and the city was torn apart by three days of rioting the worst in the country in a quartercentury bosch had to consider that the investigation of rebecca verlorens murder might have been stunted in deference to keeping the sickness beneath the surface you ready bosch looked up and saw robert verloren standing over him his face was sweating from exertion he now held the chefs hat in his hand there was still a slight tremor in his arm yeah sure do you want to sit down verloren took the seat across from bosch is it always like this bosch asked this crowded every morning today we served a hundred sixtytwo plates a lot of people count on us no wait make that a hundred sixtythree plates i forgot about you how was it it was damn good thank you i needed the fuel my specialty a little different than cooking for johnny carson and the malibu set huh yeah but i dont miss that not at all just a stopoff on the road to finding the place where i belong but im here now thanks to the lord jesus and this is where i want to be bosch nodded whether intentionally or not verloren was communicating to bosch that his new life had been achieved through the intervention of faith bosch had often found that those who talked about it the most had the weakest hold on it how did you find me verloren asked my partner and i talked to your wife yesterday and she told us that the last time she had heard anything about you you were down here i started looking last night i wouldnt go on these streets at night if i were you there was a slight caribbean lilt in his voice but it was something that seemed to have receded over time i thought i was going to find you standing in a line not feeding the line well not too long ago i was in the line i had to stand there to stand where i am today bosch nodded again he had heard these onedayatatime mantras before how long have you been sober verloren smiled this time a little over three years look i dont want to force you to relive the trauma of seventeen years ago but weve reopened the case its okay detective i reopen the case every night when i shut my eyes and every morning when i say my prayers to jesus bosch nodded again do you want to do this here or take a walk or go over to parker center where we can sit in a quiet room here is good i am comfortable here okay then let me tell you a little bit about what is going on i work for the openunsolved unit we are currently looking into your daughters murder again because we have some new information what information bosch decided to take a different approach with him where he had held information back from the mother he decided to give it all to the father we have a match between blood found on the weapon used in the crime and an individual who we are pretty sure was living up there in chatsworth at the time of the killing its a dna match do you know what that is verloren nodded i know like in oj this ones solid it doesnt mean he is the one who killed rebecca but it means he was close to the crime and that makes us closer who is it ill get to that in a minute but first mr verloren i want to ask you some questions relating to yourself and the case what about me bosch felt the tension rise the skin around verlorens eyes grew tighter he realized that he could have been careless with this man mistaking his position in the kitchen as a sign of health and forgetting the warning rider had issued about the homeless population well he said id like to know a little bit about what has happened to you in the years since rebecca was taken whats that got to do with anything maybe nothing but i want to know what happened to me is that i tripped and fell into a black hole took me a long time to see the light and my way out you got kids one a girl then you know what i mean you lose a kid the way i lost my girl and thats it my friend its all over you are like an empty bottle tossed out the window the car keeps going but you are on the side of the road broken bosch nodded he did know this he lived a life of screaming vulnerability knowing that what might happen in a city far away could cause him to live or die or fall into the same black hole as verloren after your daughters death you lost the restaurant thats right it was the best thing that could have happened i needed that to happen for me to find out who i really was and to make my way here bosch knew that such emotional defenses were fragile following verlorens logic it could be said that his daughters death was the best thing that could have happened because it led to the loss of the restaurant which triggered all the wonderful personal discoveries he had made it was bullshit and both men at the table knew it one just couldnt admit it mr verloren talk to me bosch said leave all the selfhelp lessons for your meetings and the ragged people in line tell me how you tripped tell me how you fell into that black hole i just did not everybody who loses a child falls so far into the hole youre not the only one this has happened to mr verloren some people end up on tv some run for congress what happened to you why are you different and dont tell me it is because you loved your kid more we all love our kids verloren was quiet a moment he pressed his lips tightly together as he composed bosch could tell he had made him angry but that was okay he needed to push things all right verloren finally said all right but that was all bosch could see the muscles of his jaw working the pain of the last seventeen years had set in his face bosch could read it like a menu appetizers entrees desserts frustration anger irredeemable loss all right what mr verloren verloren nodded he removed the final barricade i could blame you people but i must blame myself i abandoned my daughter in death detective and then the only place i could hide from the betrayal was in the bottle the bottle opens up the black hole do you understand bosch nodded i am trying to tell me what you mean about blaming you people do you mean cops do you mean white people i mean all of it verloren turned in his seat so that his back was against the tile wall next to the table he looked toward the door to the alley he wasnt looking at bosch bosch wanted the eye contact but he was willing to let things ride as long as verloren kept talking lets start with the cops then bosch said why do you blame the cops what did the cops do you expect me to talk to you about what you people did bosch thought carefully before responding he felt this was the makeorbreak point of the interview and he sensed that this man had something important to give up we start with the fact that you loved your daughter right bosch said of course well mr verloren what happened to her should never have happened i cant do anything about it but i can try to speak for her thats why i am here what the cops did seventeen years ago is not what i am going to do most of them are dead now anyway if you still love your daughter if you love the memory of her then you will tell me the story you will help me speak for her its your only way of making up for what you did back then verloren started nodding halfway through boschs plea bosch knew he had him that he would open up it was about redemption it didnt matter how many years had gone by redemption was always the brass ring a single tear rolled down verlorens left cheek almost imperceptible against the dark skin a man in dirty kitchen whites came into the break area with a clipboard in hand but bosch quickly waved him away from verloren bosch waited and finally verloren spoke i chose myself over her and in the end i lost myself anyway he said how did that happen verloren covered his mouth with his hand as if to try to keep the secrets from being dispelled finally he dropped it and spoke i read one day in the newspaper that my daughter had been killed with a gun that came from a burglary green and garcia they hadnt told me that so i asked detective green about it and he told me the man with the gun had it because he was afraid he was a jewish man and there had been threats against him i thought he stopped there and bosch had to prompt him you thought that maybe rebecca had been targeted because of her mixed races because her father was black verloren nodded i thought yes because from time to time there would be a comment or something not everybody saw the beauty in her not like we did i wanted to live on the westside but muriel she was from up there it was home to her what did green tell you he told me no that it wasnt there they had looked at that and it wasnt a possibility it wasnt it didnt seem right to me they were ignoring this it seemed to me i kept calling and asking i was pushing it finally i went to a customer i had at the restaurant who was a member of the police commission i told him about this thing and he said he would check into it for me verloren nodded more to himself than to bosch he was fortifying his faith in his actions as a father seeking justice for his daughter and then what happened bosch prompted then i got a visit from two police not green and garcia no not them different police they came to my restaurant what were their names verloren shook his head they never gave me their names they just showed me their badges they were detectives i think they told me i was wrong about what i was pushing green about they told me to back off it because i was just stirring the pot that is what they called it stirring the pot like it was about me and not my daughter he shook his head tightly that anger still sharp after all the years bosch asked an obvious question obvious because he knew so well how the lapd worked back then did they threaten you verloren snorted yes they threatened me he said quietly they told me that they knew my daughter had been pregnant but they couldnt find the clinic she had gone to to get it taken care of so there was no tissue they could use to identify the father no way to tell who it was or wasnt they said that all it would take was for them to ask a few questions about me and her like with my customer on the police commission and the rumors would start to run they said just a few questions in the right places and pretty soon people would think it was me bosch didnt interrupt he felt his own anger tightening his throat they said it would be hard for me to keep my business if everybody thought i had i had done that to my daughter now more tears came down his dark face he did nothing to stop their flow and so i did what they wanted i backed off and dropped it stopped stirring the pot i told myself it didnt matter it wouldnt bring becky back to us so i never called detective green again and they never solved the case after a while i started drinking to forget what i had lost and what i had done that i had put myself and my pride and my reputation and my business ahead of my daughter and pretty soon before you knew it i came to that black hole i was telling you about i fell in and im still climbing out after a moment he turned and looked at bosch hows that for a story detective im sorry mr verloren im sorry that happened all of it is that the story you wanted to hear detective i just wanted to know the truth believe it or not it is going to help me it will help me speak for her can you describe these two men who came to you verloren shook his head its been a long time i probably wouldnt recognize them if they stood in front of me i just remember they were both white men one of them i always thought of as mr clean because his head was shaved and he stood with his arms folded like the guy on the bottle bosch nodded and he felt his anger working into the muscles of his shoulders he knew who mr clean was how much of all this did your wife know he asked in a calm tone verloren shook his head muriel didnt know anything about this i kept it from her it was my water to carry verloren wiped his cheeks and seemed to have earned some relief from finally telling the story bosch reached into his back pocket and came up with the old photograph of roland mackey he put it down on the table in front of verloren do you recognize this kid verloren looked for a long moment before shaking his head in the negative should i who is he his name is roland mackey he was a couple years older than your daughter in eightyeight he didnt go to school at hillside but he lived in chatsworth bosch waited for a response but didnt get any verloren just stared at the photo on the table thats a mug shot what did he do stole a car but he has a record of associating with white power extremists in and outside of jail does the name mean anything to you no should it i dont know im just asking can you remember if your daughter ever mentioned his name or maybe somebody named ro verloren shook his head what we are trying to do is figure out if they could have intersected anywhere the valleys a big place they couldve what school did he go to he went to chatsworth high but never finished he got a ged rebecca went to chatsworth high for drivers ed the summer before she was taken you mean eightyseven verloren nodded ill check it out but bosch didnt think it was a good lead mackey had dropped out before the summer of and didnt come back for his general education degree until still it was worth a thorough look what about the movies did she like to go to movies and the mall verloren shrugged she was a sixteenyearold girl of course she liked movies most of her friends had cars once they hit sixteen and got mobile they were all over the place my wife called it the three msmovies malls and madonna which malls which theaters they went to the northridge mall because it was close you know they also liked to go to the drivein over on winnetka that way they could sit in the car and talk during the movie one of the girls had a convertible and they liked going in that bosch zeroed in on the drivein he had forgotten about it when he had spoken about movie theaters with rider earlier but roland mackey had once been arrested burglarizing the same drivein on winnetka that made it a key possibility as the point of intersection how often did rebecca and her friends go to the drivein i think they liked to go on friday nights when the new movies were just out did they meet boys there i would assume so you see this is all just secondguessing there was nothing wrong or unnatural about our daughter going to the movies with her friends and meeting up with boys and whatnot it is only after the worstcase scenario happens that people ask why dont you know who she was with we thought everything was fine we sent her to the best school we could find her friends were from nice families we couldnt watch her every minute of the day friday nightshell most nightsi worked late at the restaurant i understand i am not judging you as a parent mr verloren i see nothing wrong with that okay i am just dragging a net im collecting as much information as i can because you never know what might become important yeah well that net got snagged and ripped on the rocks a long time ago maybe not you think this mackey fellow is the one then hes connected somehow thats all we know for sure well know more soon enough i promise you that verloren turned and looked directly into boschs eyes for the first time during the interview when you get to that point you will speak for her wont you detective bosch nodded slowly he thought he knew what verloren was asking yes sir i will kiz rider sat at her desk with her arms folded as if she had been waiting for bosch all morning she had a somber look on her face and bosch knew something was up you get the pdu file he asked i got to look at it i wasnt allowed to take it bosch nodded he slid into his seat across from her good stuff he asked depends on how you look at it well i got some stuff too he looked around abel pratts door was open and bosch could see him in there bending over to the little cooler he kept next to his desk pratt was in earshot it wasnt that bosch didnt trust pratt he did but he didnt want to put him in a position of hearing something he didnt want to or was not ready to hear same as rider when they had spoken on the phone earlier he looked back at his partner you want to take a walk yes i do they got up and headed out when bosch went past the oics door he leaned in pratt was now on the phone bosch caught his attention and pantomimed drinking from a cup and then pointed to pratt shaking his head no to the offer of coffee pratt held up a tub of yogurt as if to say he had what he needed bosch saw little chunks of green in the gunk he tried to think of a green fruit and only came up with kiwi he walked away thinking that the only possible way to make yogurt taste worse was to put kiwi into it they took the elevator down to the lobby and walked out front to where the memorial fountain was so where do you want to go kiz asked depends on how much there is to talk about probably a lot last time i worked in parker center i was a smoker when i needed to walk and think id go over to union station and buy smokes in the shop over there i liked that place its got those comfortable chairs in the main hall or it used to at least sounds good to me they headed that way taking los angeles street to the north the first building they passed was the federal office building and bosch noticed that the concrete barriers erected in to keep potential vehicle bombs away from the building were still in place the threat of danger didnt seem to bother the people in the line stretching across the front of the building they were waiting to get into the immigration offices each clutching paperwork and ready to make a case for citizenship they waited beneath the tile mosaics on the front façade that depicted people dressed like angels their eyes skyward waiting on heaven why dont you start harry rider said tell me about robert verloren bosch walked a little further before beginning i liked the guy he said hes digging himself out of the hole he cooks a hundred or so breakfasts a day over there i had a plate and it was pretty good stuff and im sure it beats the hell out of the prices at pacific dining car what did he give you thats made you so angry what are you talking about you read me i read you i know he told you something thats got you going bosch nodded it sure didnt seem like three years since they had worked together irving or at least i think he gave me irving tell it bosch took her through the story verloren had told him less than an hour before he finished with verlorens description limited as it was of the two men with badges who came to his restaurant and threatened him in order to make him back off the racial angle sounds like irving to me too rider said and one of his poodles maybe it was mcclellan maybe so you think verloren was straight hes been on the nickel a long time i think so he claims to have been sober for three years this time but you know grinding over something for seventeen years pretty soon perceptions become facts still everything he said just seems to fit into the underpinnings of this i think they pushed this case kiz it was going in one direction and they pushed it the other way maybe they knew what was coming that the city was going to burn rodney king wasnt the gasoline he was only the match things had been building and maybe the powers that be looked at this case and said for the public good we have to go the other way they sacrificed justice for rebecca verloren they were crossing over the freeway on the los angeles street overpass eight lanes of crawling traffic smoked beneath them the sun was bright reflecting off windshields and buildings and concrete bosch put on his raybans the traffic was loud too and rider had to raise her voice thats not like you harry what isnt looking for a good reason for them to have done something so wrong you usually look for the sinister angle are you telling me you found the sinister angle in that pdu file she nodded glumly i think so she said and they just let you waltz in there and get it i got in to see the man first thing this morning i brought him a cup of coffee from starbuckshe hates the cafeteria crap that got me in then i told him what we had and what i wanted to do and the bottom line is he trusts me so he more or less let me have a look around in special archives the public disorder unit came and went long before he was here did he know about it im sure after he took the job he was briefed maybe even before he took it did you tell him specifically about mackey and the chatsworth eights not specifically i just told him the case we caught was connected to an old pdu investigation and i needed to get into special archives to look for a file he sent lieutenant hohman with me we went in found the file and i had to look through it while hohman sat across a table from me you know what harry there are a hell of a lot of files in special archives where all the bodies are buried bosch wanted to say something more but wasnt sure how to say it rider looked at him and read him what harry he didnt say anything at first but she waited him out kiz you said the man on six trusts you do you trust him she looked him in the eye when she answered like i trust you harry okay bosch looked at her thats good enough for me rider made a move to turn down arcadia but bosch pointed toward the old pueblo the place where the city of angels was founded he wanted to take the long way and walk through i havent been down here in a while lets check this out they cut through the circular courtyard where the padres blessed the animals every easter and then past the instituto cultural mexicano they followed the curving arcade of cheap souvenir booths and churro stands recorded mariachi music came from unseen speakers but in counterpoint was the sound of a live guitar they found the musician sitting on a bench in front of the avila adobe they stopped and listened as the old man played a mexican ballad bosch thought he had heard before but could not identify bosch studied the mudwalled structure behind the musician and wondered if don francisco avila had any idea what he was helping to set in motion when he staked his claim to the spot in a city would grow tall and wide from this place a city as great as any other and just as mean a destination city a city of invention and reinvention a place where the dream seemed as easy to reach as the sign they put up on the hill but a place where the reality was always something different the road to that sign on the hill had a locked gate across it it was a city full of haves and havenots movie stars and extras drivers and the driven predators and prey the fat and the hungry and little room in between a city that despite all of that still had them lining up and waiting every day behind the bomb barriers to get in and stay in bosch pulled the fold of money from his pocket and dropped a five in the old musicians basket he and rider then cut through the old cucamonga winery its cask rooms converted into galleries and artists stalls and out to alameda they crossed the street to the train station its clock tower rising in front of them in the front walkway they passed a sundial with an inscription cut into its granite pedestal vision to see faith to believe courage to do union station was designed to mirror the city it served and the way in which it was supposed to work it was a melting pot of architectural stylesspanish colonial mission streamline moderne art deco southwestern and moorish design flourishes among them but unlike the rest of the city where the pot more often than not boiled over the styles at the train station blended smoothly into something unique something beautiful bosch loved it for that through the glass doors they came into the cavernous entry hall and an archway three stories tall led to the immense waiting room beyond as bosch took it in he remembered that he used to walk over here not only for cigarettes but also to renew himself a little bit going to union station was like paying a visit to church a cathedral where the graceful lines of design and function and civic pride all intersected in the central waiting room the voices of travelers rose into its high empty spaces and were transformed into a choir of languid whispers i love this place rider said did you ever see the movie blade runner bosch nodded he had seen it this was the police station right he asked yeah did you ever see true confessions he asked no was it good yeah you should see it another take on the black dahlia and lapd conspiracy she groaned thanks but i dont think thats what i need right now they got cups of coffee at union bagel and then walked into the waiting room where rows of brown leather seats were lined up like luxurious pews bosch looked up as he was always drawn to do six huge chandeliers hung forty feet above them in two rows rider looked up too bosch then pointed to two sidebyside seats open near the newsstand they sat down on the soft padded leather and put their cups on the wide wooden armrests you ready to talk about this now rider asked if you are he answered what was in the file you saw in special archives what was so sinister for one thing mackey is in there as a suspect in verloren no the file has nothing to do with verloren verloren was not even a blip on the screen as far as the file goes its all about an investigation that went down and was buttoned up before rebecca verloren was even pregnant let alone snatched from her bed in the night all right then whats it got to do with us maybe nothing and maybe everything you know the guy mackey lives with william burkhart yeah hes in there too only back then he was better known as billy blitzkrieg that was his moniker in this gang the eights okay in march of eightyeight billy blitzkrieg went away for a year for vandalizing a synagogue in north hollywood property damage graffiti defecation the whole thing the hate crime he was the only one they bagged she nodded they got a latent off a spray can they found in a gutter trap about a block from the synagogue so he went down for it took a plea or they would have made an example of him and he knew it bosch nodded he didnt want to say anything that would interrupt her flow in the reports and in the press burkhartor blitzkrieg or whatever you want to call himwas portrayed as the leader of the eights they said he called for nineteen eightyeight to be a year of racial and ethnic upheaval to honor their beloved adolf hitler you know the crap rahowa revenge of the white trash and all that they all ran around in minnesota vikings jerseysthe vikings apparently were a pure race they all wore number eightyeight im getting the picture anyway they had a lot on burkhart they had him cold on the synagogue and they had the feds chomping at the bit to do a civil rights dance on his pointy little head there were a lot of crimes beginning right at the start of the year when they toasted new years by burning a cross on a black familys lawn in chatsworth after that there were more cross burnings threatening phone calls bomb scares the synagogue breakin they even trashed a jewish daycare center in encino this was all in early january they also started going to street corners picking up mexican laborers and taking them out into the desert where they assaulted or abandoned them or both usually both to use their terminology they were fomenting disharmony which they believed would help lead to a separation of the races yeah ive heard the song okay well like i said they were ready to make burkhart the poster boy for all of this and if they went with it to justice he could have ended up going away for a tenyear minimum in a federal pen so it was a nobrainer he took a deal rider nodded he took a year in wayside and a fiveyear tail and the rest of it went away and the eights went away with it they were broken up and that was the end of the threat all of this went down by the end of march long before verloren as he thought about all of this bosch watched a woman in a hurry as she pulled a young girl by the hand toward the gateway to the metroline tracks the woman was also lugging a heavy suitcase and her focus was only on the gate ahead the child was pulled along with her face turned upward as she looked at the ceiling she was smiling at something bosch looked up and saw a childs balloon trapped in one of the ceilings vaulted squares one childs disaster was anothers secret smile the balloon was orange and white and shaped like a fish and bosch knew because of his daughter that it was an animated character named nemo he had a flash of his daughter but just as quickly pushed it away so he could concentrate he looked at rider so where was mackey in all of this he asked he was sort of the runt of the litter rider answered one of the minions he was thought to be the perfect recruit high school dropout with no life and no prospects he was on probation for burglary and his juvie jacket was full of pops for car theft burglary and drugs so he was just the kind of guy they were looking for a loser they could mold into a white warrior but once they jumped him in they found out he wasto use a quote from burkhartdumber than a nigger off the boat he apparently was so stupid that they had to take him off the graffiti runs because he couldnt even spell their basic racist vocabulary in fact his homey name in the group became wej not like you wedge your way into a door wej like jew spelled backwards because that was how he sprayed it once on a synagogue wall dyslexic id say bosch shook his head even with the giveaways in the verloren scene im not seeing this guy i agree i think he had a part but not the main part he doesnt have it between the ears bosch decided to drop mackey and double back to the beginning of her report so if they had all of this intel on these guys how come only burkhart went down im getting to that this is where the high jingo comes in you got it you see burkhart was a leader of the eights but he wasnt the leader ah the leader was identified as a guy named richard ross he was older than the others a true believer he was twentyone and was the smooth talker who recruited burkhart and then most of the other eights and got the whole thing going bosch nodded richard ross was a common name but he thought he knew where this was going this richard ross was that as in richard ross junior exactly the good captain rosss prodigy captain richard ross had been the longtime head of internal affairs division during the early part of boschs career in the department he was now retired for bosch the rest of the story tumbled into place so they kept junior out of it and saved senior and the department all the embarrassment he said they laid it all on burkhart rosss second in command he went away to wayside and the group was broken up chalk it all up to youthful misadventure you got it and let me guess all the intel came from richard ross junior youre good it was part of the deal richard junior gave up everybody and it was all pdu needed to quietly splinter the group junior then got to walk away from it all in a days work for irving and you know whats funny i think irving is a jewish name bosch shook his head whether it is or isnt its not very funny he said yeah i know not if irving saw an angle reading between the lines of the report i would say he saw all the angles this deal gave him control of iad i mean real absolute control over who was investigated and how investigations were conducted it put ross deep in his pocket it explains a lot about what was going on back then it was mostly before my time so they take care of the eights and irving gets a nice big prize in having richard ross senior wearing a collar on the poodle squad bosch said thinking out loud but then rebecca verloren ends up dead by a gun stolen from a guy the eights had been harassing a gun likely stolen by one of the little runts they let run free their whole deal could fall apart if the murder came back on the eights and then on them thats right so they step in and push the investigation they steer it away and nobody ever goes down for it motherfuckers bosch whispered poor harry you still must have a lot of rust from your layoff you thought maybe they pushed the case because they were trying to save the city from burning it was nothing so heroic no they were just trying to save their own asses and the position the deal with ross had given them given irving this is all supposition rider cautioned yeah just reading between the fucking lines bosch felt the strongest craving for a cigarette hed had in at least a year he looked over at the newsstand and saw all of the packages in the racks behind the counter he looked away he looked up at the balloon trapped at the ceiling he thought he knew how nemo felt being stuck up there when did ross retire he asked ninetyone he rode it out until he hit twentyfive yearsthey allowed him thatand then he retired i checkedhe moved up to idaho i ran junior on the box too and hed already moved up there ahead of him probably one of those gated white enclaves where he felt right at home and he was probably up there laughing his ass off when this place came apart after rodney king in ninetytwo probably but not for long he was killed in a dui in ninetythree he was coming back from an antigovernment rally out in the boonies what goes around comes around i guess a dull thud hit bosch in the stomach he had started liking richard ross jr for the verloren killing he could have used mackey to procure the weapon and maybe help carry the victim up the hill but now he was dead could their investigation be leading them to such a dead end would they end up going back to rebecca verlorens parents and telling them their longdead daughter had been taken from them by someone who also was long dead what kind of justice would that be i know what youre thinking rider said he could have been our guy but i dont think so according to the box he got his idaho drivers license in may of eightyeight he was supposedly already up there when verloren went down yeah supposedly bosch wasnt convinced by a simple dmv computer check he pushed all of the information through the filters again to see if anything else jumped out at him okay lets review for a minute make sure i have it all straight back in eightyeight we have a bunch of these valley boys calling themselves the eights and running around in their football jerseys trying to kickstart a racial holy war the department takes a look and pretty soon finds out that the brains behind this group is the son of our own captain ross of iad commander irving puts his finger into the wind and thinks hmmm i think i can use this to my advantage so he puts the kibosh on going after richard junior and they sacrifice william billy blitz burkhart to the justice gods instead the eights are splintered score one for the good guys and richard junior skates away score one for irving because now he has richard senior in his pocket everybody lives happily ever after am i missing anything actually its billy blitzkrieg blitzkrieg then so all of this gets wrapped up by early spring right by the end of march and by early may richard ross junior has moved to idaho okay so then in june somebody breaks into sam weisss house and steals his gun then in julythe day after our nations birthday no lessa girl of mixed race is taken out of her house and murdered not raped but murderedwhich is important to remember the murder is made to look like a suicide but it is done badly by all appearances by someone who was new at this garcia and green catch the case eventually see through it and conduct an investigation that leads them nowhere because whether knowingly or not they are pushed in that direction now seventeen years later the murder weapon is incontrovertibly tied to someone who just a few months before the killing was running around with the eights what am i missing here i think youve got it all so the question is could it be that the eights were not finished that they continued to foment only they tried to disguise their signature now and that they raised the ante to include murder rider slowly shook her head anything is possible but it doesnt make much sense the eights were about statementspublic statements burning crosses and painting synagogues but its not much of a statement if you murder somebody and then try to disguise it as a suicide bosch nodded she was right there was not a smooth flow to any of the logic then again they knew they had the lapd on their backs he said maybe some of them continued to operate but as sort of an underground movement like i said anything is possible okay so we have ross junior supposedly up in idaho and we have burkhart in wayside the two leaders who was left besides mackey there are five other names in the file none of the names jumped out at me thats our suspect list for now we need to run them and see where they went fromwait a minute wait a minute was burkhart still in wayside you said he got a year right that meant hed be out in five or six months unless he got into trouble up there when exactly did he go in rider shook her head no it would have been late march or early april when he checked into wayside he couldnt have doesnt matter when he checked into wayside when was he popped when was the synagogue thing it was january early january i have the exact date back in the file all right early january you said prints on a paint can tripped them to burkhart what did that take back in eightyeight when they were probably still doing it by handa week if it was a hot case like this if they popped burkhart by the end of january and he didnt make bail he held his hands wide allowing rider to finish february march april may june she said excitedly five months with gain time he could easily have been out by july bosch nodded the county jail system housed inmates awaiting trial or serving sentences of a year or less for decades the system had been overcrowded and under courtordered maximum population counts this resulted in the routine early release of inmates through gaintime ratios that fluctuated according to individual jail population but sometimes were as high as three days earned for every one day served this looks good harry maybe too good we have to nail it down when we get back ill go on the computer and find out when he left wayside whats this do to the wiretap bosch thought for a moment about whether they should slow things down i think we go ahead with the wiretap if the wayside date fits then we watch mackey and burkhart we still spook mackey because hes the weak one we do it when hes at work and away from burkhart if were right hell call him he stood up but we still have to run down the other names the other members of the eights he added rider didnt get up she looked up at him you think this is going to work bosch shrugged it has to he looked around the cavernous train station he checked faces and eyes looking for any that might quickly turn away from his own he half expected to see irving in the crowd of travelers mr clean on the scene thats what bosch used to think when irving would show up at a crime scene rider stood up they dropped their empty cups into a nearby trash can and walked toward the front doors of the station when he got there bosch looked behind them again searching for a follower he knew they now had to consider such possibilities the place that had been so warm and inviting to him twenty minutes before was now suspicious and forbidding the voices inside were no longer graceful whispers there was a sharp edge to them they sounded angry when they got outside he noticed that the sun had moved behind the clouds he wouldnt need his sunglasses for the walk back im sorry harry rider said for what i just thought that it would be different you coming back now here we are your first case back and what do you get a case with high jingo all over it bosch nodded as they crossed to the front walkway he saw the sundial and the words etched in granite beneath it his eyes held on the last line courage to do im not worried he said but they should be good to go commander garcia replied when bosch asked if he was ready bosch nodded and went to the door to usher in the two women from the daily news hi im mckenzie ward said the one leading the way she was obviously the reporter the other woman was carrying a camera bag and a tripod im emmy ward said the photographer sisters garcia asked though the answer was obvious because of how much the two women both in their twenties looked alike both attractive blondes with big smiles im older said mckenzie but not by much they all shook hands how did two sisters get on the same paper together then the same story together garcia said i was here a few years and then emmy just applied its no big deal weve worked together a lot its just a blind draw on who gets the photo assignments today we work together tomorrow maybe not do you mind if we take some photos first emmy asked i have another assignment i need to get to right after this of course garcia said ever accommodating where do you want me emmy ward set up a shot with garcia seated at the meeting table with the murder book open in front of him bosch had brought it with him to use as a prop as the photo session proceeded bosch and mckenzie ward stood off to the side and talked casually earlier they had spoken at length on the phone she had agreed to the deal if she got the story into the paper the following day she would be first in line for the exclusive when they took down the killer she had not agreed easily garcia had initially been clumsy in his approach to her before turning the negotiation over to bosch bosch was wise enough to know that no reporter would allow the police department to dictate when a story would be published and how it would be written so bosch concentrated on the when not the how he went with the assumption that mckenzie ward would and could write a story that would serve his purposes he just needed it in the paper sooner rather than later kiz rider had an appointment with a judge that afternoon if the wiretap application was approved they would be in business by the next morning did you talk to muriel verloren the reporter asked bosch yeah shes there all afternoon and shes ready to talk i pulled the clips and read everything from back thenlike i was eight years old at the timeand there were several mentions of the father and his restaurant will he be there too i dont think so hes gone its more of a mothers story anyway shes the one who has kept her daughters bedroom untouched for seventeen years she said you could photograph in there too if you want really really bosch watched her looking at the shot being set up with garcia he knew what she was thinking the mother in the bedroom frozen in time would be a lot better shot than an old cop at a table with a binder she looked at bosch while she started digging in her purse then i have to make a call to see if i can keep emmy go ahead she left the office probably because she didnt want garcia to overhear her telling an editor that she needed emmy to stay on the assignment because she had a better shot with the mother she was back in three minutes and nodded to bosch which he took to mean that emmy was going to stay with her on the story so this thing is a go for tomorrow he asked just to make sure once again its slotted for the windowdepending on the art my editor wanted to hold it for sunday make a nice long feature but i told him we were competitive on it anytime we can beat the times on a story we do yeah but what will he say when the times doesnt run anything hell know you tricked him no hell think that the times killed their story because we beat them to the punch happens all the time bosch nodded thoughtfully then asked what did you mean about it being slotted for the window we run a news feature every day with a photo on the front page we call it the window because its in the center of the page also because you can see the art in the window of the newspaper boxes on the street its a prime spot good bosch was excited by the play the story was going to get if you guys screw me on this i wont forget it mckenzie said quietly there was a threat in her tone the tough reporter coming to the surface bosch held his hands wide as if he had nothing to hide thats not going to happen youve got the exclusive as soon as we wrap somebody up im calling you and you only thank you now just to go over the rules again i can quote you by name in the story but you dont want to be in any photos right right i may have to do some undercover work on this i dont want my face in the paper got it what undercover you never know i just want to keep the option open besides the commander is better for the photo hes lived with the case longer than i have well i think i already have most of what i need from the clips and our call earlier but i still want to sit down with you two for a few minutes whatever you need done emmy said a few minutes later she started breaking down her equipment call the photo desk her sister said i think theres been a change and you are staying with me oh emmy said not seeming to mind why dont you make the call outside while we get going with the interview mckenzie said i want to get back to writing this as soon as we can the reporter and bosch took seats at the table with garcia while the photographer went out to check on her new assignment mckenzie started by asking garcia what stuck with him about the case for so long and what made him push it forward through the openunsolved unit while garcia gave a rambling response about the ones that haunt you bosch felt the waters of contempt rise in him he knew what the reporter didnt know that garcia had knowingly or unknowingly allowed the investigation to be shunted aside seventeen years earlier the fact that it appeared garcia did not know that his investigation had been tampered with somehow seemed like the lesser sin to bosch still if it didnt show personal corruption or a giving way to pressure from the upper reaches of the department at the very least it showed incompetence after a few more questions of garcia the reporter turned her attention to bosch and asked what was new in the case seventeen years later the main thing is we have the dna of the shooter he said tissue and blood from the murder weapon was preserved by our scientific investigation division we are hoping that analysis of it will allow us either to match it to a suspect whose dna is already in the department of justice data bank or to use it in comparisons to eliminate or identify suspects we are in the process of going back to everybody in the case anybody who looks like a suspect will have their dna checked against what weve got that is something commander garcia couldnt do in eightyeight were hoping it will change things this time bosch further explained how the weapon extracted a dna sample from the person who shot it the reporter seemed very interested in the happenstance of this and took detailed notes bosch was pleased the gun and dna story was what he wanted to get into the paper he wanted mackey to read the story and know that his dna was in the pipeline it was being analyzed and compared he would know that a sample from him was already in the doj database the hope was that this would make him panic maybe he would try to run maybe he would make a mistake and make a call in which he discussed the crime one mistake would be all it would take how long before you get results from the doj mckenzie asked bosch fidgeted he was trying not to lie directly to the reporter uh thats hard to say he answered the doj prioritizes comparison requests and there is always a backup we should have something any day now bosch was pleased with his response but then the reporter threw another grenade into his foxhole what about race she said i read all the clips and it seemed like nothing was ever brought up one way or the other about this girl being biracial do you think that played at all into the motivation of this murder bosch flicked a look at garcia and hoped he would answer first the case was fully explored in that regard in nineteen eightyeight garcia said we found nothing to support the racial angle thats probably why it wasnt in the clips the reporter turned her focus to bosch wanting the present take on the question as well weve thoroughly reviewed the murder book and there is nothing there that would support a racial motivation in the case bosch said we obviously are in the process of reworking the case front to back and well be looking for anything that might have played a part in the motivation behind the crime he looked at her and braced himself for her not accepting his answer and pressing it further he thought about floating the racial angle into the story it might improve the chances of some kind of response from mackey but it might also tip mackey to how close they were to him he decided to leave his answer as is instead of pursuing the question further the reporter flipped her notebook closed i think i have what i need for right now she said i am going to go talk to mrs verloren and then i have to hurry back and write this up to get it in tomorrow is there a number i can reach you at detective bosch quickly if i need to bosch knew she had him he reluctantly gave her his cell number knowing it meant that in the future she would have a direct line to him and would use it in regard to any case or story it was the last payment on the deal they had made everyone got up from the table and bosch noticed that emmy ward had quietly come back into the office and had been sitting by the door during the interview he and garcia thanked them both for coming in and said goodbye bosch remained in the office with garcia i think that went well garcia said after the door had closed i hope so bosch said it cost me a cell phone number ive had that number for three years now ill have to change it and notify everybody about the new number a big pain in the ass is what its going to be garcia ignored the complaint how sure are you that this guy mackey will even see the story were not in fact we believe hes dyslexic he might not read at all garcias jaw dropped then what are we doing well we have a plan for making sure hes aware of the story dont worry about that weve got it covered theres also another name thats come up since yesterday an associate of mackey then and now his name is william burkhart back when you were on the case he was known as billy blitzkrieg that ring a bell garcia put on his best deep thinking look like the one he had used for the camera and moved around behind his desk he then shook his head dont think it came up he said yeah you probably would have remembered garcia remained standing but leaned over the desk to look at his schedule lets see what have i got next youve got me commander bosch said garcia looked at him excuse me i need a few more minutes to clear up some of this stuff thats come up what stuff you mean this new guy blitzkrieg yes and the stuff the reporter asked about and we lied about the racial angle bosch watched garcias face set sternly into stone i didnt lie to her and i didnt lie to you yesterday we didnt find it we didnt see a racial angle to this we my partner and i are you sure about that the phone on his desk buzzed garcia grabbed it up angrily and said no calls no intrusions into it before dropping it back into its cradle detective i want to remind you whom you are talking to garcia said evenly now what the fuck do you mean are you sure what are you saying with all due respect to the rank sir the case was pushed away from the racial angle in eightyeight i believe you when you say you didnt see it otherwise i cant see you calling pratt down at openunsolved and reminding him there was dna in the case but if you didnt know what was happening then your partner certainly did did he ever talk about the pressure brought to bear on him from the command side on this case ron green was the finest detective i ever knew or worked with im not going to let you besmirch his reputation they stood just a few feet apart the desk between them their eyes locked in battle im not interested in reputations im interested in the truth you said yesterday he ate his own gun a few years after this case why was there a note the burden detective he couldnt carry it anymore he was haunted by the ones who got away what about the ones he let get away garcia pointed an angry finger at bosch how fucking dare you you are on thin ice here bosch i could make one call to the sixth floor and youd be out on the street before sundown you understand me i know about you youre just back from retirement and that makes you expendable with one phone call you understand me sure i understand you bosch sat down in one of the chairs in front of the desk hoping it might defuse the tension in the room a little bit garcia hesitated and then he sat down as well i find what you have just said to me completely insulting he said his voice juiced with anger im sorry commander i was trying to see what you knew i dont understand i am sorry sir but the case was definitely stonewalled by chain of command i dont want to get into names with you at this point some of them are still active but i think this case revolved on racethe connection to mackey and now burkhart proves it and you didnt have mackey or burkhart back then but you had the gun and there were other things i needed to find out if you were part of it i would say by your reaction that you werent but you are telling me my partner was and that he kept it from me bosch nodded impossible garcia protested ron and i were close all partners are close commander but not that close from what i understand you took care of the book and green pressed the case forward if he encountered resistance from within the department he might have chosen to keep it from you i think he did maybe he was protecting you maybe he was humiliated about being vulnerable to the push garcia dropped his eyes from bosch and looked down at his desk bosch could tell he was looking at a memory something in the stone wall of his face broke and gave way i think maybe i knew something was wrong he said quietly about halfway through how so early on we decided to split up the parents ron took the father and i took the mother you know to establish relationships ron was having trouble with the father he was volatile he had been passive and then all of a sudden hes on rons ass wanting results but there was something more there and ron kept it from me did you ask about it yeah i asked he just told me the father was a handful he said he was paranoid about race that he thought his daughter was killed because of the race thing and then he said something that i still remember he said we cant go there thats all he said but it stuck with me because that didnt sound like the ron green i knew we cant go there the ron green i knew would go wherever it led there were no cantgotheres with him not until that case garcia raised his eyes to bosch and bosch nodded his way of thanking him for opening up you think it had something to do with what happened later bosch asked you mean the suicide yeah maybe i dont know anythings possible after this case we sort of went in different directions the thing about partners is that once the work stops there isnt a whole lot to talk about true bosch said i was in a command staff meeting at seventyseventhi was assigned there after making lieutenant that was when i found out he was dead it came across in a staff notice i guess that shows how far apart we had gotten i found out he had killed himself a week after he did it bosch just nodded there was nothing he could say to that i think i have a staff meeting now detective garcia said its time for you to go yes sir but you know i was thinking in order for them to push ron green so hard they must have already had something to push him with you remember anything like that did he have an iad beef running at the time garcia shook his head he wasnt saying no to boschs question he was saying something else you know this department has always had more cops assigned to investigating cops than it has to investigating murders i always thought that if i reached the top i would change that are you saying there was an investigation im saying it was rare in the department not to have something on your record there was a file on ron sure he had been accused of assaulting a suspect it was bullshit the kid bumped his head and needed stitches when ron was putting him in the back of the car big deal right turned out the kid had connections and the iad wasnt letting it go away so they could have used that to push this case could have depending on how much a believer in conspiracy theories you are when it comes to the lapd i am a believer bosch thought but didnt say okay sir i think i have the picture he said instead ill get out of here now bosch stood up to leave i understand your need to know all of this garcia said i just dont appreciate how you sandbagged me im sorry sir no youre not detective bosch not really bosch said nothing he moved to the door and opened it he looked back at garcia and tried to think of something to say he came up blank he turned and left closing the door behind him kiz rider was still sitting in the waiting area outside judge anne demchaks chambers when bosch got there he had been caught in midafternoon traffic coming back to downtown from van nuys and thought he might have missed the conference with the judge rider was reading a magazine but boschs first thought was that at this point in the case he would be unable to leisurely start flipping through a magazine at this point his focus could not be split he was all about one thing in a strange way he likened it to surfing a pursuit he had not followed since the summer of when he ran away from a foster home and lived on the beach many years had passed since then but he still remembered the water tunnel the goal was to tuck yourself into the tube the place where water swirled completely around you where there was nothing but the water and the ride bosch was in the tube now there was nothing but the case how long you been here he asked rider checked her watch about forty minutes has she been in there with it the whole time yup you worried no ive gone to her before once on a hollywood case after you left shes just thorough she reads every page it takes a while but shes one of the good ones the storys running tomorrow we need her to sign this today i know harry relax sit down bosch stayed standing the judges rotated warrant duty getting demchak was luck of the draw ive never dealt with her before he said was she a da no other side public defender bosch groaned his experience had been that criminal defense attorneys who became judges always brought at least the shadow of their allegiance to the defendant with them to the bench were in trouble he said no were not well be okay please sit down youre making me nervous is judy champagne still on the bench maybe we can take it into her judy champagne was a former prosecutor married to a former cop they used to say he hooked them and she cooked them once she became a judge she was boschs favorite for taking warrants to not because she leaned toward the cops she didnt she was downtheline fair and thats what bosch could count on shes still a judge but we cant shop search warrants around the building you know that harry now would you please sit down ive got something to show you bosch sat down in a chair next to her what ive got burkharts probation jacket she pulled a file from her bag opened it and slid it in front of bosch on the coffee table she tapped a fingernail on a line on a release form bosch leaned down to read it released from wayside july first nineteen eightyeight reported to probation and parole in van nuys on july fifth he straightened up and looked at her so hes in play absolutely they took him in on the synagogue vandalism on january twentysixth never made bail and with time served credits got out of wayside five months later hes totally in play on this harry bosch felt a charge of excitement as things seemed to fall closer together okay good did you amend the warrant to include him i put him in but not in too big a way mackeys still the direct link because of the gun bosch nodded and looked across the room at the empty desk where the judges clerk would normally sit the name plate on the desk said kathy chrzanowski and bosch wondered how the name would be pronounced and where she was he then decided to try not to think about what was happening inside the judges chambers you want to hear the latest from commander garcia he asked rider was putting the probation file back in her bag sure bosch spent the next ten minutes recounting his visit to garcias office the newspaper interview and the commanders revelations at the end you think he told you everything she asked you mean about how much he knew of what happened back then no but he told me as much as he was willing to i think he had to have been part of the deal i cant see one partner making a deal the other one doesnt know about not a deal like that then if he was in on it why would he call up pratt and tell him to send the dna through the doj wouldnt he have just sat on it like he had been doing for seventeen years not necessarily a guilty conscience works in strange ways harry maybe this has been working on garcia all these years and he decided to call pratt to make himself feel better about it plus say he was in on the deal back then with irving he might have felt safe to make that call once irving was pushed to the side by the new chief bosch thought about garcias reaction to his saying green might have been haunted by the ones he let get away maybe garcia got heated because it was he who was haunted i dont know bosch said maybe boschs cell phone chirped as he pulled it out of his pocket rider said you better turn that off before we go in thats one thing judge demchak doesnt like going off in chambers i heard about a da whose phone she confiscated bosch nodded and opened his phone and said hello detective bosch yes its tara wood i thought we had an appointment it struck bosch before she finished the sentence that he had forgotten the meeting at cbs and the bowl of gumbo he was planning for lunch beforehand he hadnt even had time for lunch tara i am really sorry something came up and we had to sort of run with it i should have called you but it slipped my mind im going to need to reschedule the interview if you will still talk to me after this um sure no problem i just had a couple of the writers from the show hanging around they were going to try to talk to you what show cold case remember i told you we have a oh right the show well im sorry about that now bosch didnt feel so bad she had been trying to use his interview appointment to work up a publicity angle of some kind he wondered if there was any feeling left in her for rebecca verloren as if knowing his thoughts she asked about the case is something happening on the case is that why you werent here sort of were making progress but there is nothing i can tell you rightactually there is something did you think at all about that name i mentioned last night roland mackey ringing any bells no still no ive got another one what about william burkhart maybe bill burkhart there was a long silence while wood did a memory scan no im sorry i dont think i know him what about the name billy blitzkrieg billy blitzkrieg youre kidding right no why you recognize it no not at all it sounds like a heavy metal rock star or something no hes not but youre sure none of the names do anything for you im sorry detective bosch looked up and saw a woman beckoning to them from the open door of the chambers rider looked at him and drew a finger across her throat look tara i need to go now i will call you to set up the interview as soon as i can i apologize again and i will call you soon thank you he closed the phone before she could respond and then he turned it off he followed rider through the door being held open by a woman bosch assumed was kathy chrzanowski the shades were drawn over the floortoceiling windows at the far end of the room a single desk lamp lit the chambers behind the desk bosch saw a woman who appeared to be in her late sixties she looked small behind the large dark wood desk she had a kind face which gave bosch hope that they would get out of the office with her approval for the phone taps detectives come in and sit down she said i am sorry to have held you out there waiting no problem your honor rider said we appreciate your taking a thorough look at this bosch and rider sat in chairs in front of the desk the judge was not wearing her black robe bosch noticed it hanging on a hat rack in the corner next to it on the wall was a framed photograph of demchak with a notoriously liberal state supreme court justice bosch felt his stomach tighten then on the desk he saw two framed photographs one was of an older man and a young boy holding golf clubs her husband and a grandson maybe the other photo showed a young girl of maybe nine or ten riding on a swing but the colors were fading it was an old photo maybe it was her daughter bosch started to think that the connection to children might make the difference you seem to be in quite a hurry with this the judge said is there a reason for that bosch looked at rider and she leaned forward to answer this was her show he was just there as a backup and to send the message to the judge that this one was important cops had to be lobbyists on occasion yes your honor a couple reasons rider began the main one is that we believe there is a newspaper article that will be in the daily news tomorrow it may cause our primary suspect roland mackey to contact other suspectsone of whom is listed in the warrantand talk about the murder as you can see from the warrant we believe more than one individual was involved in this crime but we have only directly linked mackey to it if we are up and running our taps when the newspaper story hits we might be able to identify the others involved through his calls and conversations the judge nodded but she wasnt looking at them her eyes were cast down on the application and authorization forms she had a serious look on her face and bosch began to get a bad feeling after a few moments of silence she said and the other reason for your hurry oh yes rider said having apparently forgotten the other reason is we believe roland mackey still may be engaged in criminal activities we dont know exactly what they are at this time but we believe that the quicker we can start listening in on his conversations the sooner we will ascertain that and be able to stop someone from becoming a victim as you can see from the application we know he has been involved in at least one murder before we didnt think we should waste time bosch admired riders response it was a carefully designed answer that would put a lot of pressure on the judge to sign the authorization after all she was an elected official she had to consider the ramifications of her turning down the application if mackey committed a crime that could have been stopped had the police been listening to his phone calls the judge could be held responsible by an electorate that wouldnt care much about whether she had been trying to safeguard mackeys personal rights i see demchak said coldly in response to rider and what is your probable cause to believe he is engaged in current criminal activities since you cannot cite a specific crime a variety of things judge mr mackey cleared probation for a sex crime twelve months ago and immediately moved to a new address where his name is not listed on a deed or rental agreement he left no forwarding address with his former landlord or the post office he is living on the same property as an exconvict with whom he has previously engaged in documented criminal activity that is william burkhart also listed in the application and as you can see from the application he is using a phone not registered in his name he is clearly flying below radar your honor all of these things together paint a picture of someone taking precautions to hide involvement in criminal activity or maybe he just wants to avoid government intrusion the judge said it is still very thin detective do you have anything else i could use something else rider glanced sideways at bosch her eyes wide her confidence in the waiting room was leaving her bosch knew she had put everything into the application and her comments in chambers what was left bosch cleared his throat and leaned forward to speak for the first time the previous criminal activity he took part in with the man he now lives with were hate crimes judge these guys hurt and threatened a lot of people a lot of people he settled back in his seat hoping he had just ratcheted the pressure up at least another notch and how long ago were these crimes the judge asked they were prosecuted in the late eighties bosch said but who knows how long they have continued the association of these two men has obviously continued the judge said nothing for another minute as she seemed to be reading and rereading the summation section of riders application a small red light at the side of the desk went on bosch knew it meant that whatever was scheduled in her courtroom was ready to begin all attorneys and parties were present finally judge demchak shook her head i just dont think you have it here detectives you have him with the gun but not at the murder scene he could have handled the gun days or weeks before the killing she waved dismissively at the papers spread in front of her this bit about him burglarizing a drivein movie theater where the victim and her friends liked to go is tenuous at best you really put me on the spot here by asking me to sign off on something that just isnt there it is there bosch said we know it is there rider put a hand on his arm a warning not to lose it im not seeing it detective demchak said you are asking me to bail you out here you dont have enough probable cause and you are asking me to make up the difference i cant do it not as is your honor rider said if we dont get this signed we will lose the opportunity with the newspaper story the judge smiled at her that has nothing to do with me and what i must do here detective you know that i am not an arm of the police department i am independent and i have to deal with the facts of the case as presented the victim was biracial bosch said this guy is a documented hater he stole that gun and it was used to kill a girl of mixed race the connection is right there not a connection of evidence detective a circumstantial connection of inference bosch stared at the judge for a moment and the judge stared right back do you have children judge he asked the color immediately rose in the judges cheeks what does that have to do with this your honor rider broke in well come back to you with this no bosch said no were not coming back we need this now judge this guy has been out there free for seventeen years what if it had been your daughter could you look away then rebecca verloren was an only child judge demchaks eyes grew darker when she spoke it was with measures of both calm and anger i am not looking away from anything detective i happen to be the only one in this room that is looking closely at this and i might add that if you continue to insult and question the court then i will remand you to the lockup for contempt i could have a bailiff in here in five seconds perhaps you could use the downtime to contemplate the deficiencies of your presentation bosch pressed on undaunted her mother still lives in the house bosch said the bedroom she was taken from is still the same as the day she was killed same bedspread same pillows same everything the roomand the motherare frozen in time but those facts are not germane to this her father became a drunk he lost his business then his wife and home i visited with him on fifth street this morning thats where he lives now i know thats not germane either but i thought you might want to know i guess we dont have enough facts for you but we have a lot of the ripples your honor the judge held his eyes and bosch knew he was either about to go to jail or walk out with a signed warrant no inbetween after a moment he saw the glimmer of pain in her eyes anybody who spends time in the trenches of the criminal justice systemeither sidegets that look after a while very well detective she finally said she looked down and scribbled a signature at the bottom of the last page and started to fill in the spaces that dictated the length of the wiretaps but i am still not convinced she said sternly so i am giving you seventytwo hours your honor bosch said but rider put her hand on boschs arm again trying to stop him from turning a yes into a no then she spoke your honor seventytwo hours is a very short time period for this we were hoping that we would have at least a week you said the newspaper article is coming out tomorrow the judge responded yes judge it is supposed to but you will know something pretty quick then if you feel you need to extend it then come back and see me on friday and try to convince me seventytwo hours and i want daily summaries delivered each morning if i dont get them i am going to hold you both in contempt i am not going to allow you to go fishing if what is on the summaries is not on point then i will shut you down early is all of that clear yes your honor bosch and rider said in unison good now i have a status conference in my courtroom it is time for you to go and for me to go back to work rider collected the paperwork and they said their thanks as they headed to the door judge demchak called out to their backs detective bosch bosch turned around and looked at her yes judge you saw the picture didnt you she said of my daughter you guessed i have only one child bosch looked at her for a moment and then nodded i only have one myself he said i know what its like she held his eyes for a moment before speaking you can go now she said bosch nodded and followed rider through the door they didnt speak to each other as they left the courthouse it was as if they wanted to get out of there without putting the jinx on it as if their saying one word about what had happened might echo back through the building and make the judge change her mind and recall them now that they had the judges signature on the authorization forms all they cared about was getting out once on the sidewalk in front of the monolithic courthouse bosch looked at rider and smiled that was close he said she smiled and nodded her approval ripples huh you took it right up to the red line with her i thought i was going to have to go downstairs and post a bond for you they started walking toward parker center bosch pulled his phone out and turned it back on yeah it was close he said but we got it you want to tell abel to set up the meeting with the others yeah ill tell him i was just going to wait until we got over there bosch checked his phone and saw he had missed a call and had a message he didnt recognize the number but it had an area codethe valley he checked the message and heard a voice he didnt want to hear detective bosch its mckenzie ward at the news i need to talk to you about roland mackey as soon as possible i need to hear from you or i may have to hold the story call me shit bosch said as he deleted the message what rider asked its the reporter i told muriel verloren not to mention mackey to her but it sounds like she let it slip either that or the reporter is talking to somebody else shit thats what i said they walked a little further without speaking bosch was thinking of a way to deal with the reporter they had to keep mackey out of the story or else hed probably just cut and run without bothering to call anyone else what are you going to do rider finally asked i dont know try to talk her out of it lie to her if i have to she cant put his name in the story but she has to run the story harry we only have seventytwo hours i know let me think he opened his phone and called muriel verloren she answered and he asked her how the interview went she said it was fine and she was glad it was over did they take photos yes they wanted pictures of the bedroom i didnt feel good opening it up like that to them but i did i understand thank you for doing that just remember the story is going to help us were getting close muriel and the newspaper story will push things we appreciate your doing it if it helps then i am glad to do it good let me ask you something else did you mention the name roland mackey to the reporter no you told me not to so i didnt are you sure im more than sure she asked me what you people were telling me but i didnt say anything about him why no reason i just wanted to make sure thats all thank you muriel ill call you as soon as i have some news he closed the phone he didnt think muriel verloren would lie to him the reporter had to have another source what rider asked she didnt tell her then who did good question the phone started to vibrate and chirp while he was still holding it he looked at the screen and recognized the number its herthe reporter i have to take this he answered the call detective bosch its mckenzie ward im on deadline and we need to talk right i just got your message my phone was off because i was in court why didnt you tell me about roland mackey what are you talking about roland mackey i was told you already have a suspect named roland mackey who told you that that doesnt matter what matters is that you withheld a key piece of information from me is roland mackey your prime suspect let me guess you are playing both sides and giving that to the times bosch had to think quickly the reporter was sounding pressed and upset a reporter who goes off angry could be a problem he had to calm the situation and at the same time take mackey out of the mix the one thing he had going for him was that she had not mentioned a dna link between mackey and the gun this made bosch think that her source of information was outside the department someone with limited information first of all im not talking to the times on this as long as it runs tomorrow you are the only one with this story secondly it does matter where you got that name from because your information is wrong i am trying to help you here mckenzie you would be making a big mistake if you put that name in the article you might even get sued then who is he who is your source you know i cant give you that why not bosch was stalling for time while he thought it out while the reporter rattled off a standard response about shield laws and protecting sources bosch was ticking off the names of people outside the department whom he and rider had talked to about mackey they included rebecca verlorens three friendstara wood bailey sable and grace tanaka there was also robert verloren danny kotchof thelma kibble the parole agent and gordon stoddard the school principal as well as mrs atkins the secretary who looked for mackeys name in the schools rolls there was also judge demchak but bosch dismissed that as a long shot wards message had been left on his line while he and rider were with the judge the idea that the judge would have picked up the phone and called the reporter while she had been alone in chambers studying the search warrant application seemed out of the question she hadnt even known of the pending newspaper story let alone the reporter assigned to it bosch guessed that because of time constraints the reporter had simply gone back to the office and made a few phone calls to round out the story she had gotten the name roland mackey from someone she had called bosch doubted that she could have located or even contacted robert verloren in the few hours since the interview he also scratched grace tanaka and danny kotchof because they werent local without mackeys name there was no link to kibble that left tara wood and the schooleither stoddard sable or the secretary the most obvious answer was the school because it would have been the easiest link for the reporter to make he now felt better and thought he could contain the threat detective are you still there yes sorry im trying to dodge some traffic here then what is your answer who is roland mackey hes nobody hes a loose end or was actually weve tied that up now explain that look we inherited this case right well over the years the murder book got shelved reshelved moved around a bit things got mixed up so part of what we had to do was some basic housekeeping we had to put things in order we found a picture of this roland mackey guy loose in the book and we werent sure who he was and what his connection was when we were out doing interviews getting acquainted with the players in the case we showed his picture to a few people to see if they knew who he was and where he fit at no time mckenzie did we tell anyone he was a prime suspect that is the truth so either you are exaggerating or whoever mentioned this guy to you was exaggerating there was a silence and bosch guessed she was revisiting the interview that gave her the name mackey then who is he she finally asked just some guy with a juvie record who was living in chatsworth back then he hung out at the old drivein on winnetka and that was apparently a hangout for rebecca and her friends as well but it turns out that back in he was cleared of any involvement we didnt find out until after we showed the photo to a few people it was a mixture of truth and shadings of the truth again the reporter was silent while she considered his answer who told you about him gordon stoddard or bailey sable bosch asked we took the photo to the school to see if he fit in there and it turns out he didnt even go to school there we dropped it after that you sure about this look do what you want but if you put that guys name in the paper simply because we asked about him you could be getting calls from him and his lawyer we ask about a lot of people mckenzie thats our job more silence slipped by bosch thought the silence meant he had successfully defused the bomb we went over to the school to look at the yearbook and copy photos ward finally said we found out you took the only one they had in the library from eightyeight it was her way of confirming that bosch had it right but without giving up her source sorry about that he said i have the yearbook on my desk i dont know what kind of time you have but you can send somebody over to pick it up if you want no theres no time we took a picture of the plaque thats on the wall at the school that will work besides i found a shot of the vic in our archives well use that i saw the plaque its nice theyre very proud of it so were all right on this mckenzie yes were fine i just got a little excited there when i thought you were holding back something big dont have anything big to report yet all right then i better get back to finishing the story its still running in the window tomorrow if i get it finished call me tomorrow and tell me what you think i will bosch closed the phone and looked at rider i think were okay he said boy harry youve really got it going today the artful dodger i think you could probably talk a zebra out of his white stripes if you had to bosch smiled he then looked up at the city hall annex on spring street banished from parker center irvin irving now operated from the annex bosch wondered if mr clean was looking down on them right now from behind one of the mirrored windows of the office of strategic planning he thought of something kiz what do you know mcclellan no not really but you know what he looks like sure i saw him at command staff meetings irving stopped going once he was moved out to the annex he sent mcclellan most of the time as his representative so you could pick him out then sure but what are you talking about harry maybe we should go talk to him maybe spook him and send a message back down the pipe to irving you mean right now why not were here he gestured toward the annex building we dont have the time harry besides why pick a fight you can avoid lets not deal with irving until we have to all right kiz but we will have to deal with him i know we will they didnt speak again each focused on thoughts on the case until they reached the glass house and went inside abel pratt convened all members of the openunsolved unit in the squad room as well as four other rhd detectives loaned to the unit for the surveillance the meeting was turned over to bosch and rider who took a verbal walk through the case that lasted a half hour on a bulletin board behind them they pinned blowups of the most recent drivers license photos of roland mackey and william burkhart the other detectives asked few questions bosch and rider then turned the show back over to pratt all right were going to need all hands on deck with this he said well be working the sixes two pairs working the sound room two pairs working mackey and two pairs working burkhart i want the ou teams on mackey and the surveillance room the four loaners from rhd will watch burkhart kiz and harry have dibs and they want the second shift on mackey the rest of you can work out how you want to cover the remaining shifts we start tomorrow morning at six just about the time the paper will be hitting the streets the plan translated into six pairs of detectives working twelvehour shifts the shifts changed at am and pm since it was their case bosch and rider got first choice of shifts and had elected to cover mackey beginning each day at pm this meant working through the night but it was boschs hunch that if mackey made a move or a call it would occur in the evening and bosch wanted to be there when it happened they would alternate with one of the other teams the remaining two ou teams would alternate their time in the city of industry where a private contractor called listentech had what amounted to a wiretap center which was used by all law enforcement agencies in los angeles county sitting in a van next to the telephone pole carrying the line you were listening to was a thing of the past listentech provided a quiet airconditioned center where electronic consoles were set up for monitoring and recording conversations placed or received on any phone numbers in the county including cell phones there was even a cafeteria with fresh coffee and vending machines pizza could be delivered if needed listentech could service as many as ninety taps at a time rider had told bosch that the company was spawned in when law enforcement agencies began taking increasing advantage of the widening laws governing wiretaps a private company that saw the growing need stepped in with regional wiretap centers also known as sound rooms they made the work easier but there were still rules to follow were going to hit a bit of a snag in the sound room pratt said the law still requires that each line be monitored by a single individualno listening to two lines at once but we need to monitor three lines with two cops because thats all we got so how do we do this and still stay within the law we alternate one line is roland mackeys cell we monitor that fulltime but the other two lines are secondary thats where we alternate they come from the property where he lives and the place where he works so what we do is we stay with the first line when he is home and then from four to midnight when he is at work we switch to the work line no matter what lines we are actually listening to we will still get twentyfourhour pen registers on all three cant we get one more loaner from rhd to cover the third line rider asked pratt shook his head captain norona gave us four bodies and thats it pratt said we wont miss much like i said we have the pen registers pen registers were part of the telephone monitoring process while the investigators were allowed to listen in on phone calls on the monitored lines the equipment also registered all incoming and outgoing calls on all the lines listed in the warrant even if they were not being monitored this would provide the investigators with a listing by time and length of call as well as the numbers dialed on outgoing calls and the originating numbers for incoming calls any questions pratt asked bosch didnt think there would be any questions the plan was simple enough but then an ou detective named renner raised his hand and pratt nodded at him is this thing ot authorized yes it is pratt replied but as was said before as of now we only have seventytwo hours on the warrant well lets hope it goes the whole seventytwo renner said i gotta pay for my kids summer camp in malibu the others laughed tim marcia and rick jackson volunteered to be the other street team working with bosch and rider the other four got the soundroom detail with renner and robleto taking the day shift and robinson and nord taking the same shift as bosch and rider the listentech center was nice and comfortable but some cops didnt want to be cooped up no matter what the circumstances some would always choose the street and like marcia and jackson bosch knew he was one of them pratt ended the meeting by handing out copies of a piece of paper with everyones cell phone number on it as well as the radio channel they would use during the surveillance for you teams in the field ive got rovers on hold down in the equipment shed pratt said make sure you have the radio on harry kiz did i miss anything i think you got it covered rider said since our time is short on this one bosch said kiz and i are working something up to sort of push the action if we dont see any signs by tomorrow night we have the newspaper article and we have to make sure he sees it hows he going to read it if hes dyslexic renner asked he got a ged bosch said he should be able to read it we just have to make sure it somehow gets in front of him everybody nodded their agreement and then pratt wrapped things up okay gang thats it pratt said i will be checking with everybody through the days and nights stay loose and be careful with these guys we dont want anything turning back on us you people taking the first shift might want to head home now and get a good night just remember the clocks ticking on the warrant we have till friday night and then its pumpkins so lets get out there and get whats to be got were the closers so lets close this one out bosch and rider stood and smalltalked about the case with the others for a few minutes and then bosch made his way back to their alcove he pulled the copy of the probation file out of the stack of accumulated case files he had not gotten a chance to read through it thoroughly and now was the time the file was an addon file meaning that as mackey repeatedly was arrested and continued a lifelong trek through the criminal justice system the reports and court transcripts were merely added to the front of the file therefore the reports ran in reverse chronological order bosch was most interested in mackeys earlier years he went to the back of the file with the idea of moving forward in time mackeys first arrest as an adult came only a month after he turned eighteen in august he was picked up for car theft in what the followup reports classified as a joyriding incident mackey had been living at home at the time and stole a neighbors corvette he had jumped in the car and taken off after the neighbor had left it running in the driveway and gone back inside his house for a forgotten pair of sunglasses mackey pleaded guilty and the presentencing report contained in the file cited his juvenile record but made no mention of the chatsworth eights in september the young car thief was placed on one year probation by a superior court judge who tried to talk mackey out of a life of crime the transcript of the sentencing hearing was in the file bosch read the judges twopage lecture in which he told mackey he had seen young men like him a hundred times before he told mackey he was standing at the same precipice as the others one simple crime could be a life lesson or it could be the first step down a spiral he urged mackey not to go down the wrong path he told him to think hard and make the right decision on which way to go the words of warning had obviously fallen on deaf ears six weeks later mackey was arrested for burglarizing a neighborhood home while the husband and wife who lived there were at work mackey had cut an alarm but the break in current had registered with the alarm company and a patrol car was dispatched when mackey came out the back door carrying a video camera and assorted other electronics and jewelry two officers were waiting with guns drawn because mackey had been on probation for the car theft he was held in the county jail while awaiting disposition of the case after thirtysix days in stir he stood before the same judge again and according to the transcript begged forgiveness and for one more chance this time the presentencing report noted that drug testing indicated that mackey was a marijuana user and that he had begun hanging around an unsavory group of young men from the chatsworth area bosch knew that these men were likely the chatsworth eights it was early december and their plan of terror and symbolic homage to adolf hitler was just a few weeks away but none of this was in the psr the report simply stated that mackey was hanging with the wrong crowd as he sentenced mackey the judge would not have known how wrong that crowd was mackey was sentenced to three years of prison reduced to time served he was also placed on two years probation the judge knowing that prison would be just a finishing school for a young criminal like mackey was giving him a break and attempting to break him at the same time mackey walked out of court free but the judge had placed a series of heavy restrictions on his probation they included weekly drug tests maintaining gainful employment and a requirement that the high school dropout get his general education degree within nine months the judge told mackey that if he failed in any part of the probation order he would be sent to a state prison to complete his threeyear sentence you may consider this harsh mr mackey the judge said in the transcript but i consider it quite kind i am giving you a last chance here if you fail me on this you will without a doubt be going to prison society will be through with trying to help you at that point it will simply throw you away do you understand this yes your honor mackey said the file came with copies of the courtrequested completion reports from chatsworth high mackey got his ged in august a little more than a month after rebecca verloren was taken from her bed and murdered despite the judges admirable efforts to steer mackey from a life of crime bosch had to wonder if those efforts had cost rebecca verloren her life whether mackey was the actual triggerman or not hed had possession of the gun that killed her was it reasonable to think that the chain of events leading to the murder would have been broken if mackey had been behind bars bosch wasnt sure it was possible that mackey simply filled a role as weapon delivery man if it wasnt him it could have been someone else bosch knew there was no sense in breaking down the chain into what could or could not have happened anything bosch looked up from his thoughts rider was standing at her desk he flipped the file closed nah not really i was reading the probation file the early stuff a judge took an interest at first but then sort of let him go the best he could do was make him get the ged and that served him so well didnt it yeah bosch said nothing else he only had a ged himself hed also stood before a judge once as a car thief the car he had gone joyriding in had also been a corvette except it had not been a neighbors it had been his foster fathers bosch had taken it as a way to say fuck you but it was the foster father who sent the ultimate fuck you bosch was sent back to the youth hall to fend for himself my mother died when i was eleven bosch suddenly said rider looked at him doing her eyebrow thing i know whyd you bring that up i dont know i spent a lot of time in the youth hall after that i mean i had some stays with foster families but it never lasted long i always went back rider waited but bosch didnt continue and she prompted well we didnt have gangs in the hall he said but there was sort of a natural segregation you know the whites stuck together the blacks the hispanics there werent any asians back then what are you saying that you feel sorry for this asshole mackey no he killed a girl or at least helped kill her harry i know that kiz thats not my point what is your point i dont know im just sort of wondering you know what makes people go down different paths how come this guy became a hater how come i didnt harry youre overthinking go home tonight and get a good nights sleep youll need it because there wont be any tomorrow night bosch nodded but didnt move you going to take off rider asked yeah in a few you heading out yeah unless you want me to go with you over to hollywood vice nah ill be all right lets talk in the morning after we get the paper yeah im not sure where i can get the daily news in the south end i might have to call you up and let you read it to me the daily news was circulated widely in the valley but sometimes hard to locate elsewhere in the city rider lived down near inglewood in the same neighborhood where she had grown up thats cool give me a call and ill have it theres a box down at the bottom of the hill from my place rider opened one of her desk drawers and pulled out her purse she looked at bosch and did her eyebrow thing once again you sure about doing this marking yourself like that she was talking about their plan for pushing mackey the next day bosch nodded i have to be able to sell it he said besides i can wear long sleeves for a while it isnt summer yet but what if its not necessary what if he sees the story in the paper and gets on the phone and starts talking a blue streak something tells me that isnt going to happen anyway it isnt permanent vicki landreth told me it lasts a couple weeks at the most depending on how often you shower its not like those henna tattoos kids get on the santa monica pier they last longer she nodded her agreement okay harry ill catch you in the am then see ya kiz have a good one she started walking out of the alcove hey kiz bosch called after her what she said stopping and looking back at him what do you think you happy to be back on it she knew what he was talking about being back in homicide oh yeah harry im happy ill be downright giddy once we take this pale rider down and solve the mystery yeah bosch said after she left bosch thought for a few moments about what she meant by calling mackey a pale rider he thought it might be some sort of biblical reference but he couldnt place it maybe in the south end it was what some people called racists he decided to ask her about it the next day he started to look through the probation file again but soon gave up he knew it was time to focus on the here and now not the past not the choices made and the paths not taken he got up and stacked the file and the murder book under his arm if things were slow on the surveillance the next day they might make for good reading he stuck his head in abel pratts office to say goodbye good luck harry pratt said close it out were going to bosch parked in the rear lot and walked in through the back doors of hollywood division it had been a long time since he had been in the place and he immediately found it different the earthquake renovation that edgar had spoken of had seemingly touched every space in the building he found the watch office in the place where a holding tank had been located he found a report writing room for patrol officers whereas before theyd had to steal space in the detective bureau before going upstairs to the vice unit he had to go by the detective bureau to see if he could pull a file he went down the rear hallway passing a patrol sergeant named mcdonald whose first name he couldnt remember hey harry you back long time no see man im back six good deal six was the radio designation for hollywood division calling the patrol sergeant six was like calling a homicide detective roy it worked and it got bosch past his awkward memory loss by the time he got to the end of the hallway he remembered that the sergeants name was bob the homicide unit was at the back end of the vast detective squad room edgar had been right it didnt look like any detective bureau bosch had ever seen it was gray and sterile it looked like a warehouse where yaks made cold calls and ripped off businesses and old ladies for overpriced pens or timeshare units he recognized the top of edgars head just cresting above one of the sound partitions between the cubicles it looked like he was the only one left in the whole bureau it was late in the day but not that late he walked over and looked over the partition and down on edgar he had his head down and was working on the times crossword puzzle it had always been a ritual with edgar hed work the puzzle throughout each day taking it with him to the restroom and to lunch and out on surveillances he never liked to go home without finishing it edgar hadnt noticed boschs presence bosch quietly stepped back and ducked into the cubicle next to edgars he carefully lifted the steel trash can out of the desks foot well and duckwalked out of the cubicle to a position right behind edgar he stood up and let the trash can fall to the new gray linoleum from about four feet the resulting sound was loud and sharp almost like a shot edgar leaped out of his seat his crossword pencil flying toward the ceiling he was about to yell something when he saw it was bosch goddamn it bosch how you doin jerry bosch said barely getting it out while laughing goddamn it bosch yeah you said that i take it things are pretty slow in hollywood tonight what the fuck you doing here i mean besides scaring the shit out of me im working man ive got an appointment with the vice artist upstairs what are you doing im finishing up i was about to get out of here bosch leaned forward and saw that the grid of the crossword was almost entirely filled out with words there were several erasure marks edgar never worked a crossword in ink bosch noticed his old red dictionary was off the shelf and on the desk cheating again jerry you know you arent supposed to be using the dictionary like that edgar dropped back into his seat he looked exasperated by the scare and now the questions bullshit i can do whatever i want there arent any rules harry why dont you get on upstairs and leave me alone have her put some eyeliner on you and put you out on the stroll yeah you wish youd be my first customer all right all right is there something you need here or did you just drop by to bust my chops edgar finally smiled and bosch knew everything was all right between them a little of both bosch said i need to pull an old file where do they keep them now in this palace how old is it they started shipping stuff downtown to be microfilmed wouldve been in two thousand you remember michael allen smith edgar nodded of course i do someone like me isnt going to forget smith what do you want with him i just want his picture that file still here yeah anything that fresh is still around follow me he led bosch to a locked door edgar had a key and soon they were in a small room lined with shelves crowded with blue binders edgar located the michael allen smith murder book and pulled it off a shelf he dropped it into boschs hands it was heavy it had been a tough case bosch took the murder book to the cubicle next to edgars and started flipping through it until he came to a section of photographs that showed smiths upper torso and several closeups of his tattoos his markings had been used to identify and charge him with the murders of three prostitutes five years earlier bosch edgar and rider had worked the case smith was an avowed white supremacist who secretly hired black transvestite prostitutes he picked up on santa monica boulevard then out of guilt for crossing both racial and sexual lines he would kill them it somehow made him feel better about his transgressions the key break in the case came when rider found a prostitute who had seen one of the victims get into a van with a customer he was able to describe a distinctive tattoo on the johns hand that eventually led them to smith who had collected a variety of tattoos while in various prisons around the country he was tried convicted and sent to death row where he was still dodging the needle with a barrage of legal appeals bosch removed the photos that showed smiths neck hands and upper left arm all of which were festooned with prison ink i need these while im upstairs if youre leaving and need to lock the file room i can just leave these on your desk edgar nodded thatll be fine so what are you getting into man youre going to put that shit on yourself thats right i want to be like mike edgar narrowed his eyes this connected to that chatsworth eights stuff we were talking about yesterday bosch smiled you know jerry you ought to be a detective youre good at it edgar nodded like he was merely putting up with another sarcastic assault you going to get the haircut too he asked nah i wasnt planning on going that far bosch said im going to be sort of a reformed skinhead i think i get it so listen are you busy tonight this shouldnt take too long up there if you want to wait and finish your puzzle we could go grab a steak over at mussos just saying it made bosch hungry for it that and a vodka martini nah harry i gotta go over the hill to the sportsmens lodge for sheree rileys retirement gig thats why i was killing time here i was just waiting out the traffic sheree riley was a sex crimes investigator bosch had worked with her on occasion but they had never been close when sex and murder entwined the cases were usually so brutal and difficult there wasnt much room for anything but the work bosch didnt know she was retiring maybe we can get that steak some other time edgar said that cool everythings cool jerry have a good time up there and tell her i said hello and good luck and thanks for the pictures theyll be on your desk bosch headed back toward the hallway but heard edgar curse he turned around and saw his old partner standing and looking into his cubicle with his arms wide whered my damn pencil go bosch scanned the floor and didnt see it eventually his eyes rose and he saw the pencil stuck into the soundabsorption tiles in the ceiling above edgars head jerry sometimes what goes up doesnt come down edgar looked up and saw his pencil it took him two jumps to grab it the door to the vice unit on the second floor was locked but this was not unusual bosch knocked and it was quickly answered by an undercover officer bosch didnt recognize is vicki here shes expecting me then come on in the officer stepped back and let bosch enter he saw that this room had not been changed dramatically during the retrofitting it was a long room with work counters running down both sides above each vice officers space was a framed movie poster in hollywood division only posters from movies actually filmed in the division were allowed to grace the walls he found vicki landreth at a workspace under a poster from blue neon night a film bosch had not seen she and the other officer were the only ones in the office bosch guessed everybody else was already out on the streets for the night shift hey bosch landreth said hey vic you still have time to do this for you honey i will always make time landreth was a former hollywood makeup artist one day twenty years earlier she was talked into taking a ridealong with one of the offduty officers working security on the set the guy was just trying to make time with her hoping maybe shed catch a thrill on the ridealong and it would lead to something else what it led to was landreths enrollment in the police academy and her becoming a reserve officer working two shifts a month on patrol filling in where needed then someone in vice found out about her daytime job and asked her to work her two shifts in vice where she could be used to make undercover officers look more like prostitutes and pimps and drug users and street people soon vicki found the cop work more interesting than the movie work she quit the industry and became a fulltime cop her makeup skills were highly coveted and her niche in hollywood division was secure bosch showed her the photos of michael allen smiths tattoos and she studied them for a few moments nice guy huh she finally said one of the best and you want all of this done tonight no i was thinking about the lightning bolts on the neck and maybe the bicep if you could do it its all jailhouse no real art to it one color i can do it sit down over here and take off your shirt she led him to a makeup station where he sat on a stool next to a rack of various body paints and powders on an upper shelf there were mannequin heads with wigs and beards on them below these someone had taped the names of various supervisors in the division bosch took off his shirt and tie he was wearing a tshirt underneath i want these to be seen but i dont want to be too obvious about it he said i was thinking that you could work it so if i had on a tshirt like this you would sort of see parts of the tats sticking out enough to know what they are and what they mean not a problem hold still she used a piece of chalk to mark the lines on his skin where the shirts sleeve and neck reached these will be the visibility lines she explained you just tell me how much you want to go above and below them got it now take it all off harry she said it with undisguised sensuality in her voice bosch pulled his shirt over his head and tossed it over a chair with his other shirt and the tie he turned back to her and landreth was studying his chest and shoulders she reached over and touched the scar on his left shoulder thats new she said thats old well it has been a long time since i saw you naked harry yeah i guess so back when you were a boy in blue and could talk me into anything even joining the cops i talked you into my car not the department blame yourself for that bosch felt embarrassed and felt his skin blush their liaison twenty years earlier had flickered out for no reason other than that neither was looking for any sort of commitment to or from anybody they went their separate ways but always remained easy friends especially when bosch was transferred to the hollywood division homicide squad and they were working out of the same building look at you blushing landreth said after all these years well you know he said nothing further landreth rolled her stool closer to bosch she reached up and rubbed her thumb over the tunnel rat tattoo at the top of his right arm i do remember this one she said its not holding up so well is it she was right that tattoo he had gotten in vietnam had lost its lines over time and the colors had blurred the character of the rat with a gun emerging from a tunnel was not recognizable that tattoo looked like a painful bruise im not holding up so well myself vicki bosch said she ignored his complaint and got down to work she first used an eyeliner pencil to sketch out the tattoos on his body michael allen smith had what he had called a gestapo collar tattooed on his neck on each side of his neck was the twin lightning bolt insignia of the ss this symbolized the emblems attached to the collar points of the uniforms worn by hitlers elite force landreth etched these onto boschs skin easily and quickly it tickled and he had a hard time holding still then it was time for the bicep piece which arm she asked i think the left he was thinking of the play with mackey he thought the chances were better that he would end up sitting on mackeys right as opposed to his left that meant his left arm would be in mackeys line of sight landreth asked him to hold the photo of smiths arm up next to his own so she could copy it tattooed on smiths bicep was a skull with a swastika inside a circle on the crown while smith had never admitted to the murders he was charged with he had always been quite open about his racist beliefs and the origins of his many body markings the bicep skull he said had been copied from a world war ii propaganda poster shifting the sketch work from his neck to his arm allowed bosch to breathe easier and landreth to engage him in conversation so whats new with you she asked not a lot retirement was boring you could say that what did you do with yourself harry i worked a couple old cases but mostly i spent time in las vegas trying to get to know my daughter she leaned back away from her work and looked up at bosch with surprise in her eyes yeah i was surprised too when i found out he said how old almost six you still going to be able to see her now that youre on the job doesnt matter shes not there well where is she her mother took her to hong kong for a year hong kong whats in hong kong a job she signed a year contract she didnt consult you about it i dont know if consulted is the right word she told me she was going i talked to a lawyer about it and there wasnt much i could do thats not fair harry im all right i talk to her once a week as soon as i earn up some vacation ill go over there im not talking about it being unfair to you im talking about her a girl should be close to her father bosch nodded because that was all he could do a few minutes later landreth finished the sketch work opened a case and took out a jar of hollywood tattoo ink along with a penlike applicator this is bic blue she said its what most of them use in the jails i wont be perforating the skin so it should come off in a couple weeks should most times there was one actor i worked with though i put an ace of spades on his arm and the funny thing was that it wouldnt come off not all the way so he just ended up having a real tattoo put over my piece he wasnt too happy about it just like im not going to be happy if i have lightning bolts on my neck for the rest of my life before you start putting that stuff on me vicki is there he stopped when he realized she was laughing at him just kidding bosch its hollywood magic it comes off with a couple of good scrubs okay okay then then hold still and lets get this done she went to work applying the dark blue ink to the pencil drawing on his skin she blotted it regularly with a cloth and repeatedly told him to stop breathing which he told her he couldnt do she was finished in under a half hour she gave him a hand mirror and he studied his neck it looked good in that it looked real to him it also looked strange to see such displays of hate on his own skin can i put my shirt on now give it a few more minutes she touched the scar on his shoulder once again is that from when you got shot in that tunnel downtown yes poor harry more like lucky harry she started packing up her equipment while he sat there with his shirt off and feeling awkward about it so whats the assignment tonight he asked just to be saying something for me nothing im out of here youre done yeah we worked a day shift today working girls invading the hotel by the kodak center cant have that in the new hollywood can we so we bagged four of them im sorry vicki i didnt know i was holding you up i wouldve come in sooner hell i was downstairs shooting the shit with edgar before coming up you shouldve told me youd be waiting on me its all right it was good to see you and i wanted to tell you im glad youre back on the job bosch suddenly thought of something hey you want to hit mussos for dinner or are you going up to the sportsmens lodge forget the sportsmens lodge those things remind me too much of wrap parties i didnt like them either then what do you think i dont know if i want to be seen in that place with such an obvious racist pig this time bosch knew she was kidding he smiled and she smiled and she said dinner was a go ill go on one condition she said whats that you put your shirt back on without need of an alarm bosch awoke at fivethirty the next morning this was not unusual for him he knew that this was what happened when you surfed into the tube on a case waking hours overpowered the sleeping hours you did all you could to stay up on that board and in the pipeline though not scheduled to begin work for more than twelve hours he knew this would be the pivotal day in the case he could not sleep anymore in darkness and unfamiliar surroundings he got dressed and made his way to the kitchen where he found a pad for writing down needed grocery items he wrote a note and left it in front of the automatic coffeemaker which he had watched vicki landreth set the night before to begin brewing at am the note said very little other than thank you for the evening and goodbye there were no promises or seeyoulaters bosch knew she would not be expecting any they both knew that little had changed in the twenty years between their liaisons they liked each other fine but that wasnt enough to build a house on the streets between vicki landreths los feliz home and the cahuenga pass were misted and gray people drove with their lights on either because they had been driving through the night or because they thought it might help wake up the world bosch knew the dawn had nothing on the dusk dawn always came up ugly as if the sun was clumsy and in a hurry the dusk was smoother the moon more graceful maybe it was because the moon was more patient in life and nature bosch thought darkness always waits he tried to push thoughts of the night before out of his mind so that he could focus only on the case he knew the others would be moving into position now on mariano street in woodland hills and in the listentech sound room in the city of industry while roland mackey slept the forces of justice were quietly closing in on him thats how bosch looked at it that was what put the wire in his blood he still believed it was unlikely that mackey had been the one to pull the trigger on rebecca verloren but bosch felt no doubt that mackey provided the gun and would lead them on this day to the triggerman whether it would be william burkhart or someone else bosch pulled into the parking lot in front of the poquito mas at the bottom of the hill from his house he left the mercedes running and got out and went to the row of newspaper boxes he saw the face of rebecca verloren staring out at him through the smeared plastic window of the box he felt a little catch in his rhythm it didnt matter what the story said they were now in play he dropped the coins into the box and took a paper out he repeated the process taking a second paper one for the files and one for mackey he didnt bother reading the story until he had driven up the hill to his house he put a pot of coffee on and read the story while standing in the kitchen the window photo was a shot of muriel verloren sitting on her daughters bed the room was neat and the bed perfectly made right down to the ruffle skirting the floor there was an inset photograph of rebecca in the top corner it turned out that the daily news archives had held the same shot as the yearbook a headline above the photo said a mothers long vigil the bedroom photograph was credited to emerson ward the photographer apparently using her given name below it was a caption that read muriel verloren sits in her daughters bedroom the room like mrs verlorens grief has been untouched by time beneath the photo and above the body of the story was what a reporter had once told bosch was a deck headlinea fuller description of the story it read haunted muriel verloren has waited years to learn who took her daughters life in a renewed effort the lapd may be close to finding out bosch thought the deck was perfect if and when mackey saw it he would feel the cold finger of fear poke him in the chest bosch anxiously read the story by mckenzie ward staff writer seventeen years ago this summer a young and beautiful highschool girl named rebecca verloren was stolen away from her chatsworth home and brutally murdered on oat mountain the case was never solved leaving in its wake a splintered family haunted police officers and a community with no sense of closure from the crime but in a measure of hope for the victims mother the los angeles police department has launched a new investigation of the case that may see results and closure for muriel verloren this time out the detectives have something they didnt in the killers dna the lapds openunsolved unit began the intense refocus on the verloren case after one of the original detectivesnow a valley area commanderurged that it be reopened two years ago when the squad was formed to investigate cold cases as soon as i heard we were going to start looking at cold cases i was on the phone to them cmdr arturo garcia said yesterday from his office in the valley bureau command center this was the case that always stuck with me that beautiful young girl taken from her home like that no murder in our society is acceptable but this one hurt more than most it haunted me all these years so too muriel verloren rebeccas mother has continued to live in the house on red mesa way from which her yearold daughter was taken rebeccas bedroom remains unaltered from the night she was carried out a back door never to return i dont want to change anything the tearful mother said yesterday while smoothing the spread on her daughters bed its my way of remaining close to her i will never change this room and i will never leave this house det harry bosch who is assigned to the renewed investigation told the news that there are several promising leads in the case now the greatest aid in the case has been the technological advances made since blood that did not belong to rebecca verloren was actually found inside the murder weapon bosch explained that the pistols hammer bit the shooter on the hand taking a sample of blood and tissue in it could only be analyzed typed and preserved now it can be directly matched to a suspect the challenge is finding that suspect the case was thoroughly investigated previously bosch said hundreds of people were questioned and hundreds of leads were followed we are backtracking on all of that but our real hope lies in the dna it will be the case breaker i think the detective explained that while the victim was not sexually assaulted there were elements to the crime of a psychosexual nature ten years ago the state department of justice started a database containing dna samples from every person convicted of a sexually related crime the dna from the verloren case is in the process of being compared to those samples bosch believes it is likely that rebecca verlorens killing was not an isolated crime i think it is unlikely that this killer only committed this one crime and then led a lawabiding existence the nature of this offense indicates to us that this person likely committed other crimes if he was ever caught and his dna put into a data bank then its only a matter of time before we identify him rebecca was carried from her home in the dead of night on july for three days police and community members searched for her a woman riding a horse on oat mountain found the body secreted by a fallen tree while the investigation revealed many things including that rebecca had terminated a pregnancy about six weeks before her death the police were unable to determine who her killer was and how he got into the house in the years since the crime has echoed through many lives the victims parents have split up and muriel verloren could not say where her husband robert verloren a former malibu restaurateur is now located she said the disintegration of their marriage was directly attributed to the strain and grief brought on by their daughters murder one of the original investigators on the case ronald green retired early from the department and later committed suicide garcia said he believes the unsolved verloren case played a part in his former partners decision to end his life ronnie took things to heart and i think this one always bothered him garcia said and at hillside preparatory school where rebecca verloren was a popular student there is a daily reminder of her life and death a plaque erected by her classmates remains affixed to the wall in the exclusive schools main hallway we dont ever want to forget someone like rebecca said principal gordon stoddard who was a teacher when verloren was a student at the school one of rebeccas friends and classmates is now a teacher at hillside bailey koster sable spent an evening with rebecca just two days before she was murdered the loss has haunted her and she says she thinks about her friend all the time i think about it because it feels like it could have happened to anybody sable said after classes yesterday so it leads me to always ask the same thing why her that is a question the los angeles police hope to finally answer soon bosch looked at the photo on the inside page where the story jumped to it showed bailey sable and gordon stoddard standing on either side of the plaque on the wall at hillside prep emerson ward was credited with this photo as well the caption read friend and teacher bailey sable went to school with rebecca verloren and gordon stoddard taught her science class now school principal stoddard said becky was a good kid this shouldnt have happened bosch poured coffee into a mug and then read the story again while sipping his breakfast he then excitedly grabbed the phone off the counter and called kizmin riders home number she answered with a blurry voice kiz the story is perfect she put in everything we wanted harry what time is it harry almost seven were in business harry we have to work all night what are you doing awake what are you doing calling me at seven oclock bosch realized his mistake im sorry im just excited about it call me back in two hours she hung up there had not been a pleasant tone in her voice undaunted bosch pulled a folded sheet of paper from his jacket pocket it was the sheet of numbers pratt had passed out during the staff meeting he called tim marcias cell number its bosch he said you guys in position yeah were here anything shaking its a sleepy hollow right now we figure if this guy worked till midnight last night then hes going to be sleeping late his car is there the camaro yes harry its here okay did you read the story in the paper not yet but weve got two teams sitting on this house for mackey and burkhart were about to break off to get coffee and pick up the paper its good its going to work lets hope so after bosch hung up he realized that until mackey or burkhart left the house on mariano there would be double surveillance on the place it was a waste of time and money but he didnt see any way around it there was no telling when one of the surveillance subjects might take off from the house they knew very little about burkhart they didnt even know if he had a job he next called renner in the sound room at listentech he was the oldest detective on the squad and had used seniority to get him and his partner the day shift in the sound room anything yet bosch asked him not yet but youll be the first to know bosch thanked him and hung up he checked his watch it wasnt even seventhirty and he knew it was going to be a long day waiting for his surveillance shift to begin he refilled his coffee mug and looked at the paper again the photo of the dead girls bedroom bothered him in a way he could not pinpoint there was something there but he could not pull it out he closed his eyes for a five count and then brought them open hoping the trick would jar something loose but the photo did not reveal the secret a sense of frustration started to rise in him but then the phone rang it was rider great now i cant go back to sleep you better be brighteyed tonight harry because i wont be sorry kiz i will read me the story he did and when he was finished she seemed to have caught some of his excitement they both knew that the story would play perfectly into provoking a response from mackey the key would be to make sure that he saw it and read it and they thought they had that covered okay harry im going to get going i have some things to do today all right kiz see you up there how bout we meet at quarter to six on tampa about a block south of the service station ill be there unless something happens before yeah me too after hanging up bosch went into his bedroom and changed into fresh clothes that would be comfortable during an allnight surveillance and useful as well for the play he intended for mackey he chose a white tshirt that had been washed many times and had shrunk so that its sleeves were tight and short on his biceps before putting on a shirt over it he checked his look in the mirror a full half of the skull was exposed and the ss bolts pointed up above the cotton on his neck the tattoos looked more authentic than they had the night before he had taken a shower at vicki landreths and she told him that the water would slightly blur the ink on his skin as was the case with most prisonapplied tattoos she warned him that the ink would start to wash away after two or three showers and if needed she could maintain his look with further applications he told her he wasnt planning on needing the tattoos more than one day they would work or not work when he made his play he put on a longsleeved buttondown shirt over the tshirt he checked this in the mirror and thought he could see details of the skull tattoo bleeding through the cotton the thick black swastika on the crown was coming through ready to go but with hours before he was needed bosch paced nervously around his living room for a few moments wondering what to do he decided to call his daughter hoping that her sweet voice and cheerfulness would give him an added charge for the day he got the number for the intercontinental hotel in kowloon off the postit on his refrigerator and punched it into his phone it would be almost pm there his daughter should still be awake but when his call was connected to eleanor wishs room there was no answer he wondered if he had the time change wrong maybe he was calling too early or too late after six rings an answering service picked up giving bosch instructions in english and cantonese in how to leave a message he left a short message for both eleanor and his daughter and hung up the phone now not wanting to dwell on his daughter or thoughts about where she was bosch opened the murder book and began reviewing its contents again always looking for details of the case he had possibly missed despite everything he had learned about the case and how it was pushed off track by the powers that be he still believed in the book he believed the answers to the mysteries were always found in the details he finished a readthrough and was going to take up the copy of mackeys probation file when he thought of something and called muriel verloren she was at home did you see the story in the paper he asked yes it makes me feel so sad to see that why is that because it makes it all real to me i had pushed it away im sorry but it is going to help us i promise im glad you did it thank you whatever will help i want to do thank you muriel listen i wanted to tell you that i located your husband i spoke to him yesterday morning there was a long silence before she spoke really where is he down on fifth street he runs a soup kitchen for the homeless he serves breakfast to them its called the metro shelter i thought you might want to know again a silence bosch guessed she wanted to ask him questions and he was willing to wait you mean he works there yes hes sober now he said its been three years i guess he first went there for a meal and hes sort of worked his way up he runs the kitchen now and its good food i ate there yesterday i see um i have a number that he gave me its not a direct line he doesnt have a phone in his room but its in the kitchen and hes there in the mornings he said it slows down after about nine okay do you want the number muriel this question was followed by the longest silence of all bosch finally answered the question himself ill tell you what muriel ive got the number and if you ever want it you can just call me is that okay that would be fine detective thank you no problem im going to go now were hoping something breaks on the case today please call me it will be the first call i make after hanging up bosch realized that talking about breakfast had made him hungry it was now almost noon and he hadnt eaten anything since the steak at mussos the night before he decided that he would go into the bedroom and rest for a while and then have a late lunch before reporting for the surveillance he would go over to dupars in studio city it was on the way out to northridge pancakes were the perfect surveillance food he would order a full stack of buttered pancakes and they would sit in his stomach like clay and keep him full all night if necessary in the bedroom he lay on his back and shut his eyes he tried to think of the case but his mind wandered to the drunken time he got the tattoo put on his arm in a dirty studio in saigon as he drifted off to sleep he remembered the man with the needle and his smile and his body odor he remembered the man had said are you sure remember youll be marked forever with this bosch had smiled back and said i already am then in his dream the mans smiling face turned into vicki landreths face she had red lipstick smeared across her mouth she held up a buzzing tattoo needle she said are you ready michael he said im not michael she said its all right it doesnt matter who you are everybodys dodging the needle but nobody gets away kiz rider was already at the meeting spot when bosch got there he got out of his car and brought the murder book and the other files to her car a nondescript white taurus you have any room in your trunk he asked before getting in its empty why pop it i forgot to leave my spare tire at home he went back to his car a mercedesbenz suv and took the spare tire out of the back and transferred it to riders trunk using a screwdriver from the tool kit he removed the license plates from his car and put them in the trunk as well he then got in with her and they drove up tampa to the plaza shopping center across from the service station where mackey worked the day team marcia and jackson were waiting in their car in the lot the space next to them was open and rider pulled in everybody put down their windows so they could talk and transfer the two rovers without having to get out of their cars bosch took the radios but knew he and rider wouldnt use them well bosch asked well nothing jackson said seems like were pumping a dry hole here harry nothing at all rider asked there has been absolutely no indication at all that hes seen the paper or that anybody he knows has seen it we checked with the sound room twenty minutes ago and this guy hasnt even gotten a phone call let alone one about this he hasnt even had a tow call since he came on bosch nodded he wasnt concerned yet sometimes things needed a little push and that was what he was ready to do i hope youve got a good plan harry marcia called over he was in the drivers side of their car and bosch was furthest away on the passenger side of riders car you want to stick around bosch replied no use waiting on it if there hasnt been any action im ready to go jackson nodded i dont mind he said you going to need backup i doubt it im just going to plant a seed but you never know it couldnt hurt all right well watch anyway just in case whats your flare going to be bosch hadnt thought about how he would send up a flare if things went wrong and he had to call in backup i guess ill hit the horn he said or youll hear the shots he smiled and everybody nodded and then rider backed out of the space and they headed back down tampa to his car you sure about this rider asked as she pulled in next to the mercedes im sure he had noticed on the way over that she had brought an accordion file with her it was on the armrest between the seats whats this since you woke me up early i decided to go to work i traced down the other five members of the chatsworth eights great work any of them still local two of them are still around but it looks like they have grown out of their socalled youthful indiscretions no records theyve got pretty decent jobs what about the others the only one that still seems like hes a believer in the cause is a guy named frank simmons moved down here from oregon when he was in high school a couple years later he joins the eights he now lives in fresno but he did a twoyear bit in obispo for selling machine guns i might be able to use that when was he there hold on a second she opened her file and dug through it until she came up with a slim manila folder with the name frank simmons on it she opened it and showed bosch a prison mug shot of simmons six years ago she said he got out six years ago bosch studied the photo committing the details of simmonss look to memory he had dark short hair and dark eyes his skin was very pale and his face was tracked with acne scars he tried to cover these with a goatee that would also make him look tougher where was the case here he asked no actually it was from fresno he apparently moved up there after the troubles down here who was he selling the machine guns to i called the fbi office up there talked to the agent he didnt want to cooperate with me until he checked me out im still waiting for the callback great i got the feeling that mr simmons is still of active interest to the bureau up there and the agent wasnt into sharing bosch nodded where was simmons living at the time of the verloren thing cant tell he was one of the younger ones so he was probably living with his parents autotrack doesnt trace him back further than ninety by then he was in fresno so unless his parents moved out after this thing he was probably right there in the valley its possible okay this is good kiz i might be able to use some of this follow me over to the top of balboa park by woodley i think thats a good spot theres a golf course there with a parking lot there will be a lot of cars you guys will be able to park there and it will be good cover okay okay tell the other guys he took out his badge wallet his cuffs and his service pistol and put them all down on the floor of the car harry you got a backup ive got you right i mean it yes kiz ive got a little popper on my ankle ill be all right he got out and got into his own car on the drive over to the park he rehearsed the play in his mind he got ready and got excited ten minutes later he pulled over onto the shoulder of the park road killed the engine and got out he went to the right front side of the car and let the air out of the tire through the valve because he knew some tow trucks come equipped with compressed air he opened his pocket knife and slashed open the stem of the tires valve the tire would have to be repaired not refilled ready to go he opened his cell phone and called the service station where mackey worked he said he needed a tow and was put on hold a whole minute went by before another voice came on the line roland mackey what do you need i need a tow i got a flat and the valve looks like its fucked up what kind of car is it black mercedes suv what about the spare it got stolen by some niit was stolen when i was in southcentral last week thats too bad shouldnt go down there i had no choice can you tow me or not okay okay where are you bosch told him it was close enough that this time mackey didnt try to talk him into calling someone else all right ten minutes mackey said be there with your car when i get there ive got nowhere else to go bosch closed the phone and opened the back of the suv he pulled his outer shirt out of his pants and then took it off he put it in the back his new tattoos were now partially displayed he sat down on the tailgate and waited two minutes later his cell phone chirped it was rider harry they were able to pipe the call over to me from listentech you sounded legit good i just talked to the guys mackeys moving theyre with him okay im ready i kind of wish now we had gotten you a body wire you never know what this guy is going to say to you too risky in just a tshirt besides the chances of the guy telling a stranger he was the one who killed the girl in the newspaper story are probably longer than me winning the lotto without buying a ticket i guess i gotta go kiz good luck harry be careful all the time he closed the phone the tow truck slowed as it approached the mercedes bosch looked up from the rear hatch where he was sitting below the shade of the overhead door and reading the daily news he waved the paper at the tow truck driver and stood up the truck drove by and then onto the shoulder in front of the mercedes it then backed up to within five feet of it its driver got out it was roland mackey mackey was wearing leather gloves that were greasestained dark in the palms rather than acknowledge bosch he walked around the front of the mercedes and looked down at the flattened tire as bosch came around still holding the paper mackey squatted down and looked at the tires valve he reached out and bent it back and forth exposing the slice that had been cut into it almost looks like it was cut mackey said maybe glass in the road or something bosch offered and no spare aint that a bitch he looked up at bosch squinting in the light from the sun that was beginning to go down behind bosch youre telling me bosch replied well i can tow it in and then have my guy put a new valve on the tire take about fifteen minutes once we get it into the garage fine do it this going to be on triple a or insurance no cash mackey told him it would be eightyfive dollars for the tow plus three dollars for every mile his car was towed the charge for the valve replacement would be another twentyfive plus the cost of the valve fine do it bosch said again mackey stood up and looked at bosch he appeared to glance directly at boschs neck and then away he said nothing about the tattoos you should close the back he said instead unless you want to dump everything out on the way he smiled a little tow truck humor ill grab my shirt out of there and close it bosch said all right if i ride with you unless you want to call a cab and ride in style id rather ride with somebody who speaks english mackey laughed loudly while bosch went to the back of his car bosch then stood off to the side while mackey went through the procedures for hooking the vehicle to the truck it took him no more than ten minutes before he was standing at the side of his truck holding down a lever that raised the front end of the suv into the air after it was high enough for mackey he checked all the chains and harnesses and said he was ready to go when bosch got into the tow truck he had his shirt over his arm and the folded newspaper in his hand it was folded so the photo of rebecca verloren was noticeable does this thing have airconditioning bosch said as he pulled the door closed i was sweating my ass off out there you and me both you shouldve stayed in the vehicle with your own ac blowing while you waited this piece of shit doesnt have air in the summer or heat in the winter kind of like my exwife more tow truck humor bosch guessed mackey handed him a clipboard with an information page and a pen attached fill that out he said then were set okay bosch started to fill the form in with the false name and address he had come up with earlier mackey pulled a microphone off the dashboard and spoke into it hey kenny a few moments later there was a response go ahead tell spider not to leave yet mackey said im bringing in a tire that needs a valve hes not going to like that hes already washed up just tell him out mackey returned the microphone to its dash holder think hell stay bosch asked you better hope so or youre going to be waiting till tomorrow for your tire to get done i cant do that i have to get back on the road yeah where to barstow mackey started the tow truck and turned his body to the left so he could look out the side window and make sure it was okay to pull off the shoulder onto the road he could not see bosch from this position bosch quickly hiked the left sleeve on his tshirt up so that more than half of the skull tattoo was visible the tow truck pulled into the street and they started off bosch glanced out his window and saw the cars belonging to both rider and the other surveillance team in the parking lot of the golf course bosch put his elbow on the sill of the open window and his hand on the top frame out of mackeys view he was able to give the thumbsup sign to the watchers whats out in barstow mackey asked home thats all i want to get home tonight what have you been doing down here this and that what about southcentral what were you doing down there with those people last week bosch understood the reference to those people as meaning the predominant minority population of south la he turned and looked pointedly at mackey as if telling him he was asking too many questions this and that he said evenly thats cool mackey responded taking his hands off the wheel in a backing off gesture tell you what though it doesnt matter what i was doing you can just fucking keep this city man mackey smiled i know what you mean he said bosch thought they were close to sharing more than small talk he believed mackey had gotten a glimpse of the tattoos and was trying to draw from bosch a signal as to what kind of person he was he thought the moment was right for another subtle move toward the newspaper article bosch put the newspaper down on the seat between them making sure the photo of rebecca verloren was still noticeable he then started putting his shirt back on he leaned forward and extended his arms to do it he didnt look at mackey but knew the skull on his left arm would be very noticeable as he did this he put his right arm into the shirt first and then brought the shirt behind his back and put his left arm into its sleeve he leaned back and started buttoning the shirt just a little too third world around here for me bosch said im with you on that yeah is this where youre from my whole life well pal you ought to take your familyif you have a familyand the flag with you and leave just fucking leave this place mackey laughed and nodded i got a friend says the same thing all the time yeah well its not an original idea got that right then the radio interrupted the momentum of the conversation hey ro mackey grabbed the mike yeah ken im gonna run over to kfc while spiders waiting on you you want something nah ill go out later out he hung the mike up they drove in silence for a few moments while bosch tried to think of a way to naturally get the conversation going again and in the right direction mackey had driven down to burbank boulevard and gone right they were coming up on tampa he would turn right again and then it would be a straight shot to the station in less than ten minutes the ride would be over but it was mackey who got it going again so whered you do your time he suddenly asked bosch waited a moment so that his excitement wouldnt show what are you talking about he asked i saw your markings man its no big deal but theyre either homemade or prisonmade thats obvious bosch nodded obispo i spent a nickel up there yeah for what bosch turned and looked at him again this and that mackey nodded apparently not put off by his passengers reluctance to open up thats cool man i have a friend that was there for a while late nineties he said it wasnt so bad its kind of a whitecollar place not as many niggers there as other places at least bosch was silent for a long moment he knew mackeys use of the racial slur was like a password if bosch responded in the proper way then he would be accepted it was code work yeah bosch said nodding his head that made the conditions a little more livable i probably missed your friend though i got out in early ninetyeight frank simmons thats his name he was only there for like eighteen months or something he was from fresno frank simmons from fresno bosch said as if trying to recall the name i dont think i knew him hes good people bosch nodded there was one guy who came in like a few weeks before i walked out of that place he said i heard he was from fresno but man i was on short time and i wasnt into meeting new people you know what i mean yeah thats cool i was just wondering you know did your guy have dark hair and his face had a lot a scars like from zits and stuff mackey started smiling and nodding thats him thats frank we used to call him crater face from crater lake and im sure he was happy about that the tow truck turned onto tampa and headed north bosch knew he might have more time with mackey in the service station while the tire was being fixed but he couldnt count on it there could be another tow call or myriad other distractions he had to finish the play and plant the seed now while he was alone with the target he picked up the newspaper and held it in his lap glancing down as if he was reading the headlines he had to figure out a way to naturally steer the conversation directly toward the verloren article mackey took his right hand off the wheel and pulled off his glove by biting one of the fingers it reminded bosch of the way a child would do it mackey then extended his hand to bosch im ro by the way bosch shook his hand ro short for roland roland mackey pleased to meet you george reichert bosch said giving the name he had made up after careful thought earlier in the day reichert mackey said german right means heart of the reich thats cool and i guess that explains the mercedes you know i deal with cars all fucking day you can tell a lot about people by the cars they drive and how they take care of them i suppose bosch nodded he now saw the direct way to his goal once again mackey had unwittingly helped german engineering bosch said the best fucking carmakers in the world what do you drive when youre not in this rig im restoring a seventytwo camaro its going to be a sweet ride when im finished good year bosch offered yeah but i wouldnt buy anything out of detroit nowadays you know whos making our cars now dont you all the fucking mud people i wouldnt drive one let alone put my family in one in germany bosch responded you go into a factory and everybodys got blue eyes you know what i mean ive seen pictures mackey nodded thoughtfully bosch thought it was time to make the direct move he unfolded the newspaper on his lap he held it up so that the full front page and the full verloren story could be seen talk about mud people he said did you read this story no whats it say its about this mother sittin on a bed boohooing about her mud child who got killed seventeen years ago and the police are still on the case but i mean who cares man mackey glanced over at the paper and saw the photo with the inset shot of rebecca verlorens face but he didnt say anything and his own face did not betray any recognition bosch lowered the paper so as not to be too obvious about it he refolded it and discarded it on the seat between them he pushed things one more time i mean you mix the races like that and what are you going to get he asked exactly mackey said it wasnt a strong reply it was almost hesitant as if mackey was thinking about something else bosch took this as a good sign maybe mackey had just felt that cold finger go down his spine maybe it was the first time in seventeen years bosch decided he had given it his best shot if he tried to do anything more he might cross the line into obviousness and give himself away he decided to ride the rest of the way silently and mackey seemed to make the same choice but a few blocks later mackey swerved the truck into the second lane to get around a slowmoving pinto you believe there is still one of those on the street he said as they passed the little car bosch saw a man of asian descent huddled behind the wheel bosch thought he might be cambodian figures mackey said as he saw the driver watch this mackey then steered back into the original lane squeezing the pinto between the towed mercedes and a row of cars parked against the curb the pinto driver had no choice but to pull to a screeching stop mackeys laughter drowned out the weak horn blast from the pinto fuck you mackey yelled get back on your fucking boat he looked to bosch for affirmation and bosch smiled the hardest thing hed had to do in a long while hey man that was my car you almost hit that guy with he said in mock protest hey were you in vietnam mackey asked why because man you were there werent you so so man i had a friend who was there he said they dusted mooks like that guy back there like it was nothing a dozen for breakfast and another dozen for lunch i wish id been there is all im saying bosch looked away from him and out the side window mackeys statement had left an opening for him to ask about guns and killing people but bosch couldnt bring himself to go there all at once he just wanted to get away from mackey but mackey kept talking i tried to sign up for the gulfthe first onebut they wouldnt take me bosch recovered some and got back into it why not he asked i dont know they needed the slot for a nigger i guess or maybe you had a criminal record bosch had turned to look at him as he said this he immediately thought he had sounded too accusatory about it mackey turned and held his stare for as long as he could before having to return his eyes to the road ive got a record man big fucking deal they still couldve used me over there the conversation died there and in a few blocks they were pulling into the service station i dont think well need to put it in the garage mackey said spider can just take the wheel off while i have it on the hook well do it quick whatever you want to do bosch said youre sure he didnt leave yet no thats him right there as the tow truck went by the double bays of the garage a man emerged from the shadows and headed toward the back of the truck he was holding a pneumatic drill with one hand and pulling the air line with the other bosch saw the webwork tattooed on his neck prison blue something about the mans face immediately struck bosch as familiar in a rushed moment of dread he thought he knew the man because hed had dealings with him as a cop he had arrested him or questioned him before maybe even sent him to the prison where he had gotten the webwork done bosch suddenly knew he had to stay clear of the man called spider he pulled his phone off his belt all right if i sit here and make a call he asked mackey who was getting out of the truck yeah go ahead this wont take long mackey closed the door leaving bosch alone as he heard the drill start taking the lugs off the wheel of his suv bosch rolled the window up and called riders cell phone hows it going she said by way of a greeting it was going good till we got back to the station bosch said in a low voice i think i know the mechanic if he knows me this could be a problem you mean he might know youre a cop exactly shit exactly what do you want us to do tim and rick are still floating around call them and tell them whats happening tell them to stay loose until i get clear im going to stay in the truck as long as i can if i hold the phone up like i am talking i can keep him from seeing my face okay i just hope mackey doesnt want to introduce me i think i made an impression on him he might want to show me off okay harry just stay cool and well move in if we have im not worried about me im worried about the play with hey hes coming over just as she said the warning there was a sharp rap on the window bosch lowered the phone and turned to see mackey staring at him he rolled the window down its done he said already yup you can come into the office and pay while he puts the wheel back on youll make it home in a couple hours great holding the phone up to his right ear bosch got out of the truck and walked to the office never allowing spider a decent look at his face he spoke to rider while he walked it looks like im getting out of here he said good she said the man in question is putting on your wheel watch yourself when you leave will do once he was in the little office bosch closed the phone mackey had gone behind a greasy cluttered desk he took several seconds to use a calculator to do the simple arithmetic of the tow and repair charges comes to one twentyfive even he said four miles towing and the valve was three bucks bosch sat down in a chair in front of the desk and pulled out his fold of money can i get a receipt for it as he counted out six twenties and a five he heard the drill outside the tire was being put back on he held the money out but mackey was preoccupied by looking at a postit note he had found on the desk he held it at an angle that allowed bosch to read it rofyi visa called to confirm employment on your app bosch read it in a few seconds but mackey looked at it for a long time before finally dropping the note back on the desk and taking the money from bosch mackey put the money in a cash drawer and then started fishing around on the desk for a receipt pad he was taking a long time kenny usually writes up the receipts he said and he went to get some chicken bosch was about to say never mind about the receipt when he heard the scrape of a step behind him and knew that someone had entered the office he didnt turn in case it was spider all right ro its done you just need to let her down bosch knew this was the tight moment mackey would either introduce him or not all right spider mackey said then im outta here okay man thanks for sticking catch you tomorrow spider left the office without bosch ever turning around mackey found what he was looking for in the center drawer and scribbled something on it he gave it to bosch it was a blank receipt he had written in a childlike scrawl at the bottom you can just fill that out mackey said as he got up ill go drop your machine and you can get out of here bosch followed him out realizing he had left the newspaper on the seat of the truck he wondered if he should leave it there or come up with an excuse to go back into the truck so he could get it and maybe leave it in the office where he knew mackey watched television during the slow parts of his shift he decided to leave it where it was he had planted the seed as best he could it was time now to just step back and see what grew from it the mercedes was off the truck now bosch walked around to the drivers side mackey was stowing the harness in the back of the tow truck thanks roland bosch said just ro man mackey responded you take care man and do yourself a favor and stay out of southcentral dont worry about me bosch said i will mackey smiled and winked as he pulled off his glove again and offered bosch his hand bosch shook it and smiled back he then looked down at their hands and saw a tiny white scar in the fleshy part between mackeys right thumb and finger the tattoo from a colt ill catch you later he said bosch drove to the spot where he had met rider at the start of the surveillance shift and she was there waiting he parked and got into her taurus that was close she said turns out you probably did know that guy jerry townsend ring a bell we ran the plate on his pickup when he left work and got the id jerry townsend no not the name i just recognized his face he has a manslaughter conviction in ninetysix served five years sounds like it was a domestic abuse case but thats all they could pull off the computer i bet if we pulled the file your name would be on it thats how you recognized him you think he could be connected to this thing were working i doubt it whats probably going on is that whoever owns that station doesnt mind hiring excons they come cheap you know and if hes scamming on repairs then whos going to complain well lets get back and see what happens she put the car into gear and pulled out on tampa to head back up to the intersection where the service station was how did it go with him rider asked pretty good i did all but read the story to him he didnt show anything no recognition but the seed is definitely planted did he see the tattoos yeah they worked good he started asking questions right after he saw them your file on simmons paid off too he came up in the conversation and for what its worth he had a scar on the webbing by his right thumb from the bite harry man you covered everything i guess all we do now is sit back and see what happens did the other guys take off as soon as we get back on post theyre leaving when they got to the intersection of tampa and roscoe they saw mackeys tow truck waiting to pull onto roscoe to head west hes on the move bosch said why didnt anybody tell us just as he said it riders cell phone buzzed she handed it to bosch so she could concentrate on driving she cut into the left turn lane so she would be able to follow mackey onto roscoe bosch opened her phone it was tim marcia he explained that mackey went on the move without a call coming into the station for a tow jackson had checked with the sound room there had been no call on the lines they were listening to all right bosch said he said something when i was in the truck about going to grab dinner maybe this is it maybe okay tim we got him now thanks for sticking around tell rick the same good luck harry they followed the tow truck to a plaza shopping center and watched mackey go into a subway fast food restaurant he did not take the newspaper bosch had left in the truck with him but after getting his food he sat down at one of the inside tables and started to eat you going to get hungry harry rider asked now might be the time i did dupars on the way in so ill be fine unless we see a cupids around id go for that no way thats one thing i got over after you left i dont eat that fast food crap anymore what do you mean we ate good didnt we go to mussos every thursday if you call chicken pot pie a healthy meal yeah we ate good besides im talking about stakeouts did you hear about rice and beans in hollywood rice and beans was the designation given to a pair of robbery detectives in hollywood division named choi and ortega they were there when bosch worked in the division no what happened they were on a surveillance gig on these guys that were taking down street prostitutes and ortega was sittin in the car eating a hotdog he suddenly started choking on it and he couldnt clear himself hes turning purple and pointing to his throat and chois like what the fuck so finally beans jumps out of the car and choi finally gets whats going on he comes running around to give him the heimlich he popped the hotdog onto the hood of the car and they blew the surveillance bosch laughed as he pictured it he knew it was a story rice and beans would never live down in the division not with people like edgar there to tell and retell it to anyone who transferred in well see they dont have a cupids down in hollywood he said if hed been eating a nice soft dog from cupids there wouldnt have been a problem like that i dont care harry no hotdogs on stakeout no crap thats my new rule i dont want people talking about me like that the rest of my boschs phone chirped it was robinson who was working the late shift in the sound room with nord they just had a tow call come into the station they then turned around and called mackey he must not be at the station bosch explained the situation and apologized for not keeping the sound room in the loop wheres the tow he asked its an accident on reseda at parthenia i guess the cars doa hes got to tow it into a dealership okay were with him a few minutes later mackey came out of the fast food restaurant carrying a large soda cup with a straw sticking out they followed him to reseda boulevard and parthenia street where a toyota with the front end caved in had been pushed off the road another tow truck was just jacking up the other car a large suv that had its back end realigned by the accident mackey spoke briefly with the other tow truck drivera professional courtesyand went to work on the toyota an lapd patrol car was sitting in the parking lot of the corner plaza and the officer inside was writing up a report bosch saw no drivers he thought this meant that they might have all been transported to an emergency room because of injuries mackey towed the toyota to a dealership all the way over on van nuys boulevard while he was there letting the wreck down in the service drive bosch got another call robinson told him that mackey had been summoned again this time to the northridge fashion center where an employee of the borders bookstore needed a battery jump this guy isnt going to have time to read the paper if he stays busy like this rider said after bosch reported on the phone call i dont know bosch said im wondering if he can even read you mean the dyslexia yeah but not just that i havent seen him do any reading or writing he told me to fill in the forms for the tow then he either didnt want to or couldnt fill out a receipt at the end and then there was this note on the desk for him what note he picked it up and stared at it for a long time but i wasnt really sure he knew what it said could you read it what did it say it was a note from the dayshift people visa had called to confirm his employment on an application he had made i guess rider wrinkled her brow what bosch asked just seems weird him applying for a credit card that would make him findable which i thought he was trying to avoid maybe hes starting to feel safe mackey went from the toyota dealership straight to the shopping mall where he jumpstarted a womans car he then turned his truck toward the home base it was almost ten oclock by the time he pulled back into the station boschs sagging hopes were buoyed when he looked through the binoculars from the plaza across the street and saw mackey walking from the truck to the office we might still be in play he said to rider hes carrying the paper with him it was hard to keep track of mackey inside the station the front office was glass on two sides and that was not a problem but the garage doors were now closed and oftentimes it seemed that mackey would disappear into these areas where bosch could not see him you want me to be the eyes for a while rider asked bosch lowered the binoculars and looked at her he could barely read her face in the darkness of the car nah im okay youre doing all the driving anyway why dont you rest i woke you up early today he raised the binoculars back up im fine rider said but anytime you need a break besides bosch said i sort of feel responsible for this guy what do you mean you know this whole thing i mean we couldve just pulled mackey in and sweated him in the box tried to break him instead we went this way and its my plan im responsible we can still sweat him if this doesnt work then thats probably what well need to do boschs phone began to chirp maybe this is what were waiting for he said as he answered it was nord i thought you told us this guy got his general education degree harry he did whats going on he just had to call someone to read the story to him out of the paper bosch sat up a little straighter they were in play it didnt matter how the story was communicated to mackey the important thing was that he wanted to know what it said who did he call a woman named michelle murphy sounded like an old girlfriend he asked if she still got the paper every day like he wasnt sure anymore she said yeah and he asked her to read the story to him did they talk about it after she read it yeah she asked him if he knew the girl the story was about he said no but then he said i knew the gun just like that then she said she didnt want to know anything else and that was it they hung up bosch thought about all of this the play earlier in the day had worked it had kicked over a rock that had not been moved in seventeen years he was excited and he could feel the charge building in his blood can you pipe the recording over the line to us here he asked i want to hear it i think we can nord said let me get one of the techs who are floating around here tohey harry i gotta call you back mackeys making a call call me back bosch quickly closed the phone so nord could get back to her monitor he excitedly recounted for rider the report on mackeys phone call to michelle murphy he could tell rider caught the charge as well we might be in business harry bosch was looking through the binoculars at mackey he was sitting behind the desk in the office and talking on his cell phone come on mackey bosch whispered spill it tell us the story but then mackey closed the phone bosch knew the call was too short ten seconds later nord called bosch back he just called billy blitzkrieg what did he say he said i might be in trouble and i might need to make a move and then burkhart cut him off and said i dont care what it is dont talk about it on the phone so they agreed to meet after mackey gets off work where sounded like at the house mackey said youll be up and burkhart said he would be mackey then said what about belinda she still there and burkhart said shed be asleep and not to worry about her they ended it like that bosch immediately felt a crushing blow to his hopes of breaking the case that night if mackey met burkhart inside the house they would not hear what transpired inside theyd be locked out of the confession they had set up the surveillance to get call me if he makes any other calls he said quickly and then hung up he looked at rider who was waiting expectantly in the dark not good she asked she had obviously read something in his tone to nord not good he told her about the calls and the obstacle they would face if mackey met with burkhart to discuss his trouble behind closed doors its not all bad harry she said after hearing everything he made a solid admission to the murphy woman and a lesser admission to burkhart but were getting close so dont get depressed lets figure this out what can we do to make them meet outside of the house like at a starbucks or something yeah right mackey ordering a latte you know what i mean even if we roust them out of the house how are we going to get close we cant we need this to be a phone call its the blind spotmy blind spotto this whole thing we just need to sit tight and see what happens its all we can do right now look it would be good to have an ear on this but maybe its not the end of the world we already have mackey on the phone saying he might have to make a move if he does if he runs then that could be seen by a jury as a shading of guilt and if you take that and what we already have on tape it might be enough to squeeze more out of him when we finally bring him in so all is not lost here okay okay you want me to call it in to abel hed want to know yeah fine call it in theres nothing to call in but go ahead just cool down harry bosch shut her out by raising the binoculars and looking at mackey he was still behind the desk and appeared deep in thought the other night man the one bosch assumed was kenny was sitting on another chair and his face was angled up for viewing the television he was laughing at something he was watching mackey was not laughing or watching his face was cast down he was looking at something in memory the wait until midnight was the longest ninety minutes of surveillance bosch had ever spent as they waited for the station to close and mackey to head to his rendezvous with burkhart nothing happened the phones were silent mackey did not move from his spot at the desk and bosch came up with no plan to either avert the rendezvous or infiltrate it in some way it was as though they were all frozen until the clock struck twelve finally the exterior lights of the station went off and the two men closed the business for the night when mackey walked out he was carrying the newspaper he could not read bosch knew he was going to show it to burkhart and most likely discuss the murder and we wont be there bosch mumbled as he tracked mackey through the binoculars mackey got into his camaro and revved the engine loudly after firing it up he then pulled out onto tampa and headed south toward his home the intended meeting place rider waited an appropriate amount of time and then pulled out of the plaza lot cut across the northbound lanes of tampa and headed south as well bosch called nord in the sound room and told her mackey had left the station and they should switch their monitoring to the house line the lights of mackeys car were three blocks ahead traffic was sparse and rider kept a safe distance back as they passed the lot where bosch had left his car he checked on the mercedes just to make sure it was still there uh oh rider said bosch turned back to the street ahead in time to see mackeys car complete a fast uturn he was now heading back toward bosch and rider harry what do i do rider asked nothing dont do anything obvious hes coming right back at us he must have seen the tail sit tight maybe he saw my car parked back there the deepthroated engine of the camaro could be heard long before the car got to them it sounded menacing and evil like a monster roaring and coming for them the old camaro went screaming by bosch and rider without hesitation it blew the light at saticoy and kept going bosch watched its lights disappearing to the north what was that rider said you think he knows theres a tail i dont boschs cell phone sounded and he quickly answered it it was robinson he just got called back by the triple a answering service he seemed pretty upset but they have to take it i guess what do you mean hes got a tow yeah it was triple a dispatch i guess if he didnt take it they would go to another company and that could mean trouble like losing the triple a business wheres the tow its a breakdown on the reagan on the westbound side near the tampa avenue overpass so its close he said he was on the way okay we got him bosch closed the phone and told rider to turn around that their cover was still intact that mackey was simply hurrying back to get the tow truck by the time they were back to the intersection of tampa and roscoe the tow truck was pulling out of the darkened station mackey wasnt wasting any time since they knew mackeys destination rider could afford to hang back and not risk being noticed in the tow trucks rearview mirror they headed north on tampa toward the freeway the reagan was the freeway which ran eastwest across the northern stretch of the valley it was one of the few freeways that was not crowded with traffic twentyfour hours a day named after the late governor and president it led to simi valley where reagans presidential library was located still it had been jarring to bosch to hear robinson call it the reagan to bosch it was always simply the the westbound entrance to the ramped down from tampa avenue to the ten lanes of freeway rider slowed and hung back and they watched the tow truck turn left and head down the ramp out of sight she then pulled up and made the same turn as they came on the ramp and started down they immediately realized their problem the disabled car was not on the freeway as nord had said but actually on the entrance ramp they were quickly coming up on the tow truck it was pulled onto the ramps shoulder about fifty yards ahead its rear spreader lights were on and it was backing toward a small red car that was parked on the shoulder with its emergency lights blinking what do we do harry rider said if we pull over its going to be obvious she was right they would blow their cover just go on by he replied he had to think quickly he knew that once they were on the freeway they could pull onto the shoulder and wait until mackeys tow truck came by with the disabled car on its hook but that was risky mackey might recognize riders car or even stop to see if they needed assistance if he saw bosch then the surveillance would be blown you got a thomas guide under the seat rider drove by the disabled car and the tow truck as bosch reached under the seat for the map book once they were clear of the tow truck he put on the overhead light and quickly flipped through the map pages a thomas map book was the driving bible of los angeles bosch had years of experience with them and quickly found the page depicting the section of the city they were in he made a quick study of their situation and gave rider directions the next exit is porter ranch drive he said less than a mile we get off and go right and then another right on rinaldi it takes us back to tampa we either wait up on top of the overpass and watch or we just keep circling i think we wait up on top rider said if we keep going down that ramp in the same car he might notice sounds like a plan i dont like it but i dont know what choice we have they covered the distance to the porter ranch exit quickly did you check out the tow car bosch asked i was looking for the map book small foreign job rider responded it looked like one person behind the wheel and that was it the lights from the truck were too bright to see anything else rider kept her speed up until they pulled into the exit lane for porter ranch drive as instructed she took a right and then another right and they were quickly heading back toward tampa they got stopped at the light at corbin but then rider drove through it after checking to make sure it was clear less than three minutes after passing the tow truck they were back on tampa rider pulled to the side of the road in the middle of the overpass bosch cracked his door ill check it out he said he stepped out of the car at this angle he couldnt see the tow truck but the spreader lights on the top of the cab cast a glow above the entrance ramp harry take this rider called bosch ducked back into the car and took the rover rider was holding out to him he walked back along the overpass the freeway wasnt crowded but it was still loud with the cars passing beneath him when he got to the top of the ramp and looked down it took him a few moments to adjust his vision because the lights from the back of the tow truck were still slashing through the darkness but soon he realized that the blinking lights of the disabled car were not there he looked closer and saw that the car was no longer on the shoulder his eyes traveled down the ramp to the freeway and he saw the red taillights of dozens of cars moving westbound into the distance he looked back at the tow truck everything was still there was no sign of mackey bosch raised the radio to his mouth and keyed the mike kiz yeah harry you better get over here bosch started walking down the ramp as he did so he drew his weapon and carried it down by his side in thirty seconds lights flashed behind him and rider pulled her car onto the shoulder she got out with a flashlight and they continued down the ramp whats going on she asked i dont know there was still no sign of mackey in or around the tow truck bosch felt his chest tighten he instinctively knew something was wrong the closer they got the more he knew it what do we say if hes here and everythings okay rider whispered it isnt bosch said the light from the back of the truck was almost blinding and bosch knew they were in a vulnerable position he could not see anyone on the front side of the tow truck he moved to his right so that he and rider would be spread apart rider could not move to the left or she would be walking into the entrance lane a semitruck roared by on the ramp wafting petroleumtinged wind and sound over them and making the ground shake like an earthquake bosch was now walking in the weeds that were on the upward slope off the shoulder he still didnt see anyone up ahead bosch and rider did not communicate the noise from passing traffic on the freeway just below was echoing from beneath the overpass they would have to shout now and that would detract from their concentration they came back together when they got to the tow truck bosch checked the cab and there was no sign of mackey the truck was still running he stepped back to the rear and looked at the ground illuminated by the spreader lights there were curving black tire marks leading right up to the trucks rear gate and on the gravel was one of the leather gloves greasestained in the palm that he had seen mackey wearing earlier in the day let me borrow this he said taking the flashlight from rider he noticed that it was one of the short rubber models approved by the police chief after an officer was videotaped beating a suspect with one of the heavy steel lights bosch pointed the beam at the trucks rear gate running it over the underside that had been cast in shadows by the bright glare from the spreader above blood reflected brightly on the dark steel it could not be mistaken for oil it was as red and real as life bosch squatted down and pointed the light beneath the truck it had been dark here too made all the more impervious to vision by the bright lights above he saw mackeys body crumpled against the rear axle differential fully onehalf of his face was bathed in blood from a long and deep laceration that cut across the left side of his head his blue uniform shirt was maroon down the front from blood from other unseen injuries the crotch of his pants was stained with blood or urine or both the one arm bosch could see was bent oddly at the forearm and a jagged ivory white bone protruded from the flesh the arm was cradled against mackeys chest which heaved with nonrhythmic gasps he was still alive oh god rider called out from behind bosch get an ambulance bosch ordered as he started to crawl under the truck hearing riders feet crunch on the gravel as she ran back to her car and the radio bosch moved as close to mackey as he could get he knew he might be destroying a crime scene but he had to get close ro can you hear me ro who did this what happened mackey seemed to stir at the sound of his name his mouth started moving and that was when bosch could tell his jaw was broken or dislocated its movements were uncoordinated it was like mackey was trying it out for the first time take your time ro tell me who did this did you see him mackey whispered something but a car speeding by on the entrance ramp drowned it out tell me again ro say it again bosch pushed forward and leaned his head down by mackeys mouth what he heard was half gasp half whisper sworth he pulled back and looked at mackey he put the light into his face hoping it might rouse him he saw that the bone structure around mackeys left eye was also crushed and hemorrhaging he wasnt going to make it ro if you have something to say say it now did you kill rebecca verloren were you there that night bosch leaned forward if mackey said anything it was drowned in the noise of another car going by when bosch pulled back to look at him again he appeared to be dead bosch pushed two fingers into the bloodied side of mackeys neck and could not find a pulse ro roland are you still with me the one undamaged eye was open but at halfmast bosch moved the light in close and saw no pupil movement he was gone bosch carefully crawled out from beneath the truck rider was standing there her arms folded tightly in front of her ambulance on the way she said call em off he handed her back her flashlight harry if you think hes dead the paramedics should confirm it dont worry hes dead theyll just get under there and ruin our crime scene call them off did he say anything it sounded like he said chatsworth that was it anything else i couldnt hear she seemed to be pacing now in a small track nervously moving back and forth oh god she said i think im going to be sick then move back over there away from the scene she walked off behind her car bosch felt sick to his stomach as well but he knew he could keep it in it wasnt seeing mackeys torn and broken body that was causing the bile to rise in his throat bosch like rider had seen far worse it was the circumstances that were sickening instinctively he knew that this was no accident this had been an assassination and it was he who had put it all into motion he was sick because he had just gotten roland mackey killed and with the death he might have lost the last best link to rebecca verlorens killer part three darkness waits the tampa avenue entrance ramp to the ronald reagan freeway was closed and traffic was routed down rinaldi to the porter ranch drive entrance the entire freeway ramp was choked with official police vehicles the lapds scientific investigation division california highway patrol and the medical examiners office were all represented along with members of the openunsolved unit abel pratt had made calls and had greased the takeover of the case by the unit because the murder of roland mackey had taken place on a state freeway entrance the case technically belonged to the jurisdiction of the chp but the agency was more than happy to hand it off especially since the death was seen as part of an ongoing lapd investigation in other words the lapd was going to be allowed to clean up its own mess the commander of the local chp barracks did offer the use of his squads best accident expert and pratt took him up on that added to this pratt had assembled some of the best forensics people the department could muster all in the middle of the night bosch and rider spent much of the time during the crime scene investigation sitting in the back of pratts car where they were interviewed at length by pratt and then by tim marcia and rick jackson who were called in from home to head up the investigation into mackeys death since bosch and rider were part of some events and witnesses to others it was determined that they would not investigate the case as leads this was a technical formality it was clear that bosch and rider would be continuing to pursue the verloren case and in doing so they would obviously be pursuing roland mackeys killer at about am the forensics investigators gathered with the homicide detectives to go over what they knew so far mackeys body had just been removed from beneath the truck and the scene had been thoroughly photographed videoed and sketched it was now considered an open scene and everyone could walk freely about pratt asked the chp investigator a tall man named david allmand to go first allmand used a laser pointer to delineate the tire marks on the roadway and the gravel that he believed were involved in the incident with mackey he also pointed to the back of the tow truck where chalk circles had been drawn around several scratches dents and breaks in the heavy steel gate he said he concluded the same thing bosch and rider had concluded within seconds of finding mackey he was murdered the tire markings tell us that the victim pulled the tow truck onto the shoulder about thirty yards west of this point allmand said this was likely to avoid the disabled vehicle already on the shoulder the tow truck was then backed down the shoulder to this position here the driver put the transmission in park and set the parking brake before exiting the truck if he was in a hurry as some of the ancillary information indicates he may have gone right to the tail here to lower the towing assembly this is where he got it the disabled car was obviously not disabled the driver floored the accelerator and it lurched forward striking the tow truck driver and pinning him against the back of the truck and the tow assembly to get ready for the tow the vic would have bent over here to free the hook assembly he was likely doing this when he was struck and this would explain the head injuries he went face first into the assembly theres blood on the tow arm allmand ran the red eye of his laser over the tow trucks hook assembly to illustrate the car then backed up he continued and thats where you get the striated markings on the asphalt here he then moved forward for another strike the victim was probably already fatally injured from the first impact but he wasnt dead yet it is likely he fell to the ground after the first impact and with his last strength crawled under the truck to avoid the second impact either way the vehicle did strike the tow truck a second time and of course the victim succumbed to his injuries while beneath the truck allmand paused there for questions but he was met only with grim silence bosch could think of nothing to ask unchecked allmand finished up his report by pointing to two tire lines made in the gravel and asphalt youve got a wheel base on the striking vehicle that is not very wide he said that will cut it down some its probably going to be a little foreign job i took measurements and as soon as i consult my manufacturers catalogs i will be able to come up with a list of cars those treads could have come from ill let you know when no one said anything allmand used his laser to circle a small oil spot on the asphalt additionally the striking vehicle was leaking oil not a big deal but if it becomes important for a prosecutor to be able to say how long the killer sat here and waited for the victim then we can time the leak once the vehicle is recovered and come up with a rough estimate of how long it would have taken to make this little spot here pratt nodded good to know he said pratt thanked allmand and asked the assistant medical examiner ravi patel to report on his preliminary examination of the body patel began by listing the numerous broken bones and injuries that were obvious from external examination of the body he said the impact had likely fractured mackeys skull crushed the orbit of his left eye and dislocated his jaw his hips were crushed along with the left side of his upper torso his left arm and left thigh were broken as well it is likely these injuries were sustained in one initial impact he said the victim was likely standing and the impact came from the right rear side would he have been able to crawl under the truck rick jackson asked it is possible patel answered we have seen the instinct for survival allow people to do amazing things i wont know until i open him up but what we often see in cases like this is that the compression perforates the lungs the lungs fill with blood this takes time he could have crawled to what he thought was safety and then drowned on the side of the freeway bosch thought next to report was the lead sid investigator who happened to be ravi patels brother raj bosch knew them both from previous cases and knew they were both among the best raj patel gave the basics of the crime scene investigation and reported that mackeys efforts to save his life by crawling under the truck could ultimately allow the investigators to catch his killer the second impact on the truck was without the body as a buffer you see it was metal on metal we have both metal and paint transference and we have collected several samples if you find the vehicle that did this we can match it with one hundred percent accuracy that was one piece of light in all the darkness bosch thought after patel finished his report the crime scene began to break up with the investigators heading out to follow various assignments pratt wanted completed before the entire unit was to meet at the pacific dining car at am to discuss the case marcia and jackson were assigned to search mackeys home this would entail rousting a judge from sleep and getting a search warrant signed because mackey shared the home with william burkhart and burkhart was a possible suspect in the killing the homewith burkhart presumed to be in itwas under surveillance at the time mackey was cut down on the freeway nevertheless burkhart could have directed someone else to carry out the killing and was viewed as a suspect until cleared of involvement one of the first calls bosch and rider had made after finding mackey beneath the tow truck was to kehoe and bradshaw the two rhd detectives watching the home on mariano street they immediately went to the house and took burkhart and a woman identified as belinda messier into custody they were now waiting to be interviewed at parker center and bosch and rider drew that assignment from pratt but as they turned to walk up the slope of the freeway exit to riders car pratt asked them to hold up he then huddled with them and spoke so no one else remaining at the scene could hear i guess i dont have to tell you two that were going to get some heat on this he said we know rider said i dont know what form the review will take but i think you can count on a review pratt said well be ready rider said you might want to talk about that on the way downtown pratt suggested make sure everybodys on the same page bosch knew pratt was telling them to get their story straight so that it could be presented in unison and in the light that served them best even if they were interviewed separately well be all right rider said pratt glanced at bosch and then looked away back at the tow truck i know bosch said im a boot if somebody takes a fall for this it will be me thats okay the whole thing was my idea harry rider said thats not it was my plan bosch said cutting her off im the one well you might not have to be the one pratt said the sooner we get this thing put together the better off well be success makes a lot of bad shit go away so lets close this fucker by breakfast you got it boss rider said as bosch and rider headed up the slope they didnt speak parker center was deserted when they arrived though several investigative units operated from the headquarters building it was primarily filled each day with command staff and support services it didnt come alive until after sunup in the elevator bosch and rider split up bosch going directly to the robberyhomicide division on the third floor to relieve kehoe and bradshaw while rider made a stop by the openunsolved office to pick up the file she had put together earlier on william burkhart see you in a few she said to bosch as he stepped off i hope kehoe and bradshaw made some coffee bosch turned the corner out of the elevator alcove and headed down the hallway to the double doors of rhd a voice from behind stopped him what did i tell you about retreads bosch turned it was irving coming from the opposite hallway there was nothing down that way but computer services bosch guessed that he had been waiting in the hallway he tried not to show surprise that irving apparently already knew about what had happened on the freeway what are you doing here oh i wanted to get an early start its going to be a big day is that right thats right and ill give you fair warning in the morning the media will be alerted to this middleofthenight fuckup of yours the reporters will be told how you used this man mackey as bait only to let him be killed in a most horrible way they will ask questions about how a retired detective could have been allowed back into the department to do this but dont worry these questions will most likely be addressed to the chief of police who set it all in motion bosch laughed and shook his head acting as though he didnt feel the threat is that all he asked i will also be urging the commander of the internal affairs division to open an investigation into how you conducted this investigation detective bosch i wouldnt get too used to being back bosch took a step toward irving hoping to turn some of the threat back at him good chief you do that i hope you also prepare the commander for what i will be telling his investigators as well as the reporters about your own culpability in all of this there was a long pause before irving bit what nonsense are you talking about this man youre so worried about being used as bait was cut loose by you seventeen years ago chief cut loose so you could make your deal with richard ross mackey shouldve been in jail instead he used the gun from one of his little burglaries to kill an innocent sixteenyearold girl bosch waited but irving didnt say anything thats right bosch said i might have roland mackeys blood on my hands but youve got rebecca verlorens on yours you want to go to the media and iad with it fine take your best shot and well see how it all comes out a pinched look formed in irving s eyes he took a step toward bosch until their faces were only inches apart you are wrong bosch all of those kids back then they were cleared of involvement in verloren yeah how who cleared them green and garcia sure didnt they were pushed away from them by you just like the girls father you and one of your dogs scared him away from it too bosch pointed a finger at his chest you let murderers walk so you could keep your little deal intact an urgency entered irving s voice when he responded you are completely wrong on this he said do you really think that we would let murderers walk bosch shook his head stepped back and almost laughed as a matter of fact i do listen to me bosch we checked alibis on every last one of those boys they were all clean for some of them we were the alibi because we were still watching them but we made sure every member of that group was clean on this then we told green and garcia to back off the father was told too but he wouldnt stand down so you pushed him down right chief pushed him into a hole things had to be done the city was very tense back then we couldnt have her father running around saying things that werent true dont give me that goodofthecommunity bullshit chief you had your deal thats all you cared about you had ross and iad in your pocket and you wanted to keep it that way only you were dead wrong the dna proves it mackey was good for verloren and your investigation was for shit no wait just a minute it only proves one thing that he had the gun i read the story you planted in the paper today too the dna connects him to the gun not to the murder bosch waved him off he knew there was no sense going back and forth with irving his only hope was that his own threat to go to the media and iad would neutralize irving s threat he believed they were at a stalemate who checked the alibis he asked calmly irving didnt answer let me guess mcclellan hes got his prints all over this again irving didnt answer it was like he had drifted off into the memory of seventeen years before chief i want you to call your dog i know he still works for you tell him i want to know about the alibis i want details i want reports i want everything hes got by seven am today or thats it we do what we have to do and we see where the chips fall bosch was about to turn away when irving finally spoke there are no alibi reports he said there never would have been any bosch heard the elevator open and rider soon rounded the corner carrying a file she stopped dead when she saw the confrontation she said nothing no reports bosch said to irving then you better hope hes got a good memory good night chief bosch turned and started down the hall rider hurried to catch up to him she looked back over her shoulder to make sure irving was not following after they turned in through the double doors to rhd she spoke are we in trouble harry is he going to turn this against the man up on six bosch looked at her the mix of dread and fear on her face told him how important his answer was going to be not if i can help it he told her william burkhart and belinda messier were being held in separate interview rooms bosch and rider decided to take messier first so that burkhart would have to sit and wait and wonder it would also give them time to let marcia and jackson get the warrant and get into the house on mariano what they found might be helpful during the interview with burkhart belinda messier had come up in the investigation before the number on the cell phone mackey carried around was registered to her in the briefing kehoe and bradshaw had given bosch and rider upon their arrival she was described as burkharts girlfriend she had volunteered as much when the rhd detectives had taken both of them into custody she told them little else after that belinda messier was a petite woman with mousy blonde hair that framed her face her look belied the hard case she turned out to be she asked to see an attorney the moment rider and bosch entered the room why do you want to see an attorney bosch asked do you think you are under arrest are you telling me i can leave she stood up sit down bosch said roland mackey was killed tonight and you could be in danger too youre in protective custody that means youre not getting out of here until we get some things straight i dont know anything about it i was with billy all night until you people showed up over the next fortyfive minutes messier gave up information only grudgingly she explained that she knew mackey through burkhart and that she agreed to apply for cell phone service and turn the phone over to mackey because he didnt have a viable credit report she told the detectives that burkhart did not work and lived off a damages award he had received after a car accident two years before he bought the house on mariano street with the payout and charged mackey rent messier said she didnt live in the house but spent many nights there visiting burkhart when asked about burkhart and mackeys past ties to white power groups she feigned surprise when asked about the tiny swastika tattooed on the webbing between her right thumb and forefinger she said she thought it was a navajo good luck symbol do you know who killed roland mackey bosch asked after the long preamble of questions no she said he was a real nice guy thats all i know what did your boyfriend say after mackey called him nothin he just told me he was going to stay up and talk to ro about something when he came home he said they might go out for some privacy thats all yeah thats what he said they went at her several times and from several different angles with bosch and rider trading the lead back and forth but the interview produced nothing of real value to the investigation burkhart was next but before going into the interview bosch called marcia and jackson for an update you guys in the house yet bosch asked marcia yeah were in we havent found anything yet what about a cell phone no cell phone so far do you think burkhart could have slipped out on kehoe and bradshaw anythings possible but i doubt it they werent sleeping they were silent a moment as they thought about things and then marcia spoke how long was it between the time mackey got it and you called kehoe and bradshaw and told them to take burkhart in bosch reviewed his actions on the freeway before answering it was pretty quick he finally said ten minutes max then there you go marcia said getting from the one eighteen in porter ranch all the way to mariano street in woodland hills in ten minutes max and without being seen by our guys no way it wasnt him kehoe and bradshaw are his alibi and no cell phone in the house they all already knew that the landline in the house was not used to make a call because it would have registered on the monitoring equipment at listentech nope marcia said no cell phone and no call on the landline i dont think this is our guy bosch wasnt ready to agree yet he thanked him and hung up then gave the bad news to rider so what do we do with him she asked well he might not be our guy on mackey but mackey called him after the story was read to him i still like him for verloren but that doesnt make sense whoever hit mackey had to have been his partner on verlorenunless youre saying what happened on the onramp is just coincidental to all of this bosch shook his head no im not saying that were just missing something burkhart had to have gotten a message out of that house you mean like dialahitman or something its not working for me harry now bosch nodded he knew she was right it wasnt coming together all right then lets just go in there and see what he has to say for himself rider agreed and they spent a few minutes working out an interview strategy before going back into the hallway behind the squad room and entering the interview room where burkhart waited the room was stuffy with burkharts body odor and bosch left the door open burkhart had his head down on his folded arms when he didnt rouse from his feigned sleep bosch kicked the leg of his chair and that brought his head up rise and shine billy blitzkrieg bosch said burkhart had scraggly dark hair that flopped around a face of pasty white skin he looked like he didnt go out much except at night i want a lawyer burkhart said we all do but lets start with first things first my name is bosch and this is rider you are william burkhart and you are under arrest for suspicion of murder rider started to read him his rights but he cut her off are you crazy i never left my house my girlfriend was there the whole time bosch held a finger to his lips let her finish billy and then you can lie to us as much as you like rider finished reading the rights off the back of one of her business cards then bosch took back over now you were saying im saying you are fucked i was home the whole time and i have a witness who can prove it besides ro was my friend why would i kill him this is just a fucking joke so why dont you go ahead and get me my lawyer now so he can laugh your asses out of here you finished bill cause i have some news for you were not talking about roland mackey were taking you back seventeen years to rebecca verloren you remember her you and mackey the girl you took up into the hills thats who were talking about here burkhart showed nothing bosch had been hoping for a tell some sort of sign that he was on the right track i dont know what youre talking about burkhart said his face a stone weve got you on tape mackey called last night its over burkhart seventeen years is a long run but its over you got shit if there is a tape then all youll hear is me tellin him to shut up i dont have a cell phone and i dont trust em thats standing operating procedure if he was going to start telling me his problems i didnt want to do it on a goddamn cell phone as far as rebecca whateverhernameis i dont know nothing about that i guess you shouldve asked ro while you had the chance he looked at bosch and winked and bosch felt like coming across the table at him but he didnt they verbally sparred for another twenty minutes but neither bosch nor rider put a ding in burkharts armor eventually burkhart stopped taking part in the backandforth saying once more that he wanted an attorney and not responding in any form to any question that followed rider and bosch left the room to discuss their options which they agreed were minimal they had thrown a bluff at burkhart he had called them on it and they either had to book him and get him his lawyer or kick him loose we dont have it harry rider said we shouldnt kid ourselves i say we kick him bosch nodded he knew it was true they didnt have a case now and for that matter they might never have one mackey the one direct connection to verloren they had was gone boschs own doing had lost him now they would have to go back in time and run a full field on burkhart and search for something that was missed or hidden or ignored seventeen years before the full depression of their case situation was descending on him like a lead blanket he opened his phone and called marcia once more anything nothing harry no phone no evidence nothing okay just so you know were going to kick him he might show up there in a little while great he wont like what he finds here good bosch closed the phone and looked at rider her eyes told the story disaster he knew he had let her down for the first time he thought maybe irving had been rightmaybe he shouldnt have come back ill go tell him hes a free man he said after he walked away rider called after him harry i dont blame you he looked back at her i went along every step of the way it was a good plan he nodded thanks kiz bosch went home to take a shower get fresh clothes and maybe close his eyes for a while before heading back downtown for the unit meeting once again he drove through a city that was just waking for the day and once more it came up ugly in his eyes all sharp edges and harsh glare everything seemed ugly to him now bosch didnt look forward to the unit meeting he knew all eyes would be on him everybody in openunsolved understood that their actions would now be analyzed and secondguessed following mackeys death they also understood that if they were looking for a reason for the potential threat to their careers they didnt have to look far bosch threw his keys on the kitchen counter and checked the phone no messages he looked at his watch and determined that he had at least a couple hours before he needed to head toward the pacific dining car checking the time reminded him of the ultimatum he had given irving during their confrontation in the hallway outside rhd but bosch doubted he would hear from irving or mcclellan now it seemed as though everybody was calling his bluffs he knew sleeping for a couple hours wasnt really an option not with everything that weighed on him he had carried the murder book and the accumulated files into the house he decided he would work on them he knew that when all else went wrong there was always the murder book he had to keep his eyes on the prize the case he started the coffee brewer took a fiveminute shower and then went to work rereading the murder book while a remastered release of kind of blue sounded from the cd player the feeling that he was missing something right in front of him was grinding on him he felt that he would be haunted by the case that he would carry it around with him forever unless he cracked through and found that missing thing and he knew that if it was to be found anywhere it would be in the book he decided that this time he would not read through the documents in the order they had been presented to him by the first investigators of the case he snapped open the rings and took the documents out he started reading them in random order taking his time making sure that he absorbed every name every word every photo fifteen minutes later he was staring once again at the crime scene photos of rebecca verlorens bedroom when he heard a car door close in front of his house curious about who would be parking out there so early he got up and went to the door through the peephole he saw a man approaching by himself it was hard to clearly see him through the convex lens of the peep bosch opened the door anyway before the man had a chance to knock it did not surprise the man that his approach had been watched bosch could tell by his demeanor that he was a cop mcclellan he nodded lieutenant mcclellan and i assume you are detective bosch you could have called bosch stepped back to let him in neither man offered to shake hands bosch thought it was typical of irving to send his man to the house a standard procedure in the old iknowwhereyoulive intimidation strategy i thought it better that we talk face to face mcclellan said you thought or chief irving thought mcclellan was a big man with sandy almost transparent hair and wide florid cheeks bosch thought he could best be described as well fed his cheeks turned a darker shade at boschs question look im here to cooperate with you detective good can i get you something i have water waterd be fine have a seat bosch went into the kitchen and chose the dustiest glass from the cabinet and then filled it with tap water he flicked off the switch on the coffeemaker and warmer he wasnt going to let mcclellan get cozy when he returned to the living room mcclellan was looking out through the sliding glass door and across the deck the air was clear in the pass but it was still early nice view mcclellan said i know i dont see any files in your hand lieutenant i hope this isnt a social call or like one of those visits you made to robert verloren seventeen years ago mcclellan turned to bosch and accepted the glass of water and the insult with the same blank expression there are no files if there were they disappeared a long time ago and what youre here to try to convince me with your memories as a matter of fact i have great recall of that time period you have to understand something i was a detective first grade assigned to the pdu if i was given a job i did it you dont question command in that situation you do and youre out so you were a good soldier just doing your job i get it what about the chatsworth eights and the verloren murder what about the alibis there were eight principal players in the eights i cleared them all and dont think i wanted to clear them and so i just did i was told to see if any of these little pissants could have been involved and i checked it out but they all came up cleanon the murder at least tell me about william burkhart and roland mackey mcclellan sat down on a chair by the television he put his glass of water which he had yet to drink from down on the coffee table bosch turned off miles davis in the middle of freddie freeloader and stood with his hands in his pockets near the sliding doors well first of all burkhart was easy we were already watching him that night explain that he had just gotten out of wayside a few days before we had gotten tipped that while he was up there he was reupping on the racial religion so it was thought to be prudent to keep an eye on him to see if he was going to try to start things up again who ordered that mcclellan just looked at him irving of course bosch answered keeping the deal safe so pdu was watching burkhart who else burkhart got out and hooked up with two guys from the old group a guy named withers and another named simmons it looked like they mightve been planning something but on the night in question they were in a pool hall on tampa drinking themselves into oblivion it was solid two undercovers were in there with them the whole time thats what im here to tell you they were all solid detective yeah well tell me about mackey the pdu wasnt watching him was it no not mackey then how was he so solid what i remember about mackey was that on the night the girl was taken he was getting tutored at chatsworth high he was going to night school getting his high school degree actually his general education degree not exactly the same thing thats right a judge had ordered it as a condition of probation only he had to pass and he wasnt doing too good but he was getting tutored on the off nightswhen there was no school and the night the girl got grabbed he was with his tutor i confirmed it bosch shook his head mcclellan was trying to feed him a line youre telling me mackey was getting tutored through the middle of the night either youre full of shit or you believed a line of bullshit from mackey and his tutor who was the tutor no no they were together earlier in the evening i dont remember the guys name now but they were done by like eleven at the latest and then they went their separate ways mackey went home bosch looked astonished thats no alibi lieutenant time of death on the girl was two in the am didnt you know that of course i did but time of death wasnt the only alibi point i was given the summaries put together by the guys on the case there was no forced entry to that house and the father had gone around and checked all the doors and locks after he got home at ten that night that meant the killer had to have been inside the house at that point he was in there hiding waiting for everybody to go to sleep bosch sat down on the couch and leaned forward elbows on his knees he suddenly realized that mcclellan was right and that everything was now different he had seen the same report mcclellan had seen seventeen years before but its meaning had not registered the killer had been inside by the time robert verloren came home from work this changed a lot bosch knew it changed how he looked not only at the first investigation but also at his own not registering boschs inner turmoil mcclellan continued so mackey couldnt have gotten into that house because he was with his tutor he checked out all those little assholes checked out so i gave my boss a verbal report and then he told the two guys working the case and that was the end of it until this dna thing came up bosch was nodding to what mcclellan was saying but he was thinking about other things if mackey was clean how do you explain his dna on the murder weapon he asked mcclellan looked dumbfounded he shook his head i dont know what to say i cant explain it i cleared him of involvement in the actual murder but he mustve he didnt finish bosch thought that he actually looked wounded by the idea that he might have helped a murderer or at least the person who provided the weapon for a murder to get away with it he looked as though he knew all at once that he had been corrupted by irving he looked crushed is irving still planning to tip the media and iad to all of this bosch asked quietly mcclellan slowly shook his head no he said he told me to give you a message he said to tell you an agreement is only an agreement if both sides keep their end of it thats it one last question bosch said the evidence box on the verloren case is gone you know anything about that mcclellan stared at him bosch could tell he had badly insulted the man i had to ask bosch said all i know is that stuff disappears from the place mcclellan said through a tight jaw anybody could have walked off with it in seventeen years but it wasnt me bosch nodded he stood up well i have to get back to work on this he said mcclellan took the cue and stood he seemed to swallow his anger over the last question maybe accepting boschs explanation that it had to be asked all right detective he said good luck with this thing i hope you catch the guy and i really mean that he held his hand out to bosch bosch didnt know mcclellans story he didnt know all the circumstances of life in the pdu in but it looked like mcclellan was leaving the house with a greater burden than he had come in with so bosch decided he could shake his hand after mcclellan left bosch sat down again thinking about the idea that rebecca verlorens killer had been hiding in the house he got up and went to the dining room table where the files from the murder book were spread out the photos from the dead girls room were at center in the spread he looked through the reports until he found the sid report on latent fingerprint analysis the report was several pages long and contained the analysis of several fingerprints lifted from surfaces in the verloren household the main summary concluded that no print lifted from the house was an unknown therefore it was likely the suspect or suspects wore gloves or simply avoided touching surfaces likely to retain prints the summary said that all latent fingerprints lifted from the house were matched to samples from members of the verloren family or people who had an appropriate reason to have been in the house and touching the surfaces where the prints were found this time bosch read the report differently and in its entirety this time he was no longer interested in the analysis he wanted to know where the sid techs had looked for prints the report was dated a day after the discovery of rebeccas body it detailed a routine search for fingerprints in the household all topical surfaces were examined all doorknobs and locks all windowsills and frames every place it was logical to think that the killerkidnapper might have touched a surface during the crime while several prints on windowsills and latches were recovered and matched to robert verloren the report stated that no usable prints at all were recovered from doorknobs in the house it noted that this was not unusual because of the smudging that routinely occurred when knobs were turned it was in what was not included in the report that bosch saw the crack through which a killer might have escaped the sid team had gone into the house a day after the victims body was discovered this would have been after the case had been misread twice first as a missingpersons case and second as a suicide added to this when a murder investigation was finally mounted the latents team was sent in blind there was no understanding of the case at that point the idea that the killer might have hidden in the garage or somewhere else in the house for several hours had not been formulated yet the search for fingerprints and other evidence such as hairs and fibers never went beyond the obvious beyond the surface bosch knew it was too late now too many years had passed a cat roamed the house and who knows what objects from yard sales had come in and gone out of the house where a killer had hidden and waited then his eyes fell to the spread of photos on the table and he realized something rebeccas bedroom was the one place that had not been contaminated over time it was like a museum with its artwork encased and almost hermetically sealed bosch spread all the crime scene photos of the bedroom in front of him there had been something gnawing at him about these photos since the first time he had seen them he still couldnt get to it but now he felt urgent about it he studied the shots of the bureau and the bed table and then the open closet last he studied the bed he thought of the photo that had run in the newspaper and took the second copy of the paper out of the file containing all reports and documents accumulated during the reinvestigation of the case he unfolded the paper and studied emmy wards photo and then compared it to the photographs of seventeen years before the room seemed exactly the same as if untouched by the grief emanating from it like heat from an oven then bosch noticed a small difference in the daily news shot the bed had been carefully straightened and smoothed by muriel before the photograph was taken in the older sid shots the bed was made but the ruffle fluffed outward along one side of the bed and inward along the foot boschs eyes moved back and forth from one photo to the other he felt something breaking loose inside he felt a little charge drop into his blood this was what had bothered him it was the something that was not right in and out he said to himself it was possible he knew that the ruffle had been pushed inward at the bottom of the bed by someone crawling underneath it that would make it likely that the outward fluffing of the ruffle at the side of the bed would have occurred when that same person slid or crawled out after everyone was asleep bosch got up and started pacing as he worked it through again in the photo taken after the abduction and murder the bed clearly showed the possibility of entrance and exit rebeccas killer could have been waiting right below her as she fell asleep in and out bosch said again he worked it further he knew that no readable fingerprints had been recovered at the house but only obvious surfaces had been checked this did not necessarily mean the killer had worn gloves it only meant he was smart enough not to touch obvious places with his bare hands or smudged the prints when he needed to even if gloves had been worn during the entry to the house might not the killer have removed them while waitingpossibly for hoursunder the bed it was worth a shot bosch went to the kitchen and called sid and asked for raj patel raj what are you doing i am cataloging the evidence we gathered last night on the freeway i need your best latents man to meet me back up there in chatsworth now right now raj i might not even have a job later we have to do this now what is it we are to do i want to lift a bed and look underneath it its important raj if we find something it will lead us to the killer there was a short silence and then patel replied i am my best latents man harry give me the address thanks raj he gave patel the address and then hung up the phone he drummed his fingers on the counter wondering if he should call kiz rider she had been so distressed and discouraged as they had walked out of parker center that she said all she wanted to do was go home to sleep should he wake her for the second day in a row he knew that wasnt really the question the question was whether he should wait to see if there was anything beneath the bed before telling her and getting her hopes up he decided to hold off on the call until there was something solid to tell her instead he picked up the phone and woke up muriel verloren he told her he was on his way bosch got to the squad meeting at the pacific dining car late because of traffic coming in from the valley everyone was in a private area in the back of the restaurant most of them already had plates of food in front of them his excitement must have showed pratt interrupted a report from tim marcia to look at bosch and say you either got lucky during the time you had off or you just dont care about the deep shit were in here i got lucky bosch said as he took the only empty chair and sat down but not in the way you mean raj patel just pulled a palm print and two fingers off a wood slat that was beneath rebecca verlorens bed thats good pratt said dryly whats it mean it means that as soon as raj runs it through the database we might have our killer how so rider asked bosch had never called her he could already feel a hostile vibe from her i didnt want to wake you up bosch said to her then to the others he said i was looking through the original latents report in the murder book i realized that they went in there for prints the day after the girls body was found they never went back after it became a strong possibility that the abductor had come into the house earlier in the day when the garage was left open and hid somewhere until everybody was asleep so why the bed pratt asked the crime scene photos showed the ruffle at the foot of the bed had been pushed in like somebody had crawled underneath they missed it because they werent looking for it good work harry pratt said if raj gets a hit we change directions and move with it all right lets get back to our reports you can check with your partner on what youve missed so far pratt then turned to robinson and nord at the other end of the long table and said what did you come up with on the call for the tow truck not a lot that helps nord said because the call was made after we had switched our monitoring to the line at the burkhart property we dont have an audio recording of it but we do have the pen registers and they show that the call came directly to tampa towing before being bounced over to the triple a answering service the call came from a pay phone outside the seveneleven on tampa by the freeway entrance he probably made the call then drove down the entrance and waited prints on the phone pratt asked we asked raj to take a look after he cleared the scene robinson said the phone had been wiped figures pratt said you talked to triple a yes no help other than to say the caller was a male he turned to bosch you have anything to add that your partner didnt already tell us probably just more of the same burkhart looks like he is clear on last night and he looks like hes clear on verloren as well both nights he happened to be under lapd surveillance rider gave him her knottedbrow look he had even more information she didnt know he looked away well thats just perfect pratt said so who what and where does that leave us people well basically our newspaper plant backfired rider said it may have worked in terms of getting mackey to want to talk about verloren but he never got the chance somebody else saw the story that somebody being the actual killer pratt said exactly rider said the person mackey helped andor gave the gun to seventeen years ago that person also saw the story and knew it wasnt his blood on the gun so that meant it had to be mackeys he knew mackey was the link to him so mackey had to go so how did he set it up pratt asked he was either smart enough to figure the story was a plant and we were watching mackey or he just figured the best way to get to mackey was the way he did it get him out there alone like i said he was smart he picked a time and place that would result in mackey being alone and vulnerable on that entrance ramp you are up above the freeway even with the tow trucks lights on nobody would see up there it was also a good spot in case mackey had a tail nord added the killer knew a tail car would have to just keep moving by and then hed have mackey alone arent we giving this guy a little too much credit pratt asked how would he know the cops were onto this guy just from a newspaper article come on neither bosch nor rider answered and everyone else silently digested the unspoken suggestion that the killer had a connection to the department or more specifically the investigation all right whats next pratt said i think the containment on this is maybe another twentyfour hours tops after that its going to be in the papers and upstairs on six and theres going to be hair on the walls if we dont wrap it up first what do we do well take the pen registers bosch said speaking for himself and rider and go from there bosch had been thinking about the note to mackey he had seen on the desk in the service station the day before a call to verify employment from visa as rider had pointed out when she first heard about it mackey wasnt into leaving trails like credit cards it was something that didnt fit and therefore he wanted to go after it we have all of the printouts right here robinson said the line that was busiest was the one into the station all kinds of business calls okay harry kiz you want the registers pratt asked rider looked at bosch and then at pratt if thats what harry wants he seems to be on a roll today as if on cue boschs phone began to chirp he looked at the screen it was raj patel well see what kind of a roll right now he said as he opened the phone patel said he had good and bad news the good news is we still had the exemplar skid from the house in records here the latents we recovered this morning did not match any of them you found somebody new harry it could be your killer what this meant was that fingerprint examples from the members of the verloren family and others who had appropriate access to the house were still on file in the sid print lab none of those examples matched the fingerprints and palm print recovered that morning from beneath rebecca verlorens bed of course fingerprints could not be dated and it was possible that the prints discovered that morning had been left by whoever had installed the bed but it seemed unlikely the prints were taken off the underside of the wooden slat whoever had left them had most likely been under the bed and the bad news bosch asked i just ran them through the california system no matches what about the fbi thats next but that wont be so fast they have to process it i will send it through with an expedite request but you know how that goes i do raj let me know when you know and thanks for the effort bosch closed the phone he felt a steep letdown and his face showed it he could already tell the others knew the score before he delivered the news no match on the doj database he said hell try the bureaus base but that will take a while shit said renner speaking of raj patel pratt said his brother scheduled the autopsy for two oclock today i want one team there who wants to take it renner weakly raised his hand he and robleto would take it it was an easy assignment if you didnt mind the visuals the meeting soon broke up after pratt assigned robinson and nord the service station and the interviews of the people mackey worked with there marcia and jackson would work on pulling reports together and into a murder book they were still the lead investigators and would coordinate things from room pratt looked at the bill divided it by nine and told everyone to put in ten this meant bosch had to throw in a ten even though he hadnt even had a cup of coffee he didnt protest it was the price of being late and being the guy who put them on this path as everyone stood bosch caught riders eye did you come directly here or did you ride with somebody abel gave me a lift want to ride back together sure outside the restaurant she gave bosch the silent treatment while they waited for his car from the valet she stared at the large plastic steer that was atop the restaurants sign under her arm was a file containing the printouts from the pen registers finally the car came and they got in before pulling out of the lot bosch turned and looked at her all right say it he said say what whatever it is you want to say so you can feel better you shouldve called me harry thats all look kiz i called you yesterday and you chewed me out i was just working off of recent experience this was different and you know it you called me yesterday because you were excited about something today you were following a lead i should have been with you and then to not find out what you came up with until you went in there and told everybody that was embarrassing harry thanks for that bosch nodded his contrition youre right about that part im sorry i shouldve called you when i was coming in i just forgot i knew i was late and i had both hands on the wheel and was just trying to get here she didnt say anything so he finally did can we get back to solving this case now she shrugged and he finally put the car in drive on the way to parker center he tried to fill her in on all the details he hadnt mentioned during the breakfast meeting he told her about mcclellans visit to his house and how that led him to the discovery of the prints under the bed twenty minutes later they were in their alcove in room bosch finally had a cup of coffee in front of him they sat across from each other and had the pen register printouts spread between them bosch was concentrating on the reports on the service station phones the listing was at least a couple hundred entriescalls going in or out on the stations two phonesbetween am when the surveillance started and pm when mackey reported for work and renner and robleto started livemonitoring the line bosch scanned down the list nothing looked immediately familiar many of the calls were to or from business listings with some automobile connection clearly apparent in the name many others came in from the aaa dispatch center and these were likely tow calls there were also several calls that came from personal phones bosch looked closely at these names but saw nothing that jumped out at him no one listed was an already established player in the case there were four entries on the list that were attributed to visa all the same number bosch picked up the phone and called it he never heard it ring he just got the loud screeching sound of a computer hookup it was so loud that even rider heard it what is that bosch hung up im trying to run down that note i saw on the desk in the station about visa calling to confirm mackeys employment remember you said it didnt fit i forgot about that was that the number i dont know there are four listings for visa butwait a minute he realized that the visa calls were outgoing calls never mind these were outgoing it must be the number the machine calls when you use a credit card to pay thats not it there is no incoming call listed as visa bosch picked up the phone again and called nords cell phone are you at the service station yet she laughed weve barely cleared hollywood well be there in a half hour ask them about a phone message somebody left for mackey yesterday something about visa calling to confirm employment on a credit application ask them what they remember from the call and more importantly what time it came in try to get the exact time if you can ask them about this first thing and then call me back yes sir you want us to pick up your laundry too bosch realized it was getting to be a bad morning for stepping on toes sorry he said were working under the gun here arent we all ill call you as soon as we see the guy nord hung up bosch put the phone down and looked at rider she was looking at the class picture of rebecca verloren in the yearbook they had borrowed what are you thinking she asked without looking up at bosch this thing with visa bothers me i know so what are you thinking well say youre the killer and you got the gun you did it with from mackey youre completely giving up on burkhart you sure liked him last night lets just say the facts are persuading me for now okay okay go on all right so youre the killer and you got the gun from mackey hes the one person in the world who can put the thing on you but seventeen years go by and nothing ever happens and you feel safe and maybe you even lose track of mackey okay and then yesterday you pick up the paper and you see the picture of rebecca and you read the story and it says theyve got dna you know it wasnt your blood so it was either a big bluff by the cops or its got to be mackeys blood so thats when you know mackeys gotta go exactly the cops are getting close hes got to go so how do you find him well mackeys spent his entire lifewhen he isnt in jaildriving a tow truck if you knew that then youd do exactly what we did you get out the yellow pages and start calling tow companies rider stood up and went to the bank of file cabinets along the alcoves back wall the phone books were stacked haphazardly on top she had to stand on her toes to reach the yellow pages for the valley she came back and opened the book to the pages advertising tow services she ran her finger down a listing until she reached tampa towing where mackey had worked she backed up to the previous listing a company called tall order towing services she picked up her phone and dialed the number bosch heard only her side of the conversation yes who am i speaking with she waited a moment my name is detective kizmin rider with the los angeles police department i am investigating a fraud case and wondered if i could ask you a question rider nodded as she apparently got a goahead the suspect i am documenting has a history of calling businesses and identifying himself as someone working for visa he then attempts to verify someone elses employment as part of an application for a credit card does any of this ring a bell with you we have information that leads us to believe that this individual was operating in the valley yesterday he likes to target automotive businesses rider waited while there was a response to her question she looked at bosch but gave no indication of anything yes could you put her on the line please rider went through the whole thing again with another person and asked the same question then she leaned forward and seemed to take a stiffer attitude in her posture she covered the mouthpiece and looked at bosch bingo she said she then went back to the phone call and listened some more was it a male or female she wrote something down and what time was this she wrote another note and bosch stood up so he could look across his desk to read it she had written male approx on a scratch pad while she continued the conversation bosch consulted the pen register and saw that a call came in on the tampa towing line at pm it was from a personal number the name on the register was amanda sobek the numbers prefix indicated it was a cell phone neither the name nor the number meant anything to bosch but that didnt matter he thought they were getting close to something here rider finished her call by asking if the person she was talking to remembered the name the supposed visa employee had tried to confirm after she apparently got a negative reply she asked what about the name roland mackey she waited are you sure she asked okay thank you for your time karen she hung up and looked at bosch the excitement in her eyes wiped out everything about being left out of the mornings fingerprints find you were right she said they got a call same thing she even remembered the name roland mackey once i gave it to her harry somebody was tracking him down the whole time we were watching him and now were going to track them down if they were going down the line in the phone book they would have called tampa towing next the register shows a oneforty call from somebody named amanda sobek i dont recognize it but this might be the call were looking for amanda sobek rider said as she opened her laptop lets see what autotrack has on her while she was tracing the name bosch got a call from robinson who had arrived with nord at tampa towing harry the dayshift guy says that call came in between onethirty and two oclock he knows because he had just come back from lunch and he was sent out on a tow at two oclock a triple a run was it a male or female caller from visa male okay anything else yeah once this guy confirmed that mackey worked here the visa guy asked what hours he worked okay can you ask the day man another question hes right here ask if they have a customer named sobek amanda sobek bosch waited while the question was asked no customer named sobek robinson reported back is that good news harry itll work after closing the phone bosch got up and walked around the desks so he could look at riders computer screen he told her what robinson had just reported anything on amanda sobek he asked yeah this is it she lives in the west valley farralone avenue in chatsworth but there is not a lot here no credit cards or mortgage i think it means its all in her husbands name she might be a housewife im running the address to see if i can pull him up bosch opened the yearbook to rebecca verlorens class he started flipping through the pages looking for the name sobek or amanda here he is rider said mark sobek everythings basically in his name and it looks like a lot four cars two houses lots of credit cards there was nobody named sobek in her class bosch said but there were two girls named amanda amanda reynolds and amanda riordan think she is one of them rider shook her head i dont think so the age is off this says amanda sobek is fortyone that would make her eight years older than rebecca something doesnt fit think we should just call her bosch closed the yearbook with a bang rider jumped in her seat no he said lets just go where to see her yeah time to get off your ass and knock on doors he looked down at rider and could tell she wasnt amused i dont mean your ass specifically its a figure of speech lets just go she started getting up you are awfully flippant for somebody who might not have a job at the end of the day its the only way to be kiz darkness waits but it comes no matter what you do he led the way out of the office the farralone avenue address autotrack led bosch and rider to belonged to a mediterraneanstyle mansion that had to have been on the upper side of square feet it had a separate garage with four darkstained wooden doors and windows from a guest suite above the detectives had to view all of this through a wrought iron gate while waiting for someone to answer the intercom finally a voice came from the small square box on a pole next to boschs open window yes who is it it was a woman she sounded young amanda sobek bosch asked in reply no this is her assistant who are you two bosch looked again at the box and saw the camera lens they were being watched as well as listened to he pulled out his badge and held it a foot from the lens police he said we need to talk to amanda or mark sobek about what about police business open the gate please maam they waited and bosch was just about to punch the call button again when the gate slowly started to automatically open they drove in and parked in a turnaround circle in front of the twostory portico looks like the kind of place it might be worth killing a tow truck driver to protect bosch said quietly as he cut the engine the door was opened before they got there by a woman in her twenties she was wearing a skirt and a white blouse the assistant and you are bosch asked melody lane i work for mrs sobek is she here rider asked yes shes getting dressed and will be right down you can wait in the living room they were led into an entrance hallway where there was a table with several family photos on display it looked like a husband wife and two teenaged daughters they followed melody into a sumptuous living room with large windows looking out on santa susana state park and oat mountain beyond bosch checked his watch it was almost noon melody noticed she wasnt sleeping she worked out earlier and was taking a shower she should be down she didnt need to finish an attractive woman in white slacks and blouse left open over a pink chiffon shirt came hurrying into the room what is it is something wrong are my girls all right are you amanda sobek bosch asked of course i am what is wrong why are you here bosch pointed to the grouping of couch and chairs in the center of the room why dont we sit down here mrs sobek just tell me if something is wrong the panic on her face looked real to bosch he started to think they may have made a wrong turn somewhere nothing is wrong he said this is not about your daughters your daughters are fine is it mark no mrs sobek as far as we know he is fine too lets sit down over here she finally relented and walked quickly to the big chair to the right of the couch bosch moved around a glass coffee table and sat on the couch rider took one of the remaining chairs bosch identified himself and rider and showed his badge again he noticed that the glass on the table was spotless we are conducting an investigation that i cant tell you about i need to ask you some questions about your cell phone my cell phone you scared me to death over my cell phone its actually a very serious investigation mrs sobek do you have your cell phone with you its in my purse do you need to see it no not yet can you tell me when you used it yesterday sobek shook her head like it was an inane question i dont know in the morning i called melody from the gym i cant remember when else i went to the store and called my daughters to see if they were on their way home after school i cant remember anything else i was home almost all day except for the gym when im home i dont use my cell i use the regular phone boschs misgivings were multiplying somewhere they had made a wrong move could someone else have used the phone rider asked my daughters have their own so does melody i dont understand this bosch pulled the page from the pen register out of his coat pocket out loud he read the number of the phone that had called tampa towing is that your number he asked no its my daughters its kaitlyns bosch leaned forward this changed things further your daughters where was she yesterday i already told you she was in school and she didnt use her phone until after because its not allowed at school what school does she go to rider asked hillside prep its over in porter ranch bosch leaned back and looked at rider something had just come full circle he wasnt sure what it was but it felt important amanda sobek read the looks on their faces what is it she asked is something wrong at the school not as far as we know maam bosch answered what grade is your daughter in she is a sophomore does she have a teacher named bailey sable rider asked sobek nodded she has her for homeroom and english is there any reason why mrs sable might have borrowed your daughters phone yesterday rider asked sobek shrugged not that i can think of you have to understand how strange this is all these questions was her phone used to make a threat or something is this some kind of terrorist thing no maam bosch said but it is a serious matter we are going to have to go to the school now and talk to your daughter we would appreciate it if you came with us and were there when we spoke to her does she need a lawyer i dont think so maam bosch stood up shall we go can melody come too i want melody to go with me tell you what have melody meet us there that way she can drive you back if we need to go somewhere else on the drive over to hillside prep the car was silent bosch wanted to talk to rider to dope out this latest twist but he didnt want to do it in front of amanda sobek so they were silent until their passenger asked if she could call her husband and bosch said that was fine but she couldnt reach him and left a message in a nearhysterical voice telling him to call her as soon as he could when they got to the school it was lunchtime as they walked down the main hallway to the office they could hear the nearriotous collision of voices from the cafeteria mrs atkins was behind the counter in the office she looked a little confused when she saw amanda sobek in the company of the detectives bosch asked to see principal stoddard mr stoddard took lunch offcampus today mrs atkins said is there something i can help with yes wed like to see kaitlyn sobek mrs sobek here will be with us when we talk to her right now yes mrs atkins right now i would appreciate it if you or another school employee could go and get her it might be better if the other kids didnt see her being accompanied by the police i could go get her amanda offered no bosch said quickly we want to see her at the same time as you it was a polite way of saying that he didnt want her to ask her daughter about the cell phone before the police did ill just go to the cafeteria and find her mrs atkins said you can use the principals meeting room for your uh talk she came around the counter averted her eyes from amanda sobek and headed toward the door that led to the main hallway thank you mrs atkins bosch said it took mrs atkins almost five minutes to locate and return with kaitlyn sobek while they were waiting melody lane arrived and bosch told amanda that her assistant would have to wait outside the interview the girl accompanied bosch rider and her mother into a room off the principals office that had a round table with six chairs around it after everyone sat down bosch nodded to rider and she took over bosch thought it would be best for a woman to lead the interview of the girl and rider understood this without discussion she explained to kaitlyn that they were investigating a phone call that was made on her cell phone at pm the day before the girl immediately interrupted thats impossible she said why is that rider asked we had an electronic trap on the line that was called it showed the call came from your phone i was in school yesterday were not allowed to use cell phones during school hours the girl appeared nervous bosch could tell she was lying but couldnt figure out what the play was he wondered if she was lying because her mother was in the room where is your phone right now rider asked in my backpack in my locker and its turned off is that where it was yesterday at oneforty uhhuh she looked away from rider as she lied she was easy to read and bosch knew rider was getting the same thing he was getting kaitlyn this is a very serious investigation rider said in a soothing tone if you are lying to us you could find yourself in a lot of trouble kaitlyn dont lie amanda sobek said forcefully mrs sobek lets stay calm about this rider said kaitlyn these electronic traps i was telling you about are called pen registers the registers dont lie your cell phone was used to make the call there is no doubt so is it possible someone got into your locker and used your phone yesterday she shrugged anythings possible i guess okay who would have done that i dont know you were the one who said it bosch cleared his throat which drew the girls eyes to his he stared hard at her and said i think maybe we should take a drive downtown maybe this is not the right place for an interview he started to push back his chair and get up kaitlyn what is going on here amanda pleaded these people are serious who did you call no one okay no its not okay i didnt have the phone all right it was confiscated bosch sat back down and rider took over again who confiscated your phone she asked mrs sable the girl said why because were not supposed to use them inside school once the homeroom bell rings yesterday my best friend rita didnt come to school so i tried to text message her during homeroom to see if she was all right and mrs sable caught me and she took your phone yes she took it boschs mind was racing trying to put bailey koster sable into the mold of murderer of rebecca verloren he knew one thing didnt work a sixteenyearold bailey koster could not have carried her friends limp body up the hill behind her house why did you just lie to us about this rider asked kaitlyn because i didnt want her to know i was in trouble the girl said indicating her mother with her chin kaitlyn you never lie to the police amanda shot back i dont care what mrs sobek you can talk to her about this later bosch said let us continue when did you get the phone back kaitlyn rider asked at the end of the day so mrs sable had your phone all day yes i mean no not all day well who had it i dont know when they take your phone they tell you that you have to pick it up at the end of the day at the principals office thats what i did mr stoddard gave it back to me gordon stoddard things all at once started to come together bosch had tucked into the water tunnel and the case and all its details were swirling around him he rode the wave of clarity and grace everything was clicking stoddard clicked mackeys last word clicked stoddard was rebeccas teacher he was close to her he was her lover and the late night caller it all clicked into place mr x bosch stood up and left the room without a word he walked past stoddards office door it was open and the desk was empty he went out to the front counter mrs atkins where is mr stoddard he was just here but then he stepped out to where i dont know maybe the cafeteria i told him you and the other detective were here talking to kaitlyn and then he left yes oh i just realizedhe might be in the parking lot he said he got a new car today maybe hes showing it to one of the teachers what kind of car did he say a lexus he said it had a model number but i forget which one does he have an assigned parking space uh yes it is in the first row on the right as you come out of the entrance hall bosch turned from her and went out the door to the hallway it was crowded with students leaving the cafeteria to start afternoon classes bosch started moving through the crowd dodging students and picking up speed soon he was free of them and running he came into the parking lot and immediately trotted down the parking lane to the right he found an empty space with stoddards name painted on the curb he turned to go back in to get rider he was pulling his phone off his belt when he saw a silver blur to his right it was a car coming right at him and it was too late to get out of the way bosch was helped up into a sitting position on the asphalt harry are you all right he focused and saw that it was rider he nodded shakily he tried to remember what had just happened it was stoddard he said he was coming right at me in his car bosch laughed he had left that part out yeah his new car a silver lexus bosch started to get up rider put a hand on his shoulder to hold him down just wait a minute are you sure youre all right does anything hurt just my head it was coming back to him now i banged it when i landed he said i jumped out of the way i saw his eyes you know the rage i mean let me see your eyes he looked up at her and she held his chin while she checked his pupils you look all right she said okay then ill sit here for a second while you go back in and get stoddards home address from mrs atkins rider nodded all right you wait here hurry we have to find him she ran back into the school bosch reached up and felt the bump on the back of his head he replayed the clearing memory he had seen stoddards face behind the windshield it was angry contorted but then he had yanked the wheel to the left as bosch jumped the other way bosch reached for his phone so he could call in a wanted bulletin for stoddard it wasnt on his belt he looked around and saw the phone on the asphalt near the rear tire of a bmw he crawled over and grabbed it then stood up bosch was hit with mild vertigo and had to lean on the car suddenly an electronic voice said please step away from the car bosch pulled his hand away and started walking toward the part of the lot where he had parked his own car on the way he called central dispatch and put out the wanted bulletin for stoddard and his silver lexus bosch closed the phone and hooked it on his belt he got to his car started it and pulled up to the entrance so they would be ready to go as soon as rider came out with the address after what seemed like an interminable wait rider finally emerged and trotted to the car but she came to his side opened his door and waved him out its not far she announced its a house on chase off of winnetka but youre not driving i am bosch knew that arguing would waste time he got out and moved as quickly as his balance allowed around the front of the car and got in on the passenger side rider hit the gas and they moved out of the parking lot as rider made her way on surface streets toward stoddards home bosch called for backup from devonshire division patrol and then called abel pratt to quickly fill him in on the mornings revelations where do you think hes going pratt asked no idea were on the way to his house is he suicidal no idea pratt was silent for a moment as he digested this he then asked a few more questions about minor details and hung up he sounded happy bosch told rider says if we get this guy itll help turn a lemon into lemonade good rider replied we can pull prints from stoddards office or home and match them to the print from underneath the bed then its a done deal whether hes in the wind or not dont worry well get him harry what are you thinking stoddard and mackey did this together i dont know but i remember that photo of stoddard from the yearbook he looked pretty lean he might have been able to carry her up the hill by himself well never know unless we find him and ask him rider nodded the key question she then said is how stoddard connected with mackey the gun i know that thats obvious i mean how did he know mackey back then where is the intersection and how did he know him well enough to get the gun from him i think it was right there in front of us all along bosch said and mackey told me with his last word chatsworth chatsworth high how do you mean that summer he was getting his ged at chatsworth high on the night of the murder mackeys alibi was his tutor maybe it was the other way around maybe mackey was the tutors alibi stoddard he told us that first day that all of the teachers at hillside had outside jobs maybe stoddard was working as a tutor maybe he was mackeys tutor thats a lot of maybes harry thats why weve got to find stoddard before he does anything to himself you think hes suicidal you told abel you didnt know i dont know anything for sure but back in that parking lot he turned away from me at the last second it makes me think that he only wants to hurt one person himself maybe he just didnt want to dent his new car maybe rider turned onto winnetka a fourlane street and started moving faster they were almost to stoddards home bosch rode silently thinking about what might be waiting for them ahead rider finally turned west on chase and there was a blackandwhite patrol car with both of its front doors open in the street up ahead rider pulled to a quick stop behind it and they jumped out of the car bosch took his gun off his belt and carried it at his side rider had a point about stoddard maybe only thinking about his car when he avoided hitting bosch the front door of the small world war iiera house was open there was no sign of the patrol officers from the car bosch looked at rider and saw that she was unholstered as well they were ready to go in at the door bosch shouted detectives coming in he stepped into the threshold and got a response from inside its clear its clear bosch didnt relax or lower his weapon as he entered the living room he scanned the room and didnt see anyone he looked down at the coffee table and saw the daily news from the previous day unfolded the story on rebecca verloren on display patrol coming out a voice called from a hallway to the right soon two patrol officers stepped out of the hallway into the living room they carried their weapons at their sides now bosch relaxed and lowered his own all clear said the patrolman with the p stripes on his uniform we found the door open and came in theres something you ought to see back here in the bedroom the patrolmen led the way and bosch and rider followed they went down a short hallway that passed the open doors to a bathroom and a small bedroom that was used as a home office they entered a bedroom and the p pointed to an oblong wooden box that was open on the bed the box had a foam lining with a cutout in the shape of a longbarreled revolver the cutout was empty and the gun was gone there was a small rectangular cutout in the foam for a box of bullets it was empty too but the box was nearby on the bed is there someone hes going after the p asked bosch didnt look up from the gun box probably just himself he said either of you guys have gloves mine are in the car right here the p said he pulled a pair of latex gloves out of a small compartment on his equipment belt he handed them to bosch who snapped them on and then picked up the bullet box bosch opened it and slid out a plastic tray in which the bullets were stored there was only one bullet missing bosch was staring at the space left by the missing bullet and thinking about things when rider tapped him on the elbow he looked at her and then followed her gaze to the table on the other side of the bed there was a framed photo of rebecca verloren it was a shot of her standing in a green field with the eiffel tower behind her she was wearing a black beret and she was smiling in an unforced way bosch thought the look in her eyes was sincere and showed love for the person she was looking at he wasnt in any of the pictures in the yearbook because he was the one behind the camera bosch said rider nodded she too was in the water tunnel thats where it started she said thats where she fell in love with him my true love they stared in somber silence for a few moments until the p spoke detectives can we clear no bosch said we need you to stay here and secure the house until sid gets here and be ready in case he comes back youre leaving the p asked were leaving they moved quickly back to boschs car and rider once again got behind the wheel where to she said as she turned the ignition the verloren house bosch said and lets hurry what are you thinking ive been thinking about the picture they ran in the paper with muriel sitting on the bed it showed how the room was still the same you know rider thought for a moment and then nodded yeah rider understood the photo showed that rebeccas room was unchanged since the night she was taken seeing it might trigger something in stoddard a desire for something lost long ago the photo was like an oasis it was a reminder of a perfect place where nothing had gone wrong rider pinned the accelerator and the car lurched forward bosch opened his cell called dispatch and called for another backup unit to meet them at muriel verlorens house he also updated the bulletin on stoddard describing him now as armed and dangerous and possibly meaning mentally unstable he knew as he closed the phone that he and rider were close to the verloren home and would get there first his next call was to muriel verloren but there was no answer when the message service picked up he closed his phone no answer they turned the corner onto red mesa way five minutes later and boschs eyes immediately locked on the silver car parked at a haphazard angle against the curb in front of the verloren house it was the lexus that had come at him in the school parking lot rider stopped next to the car and once again they emerged quickly with weapons ready the front door of the house was ajar using hand signals they took stances on either side of it bosch then pushed the door open and went in first rider followed and they immediately moved into the living room muriel verloren was on the floor there was a cardboard box and other packing supplies next to her brown packing tape had been wrapped several times around her head and face as a gag and used to bind her hands and ankles rider propped her up against the couch and held a finger up to her lips muriel is he in the house she whispered muriel nodded her eyes wide and wild rebeccas room muriel nodded again have you heard a gunshot muriel shook her head no and emitted a muffled sound that would have been a scream if not for the tape across her mouth you have to be quiet rider whispered if i take off the tape you have to be very quiet muriel nodded intensely and rider started working on the tape bosch huddled in close im going up to the room wait harry rider ordered her voice louder than a whisper we go up together get her ankles bosch started working on the tape binding muriels feet together rider finally worked the tape loose from muriels mouth and pulled it down over her chin she shooshed her soothingly as she did this its beckys teacher muriel whispered her voice intense but not loud hes got a gun rider started working on her wrists okay she said were going to deal with it what is he doing muriel asked is he the one yes hes the one muriel verloren let out a long loud and anguished sigh her hands and feet were now loose and they helped her up to her feet were going up there rider told her we need you to get out of the house they started ushering her toward the entrance hallway i cant leave hes in her room i cant you have to leave muriel bosch whispered harshly its not safe here go to a neighbors house i dont know my neighbors muriel you have to get out rider said go down the street more police are on the way wave them down and tell them were inside already they pushed her through the open front door and then closed it behind her dont let him ruin her room they heard her plead from the other side its all i have left bosch and rider made their way to the back hallway and went up the stairway as quietly as they could they took positions on either side of the door to rebeccas bedroom bosch looked across at rider they both knew there was little time when backup units arrived the situation would change it was a classic suicidebypolice setup this was the one chance they might have of getting to stoddard before he or a swat cop put a bullet into his brain rider pointed to the doorknob and bosch reached out and tried to silently turn it he shook his head the door was locked they used hand signals to outline a plan nodded when they were ready and then bosch stepped back into the hallway and prepared to drive his heel into the door next to the knob he knew he had to do it with one kick they would lose the advantage of surprise after that whos out there it was stoddard his voice coming through the door bosch looked at rider so much for the element of surprise he pointed to her and gave her the silent sign he would do the talking mr stoddard its detective bosch how are you doing not too good yeah things have sort of gotten out of hand havent they stoddard didnt answer tell you what bosch said you really need to think about putting the gun down and coming out youre lucky im here i just came to check on mrs verloren but my partner and the swat team are going to be here soon you dont want to tangle with swat now is the time to come out i just want you to know i loved her thats all bosch hesitated before speaking he glanced over at rider and then back at the door he could go two ways with stoddard he could work on getting a confession right now or he could work on talking him out of the house and saving his life both things were possible but maybe not likely so what happened he asked there was a long silence before stoddard spoke what happened was she wanted to keep the baby and she didnt understand how that would ruin everything we had to get rid of it and then afterward she changed her mind about the baby about me about all of it bosch didnt respond after a few moments stoddard spoke again i loved her but you killed her i made mistakes like that night i dont want to talk about that night i want to remember all the times before that night i guess i dont blame you bosch looked at rider and held up three fingers they were going to go on a three count rider nodded she was ready bosch dropped one finger you know what i dont get mr stoddard he dropped the second finger what stoddard asked bosch dropped the third finger then raised his right leg and drove it into the door it was a hollowinterior door it gave way easily and swung open with a crash boschs momentum took him into the bedroom right behind it he raised his gun and turned toward the bed stoddard wasnt there bosch continued his turn catching a glimpse of stoddard in the mirror he was standing in the corner to the other side of the door he was raising the muzzle of a longbarreled revolver to his mouth bosch heard rider shout and her body came through the door at full speed as she threw herself into stoddard the crack of a gunshot shook the room as rider and stoddard went down to the floor the revolver fell from stoddards hand and clattered onto the floor bosch moved quickly to them and dropped his weight onto stoddard as rider rolled off him kiz you hit there was no answer bosch tried to look at her while keeping stoddard under control rider was holding one hand to the left side of her head kiz im not hit she yelled i think im just deaf in one ear stoddard tried to get up even with boschs weight on top of him please he said bosch used his forearm to knock one of stoddards arms out from supporting him stoddards chest hit the floor and bosch quickly pulled the arm back and cuffed it after a minor struggle he pulled the other arm back and completed the cuffing he then leaned down and spoke to stoddard please what please let me die bosch got up and pulled stoddard to his feet that would be too easy for you stoddard that would be like letting you get away all over again bosch looked over at rider who had gotten to her feet he could see that some of her hair had been singed by the guns discharge it had been that close you going to be okay as soon as the ringing stops bosch looked up and saw the bullet hole in the ceiling he could hear sirens coming he grabbed stoddard by the elbow and pulled him toward the bedrooms door im going to go down and put this guy in a car well book him at devonshire hold him there until the arraignment rider nodded but bosch could tell she was still dealing with what had just happened the ringing in her ear was a reminder of how close it had been bosch held stoddard by the arm as he walked him down the steps when they got to the living room stoddard spoke with a desperation in his voice you could do it now do what shoot me say i ran take one of the cuffs off and say i got loose you want to kill me dont you bosch stopped and looked at him yes id want to kill you but that would be too good for you you are going to have to pay for what you did to that girl and her family and just putting you down right here wouldnt even cover the interest on seventeen years bosch roughly pushed him toward the door they stepped out onto the front lawn just as a patrol car pulled to a stop and cut its siren bosch could tell by the streamlined light bar across the roof that it was one of the new cars he had heard about with stateoftheart equipment the department could afford only a few of them in each budget cycle the car gave bosch an idea he raised his hand and circled his finger in the air giving the allclear sign as he walked stoddard toward the car he saw muriel verloren walking down the middle of the street to her house she was staring at stoddard her mouth was wide open as if in a silent scream of horror she started running toward them bosch rode in the backseat of the patrol car with stoddard on the way to devonshire division rider was left behind at the verloren house to calm muriel and to be checked out herself by paramedics when they gave her the okay she would drive boschs car to the station the trip to the division would only take ten minutes bosch knew he had to quickly take a shot at getting stoddard talking the first thing he did was read the school principal his rights stoddard had made some admissions while holed up in rebecca verlorens bedroom but whether they could be used in court was open to question because they had not been recorded and he had not been forewarned about his rights which included remaining silent after reading the miranda warning off a business card he had borrowed earlier from rider bosch simply asked now do you want to talk to me stoddard was leaning forward because his hands were still cuffed behind his back his chin was almost down to his chest what is there to say he asked i dont know i mean i dont need you to talk weve got you actions and evidenceweve got all we need i just thought you might want to explain things thats all at a point like this a lot of people just want to explain themselves stoddard didnt respond at first the car was heading east on devonshire boulevard the station was a couple miles ahead earlier when he had conferred with the two patrolmen outside of the car bosch had told the driver to take it slow its funny stoddard finally said what is im a science teacher you know i mean before i was principal i taught science i was head of the science department uhhuh and i taught my students about dna i always told them that it was the secret of life decode dna and you decode life itself uhhuh and now now well its used to decode death by you people its the secret of life its the secret of death i dont know i guess its not really funny its more ironic in my case if you say so a guy who taught dna gets caught by dna stoddard started to laugh hey thats a good headline he said make sure you tell them that bosch reached over and used a key to unlock stoddards cuffs he then relocked his wrists in front of his body so that he could sit up back there at the house you said you loved her bosch said stoddard nodded i did i still do funny way of showing it wasnt it it wasnt planned nothing was planned that night i had been watching her thats all whenever i could i watched her i drove by all the time i followed her when she got to take the car i watched her at work too and all the time you had a gun no the gun was for me not her but you found out it was easier to kill her instead of yourself that night i saw the garage door was open i went in i wasnt sure why i thought i was going to use the gun on myself on her bed it would be my way of showing her my devotion but you went under the bed instead of on top of it i had to think where was mackey mackey i dont know where he was he wasnt with you he didnt help you he gave me the gun we made a deal the gun for the grade i was his teacher and his tutor it was my summer job but he wasnt with you that night you carried her up the hill by yourself stoddards eyes were open and staring into the distance even though their focus was only on the back of the front seat i was strong back then he said in a whisper the patrol car pulled through the opening in the concrete block wall that surrounded the back of devonshire division stoddard looked out the window seeing all of the patrol cars and the back of the station must have brought an awakening to him he realized his situation i dont want to talk anymore he said thats fine bosch said well put you in a holding room and get you a lawyer if you want the car stopped in front of a set of double doors and bosch got out he came around and got stoddard out and then walked him in through the doors the detective bureau was on the second floor they took an elevator and were met by the lieutenant in charge of devonshire detectives bosch had called him from the verloren house an interview room was waiting for stoddard bosch put him in a seat and cuffed one of his wrists to a metal ring bolted to the center of the table sit tight bosch said ill be back at the door he looked back at stoddard he decided to make one last play and for what its worth i think your story is bullshit he said stoddard looked at him surprise on his face what do you mean i loved her i didnt want you stalked her with one purpose to kill her she rejected you and you couldnt take it so you wanted her dead and now seventeen years later youre going to try to tell it different like its romeo and juliet or something youre a coward stoddard you stalked her and killed her and you should own up to it no youre wrong i had the gun for myself bosch came back into the room and leaned down on the table yeah what about the stun gun stoddard was that for yourself too you left that out of your story didnt you whyd you need a stun gun if you went in there to kill yourself stoddard was silent it was almost as if after seventeen years he had been able to erase the professional from his memory we got first degree and we got lying in wait bosch said youre going down for the whole ride stoddard you were never going to kill yourself back then or even today i think i want a lawyer now stoddard said yeah of course you do bosch left the room and walked down the hallway to an open door it was the monitoring room the lieutenant and one of the patrol officers from the ride in were in the small space there were two active video screens on one bosch saw stoddard sitting in the interview room the camera angle was from an upper corner of the room stoddard seemed to be staring blankly at the wall the image on the other screen was frozen it showed bosch and stoddard in the backseat of the patrol car hows the sound bosch asked beautiful the lieutenant said we got it all taking off the cuffs was a nice touch brought his face up into the camera the lieutenant hit a switch and the picture started moving bosch could hear stoddards voice clearly he nodded the patrol car had been equipped with a dashboard camera used for filming traffic stops and prisoner transports for the ride in with stoddard the cars interior microphone was turned on and the exterior was cut off it had worked perfectly stoddards admissions in the backseat would help seal the case bosch felt no worries from that direction at all he thanked the lieutenant and the patrolman and asked if he could borrow a desk to make some calls bosch called abel pratt to update him and to assure him that rider was shaken up but otherwise okay he told pratt that he needed to get sid teams to both stoddards and muriel verlorens homes to process crime scenes he said a search warrant should be applied for and approved before the sid team entered stoddards house he said that stoddard was about to be booked and his fingerprints taken the prints would need to be compared to those found on the slat from beneath rebecca verlorens bed he finished by telling pratt about the video taken during the ride to the station and the admissions stoddard had made its all solid and its on tape bosch said it all came after miranda good going harry pratt said i dont think well have anything to worry about on this not with the case at least meaning that stoddard was going to go down without a problem but bosch wasnt sure how he would fare in the review of his handling of the case its tough to argue with results pratt said well see bosch started getting a callwaiting signal on his phone he told pratt he had to go and clicked over to the new call it was mckenzie ward from the daily news my sister was listening to the scanner in the photo shop she said urgently she said a backup unit and an ambulance were sent to the verloren house she recognized the address thats right whats going on detective we had a deal remember yeah i remember and i was just about to call you the kitchen at the metro shelter was dark bosch went to the small lobby of the adjoining hotel and spoke to the man behind the glass window he asked for robert verlorens room number hes gone man something about the finality in his tone put a hollow into boschs chest it didnt sound like he meant verloren had gone out for the night what do you mean gone i mean gone he did his thing and hes gone thats it bosch took a step closer to the glass the man had a paperback novel open on the counter and had not looked up from its yellowed pages hey look at me the man flipped the book over to not lose his page and looked up bosch showed him his badge he then glanced down and saw the book was called ask the dust yes officer bosch looked back up at the mans tired eyes what do you mean he did his thing and what do you mean hes gone the man shrugged he came in drunk and thats the one rule we got around here no drinking no drunks he was fired the man nodded what about his room room came with the job like i said hes gone where the man shrugged one more time he pointed to the door that led to the sidewalk on fifth street he was telling bosch that verloren was out there somewhere it happens the man said bosch looked back at him when did he go yesterday it was you cops who did it to him you know what do you mean i heard some cop came in here told him some shit i dont know what it was about but that was right beforeknow what im saying he got off work and went out and took the taste again and that was that all i know is we need a new chef now cause the guy they got fillin in cant make eggs for shit bosch said nothing else to the man he stepped away from the window and went to the door outside the shelter the street was teeming with people the night people the damaged and displaced people hiding from others and hiding from themselves people running from the past from the things they did and the things they didnt do bosch knew the story was going to hit the news in the morning he had wanted to tell it to robert verloren himself bosch decided he would look for robert verloren out there he didnt know what the news he would bring would do for him he didnt know if it would bring verloren out or push him further into the hole maybe nothing could help him now but he needed to tell him anyway the world was full of people who could not get over things there was no closure and there was no peace the truth did not set you free but you could get through things thats what bosch would tell him you could head toward the light and climb and dig and fight your way out of the hole bosch pushed open the door and headed out into the night the police academy parade field was nestled like a green blanket against one of the wooded hills of elysian park it was a beautiful and shaded place and spoke well of the tradition the police chief had wanted bosch to be reminded of at am on the morning following his fruitless night search for robert verloren bosch presented himself at the graduation checkin table and was escorted to an assigned seat on the platform beneath the vip tent there were four rows of chairs in formation behind the lectern from which the speeches would be made boschs seat looked out across the parade grounds where the new cadets would march then form up and be inspected as an invited guest of the chief he would be one of the inspectors bosch was in full uniform it was tradition to fly the colors at the graduation of new officersto welcome them to the uniform in the uniform and he was early he sat by himself and listened to the police band play old standards as other vips were taken to their seats no one bothered him they were mostly politicians and dignitaries and a few purple heart winners from iraq who wore the uniform of the us marine corps boschs skin felt raw under his starched collar and tightly knotted tie he had spent almost an hour in the shower scrubbing away the ink hed had put to his skin hoping that it would take all the ugliness of the case down the drain with it he didnt notice the approach of deputy chief irvin irving until the cadet leading him to the tent said excuse me sir bosch looked up and saw that irving was being seated right next to him he straightened up and grabbed his program off the seat intended for irving enjoy yourself sir the cadet said before snapping into a turn and heading back for another vip irving didnt say anything at first he seemed to be spending a lot of time making himself comfortable and looking around to see who might be watching them they were in the first row two of the best seats in the place finally he spoke without turning or looking at bosch what is going on here bosch you tell me chief bosch took a turn looking around to see if anyone was watching them it obviously wasnt happenstance that they were sitting next to each other bosch did not believe in coincidences not like that the chief said he wanted me to be here he said he invited me on monday when he gave me back my badge good for you another five minutes went by before irving spoke again the tent was almost full except for the spot reserved for the chief of police and his wife at the end of the first row irving whispered now youve had a hell of a week detective you land in shit and come out stinking like a rose congratulations bosch nodded it was an accurate assessment what about you chief just another week at the office for you irving didnt respond bosch thought about the places he had looked for robert verloren the night before he thought about muriel verlorens face when she had seen her daughters killer being led to the patrol car bosch had had to hurry stoddard into the backseat to keep her away from him it was all because of you bosch said quietly irving glanced at him for the first time what are you talking about seventeen years thats what im talking about you had your man check the alibis on the eights he didnt know that gordon stoddard was also the girls teacher if it had been green and garcia running down the alibisas it should have beenthey would have come across stoddard and easily put the whole thing together seventeen years ago all of that time thats on you irving turned fully in his seat to face bosch we had an agreement detective you break it and i will find other ways of getting to you i hope thats understood yeah sure whatever you say chief but you forget one thing im not the only one who knows about you what are you going to do make your little deals with everybody every reporter every cop every mother and father who has had to live with a hollowedout life because of what you did keep your voice down irving said through his teeth bosch responded in a quiet calm voice ive said all i want to say to you well let me tell you something im not finished talking to you if i find he dropped the sentence as the chief of police was escorted by with his wife irving straightened himself in his seat as the music swelled and the show began twentyfour cadets with shining new badges on their uniformed chests marched into the parade grounds and took their positions in front of the vip tent there were too many preliminary speeches then the inspection of the new officers took too long but finally the program reached the main event the traditional remarks of the chief of police the man who had taken bosch back into the department was relaxed and poised at the lectern he spoke of rebuilding the police department from the inside out and starting with the twentyfour new officers standing before him he said he was talking about rebuilding both the image and the practice of the department he said many of the things he had said to bosch on monday morning he urged the new officers never to break the law to enforce the law to do their job constitutionally and compassionately at all times but then he surprised bosch with his wrapup i would also like to draw your attention to two officers here as my guests today one coming one going detective harry bosch has returned to the department this week after a few years of retirement i guess he learned during his extended vacation that you cant teach an old dog new tricks there was polite laughter from the crowd on the other side of the parade grounds this was where the families and friends of the cadets sat the chief continued so he came back to the lapd family and already he has performed admirably he has put himself in harms way for the good of the community yesterday he and his partner cleared a seventeenyearold murder that had been sticking like a thorn into the side of this community we welcome detective bosch back to the fold there was a smattering of applause from the crowd bosch felt his face go hot he looked down at his hands i would also like to thank deputy chief irvin s irving for being here today the chief continued chief irving has served in this department for nearly fortyfive years there is no current officer who has served longer his decision to retire today and make this graduation his final action while wearing the badge is a fitting end to his tour of duty we thank him for such service to this department and this city the applause for irving was much louder and sustained people started to stand in honor of the man who had served the department and city so long bosch turned slightly to his right so that he could see irving s face and he knew the moment he saw the deputy chiefs eyes that he had not seen it coming he had been sandbagged soon everyone was standing and clapping and bosch felt compelled to do the same for a man he despised he knew exactly who had engineered irving s fall if irving protested or tried in some way to recover his position he would face an internal case built by kizmin rider there would be no doubt who would lose that one no doubt at all what bosch didnt know was when it had been planned bosch thought about rider sitting on the desk in waiting for him with coffee black just like he liked it had she already known then what case the cold hit had come from and where it would lead he remembered the date on the doj report it was ten days old by the time he had read it what happened during those ten days what was planned for his arrival bosch didnt know and he was not sure he even cared department politics were played on the sixth floor bosch worked out of and thats where he would make his stand no question after the chief finished his remarks he stepped away from the microphone he gave each cadet one by one a certificate of completion of academy training and posed for a photo shaking hands with the recipient it was all very fast and clean and choreographed perfectly three police helicopters flew over the parade grounds in formation and the cadets ended the ceremony by hurling their hats into the air bosch remembered the time more than thirty years before when he had thrown his hat into the air he smiled at the memory no one from his class was left they were dead or retired or washed out he knew it was up to him to carry the banner and tradition to fight the good fight as the ceremony ended and the crowds rushed to the field to congratulate the new officers bosch watched irving stand up and start walking directly across the parade grounds to the exit area he stopped for no one not even those who extended hands of congratulations and thanks to him detective youve had a busy week bosch turned it was the chief of police he nodded he didnt know what to say thank you for being here the chief said how is detective rider she took the day off she had a close one yesterday so i heard will either of you be attending the press conference today well shes off and i was thinking of skipping it if thats all right well handle it i see you already gave the story to the daily news now everyone else is clamoring for it we have to put on the dogandpony show i owed the reporter from the news that one yes i understand when the dust settles will i still have a job chief of course detective bosch as in any investigation choices must be made tough choices you made the best decisions you could make there will be a review but i dont think you will have a problem bosch nodded he almost said thank you but decided against it he just looked at the man is there something else you wanted to ask me detective bosch nodded again i was just sort of wondering he said about what the case started with a letter from the doj and that letter was old by the time it got to me im wondering why it was held for me i guess what im saying is im wondering about what you knew and when you knew it does any of that matter now bosch poked his chin in the direction irving had taken maybe he said i dont know but he wont just walk away hell go to the media or to the lawyers he knows that if he does it will be a mistake that there will be consequences for him hes not a stupid man bosch just nodded the chief studied him a moment before speaking again you still seem troubled detective remember what i told you monday i told you i carefully reviewed your case and career before deciding whether to welcome you back bosch just looked at him i meant that the chief said i studied you and i think i know something about you you are on this earth for one thing detective bosch and you now have the opportunity to do that to continue to carry out your mission after that does anything else matter bosch held his eyes for a long time before answering i guess what i really wanted to ask is about what you said the other day when you said all of that about the ripples and the voices did you mean it or were you just winding me up to go after irving for you fire quickly spread across the police chiefs cheeks his eyes dropped from boschs as he composed his answer then he looked back up at bosch and it was his eyes that held boschs this time i meant every word of it and dont you forget it you go back to room five oh three and you close cases detective thats what you are here for close them out or ill find reason to close you out do you understand bosch didnt feel threatened he liked the chiefs answer it made him feel better he nodded i understand the chief raised his hand and took bosch by the upper arm good then lets go over here and get a picture taken with some of these young people who have joined our family today maybe they can learn something from us maybe we can learn something from them as they moved into the crowd bosch looked off in the direction irving had taken but he was long gone bosch looked for robert verloren for three of the next seven nights but didnt find him until it was too late one week after the academy graduation bosch and rider were sitting across from each other at their desks while putting the finishing touches on the case against gordon stoddard the accused murderer had been arraigned in san fernando municipal court earlier in the week and had pleaded not guilty now the legal dance had begun bosch and rider had to put together a comprehensive charging document that outlined the case against stoddard it would be given to the prosecutor and used in negotiations with stoddards defense attorney after meeting with muriel verloren as well as bosch and rider the prosecutor set a case strategy if stoddard elected to go to trial the state would seek the death penalty under the lyinginwait statute the alternative was for stoddard to avoid risking death and plead guilty to firstdegree murder in a plea agreement that would send him to prison for life without the possibility of parole either way the case summary bosch and rider were composing would be of key importance because it would show stoddard and his lawyer just how strong the evidence was it would force their hand make stoddard choose between the grim alternatives of life in a jail cell or gambling his life on the slim possibility of beating the case with a jury it had been a good week until that point rider bounced back from her near miss from stoddards bullet and showed full command of her skills in putting together the case summary bosch had spent all of monday going over the investigation with an internal affairs investigator and was cleared the next day the no action taken verdict from iad meant he was clear within the department even though the ongoing stories about the case in the media continued to call into question the departments actions in using roland mackey as bait bosch was ready to move on to the next investigation he had already told rider he wanted to check into the case of the lady he found tied up and drowned in her bathtub on his first day on the job they would take it up as soon as they put the paper case on stoddard to rest abel pratt came out of his office and stepped into their alcove he had an ashen look on his face he nodded toward riders computer screen is that stoddard youre working on he asked yes rider said whats up you can spike it hes dead nobody said anything for a long moment dead rider finally asked what do you mean dead dead in his cell in van nuys jail two puncture wounds to the neck he did it himself bosch asked i didnt think he had it in him no somebody did it for him bosch sat up straight wait a minute he said he was on the highpower floor and on keepaway status nobody couldve somebody did this morning pratt said and thats the bad part pratt raised a small notebook in his hand notes had been scribbled on it he read from it on monday night a man was arrested on van nuys boulevard on a drunk and disorderly he also assaulted one of the cops who hooked him up he was routinely fingerprinted and booked into van nuys jail he had no id and gave the name robert light the next day at arraignment he pleaded guilty to all charges and the judge gave him a week in van nuys jail the prints had still not been run through the computer bosch felt a deep tug in his gut he felt dread he knew where this was going pratt continued using his notes to construct the story the man who called himself robert light was assigned to kitchen duty at the jail because he claimed and also demonstrated that he had restaurant experience this morning he traded jobs with one of the others in the kitchen and was pushing the wagon that was carrying food trays to the custodies on high power according to two guards who witnessed it when stoddard went to the slide window on his cell door to accept the food tray robert light reached through the bars and grabbed him he then stabbed him repeatedly with a shiv made from a sharpened spoon he got two punctures into the neck before the guards subdued him but the guards were too late stoddards carotid artery was slashed and he bled out in his cell before they could get help to him pratt stopped there but bosch and rider asked no questions coincidentally pratt began again robert lights fingerprints were finally entered into the database at about the same time that he was killing stoddard the computer kicked out a bogiea custody who gave a false name the real name as i am sure you have already guessed was robert verloren bosch looked across at rider but couldnt hold her eyes for long he looked down at his desk he felt as though he had been punched he closed his eyes and rubbed his face with his hands he felt that it was in some way his fault robert verloren had been his responsibility in the investigation he should have found him hows that for closure pratt said bosch dropped his hands and stood up he looked at pratt where is he he asked verloren they still have him there van nuys homicide is handling it im going up there what are you going to do rider asked i dont know whatever i can he walked out of the alcove leaving rider and pratt behind out in the hallway he punched the elevator button and waited the heaviness in his chest wasnt going away he knew it was the feeling of guilt the feeling that he had not been ready for this case and that his mistakes had been so costly its not your fault harry he did what he had waited seventeen years to do bosch turned rider had come up behind him i should have found him first he didnt want to be found he had a plan the elevator door opened it was empty whatever youre doing rider said im going with you he nodded being with her would make it easier he motioned her into the elevator and then followed on the way down he felt a resolve rise inside him a resolve to carry on the mission a resolve never to forget robert and muriel
