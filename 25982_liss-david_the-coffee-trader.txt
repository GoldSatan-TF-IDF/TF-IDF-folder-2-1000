david liss the coffee trader it rippled thickly in the bowl dark and hot and uninviting miguel lienzo picked it up and pulled it so close he almost dipped his nose into the tarry liquid holding the vessel still for an instant he breathed in pulling the scent deep into his lungs the sharp odor of earth and rank leaves surprised him it was like something an apothecary might keep in a chipped porcelain jar what is this miguel asked working through his irritation by pushing at the cuticle of one thumb with the nail of the other she knew he had no time to waste so why had she brought him here for this nonsense one bitter remark after another bubbled up inside him but miguel let loose with none of them it wasnt that he was afraid of her but he often found himself going to great lengths to avoid her displeasure he looked over and saw that geertruid met his silent cuticle mutilation with a grin he knew that irresistible smile and what it meant she was mightily pleased with herself and when she looked that way it was hard for miguel not to be mightily pleased with her too its something extraordinary she told him gesturing toward his bowl drink it drink it miguel squinted into the blackness it looks like the devils piss which would certainly be extraordinary but ive no desire to know what it tastes like geertruid leaned toward him almost brushing up against his arm take a sip and then ill tell you everything this devils piss is going to make both our fortunes it had begun not an hour earlier when miguel felt someone take hold of his arm in the instant before he turned his head he ticked off the unpleasant possibilities rival or creditor an abandoned lover or her angry relative the danish fellow to whom hed sold those baltic grain futures with too enthusiastic a recommendation not so long ago the approach of a stranger had held promise merchants and schemers and women had all sought miguels company asking his advice craving his companionship bargaining for his guilders now he wished only to learn in what new shape disaster would unfold itself he never thought to stop walking he was part of the procession that formed each day when the bells of the nieuwe kerk struck two signaling the end of trading on the exchange hundreds of brokers poured out onto the dam the great plaza at amsterdam s center they spread out along the alleys and roads and canal sides along the warmoesstraat the fastest route to the most popular taverns shopkeepers stepped outside donning widebrimmed leather hats to guard against damp that rolled in from the zuiderzee they set out sacks of spices rolls of linen barrels of tobacco tailors and shoemakers and milliners waved men inside sellers of books and pens and exotic trinkets cried out their wares the warmoesstraat became a current of black hats and black suits speckled only with the white of collars sleeves and stockings or the flash of silver shoe buckles traders pushed past goods from the orient or the new world from places of which no one had heard a hundred years before excited like schoolboys set free of the classroom the traders talked of their business in a dozen different languages they laughed and shouted and pointed they grabbed at anything young and female that crossed their path they took out their purses and devoured the shopkeepers goods leaving only coins in their wake miguel lienzo neither laughed nor admired the commodities set out before him nor clutched at the soft parts of willing shop girls he walked silently head down against the light rain today was on the christian calendar the thirteenth day of may accounts on the exchange closed each month on the twentieth let a man make what maneuvers he liked none of it mattered until the twentieth when the credits and debits of the month were tallied and money at last changed hands today things had gone badly with a matter of brandy futures and miguel now had less than a week to pluck his fat from the fire or he would find himself another thousand guilders in debt another thousand he already owed three thousand once he had made double that in a year but six months ago the sugar market collapsed taking miguels fortune with it and thenwell one mistake after another he wanted to be like the dutch who regarded bankruptcy as no shame he tried to tell himself it did not matter it was only a little while longer until he undid the damage but believing that tale required an increasing effort how long he wondered until his wide and boyish face turned pinched how long until his eyes lost the eager sparkle of a merchant and took on the desperate hollow gaze of a gambler he vowed it would not happen to him he would not become one of those lost souls the ghosts who haunted the exchange living from one reckoning day to the next toiling to secure just enough profit to keep their accounts afloat for one more month when surely all would be made easy now with unknown fingers wrapped around his arm miguel turned and saw a neatly dressed dutchman of the middling ranks hardly more than twenty years of age he was a muscular wideshouldered fellow with blond hair and a face almost more pretty than handsome though his drooping mustache added a masculine flair hendrick no family name that anyone had ever heard geertruid damhuiss fellow greetings jew man he said still holding on to miguels arm i hope all goes well for you this afternoon things always go well with me he answered as he twisted his neck to see if any prattling troublemaker might lurk behind him the maamad the ruling council among the portuguese jews forbade congress between jews and inappropriate gentiles and while this designation could prove treacherously ambiguous no one could mistake hendrick in his yellow jerkin and red breeches for anything appropriate madam damhuis sent me to fetch you he said geertruid had played at this before she knew miguel could not risk being seen on so public a street as the warmoesstraat with a dutchwoman particularly a dutchwoman with whom he did business so she sent her man instead there was no less risk to miguels reputation but this way she could force his hand without even showing her face tell her i havent the time for so lovely a diversion he said not just now of course you do hendrick grinned widely what man can say no to madam damhuis not miguel at least not easily he had difficulty saying no to geertruid or to anyone elseincluding himselfwho proposed something amusing miguel had no stomach for doom disaster felt to him like an awkward and loose suit he had to force himself each day to play the cautious role of a man in the throes of ruin that he knew was his true curse the curse of all former conversos in portugal he had grown too used to falseness pretending to worship as a catholic pretending to despise jews and respect the inquisition he had thought nothing of being one thing while making the world believe he was another deception even selfdeception came far too easily thank your mistress but give her my regrets with reckoning day soon upon him and new debts to burden him he would have to curb his diversions at least for a while and there had been another note this morning a strange anonymous scrawl on a torn piece of paper i want my money it was one of a half dozen or so miguel had received in the last month i want my money wait your turn miguel would think glumly as he opened each of these letters but he was unnerved by the terse tone and uneven hand only a madman would send such a message without a namefor how could miguel respond even if he had the money and even if he were inclined to use what little he had for something so foolish as paying debts hendrick stared as though he couldnt understand miguels good if thickly accented dutch today is not the day miguel said a bit more forcefully he avoided speaking too adamantly to hendrick whom he had once seen slam a butchers head into the stones of the damplatz for selling geertruid rancid bacon hendrick gazed at miguel with the special pity men of the middle rank reserved for their superiors madam damhuis told me to inform you that today is the day she tells me that she will show you something and when you set your eyes on it you will forever after divide your life into the time before this afternoon and the time after the thought of her disrobing flashed before him that would be a lovely divide between the past and the future and would certainly be worth setting aside his business for the afternoon however geertruid loved to play at these games there was little chance she meant to take off as much as her cap but there was no getting rid of hendrick and urgent as his troubles might be miguel could make no deals with this dutchman lurking in his shadow it had happened before he would trail miguel from tavern to tavern from alley to canal side until miguel surrendered best to have this over with he decided so he sighed and said he would go with a sharp gesture of his neck hendrick led them off the ancient cobbled street and across the steep bridges toward the new part of the city ringed by the three great canalsthe herengracht the keizersgracht and the prinsengrachtand then toward the jordaan the most rapidly growing part of town where the air echoed with the ring of hammer on anvil and the chipping of chisel on stone hendrick led him along the waters of the rozengracht where barges pierced the thick canal mist as they headed toward the docks to unload their goods the new houses of the newly wealthy stood on either side of the murky water facing the oak and lindenlined waterway miguel had once rented the better part of so fine a house redbrick and steeplegabled but then brazilian production of sugar had far exceeded miguels expectations hed been gambling on low production for years but suddenly brazilian farmers unleashed an unexpected crop and in an instant prices collapsed a great man of the exchange as instantly became a debtor living off his brothers scraps once they departed from the main street the jordaan lost its charm the neighborhood was newwhere they stood had been farmland only thirty years beforebut already the alleyways had taken on the decrepit cast of a slum dirt replaced the cobblestones huts made of thatch and scraps of wood leaned against squat houses black with tar the alleys vibrated with the hollow clacking of looms as weavers spun from sunup until late into the night all in the hope of earning enough to keep their bellies full for one more day in moments of weakness miguel feared that poverty would claim him as it had claimed the wretched of the jordaan that he would fall into a well of debt so deep he would lose even the dream of recovering himself would he be the same man thenhimself yet pennilessor would he become as hollow as the beggars and luckless laborers he passed on the streets he assured himself it would not happen a true merchant never gives in to gloom a man who has lived as a secret jew always has one more trick to save his skin at least until he fell into the clutches of the inquisition he reminded himself and there was no inquisition in amsterdam just the maamad but what was he doing here with this inscrutable dutchman why had he allowed his will to collapse when he had business important business to pursue to what sort of place are you taking me miguel asked hoping to find a reason to excuse himself a miserable sort of place hendrick said miguel opened his mouth to voice an objection but it was too late they had arrived though he was not like the dutch inclined to believe in omens miguel would later recall that his venture had begun in a place called the golden calf surely an unpromising name they climbed down a steep and viciously lowceilinged stairwell to the cellar a little room that might comfortably have held thirty souls but now contained perhaps fifty the choking smoke of cheap west indian tobacco and musty peat stoves nearly suppressed the scent of spilled beer and wine old cheese and the odor of fifty unwashed menor rather forty men and ten whoreswhose mouths puffed out onions and beer at the bottom of the stairs an enormous man shaped remarkably liked a pear blocked their passage and sensing that someone wished to get by he moved his bulk backwards to prevent anyone from squeezing past he held a tankard in one hand and a pipe in the other and he shouted something incomprehensible to his companions move your monstrous bulk fellow hendrick said to him the man turned his head just enough to register his scowl and then looked away fellowhendrick tried againyou are the hard turd in the ass of my journey dont make me apply a purgative to flush you out go piss in your breeches he answered and then belched laughter in his friends faces fellow said hendrick turn around and see to whom you speak so rudely the man did turn around and as he saw hendrick the grin melted from his jowly threedaysunshaved face begging your pardon he said he pulled his cap down off his head and moved quickly out of the way knocking clumsily into his friends this newfound humility wasnt enough to satisfy hendrick who reached out like the lash of a whip and grabbed the mans filthy shirt the tankard and pipe fell to the floor tell me hendrick said should i crush your throat or not crush your throat not crush the drunk suggested eagerly his hands flapped like bird wings what do you say jew man hendrick asked miguel crush or not crush oh let him go miguel answered wearily hendrick released his grip the jew man says to let you go you remember that fellow next time you think to toss a dead fish or rotten cabbage at a jew a jew has saved your hide today and for no good reason too he turned to miguel this way a nod from hendrick was enough and the crowd gave way for them as the red sea parted for moses across the tavern miguel saw geertruid sitting at the bar pretty as a tulip in a dung heap when miguel stepped forward she turned to him and smiled wide and bright and irresistible he could not help but return the smile feeling like a fool boy which was how she regularly made him feel she had an illicit charm about her spending time with geertruid was like bedding a friends wife something he had never done for adultery is a most dreadful sin and no woman hed ever met had been tempting enough to lead him down that path or giving a virgin her first kiss which was something he had done but only once and that virgin later became his wife the air around geertruid always tingled with forbidden and elusive desire perhaps it was because miguel had never spent so much time with a woman to whom he was unrelated without bedding her madam im honored you wished to see me but im afraid i havent time for these diversions just now reckoning day approaches she said sympathetically she shook her head with a sadness that bordered somewhere between maternal and mocking it approaches and ive a great deal to put in order he thought to tell her more that things had gone badly and unless he could devise a remarkable scheme he would be another thousand in debt within a week but he didnt say that after six months of brutal relentless numbing indebtedness miguel had learned a thing or two about how to live as a debtor he had even considered writing a little tract on the matter the first rules were that a man must never act like a debtor and he must never announce his troubles to anyone who did not need to know them come sit next to me for a moment she said he thought to say no he preferred to stand but sitting next to her was much more delicious than standing nearby so he felt himself nodding before hed realized hed made a decision it was not that geertruid was more beautiful than other women though she certainly had some beauty about her at first glance she seemed nothing unusual a prosperous widow of her middle thirties regally tall still quite pretty particularly if a man gazed upon her from the proper distance or with enough beer in his belly but even though she was past her prime she yet retained more than her share of charms and had been blessed with one of those smooth and circular northern faces as creamy as holland butter miguel had seen youths twenty years her junior staring hungrily at geertruid hendrick appeared from behind miguel and removed the man sitting next to geertruid miguel moved in as hendrick led the fellow away i can only spare a few minutes he told her i think youll give me more time than that she leaned forward and kissed him just above the border of his fashionably short beard the first time she had kissed him they had been in a tavern and miguel who had never before had a woman for a friend let alone a dutchwoman thought himself obligated to take her to one of the back rooms and lift her skirts it would not have been the first time a dutchwoman had made her intentions known to miguel they liked his easy manner his quick smile his large black eyes miguel had a rounded face soft and youthful without being babyish dutchwomen sometimes asked if they could touch his beard it happened in taverns and musicos and on the streets in the less fashionable parts of town they claimed they wanted to feel his beard neatly trimmed and handsome as it was but miguel knew better they liked his face because it was soft like a childs and hard like a mans geertruid however never wanted anything more than to press her lips against his beard she had long since made it clear that she had no interest at all in having her skirts lifted at least not by miguel these dutchwomen kissed anyone they liked for any reason they liked and they did so more boldly than the jewish women of the portuguese nation dared to kiss their husbands you see she told him as she gestured to the crowd even though youve been in this city for years i still have new sights to show you i fear your stock of the new may be running thin at least you neednt worry about that hebrew council of yours seeing us in this place it was true enough jews and gentiles were permitted to conduct business in taverns but what jew among the portuguese would choose this foul pit still a man could never be overly cautious miguel took a quick look around for the telltale signs of maamad spies men who might be jews dressed as dutch laborers conspicuous fellows alone or in pairs eating none of the food beards which hardly anyone but jews wore cut close with scissors to resemble clean shaves the torah forbade only the use of razors on faces not the trimming of beards but beards were so out of fashion in amsterdam that even the hint of one marked a man as a jew geertruid slid her hand along miguels a gesture that came just short of the amorous she loved freedom with men above all else her husband whom she spoke of as the cruelest of villains had been dead some years now and shed not yet finished celebrating her liberty that sack of fat behind the bar is my cousin crispijn she said miguel glanced at the man pale corpulent heavyliddedno different from ten thousand others in the city thank you for letting me witness your bloated kinsman i hope i may at least ask him to bring me a tankard of his least foul beer to drown the stench no beer i have something else in mind today miguel did not try to suppress a smile something else in mind and is this where you have decided i might finally know your secret charms i have secrets aplentyyou may depend on itbut not such as youre thinking she waved over to her cousin who replied with a solemn nod and then disappeared into the kitchen i want you to taste a new drinka wondrous luxury miguel stared at her he might have been in any one of half a dozen other taverns now speaking of woolens or copper or the lumber trade he might be working hard to repair his ruined accounts finding some bargain that he alone could recognize or convincing some drunkard to sign his name to the brandy futures madam i thought you understood that my affairs are pressing i have no time for luxuries she leaned in closer and looked him full in his face and for an instant miguel believed she meant to kiss him not some sly buss on the cheek but a true kiss hungry and urgent he was mistaken i didnt bring you here idly and you will find that i offer you nothing ordinary she told him her lips close enough to his face that he could taste her fine breath and then her cousin crispijn brought out something that changed his life two earthen bowls sat steaming with a liquid blacker than the wines of cahors in the dim light miguel gripped the lightly chipped vessel with both hands and took his first taste it had a rich almost enchanting bitternesssomething miguel had never before experienced it bore a resemblance to chocolate which once he had tasted years ago perhaps he thought of chocolate only because the drinks were both hot and dark and served in thick clay bowls this one had a less voluptuous flavor sharper and more sparing miguel took another taste and set it down when he had sampled chocolate he had been intrigued enough to swallow two bowls of the stuff which so inflamed his spirits that even after visiting two satisfactory whores he had felt it necessary to visit his physician who restored his unbalanced humors with a sound combination of emetics and purges its made of coffee fruit geertruid told him folding her arms as though she had invented the mixture herself miguel had come across coffee once or twice but only as a commodity traded by east india merchants the business of the exchange did not require a man to know an items nature only its demandand sometimes in the heat of the trade not even that he reminded himself to say the blessing over wonders of nature some jews would turn away from their gentile friends when they blessed their food or drink but miguel took pleasure in the prayers he loved to utter them in public and in a land where he could not be prosecuted for speaking the holy tongue he wished he had more occasions to bless things saying the words filled him with giddy defiance he thought of each openly spoken hebrew word as a knife in the belly of some inquisitor somewhere its a new substanceentirely new geertruid explained when he was done you take it not to delight the senses but to awaken the intellect its advocates drink it at breakfast to regain their senses and they drink it at night to help them remain awake longer geertruids face became as somber as one of the calvinist preachers who railed from makeshift pulpits in town plazas this coffee isnt like wine or beer which we drink to make merry or because it quenches thirst or even because it is delightful this will only make you thirstier it will never make you merry and the taste let us be honest may be curious but never pleasing coffee is something something far more important miguel had known geertruid long enough to be acquainted with her many foolish habits she might laugh all night and drink as much as any dutchman alive she might neglect her affairs and tromp barefoot around the countryside like a girl but in matters of business she was as serious as any man a businesswoman such as she would have been an impossibility back in portugal but among the dutch her kind was if not precisely common hardly shocking this is what i think she said her voice hardly loud enough to rise above the din of the tavern beer and wine may make a man sleepy but coffee will make him awake and clearheaded beer and wine may make a man amorous but coffee will make him lose interest in the flesh the man who drinks coffee fruit cares only for his business she paused for another sip coffee is the drink of commerce how many times conducting business in taverns had miguels wits suffered with each tankard of beer how many times had he wished he had the concentration for another hours clarity with the weeks pricing sheets a sobering drink was just the thing for a trading man an eagerness had begun to wash over miguel and he found his foot tapping impatiently the sounds and sights of the tavern drifted away there was nothing but geertruid and coffee who now drinks it he asked i hardly know geertruid admitted ive heard there is a coffee tavern somewhere in the cityfrequented by turks they saybut ive never seen it i know of no dutchmen who take coffee unless it be prescribed by a physician but the word will spread already in england taverns that serve coffee instead of wine and beer have opened and men of trade flock to them to talk business these coffee taverns become like exchanges unto themselves it cant be too long before those taverns open here as well for what city loves commerce so well as amsterdam are you suggesting miguel asked that you want to open a tavern the taverns are nothing we must put ourselves in a position to supply them she took his hand the demand is coming and if we prepare ourselves for that demand we can make a great deal of money the coffees scent began to make him lightheaded with something like desire no not desire greed geertruid had stumbled upon something and miguel felt her infectious eagerness swelling in his chest it was like panic or jubilance or something else but he wanted to leap from his seat was this energy from the strength of her idea or the effect of the coffee if coffee fruit made a man unable to keep from fidgeting how could it be the drink of commerce still coffee was something marvelous and if he could dare to hope that no one else in amsterdam plotted to take advantage of this new drink it could be the very thing to save him from ruin for six dismal months miguel had at times felt himself in a waking dream his life had been replaced with a sad imitation with the bloodless life of a lesser man could coffee restore him to his rightful place he loved the money that came with success but he loved the power more he relished the respect he had commanded on the exchange and in the vlooyenburg the island neighborhood where the portuguese jews lived he loved hosting lavish dinners and never inquiring of the bill he took pleasure in giving to the charitable boards here was money for the poorlet them eat here was money for the refugeeslet them find homes here was money for the scholars in the holy land let them work to bring in the age of the messiah the world could be a holier place because miguel had money to give and he gave it that was miguel lienzo not this wretch at whose failings children and beefy housewives smirked he could not much longer endure the anxious stares of other traders who hurried away from him lest his ill fortune spread like plague or the pitying looks from his brothers pretty wife whose moist eyes suggested she saw kinship between her misery and his perhaps he had suffered enough and the holy one blessed be he had put this opportunity before him did he dare to believe that miguel wanted to agree to anything geertruid proposed but he had lost too many times in recent months for acting on foolish hunches it would be madness to forge ahead particularly when he would be plunging with a partner whose very existence would make him vulnerable to the maamad how is it that this magic potion has not swept through europe already he asked all things must begin somewhere must we wait she added in a conspiratorial voice until some other ambitious merchant learns its secret miguel pushed back from the counter and sat up straight tell me what you propose he waited with startling hunger for geertruids words she could not answer quickly enough and miguel wanted to reply before the words had even been uttered geertruid rubbed her long hands together i have determined to do some sort of business with coffee and i have some capital but i have no idea how to proceed you are a man of business and i need your helpand your partnership it was one thing to call this highspirited widow his friend when they were private together to drink and gamble with her to stand for her on the exchange and make small trades now and againdespite the maamadshaving forbidden jews to broker for gentiles on pain of excommunication it was another thing to take her as a partner in business some jews might emerge unscathed from so unusual an arrangement but miguel could not count on his luck not without money or influence to protect him once miguel had scoffed at the councils humorless censures but the maamad had begun to carry out more of its threats it sent its spies in pursuit of violators of the sabbath and eaters of unclean food it cast out those like the usurer alonzo alferonda who broke its arbitrary rules it hounded those like poor bento spinoza who uttered heresies so vague that almost no one even understood that his words were heretical more than that miguel had an enemy on the council who surely only waited for the flimsiest excuse to strike so many risks miguel bit his lip forcing back the urge to smirk he could live with the risks if he could promise himself not to think of them too often miguel began to tap the counter he wanted to act immediately he could begin at once to secure contacts and agents upon almost any important exchange in europe he could juggle coffee by the barrelful moving it from this port to that this was the true essence of miguel lienzo he made deals and connections and arrangements he was no coward to shrink from an opportunity because bitter and hypocritical men told him that they knew better than the sages what was right and wrong how shall we do this he said at last suddenly aware he had not spoken for several minutes the coffeefruit trade belongs to the east india company and we cant hope to take control away from men of their power i dont understand what youre proposing nor do i geertruid threw her hands into the air excitedly but i am proposing something we must do something i wont allow the fact that i do not know what i am proposing stand in my way as they say even the blind may stumble upon heaven you worry about the twentiethyou owe money i am offering you riches a great new venture with which to rebuild and make your current debt seem trivial ill need time to think about it he told her though he needed nothing of the kind a man does not get many such opportunities in his life and to ruin his chances out of impatience would be madness well discuss these things again after the twentieth in a week a week is a long time the widow said thoughtfully fortunes are made in a week empires rise and fall in a week i need a week miguel repeated softly a week then geertruid said in her amiable way she knew not to push further miguel realized he had been fidgeting with the buttons of his coat and now i must leave and tend to my more immediate concerns before you go let me give you something to help you consider the enterprise geertruid signaled to crispijn who hurried over and set down before her a rough woolen sack he owes me some money she explained once her cousin had walked away i agreed to take a little of this as payment and i wanted to give you something to think about miguel looked in the bag which contained perhaps a dozen handfuls of brownish berries coffee geertruid said ive had crispijn cook the berries for you because i know a portuguese hidalgo cannot be expected to roast his own fruit you merely need grind them to a powder which you mix with hot milk or sweet water then filter out the powder if you like or just let it settle dont drink too much of the powder itself lest you agitate your bowels you did not mention bowel agitation when you sang its praises even natures greatest glories can harm if taken in the wrong dose i wouldnt have said anything but a man with uneasy bowels makes a poor business partner miguel let her kiss him again and then he squeezed through the tavern and stepped out into the misty cool of the late afternoon after the stench of the golden calf the salty air off the ij felt as wonderfully cleansing as the mikvah and he let the mist fall on his face for a moment until a boy not six years old began to pull on his sleeve and weep piteously about his mother miguel tossed the boy a half stuiver already relishing the wealth coffee would bring freedom from debt his own home a chance to marry once more children in an instant he chastised himself for indulging in these fancies in light of the days setbacks another thousand guilders in debt he owed three thousand already throughout the vlooyenburg including fifteen hundred to his brother borrowed after the sugar market collapsed hed allowed the bankruptcy office at the town hall to settle his debts to christians but the jews of his neighborhood ordered their own accounts high tide had begun to move in and the waters had crept up beyond the rozengracht to slick the streets across town in his brothers house the cavernous cellar where miguel now slept at night would soon begin its own flooding that was the price of living in a city built in the water upon piles but miguel now thought nothing of the discomforts of amsterdam that had troubled him when he had first arrived he hardly noticed the deadfish stench of canal water or the squish of walking on wet ground dead fish was the perfume of amsterdam s riches the squish of water its melody the prudent thing would be to go home at once and write a note to geertruid explaining that the risks of working with her were too great and might well lead to his ruin but he would never free himself from debt with prudence and ruin was already upon him only a few months ago his sugar had crammed canalside warehouses he had strutted across the vlooyenburg like a burgher he had been ready to set the loss of katarina behind him to take a new wife and have sons and the marriage brokers had clawed at one another to gain access to him but now he was in debt his standing had collapsed to worse than nothing he received threatening notes from a man who must be mad how could he turn his fortune if not by doing something daring he had taken risks all his life was he to stop because he feared the arbitrary power of the maamad those men who entrusted to uphold the law of moses valued their power above gods word the law had nothing to say about dutch widows why should miguel avoid making his fortune with one he might have tried to conduct a little more business that day but he suspected his agitation would lead to nothing productive so instead he went to the talmud torah synagogue for afternoon and evening prayers the nowfamiliar liturgy soothed him like spiced wine and by the time he left he felt renewed as he walked the short distance from the synagogue to his brothers house keeping close to canalside houses to elude both thieves and the night watch miguel listened to the click of rat claws on the wooden planks stretched over the sewers coffee he chanted to himself he hardly needed a week to give geertruid his answer he only needed time to convince himself that any scheme he embarked on with her would not complete his ruin from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda my name is alonzo rodrigo tomas de la alferonda and i brought the drink called coffee to the europeansgave birth to its usage there one might say well perhaps i phrase that too strongly for coffee surely would have made its murky way without my efforts let us say instead that i was the manmidwife who eased its passage from obscurity into glory no you will say that was not me either it was miguel lienzo who did that what role then could alonzo alferonda have played in the triumph of this great fruit more than is generally believed i assure you and for those who say i made nothing but mischief that i thwarted and hindered and harmed rather than advanced i can only say i know more than my detractors i was thereand you in all likelihood were not my true name is avraham as was my fathers name and his fathers all firstborn alferonda men have secretly called their firstborn sons avraham for as long as jews have had secret names and before that when the moors ruled iberia they called themselves avraham openly for much of my life i was not permitted to speak my name aloud except in dark rooms and then only in whispers those who would question my actions should remember that who would you be today i ask you who judge me harshly if your own name was a secret whose revelation could cost your life and the lives of your friends and family i was born in the portuguese city of lisbon to a family of jews who were not allowed to pray as jews we were called new christians or conversos for our ancestors had been made to take the catholic faith or surrender their propertyand often their lives lest we face torture and ruin and perhaps even death we prayed publicly as catholics but in shadows and in cellars in secret synagogues that moved from house to house we prayed as jews prayer books were rare and precious to us in the light of day a man might measure his wealth in gold but in the dark of those dark rooms we measured wealth in pages and in knowledge few among our number could read the hebrew of what few books we had few knew the right prayers for the holy days or for shabbat my father knew or at least he knew some having spent the first part of his childhood in the east he had grown up among jews unrestrained by the law from practicing their religion he had prayer books that he lent out freely he owned a few volumes of the babylonian talmud but he knew no aramaic and could make little sense of its pages the secret jews in lisbon came to him for instruction in the rudiments of reading the holy tongue of the prayers for shabbat of fasting on fast days and feasting on feast days he taught them to eat outofdoors during succoth and of course he taught them to drink themselves to a merry stupor on purim let me be direct my father was no holy man or sage or saint far from it i admit this freely and think it no insult to his name my father was a trickster and a cheat in his hands trickery and cheating were beautiful and marvelous things because he was schooled in the ways of our faithno scholar mind you but simply a man with an educationmy father was tolerated among the secret jews of lisbon in ways he might not have been otherwise for he brought far more attention upon himself than was wise for any new christian wherever merchants with a few spare coins might find themselves my father would be there with his potions to lengthen life improve virility or cure any malady he knew tricks with cards and balls and dice he could juggle and ropedance and tumble he knew how to train dogs to add and subtract simple numbers and how to train cats to dance on their hind legs a natural leader of men my father attracted to him others who made their living through countless deceptive and curious entertainments he commanded an army of cardsharps and dice cheats fireeaters and blade swallowers those who could earn a living simply by displaying the shapes with which nature had burdened them also rallied to my fathers banner among my earliest childhood companions were dwarfs and giants the monstrously fat and the horrifically gaunt i played games with the snake boy and the goat girl as i grew older i developed an unhealthy curiosity about a person my father knew who had the anatomy of both a man and a woman for a few coins this unfortunate would allow anyone to watch it fornicate with itself when i was but ten years of age my father received a latenight visit from an older boy miguel lienzo whom i recognized from synagogue worship he was a roguish fellow as much drawn to my fathers company of tricksters and oddities as he was to my fathers learning i say he was roguish for he loved always to defy one authority or another and in the time i knew him in lisbon those authorities he loved defying most were his own family and the inquisition itself this lienzo came from a line of relatively sincere new christians there was no shortage of these men who out of either genuine belief or merely a desire to avoid persecution conformed entirely to the christian way and shunned those of us who sought to live as jews lienzos father was a successful trader and had in his opinion too much to risk the ire of the inquisition perhaps for this reason alone miguel came eagerly to our secret prayer meetings and struggled to learn what my father could teach him more than that young miguel used his fathers connections with the old christian community to learn what he could of the inquisition he had a keen ear for rumor and he delighted in providing warnings where he could i knew of a half dozen families who had fled the night before the inquisitors pounded on their doorsall because lienzo had known where to lurk and listen i believe he did these great deeds both from a desire to see justice done in the world and for the pleasure of treading where he had no business years later when i saw him again in amsterdam he never recognized me or even remembered what he had done for my family i have never forgotten his kindness though some have insisted otherwise miguel came to warn us after he had volunteered to help our priest scrub his private chambers in the church he always volunteered for these thankless tasks in the hopes of gaining some intelligence and had then chanced to hear a conversation between that wretch and an inquisitor who had developed an interest in my father and so in the dark of night we left the only home i had known taking many of our friends with us we were jew and christian and moor and gypsy all and we traveled to more cities than i can now enumerate for years we lived in the east and i was fortunate to spend many months in the holy city of jerusalem it is but a shadow of its former glory but there were times in my unfortunate life when the memory of those days of walking the streets of my nations ancient capital visiting the place where the holy temple once stood have sustained me when i could find meaning in nothing else if it be the will of the holy one blessed be he i shall return sometime to that sacred place and live out my remaining days there in our travels we also traversed europe and we were in london when my father died of a brain fever i was then fiveandtwenty grown to a man but not a man of my fathers disposition my younger brother mateo wanted to take command of the army of outcasts and i knew he had the character to lead them though i had wandered for years i was not myself a wanderer i could perform card cheats and dice tricks but not half so well as mateo i could get a dog to do nothing but show me its belly and a cat to do nothing but knead upon my lap my father had always spoken of the importance of jews to live as jews and among jews and i recalled from a visit to amsterdam some years earlier that in that city jews enjoyed a degree of freedom unrivaled in the rest of christendom so i crossed the north sea and found myself embraced by the large community of portuguese jews who lived there i was at any rate embraced at first and that is why i write this memoir i wish to make clear why i was unjustly exiled from a people i loved i wish to tell the world that i am not the villain it thinks me and i wish to set on paper the true facts regarding miguel lienzo and his dealings in the coffee trade having been much blamed in that sphere and blamed very unfairly too it is my intention to describe my doings in amsterdam the conditions of my excommunication my life in that city afterward and precisely what role i played in lienzos affairs it is true that before i knew how to walk i could hide a card in my clothes and make the dice roll the way i wished but i vow to practice no trickery in these pages i will be like the bear man a petulant fellow with whom i traveled for years i will disrobe to show you natures truth if you like reader you may even pull on the fur to see that it is no deception geertruid could never understand the difficulty miguel faced in doing business with her she might smile sympathetically when he spoke of his fears but in the end she almost certainly believed his resistance was some willful hebrew eccentricity like not eating squid or refusing to talk business on saturday day but being happy to talk on saturday night miguel hated that she should think him foolish or stubborn when he would violate some small law or otherdrink impure wine or labor just a little on the sabbathshe would ask how he could do these things and still purport to care so much for his observance he did not know how to explain that no one but a tsadika saintcould hope to obey all the laws it was the effort that brought a man closer to the holy one blessed be he though he had told her about his past geertruid still had no understanding of what it had been like to live as a secret jew in lisbon with only a vague notion of who he truly was if it was so truly terrible she would ask why do any of you jews remain why indeed because it was where they had always lived for hundreds of years because their families were there their businesses some stayed because they had no money others because they had too much the stories of freedom to worship in amsterdam or in the east sounded as elusive as the coming of the messiah many new christians embraced catholicism with a slavish fervor and miguels father had been such a man not that he believed deeply but he believed deeply in convincing the world of his sincerity with his regular church attendance his public denouncement of jewish superstition his donations to the church new christians sincere or not lived in a single community and miguels father wanted his sons to stay away from the backsliders my grandparents chose to convert rather than be exiled he had explained and ill not dishonor their choice perhaps for the pleasure of defying his father perhaps because it was dangerous miguel had begun secretly attending study groups when he was still a boy the older men there encouraged him made him feel special with their praise and let him know without words that they too thought his father a great boor miguel had loved the feeling of being included in something larger than himself and of doing something wicked that was at the same time righteous miguels younger brother daniel understood this division between father and son and exploited it showing his father every day in a dozen ways that he was not one of those horrible backsliders who brought nothing but woe to their community their father was inclined to favor daniel at any rate since he looked far more like his side of the family miguel bore a striking resemblance to his mothers father daniel had always been thin like the elder lienzo all hard angles and sharp corners eyes too large for his face hands too small for his body miguel took after his mothers sidemeaty men who commanded attention just the sort of man the elder lienzo had always despised when his father discovered that miguel had been attending the secret synagogues he called him a traitor and a fool he locked miguel in a room for a week with nothing but wine some dried figs two loaves of bread and a chamber pot far too small for so long a duration later miguel would find this choice of punishment horribly ironic for it was his father the inquisition had taken and locked in a prison and torturedaccidentally they claimedto death he had been named by another converso who under the inquisitors knife had shouted any names he could recall whether they be christian jew or mohammedan miguel had been three years gone by then after a rupture with his father over his marrying a woman with an insufficient dowry miguels father had absolutely forbidden the marriage not only had katarina too little money but her family consisted of wellknown judaizers who would bring down trouble on the rest of them and he insisted she was far too pretty i dont like to see you with so beautiful a girl hed said to miguel its unseemly for you to marry a betterlooking woman than your father did it makes you appear undutiful miguel was not so easily swayed by dowries and he thought it perfectly seemly to marry someone pretty but more than beauty katarina had possessed great understanding her family was devout and she had an uncle who was a great talmudist in damascus she understood hebrew better than most men in lisbon she knew the liturgy and could keep a home in accordance with the holy writings miguels father had spat on the floor when miguel announced that they had secretly married youll regret defying me hed said and youll regret marrying a woman who knows how to read i wont say another word to you until you come to me and beg my forgiveness four months later when katarina had died of a sudden fever they spoke for the last time thank christ thats over with his father had said to miguel at the conclusion of the funeral now we can get you married to someone who will do our family some good two weeks later miguel boarded a ship bound for the united provinces while miguel established himself in amsterdam his father and brother continued to export wine and figs and salt but then the inquisition arrested the elder lienzo and everything came to an end by portuguese law the church could confiscate the material goods of anyone convicted by the inquisition so wealthy merchants made particularly popular victims after suddenly expiring during a questioning session miguels father was found guilty posthumously and the family business ceased to exist left with only a few items in his own name daniel had no choice but to leave lisbon following his brother and the mass exodus of conversos to amsterdam had seemed the inevitable choice the maamad had welcomed miguel when he came to amsterdam its teachers helped him expand his understanding of the holy tongue taught him the liturgy and explained the holy days though still disoriented with grief for katarina those first few weeks had been full of excitement and learning and though his circumcision was an event best not recollected too often even that bloody affair had been moving however it was not long before he discovered that the councils aid did not come without its price the parnassim the men who composed the maamad ruled absolutely and those who would live in the community lived by their law or were cast out two evenings after his meeting with geertruid miguel had attended a study meeting at the talmud torah here was where the maamadshone study groups met constantly in the synagogues cloistered chambers jews recently escaped from iberia and the inquisition who knew nothing of their faith but that it was in their blood learned how to conduct themselves to pray to live as jews in the next chamber wise men the chachamim argued details from the talmud that miguel did not believe he would ever begin to comprehend he met with a group of men not unlike himselfreturned within the past few years but dedicated to embracing the ways of their fathers they read in hebrew the weekly torah portion and worked through its meaning while a chacham who served as their guide discussed the talmud commentary miguel loved these meetings he looked forward to them all week he had not the luxury to study quite so much torah at home as he would have likedthough he did try to go to the early morning study sessions at least once or twice a weekand what time he did have he did not always use wisely these meetings were therefore doubly precious for the space of a few short hours he was able to forget that reckoning day crept cruelly toward him and the brandy futures hed bought so impulsively would make his debts even more hopeless in the halls of the talmud torah just after his meeting miguel paused with his friend isaiah nunes to continue debate on the interpretation of a particularly thorny bit of hebrew grammar nunes traded mostly along the levant routes but had recently begun to expand into portuguese wine having sampled too many of a buyers wares before the meeting started he now argued loudly his voice echoed off the high ceilings of the nearly empty synagogue as they made their way toward the exit nunes was a large man bulky without exactly being fat not yet thirty years old he had already managed to establish himself as a man to be reckoned with in the levant routes miguel liked the young trader but there were limits to how much an indebted widower his age could like someone so young and successful almost by accident nunes stumbled on lucrative deals he invested cautiously but with obscene success he had a beautiful and obedient wife who had given him two sons however these accomplishments were tempered by nuness inability to take pleasure in anything hed done growing up hed witnessed one relative after another taken by the inquisition and hed become nervous by disposition he regarded his success as a mere illusion a trick of the devil aimed only to raise nuness expectations before dashing them the two made their way out in the darkness for only a few candles burned in the common areas nunes had been in the midst of a long harangue half of which was pure nonsense as he reasoned backtracked apologized for making little sense and then demanded that miguel agree with him then he stopped short and bent over by christ ive just broken a toe he shouted like most jews from portugal he cursed like a catholic miguel help me along miguel bent to help his friend you drunkard on what did you break a toe on nothing nunes whispered its a ruse dont you know a ruse when you see one not if its a good ruse ill take that as a compliment i suppose now that we have established that you have only pretended to break your toe in order to fool me miguel said quietly perhaps you might tell me why you would do such a thing by the virgin nunes cried out it hurts help me miguel in the dim light of sparse candles miguel could see nunes close his eyes in a moment of concentration theres a man lurking in the shadows by the door he added more quietly hes been watching you miguel felt himself tense a man lurking in the shadows awaiting him could never be good news more than once hed been spirited away to some dank tavern cellar by an angry creditor who kept him there as prisoner until he could send for the money he owed orand this was more likely to happenhe could talk his way out of imprisonment then another thought crossed his mind those strange notes he had been receiving i want my money he felt his skin prickle did you see who it is he asked nunes i caught a quick glimpse and unless i miss my guess it is solomon parido miguel stole a look toward the exit and saw a figure step toward the dark christs tabernacle what does he want the parnass had been his enemy since an unfortunate incident two years earlier which had ended with his withdrawing his offer to wed his daughter to miguel nothing good you can depend on that a parnass lying in wait is always bad news and parido is worse news than most and parido lying in wait for miguel lienzowell it is hard to think of a more dire situation to be honest i hate for him to see us together i have troubles enough without a parnass looking into my affairs too deeply you have no troubles at all miguel said darkly i should lend you some of mine your brother does business with him doesnt he why dont you have him ask parido to leave you alone i think my brother encourages him frankly miguel said bitterly it was bad enough that he was dependent upon his younger brother but daniels friendship with the parnass particularly unnerved him he could never quite shake the feeling that daniel reported everything miguel said or did lets go back inside nunes suggested well wait for him to pass i wont give him that satisfaction ill have to take my chances but i dont think your performance has fooled anyone we should break your toe in earnest if he wants to examine your foot youll be found guilty of having lied in the synagogue ive put myself at risk for your sake you ought to show some gratitude youre right should he inspect your toe and find it whole well tell him that a great miracle happened here they hobbled out to the courtyard and though he meant to restrain himself miguel couldnt help but look to the corner where he had seen parido lurking but the parnass was already gone parido lying in wait for you is bad enough nunes observed but spying on you and disappearing into the shadowsthat is something altogether more terrible than i had thought miguel had fears enough without having his friend fan the flames soon you will tell me that a quarter moon makes things worse a quarter moon is a bad omen nunes agreed miguel let out a raspy noise half chortle half cough what did the parnass want from him he could think of no religious laws hed openly violated in the recent past although he might have been seen on the street with hendrick still inappropriate contact with gentiles hardly warranted this kind of surveillance parido had something else in mind and while miguel could not think what it might be he knew it was nothing good from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda my relocation to amsterdam proved at first to be all i could have hoped for after wallowing too many years in the squalid mud of london that putrid capital of a putrid island amsterdam seemed to me the cleanest and most beautiful of places england had become a disorderly nation with its revolutions and regicide while living there i had the chance to meet a man called menasseh ben israel who came from amsterdam to convince england s warriorpriest king cromwell to allow english jews to make a home there menasseh painted a picture of amsterdam that made it sound like the garden of eden with redbrick houses in my early days there i was inclined to agree the local maamad the ruling council of jews warmly embraced newcomers it arranged for kind strangers to take us in until we could find a place of our own it at once assessed our understanding of the customs and holy laws of our race and began training us in those areas in which we showed ignorance the talmud torah the great synagogue of the portuguese jews offered the opportunity for study at all levels of understanding i arrived in amsterdam with a few coins in my purse and could afford to establish myself in business though i did not yet know what business i would make my own however i soon discovered something to my liking on the exchange a new form of commerce had emerged that of buying and selling what no one owned and indeed what no one ever intended to own it was a gambling sort of trade called futures in which a man wagered on whether the price of a commodity would rise or fall if the trader guessed correctly he would earn far more money than if he had bought or sold outright if he guessed incorrectly the cost could be formidable for he would not only lose the money he had invested he would owe for the difference between what he had bought and the final price i saw at once that this was no trade for the timid or even for the merely brave this was a trade for the lucky and i had spent my life learning how to manufacture my own luck i was not alone in doing so throughout the exchange were groups called trading combinations and they would manipulate markets as best they could a combination might circulate a rumor that it intended to buy let us say british woolens the exchange hearing that a large group of men planned to buy would respond and the price would rise accordingly all along however the combination intended to sell and once the woolens reached a rewarding price the combination would react accordingly these organizations my astute reader will see engage in a tricky business because these men will have to do as they pretend most of the time otherwise rumors surrounding their movements will never be believed i soon found myself something of a purveyor of rumors i would make commodities do pretty little dances as i saw fit and i had a knack for disguising my footprints as i did so check the dice if you wish dear sir you will see that they are but ordinary a word dropped here a rumor spread there not by me of course but done all the same this commodity bet on this one bet against it all proved a handy little trade shortly after my arrival in the city i found myself passing idle hours in a little gambling establishment owned by a fellow called juarez gambling was strictly forbidden by the maamad but many forbidden things were in truth tolerated so long as they were done quietly juarez ran a tasteful little tavern that catered to portuguese jews it offered food and drink that conformed with our holy laws and he permitted no whores to ply their trade so the parnassim chose not to bother him i played cards there with among other men a merchant some ten years my senior named solomon parido he disliked me and i disliked him why should that be i cannot say for certain there was no initial slight that began it no wrong left to be revenged it is sometimes so simple as two men having natures that cannot stand to be near each other like magnets that push each other away i found him too sour he found me too ebullient though our work and worship often threw us together neither was ever happy to see the other we might be in the same room and for no reason he would scowl at me and i would smile saucily in return he might make some reference to cheats meaning to needle me for my background i would return a reference to idiots knowing that his only son had been born deficient of mind perhaps you will say alferonda you are cruel to mock a man for his misfortune and surely you would be right to say so it is cruel but parido brought forth the cruelty in me perhaps had he been kinder i would have looked upon him compassionately i might then have seen his wealthhis massive house full of rugs and paintings and gold trinkets his indulgent coachandfour his maneuvers on the exchange that succeeded simply because of the sheer volume of capital propping them upas some small compensation for his domestic sadness i might have looked at his expensive clothes as a mask behind which he could hide his melancholy i might have viewed his lavish banquetsindulgent affairs with dozens of guests barrels of wine wheels of cheese herds of roast cattlewith new eyes for i would have been a guest at those banquets and seen what satisfaction he took in playing host but i never received the handsomely inscribed invitations to paridos house my friends did i can assure you and i listened to the tales of their delight but parido could find no place for alferonda in his magnificent house why then should alferonda make room in his equally magnificent heart one night fate placed the two of us together at a game of cards id had more wine than a gambling man ought and seeing parido showing a pleasant face to every man at the table but me i was unable to resist the urge to cheat him if just a little if a man cheats at cards to win for himself he is bound to raise the suspicions of all but if he cheats at cards for no reason other than to make another man lose he is likely to find more allies than enemies the more parido regarded me with disdain the more i saw to it that the cards did not turn the way he wished the suit or the number he longed for would find its way to another mans hand or if i was desperate in my sleeve moments when he thought all would go his way burst like flimsy bubbles more than once he cast a suspicious look in my direction but i had only modest winnings to show for myself how could i be responsible i suppose this might have come to nothing if it had ended there he lost a few guilders that night but nothing of consequence a man like parido knows never to bring more to the table than he is prepared to lose as the price of an evenings entertainment a few months later however matters took another turn i knew parido and his trading combination planned a maneuver with setúbal salt the price had been depressed for some time so exports had been reduced they were therefore due to rise and paridos men wanted to effect that rise themselves rather than be taken by surprise i caught wind of this from a tavern keeperone of the many i paid for such informationand saw an opportunity to profit for myself i want to be clear that i never engaged in any action simply for the purpose of stinging parido i did not much like him nor he me but that mattered for little when it came to trade i did what i did to earn a profit it was nothing more than that paridos combination began to spread the tale that the latest shipments of setúbal salt were selling for a much higher price than had been anticipated by doing so they hoped to spark a buying frenzy upon the exchange of those wishing to secure the current low price thus they intended to profit from the salt they had themselves acquired and from their puts wagers that the price would rise when they began to sell their salt at the new price i and my agents sold as well flooding the market in order to capitalize on the price differential my method enabled me to exploit their scheme for some fair gains it also had the unavoidable side effect of making their trade unprofitable and their puts ended up costing them a slightly more than insignificant amount but that is the price they had to pay for their trickery i was always certain to hide myself behind strange and unknown brokers when i attempted these sorts of maneuvers but parido prided himself on being mightily well connected and he found me out the next day he came up behind me on the exchange youve crossed the wrong man alferonda he said i said i knew nothing of his complaint my father had always told me to deny everything your lies dont impress me youve profited from ruining my scheme and costing me money and ill see to it that you get what such a low trickster deserves i laughed off these threats as i had laughed off others indeed as the months and even years passed i forgot his words he didnt much like me he spoke ill of me when he could but never that i knew did he act against me in matters of consequence it could have been i realized that he acted against me in any of a number of trades that went bad but that might have been fate and i tended to believe that he would not have been shy about taking credit for any harm he might send my way but then he was elected to the maamad as both a wealthy merchant and a parnass he possessed as much power as was possible for a man in our community i had no reason to celebrate his election but i had no reason to suspect that he would use his new position to attack me so ruthlessly down in the kitchen hannah nearly severed her thumb as she chopped asparagus shed not been paying attention and the knife which had grown dull under months of the maids inattention slipped easily from her grasp and dug into her flesh with amputating force but the same dullness that made the blade dangerous rendered it impotent and the wet metal barely broke her skin hannah looked up to see if annetje had noticed she hadnt the girl was busy grating cheese humming some drunken ditty to herselfappropriate enough since shed been dipping into the wine again if shed noticed hannahs mishap shed certainly have said something oh look how clumsy you are or what a fine thing that cant handle a knife she would say it with a laugh and a turn of her pretty head as though a laugh and a turned head made everything amicable hannah would let her pretend that it did make everything amicable though shed be biting back the urge to slam the half wheel of cheese into the girls face hannah stabbed at the drop of blood with her rigid tongue and pushed the asparagus into the bowl where it would be mixed with the cheese and some old bread and baked into a flan like they had eaten in portugal except in lisbon they had used different vegetables and different cheeses annetje thought flans were disgustingunwholesome she said a term she used to describe any food she hadnt eaten growing up in groningen someday she was now observing your husband will notice that you fix elaborate meals only when his brother plans to dine with you two people dont eat much hannah answered almost successfully willing herself not to blush three people eat a great deal more that was something her mother had taught her but it was particularly true when her husband was involved if daniel had his way theyd eat nothing but bread and old cheese and pickled fish anything they could get cheaply and he was the one who insisted that they make something of the evening meal when his brother joined them probably so that miguel wouldnt think daniel a miserwhich he already did but she also liked to feed him well miguel did not eat properly when left to himself and she did not like him to go hungry also unlike daniel he always appeared to relish his food to regard it as a pleasure rather than a mere necessity that kept him alive for one more day he would thank her and praise the quality he went out of his way to say little meaningless things to her observing that the added nutmeg in the herring made the dish sparkle or that the prune sauce she served over the eggs was more delicious than ever the carrots need to be stewed in the prunes and raisins annetje said seeing that hannah had taken a moment to rest im tired she sighed to emphasize her point she hated pleading weakness to the girl but she was with child now and that ought to be excuse enough it ought to be but there was nothing to be gained by thinking about what ought to be it ought to be for example that the wife of a portuguese hidalgo was not in a hot and nearly windowless kitchen chopping asparagus with her maid still that was what he asked of her and that is what she would do she took grim pleasure in keeping his house in order in making herself blameless in his eyes after their move to amsterdam daniel had allowed her to hire a houseful of servants but within weeks he had learned it was the dutch custom for wives even the wives of the greatest heren to share their labors with their maids a house with no children never had more than one servant eager to save his money daniel had dismissed nearly everyone keeping just the girl whom he favored because she was a catholic to help hannah with her chores youre tired annetje repeated sourly then a shrug hannah knew only a passable amount of dutch and annetje less portuguese so their interactions were often terse and limited not limited enough hannahfool fool hannahhad trusted the girl too much in those early days shed trusted her pretty smile and her sweet temper and seagreen eyes in the hours they spent together toiling like equalsscrubbing walls washing the stoop sweating puddles onto the kitchen floorhannah had come to like the girl and to confide in her annetje taught her as much dutch as hannah could learn and she tried patiently to learn portuguese she taught hannah how to scrub the front stairs of a house which no one had ever done in lisbon how to pick the best produce from the merchants on the dam and how to tell if a baker added chalk to whiten his bread hannah had come to look on the girl as her only true ally she found few friends among the other jewish women of the vlooyenburg and she hardly had time for idle friendship with her chores floors to scrub clothes to launder meals to cook breakfast before dawn dinner when daniel returned home from the exchangeanywhere between two and six so it had always to be readyand later depending on when he had his dinner a light supper there were the sabbath meals he hosted and the havdalah gatherings sometimes when he invited friends or colleagues for meals he would supervise as hannah and annetje prepared the food making foolish suggestions and getting underfoot hannah had never been made to do so much work in her life in lisbon shed been asked to sew and mend and to help cook on the holidays shed minded children for older relatives and shed cared for the sick and the elderly nothing like this after a week annetje had found her huddled in the corner weeping so hard she could hardly keep from banging her head against the brick behind her the girl had pleaded for her to say what was wrong but where to begin what was wrong amsterdam jews prayer synagogue cooking scrubbing and daniel it was all wrong but she could say none of it aloud so shed let the girl comfort her and bring her hot wine and sing songs to her as though she were an infant then she began to tell annetje secrets like how she had unbeknownst to her husband gone to see the witch woman who lived outside of town for a charm that would help her get with child she told her about daniels quirks and foibles and coolness for example he would never under any circumstances take off all his clothing she told annetje how after he used his chamber pot he would return hour after hour to sniff at it and she told the girl other things too things she now wished she could take back even as shed said them she knew she had confided too much maybe that was even why shed done it the thrill of speaking the forbidden of asking for help in doing what must not be doneit had been all too delicious and it would most likely be her undoing well go tomorrow annetje asked now as though she sensed hannahs thoughts yes hannah said these furtive trips had been exhilarating at first warm and welcoming but also exciting in the way forbidden things always were now it was a terrible duty one she could not avoid without seeing a little sparkle in the maids eyes a sparkle that said do as i instruct or ill tell your husband what you would not want him to know shed only uttered the threat aloud once when shed been very angry at hannah for not wanting to give her more than the secret ten guilders a week above what her husband paid her that one time had been enough now she only hinted id hate to say things best left unsaid she would tell her mistress or i fear sometimes that my tongue is too loose and if your husband is aroundwell wed best not talk of that hannah looked again at the dull knife in lisbon she might have been temptedtruly temptedto plunge it into the girls heart and be done with her who would have asked questions if a kitchen girl died in the home of a rich merchant in amsterdam though with its leveling politics and merchant culture a housewife would hardly get away with killing a servant not that hannah could really bring herself to murder another human being no matter how much she might hate her still it was better to have the option daniels teeth were bothering him today she could see that when they sat down for dinner he had fingers from both hands in his mouth and was fishing around for who knew what he would do that at night too digging for hours on end paying no mind to where his elbow flew or whom it struck after months of this she had urged him to see a surgeona tricky business since daniel took great offense if she suggested anything to him if his hand were on fire and she suggested that he dunk it in a bucket of water hed glare at her and let himself burn to soften the advice shed given it in anecdotal form jeronimo javezas wife tells me her husband had a problem tooth pulled by a skilled dentist who works near the damrak she says he hasnt been so comfortable in five years so daniel had gone but come back with the same troubling teeth with which hed left the house that morning the brute of a surgeon wanted fifteen guilders to pull five teeth hed said three guilders a tooth for fifteen guilders a man should get new teeth not lose old ones now at the table daniel looked almost ready to aid his excavation with a knife while miguel blessed the wine miguel prayed over everything they ate over anything that didnt move he might pray over his own turds for all she knew when daniel ate alone with her he would mutter the hebrew words or mutter some of them if he couldnt remember the rest often he forgot to pray at all he would always forget when he ate alone there being no one to impress or instruct miguel however would bless his food whenever he ate shed seen other men of the vlooyenburg with their hebrew and their blessings and often they seemed to her angry or frightening or alien with miguel there was delight in his utterances as though he were remembering something wonderful each time he said the prayers it was hard not to hear these strange words anew each time he spoke themnot mumbled and swallowed the way some men did but clearly articulated like oratory she heard the poetry of a foreign tongue its cadences and repetitions complementary sounds and she knew things would be different if miguel instead of daniel were her husband this wasnt just some idle fancy born from her constant reflection that miguel was far more handsome and robust than his brother where daniel was thin and looked like a beggar in merchants clothes miguel was round and pink and hearty though miguel was the elder brother he looked more youthful and healthy his large black eyes always darted here and there not nervously like daniels but with delight and wonder and his face was so rounddelicate and somehow still strong what would it be like she wondered to be married to a man who loved laughter instead of resenting it who embraced life instead of squinting at it with suspicion that was fates little irony she knew her father had been seeking an alliance with the lienzos and wanted his daughter to marry the elder son hannah had never met either or them so it was all one to her but then the elder son had upped and married a penniless girl without his familys approval so her father had opted for the next lienzo in line by the time miguels wife died only four months later hannah was already married to daniel what would these prayers mean to her if she had married miguel daniel knew almost nothing of the liturgy he went to synagogue because the parnassim expected it of him particularly his friend solomon parido whom hannah was inclined to dislike because of his sour attitude toward miguel he had often enough spared her the tedium of going herself but now that he had got her with child he made her come along so the men of the congregation could be reminded of his virility more than one had wished him a son so he might have someone to say kaddish for him when he died he had not even spoken in private to hannah of jewish worship until they began their preparations to move to amsterdam her father and three brothers had all been devoted secret jews but no one had told her so before her marriage on the eve of her wedding when she was but sixteen years old her father had explained that because her mother was renowned throughout the land for her loose tongue he had assumed that hannah would have the same streak of womanly treachery and had decided not to entrust the truth to his daughter for the good of the family she had been allowed to think of herself as a catholic worship as a catholic and hate jews as a catholic now as she prepared to marry this stranger who had been selected without even asking her opinion he had dined with her family twice and her father had pointed out hannah had politely returned his awkwardly tightlipped smiles that looked like the grimace of a man in pain her father had chosen to reveal to her the family secret the secret she was not the person she had always been led to believe she was even her name had been a lie you are not truly bernarda he told her you are hannah which is also the true name of your mother you must call yourself hannah from this moment on but not in public for that would betray us all and i hope you are not so stupid as to do that how could she be a jew was it possible that she was of the race of childkillers and wellpoisoners surely her father had made some mistake that her husband would clarify so she had merely nodded and tried not to think too much about it but how could she not think about it her father had kept her own name from her and now she had to practice strange rituals which he explained rapidly and impatiently assuring her that her new husband would clarify any foolish questions she might be imprudent enough to ask she never asked and it would be years before he explained later she heard strange stories that only the circumcised can enter the kingdom of heaven did that mean women were forever banned from their eternal reward that only flattened bread should be eaten in springtime that blood must be drained from meat before it can be eaten her father on the eve of her wedding had cared nothing for hannahs knowledge or for her ability to keep the lawsonly her tongue i suppose your silence will now be your husbands problem he had said but if the inquisition should take you i hope youll have the good sense to betray his family rather than your own hannah sometimes regretted that she had never had the opportunity to betray either she could tell at once that the meal would go badly annetje spilled some of the flan on the table and almost dropped a steaming heap of it into daniels lap learn to conduct yourself girl daniel snapped in his nearly incomprehensible dutch learn how to put your lips to my plump ass annetje answered what daniel demanded what did the girl say i cant understand a word of her garbled accent it was true enough that she spoke in the odd manner of dutch northernersand exaggerated the accent when she spoke impertinentlybut daniel only used that as an excuse for barely knowing the tongue of a land in which he had lived for more than two years he had no idea what shed said but he saw miguels stifled laugh and that was enough to set the mood miguel who hannah was sure had put his own lips to all sorts of places on annetjes anatomy tried to avert discomfort by praising the food and the wine but there was no appealing to his hosts pride ive heard daniel said that youre to lose a great deal in the brandy trade daniel had never shown warm feelings for his brother there had always been a rivalry between them she knew that when they were boys their father had told them that lienzo brothers had never gotten along not since their greatgreatgrandfather had killed their greatgreatgreatuncle in an argument over a tavern bill when he saw the boys playing happily together he would remind them of this tradition miguel wanted only to avoid his brother whenever possible but daniel believed in a more aggressive approach and he had grown even more acrimonious in recent months perhaps daniel had been embarrassed by miguels difficulties in trade perhaps he regretted having loaned his brother so large a sum and perhaps it had something to do with his friendship with solomon parido hannah did not entirely understand the relationship between her husband and the parnass but it had formed almost from the instant they arrived in amsterdam a member of the community always looked after new arrivals daniel had been asked to do this but had refused saying it was well known that refugees always brought strange smells into an established household and parido had been the one to look after daniel within a few months they had begun working together as parido mined daniels portuguese contacts to trade mostly in wines but also in figs and salt and olives and sometimes dried lemons in that first year she had overheard a conversationreally quite by accidentin which daniel lamented already having a wife and thus far a barren wife too since paridos daughter was of a marriageable age and an alliance between them would be the most beneficial thing in the world that was how they had begun to think of linking the family through miguel if that marriage had gone through as planned perhaps feelings between brothers would have softened but things went horribly badly not that hannah minded she had disliked the girl and thought miguel might do better but the disaster had left daniel feeling he could speak to his brother any way he liked a feeling only intensified by miguels losses in the sugar market miguel however at least maintained the appearance of calm as his brother harassed him about his brandy futures he only took a sip of his wine and half smiled reckoning day has not yet come well see how things stand then as i hear it youll stand another thousand or more in debt daniel had loaned miguel fifteen hundred guilders when his affairs soured and while daniel never referred to the loan directly he knew a hundred ways to refer to it obliquely miguel attempted the same half smile but said nothing more and what is this i hear daniel pressed on about the coffee trade miguel kept his smirk but at once it seemed to turn waxy and false as though he had tasted bitter meat and needed someplace discreet to spit it out what makes you think i have an interest in the coffee trade he asked because when you came home last night you woke me by clattering drunkenly around the house and muttering about coffee i have no recollection of doing so miguel answered but i suppose that is the nature of drunken mutteringsone never recollects them what is your interest in coffee no interest i was feeling overly wet in my humors so i took a prescription of coffee to dry myself out i was most likely merely marveling at its curative powers i cannot recommend that you enter into the coffee trade daniel said i have no plans to do so i think you will find it a less hospitable commodity than you might imagine after all it is only a medicine used by a few apothecaries prescribed by a few physicians what advantage could you find in trading in so unwanted a thing im sure youre right trading in something no one wants can only lead to more ruin miguel set down his glass of wine too hard and a few drops rose up to splash him in the face are you deaf he wiped away the wine from his eye are your ears in your teeth have you not heard that i have no interest in the coffee trade i only wish to make myself clear daniel said sulkily as he pushed his food around his plate waiting for it to reach the same temperature as the interior of his mouth so he could eat it without difficulty however miguel added after a moment your resolve makes me curious why should a man whoever he might be fear to involve himself in the coffee trade but now it was daniel who wanted to speak no more of it they ate the rest of the meal mostly in silence daniel staring at his food miguel exchanging glances with hannah when he felt he could do so without her husband noticing if he ever contemplated that he might well have been married to her he never showed any signs of it but he was always kind miguel was rarely home except to sleep in his damp cellar so there were few occasions for them to talk without her husbands presence but on those occasions he spoke to her warmly as though they were old friends as though he valued her opinion one time she had even dared to ask him why he slept in the cellar when he had first moved in daniel had placed him in a small windowless room on the third floorwhat the dutch called the priest roombut miguel had complained that it was too hot and smoky if he burned peat and too cold if he did not hannah suspected hed moved out for other reasons the priest room was located directly under the room in which she and daniel slept and on saturday mornings after she and her husband had observed the tradition of conjugal duties one of the few rules of the hebrews daniel showed any interest in adhering toat least until she had become pregnant miguel always seemed embarrassed and uncomfortable so now he lived in the damp cellar sleeping in a cupboard bed that even the shortest man would have to curl up to fit into at night when the tides rose the canal water spilled through the windows and onto the floor but he still preferred it to the priest room at least when he wasnt creeping up the stairs to annetjes garret chamber at the conclusion of the cheerless meal they were rescued from their misery by a pounding at the door it turned out to be the parnass senhor parido who entered the room and bowed in his overly formal way like daniel parido dressed like a portuguese man and while hannah had grown up thinking nothing of men who wore bright colors and giant hats in amsterdam such clothes appeared to her slightly ridiculous at least parido went to a decent tailor and his suits of reds and golds and bright blues somehow looked more appropriate on him than on her husband parido had wide shoulders and a muscular frame a rugged face with dull eyes he radiated a melancholy that hannah had never fully understood until the day shed seen him on the street leading his only son by the hand the boy was her age but addled in his head and hooted like a monkey shed once seen in a traveling show parido had no other sons and his wife was too old to bear more paridos sadness meant nothing to daniel hannah would have been surprised if he had even noticed it daniel saw only the enormity of paridos house the expense of his clothes the wealth that he gave to the charitable boards parido was one of the few men in the city jew or gentile who owned a coach and he maintained his own horses in a stable on the fringes of the city unlike in lisbon horse travel was not generally permitted in amsterdam and each venture had to be approved by an office in the town hall and even though the coach had little practical use daniel envied its shiny gilding the padded seats the envious looks of the pedestrians they passed that was what daniel wanted the envy he wanted to be the object of everyones envy and he had not the first idea how to go about it daniel greeted the parnass in the most elaborate terms imaginable he nearly fell over getting up from the table so he could return the bow he then told hannah that he and senhor parido would withdraw to the front room the maid should bring them some winea bottle of his best portugueseand then she should get out before she offered any of her tongue perhaps the elder senhor lienzo would like to join us parido suggested he stroked his beard which he kept fashionably short and slightly pointy like a painters rendition of his namesake miguel looked up from the last of his stewed herring he had barely responded with a nod to paridos bow now miguel continued to stare as if he didnt understand his portuguese im sure my brother has other things to do with his time daniel suggested it does seem likely miguel agreed please why dont you join us parido suggested again an unusual softness in his voice miguel could not refuse unless he wished to risk utter rudeness instead he nodded sharply almost as though trying to shake something out of his hair and the three men disappeared together into the front room hannah had made a habit of eavesdropping despite her intentions to obey her husbands wishes a year before she had found annetje in the great tradition of dutch servant girls pressing her ear against the heavy oak door to the antechamber inside daniels nasal voice vibrated muffled and incomprehensible through the walls now she could no longer recall to what the girl had been listening daniel with a tradesman daniel with a business partner it might have been daniel with that nasty little portrait painter who once when he had got hannah alone had tried to kiss her when she protested hed said it was no matter and that she was too plump for his taste anyhow hannah had walked into the hall to find annetje with her face against the door her dungcolored cap pushed askew by the force of her eagerness hannah had placed her hands upon her hips she screwed her face into a mask of authority you mustnt eavesdrop annetje had turned from the door for an instant not even the hint of a smile on her pale dutch face no shed said i must and so resumed her business there had been nothing for hannah to do but to press her ear against the door herself now she could hear paridos muffled voice on the inside i was hoping i might have a moment to speak with you he said you might have taken that moment last night i surely saw you at the talmud torah why should he not have been at the talmud torah daniel asked he is a parnass please daniel parido said quietly a moment of silence and then parido began again senhor i have but this to say things have been uneasy with us for a long time now after the business with antonia you sent me a note in which you offered an apology and i was uninterested at the time i now regret my coolness toward you your behavior was foolish and inconsiderate but not malicious i will agree with that assessment miguel said after a moment i dont expect us to become great friends in an instant but i would like to see less discomfort between us a brief pause and sounds like the drinking of wine then i have felt particular discomfort when you brought me before the maamad parido barked out a laugh do me justice and acknowledge that i never charged you unfairly nor have you ever faced serious punishment my duties as a parnass require that i guide the behavior of the community and in your case i have tried to show mercy out of affection for your brother rather than be cruel out of resentment toward you it is strange that it never occurred to me you see daniel said he has no interest in ending animosities parido seemed to ignore him we have been angry with each other these two years i cannot expect for us to be friends because i say so i only ask that you not look to extend hostilities and i will do the same and in time we may come to trust each other i appreciate your words miguel said id be happy if things could become easy between us the next time we see each other parido pressed we will meet if not as friends then at least as countrymen agreed miguel said with a bit more warmth i thank you for this gesture hannah heard scraping sounds like feet shuffling toward the door and dared not risk remaining in the hall any longer women were not made privy to business affairs but she knew that parido had long done what he could to harm miguels dealings could he now trust this offer of friendship coming as it did so suddenly it put hannah in mind of childrens stories of witches who lured children into their homes with promises of sweets or hobgoblins who tempted greedy travelers with gold and jewels she thought to warn miguel but he scarcely needed her wisdom miguel knew a witch or a hobgoblin when he saw one he would not be easily fooled though he had more pressing things to consider miguel visited a bookseller near the westerkerk and found a translation of an english pamphlet extolling the virtues of coffee the author wrote with an enthusiasm that dwarfed geertruids coffee he insisted has all but destroyed the plague in england it preserves health in general and makes those who drink it hearty and fat it helps the digestion and cures consumption and other maladies of the lung it is wonderful for fluxes even the bloody flux and has been known to cure jaundice and every kind of inflammation besides all that the englishman wrote it imparts astonishing powers of reason and concentration in the years to come the author said the man who does not drink coffee may never hope to compete with the man who avails himself of its secrets later down in his space in daniels cellar miguel fought back the urge to pick up a pewter pitcher and hurl it against the wall should he give his attention to coffee or brandy could he separate the two the brandy business pulled him down like a weight on a drowning man but coffee could be the very thing to buoy him up he turned for comfort as he increasingly did to his collection of pamphlets since coming to amsterdam miguel had discovered a love of spanish adventures translated french romances marvelous travel stories and most of all salacious tales of crime of these accounts of murderers and thieves miguel loved best the pamphlets recounting the adventures of charming pieter the clever bandit who had been playing his wily tricks on the foolish rich in and around amsterdam for years geertruid had first introduced him to the adventures of this scoundrel hero who she said along with his goodwife mary embodied the very core of dutch cleverness she read the pamphlets eagerly sometimes aloud to her man hendrick and sometimes to an entire tavern of men who laughed and hooted and toasted this thief were the stories true were they mere fictions like don quixote or something in between miguel had resisted the allure of these stories at first in lisbon he had never bothered with lurid accounts of murderers and executions and now he had reading enough with his studies of torah nevertheless charming pieter had won him over miguel had become enchanted by the bandits celebration of his own duplicity the conversos of lisbon had been duplicitous by necessity even those who fully embraced the catholic church a new christian could be betrayed at any time by a victim under an inquisitors knife miguel had habitually lied hidden facts about himself eaten pork in public he had done anything to prevent his name from being the one to come to a prisoners lips deception had always been a burden but pieter reveled in his duplicity miguel was enchanted by these tales because he longed like charming pieter to be a trickster instead of a liar now he tried to lose himself in one of his favorite stories that of a rich burgher who entranced by goodwife marys beauty had thought to cuckold pieter while she provided a distraction with her wit and artful ways pieter and his men carried off all of the burghers possessions after turning the burgher out of his own home naked to the world pieter and mary opened up the mans larder to the people of the village and allowed them to feast upon his wealth and so in his own way charming pieter carried out the justice of the common folk when he closed the little volume miguel was still thinking about brandy and about coffee that afternoon he received a letter from the usurer alonzo alferonda with whom he maintained a cautious friendship alferonda had a reputation as a man dangerous to neglectdozens of blinded and lamed debtors in amsterdam would testify to thatbut miguel found alferondas hobbled victims hard to reconcile with the plump and jovial fellow who seemed to have an infinite store of kindness the maamad would have destroyed miguel for his congress with a man it had expelled but alferondas company was too merry to set aside even in his exiled state he had knowledge and information and he never hesitated to pass it along some months ago miguel had mentioned a rumor hed heard and alferonda volunteered to find out what he could now he claimed to have learned something important and requested that they talkalways a tricky business but usually managed well enough with a bit of caution miguel wrote to alferonda suggesting they meet in the coffee tavern which he had found by inquiring of a few men in the east india trade miguel knew only that the place was located in the plantage which stretched out east of the vlooyenburg endless walks cutting through sculpted gardens square paths crisscrossed walkways peopled with the high and the low alike the burgomasters had ruled that no permanent buildings might stand on its verdant grounds so all structures here were made of wood ready to be taken apart should the city so decree on pleasant evenings the plantage became a garden of delights for those who had the coin and the inclination strollers could walk among bands of fiddlers and fife players on the welllighted paths entrepreneurs had set up tables and poured beer and served sausage or herring or cheese in houses hardly more than huts a man could buy delicacies of a more human kind miguel located the meeting place with difficulty after asking several other proprietors for directions finally he came upon what he suspected was the right building a poor wooden structure built at crazed angles hardly looking fit to withstand a rainstorm miguel found the door locked but a nearby brothel keeper had assured him that it was the right place so he knocked loudly almost at once the door opened a crack and miguel stared at a darkskinned turk in a yellow turban the man said nothing is this the coffee tavern miguel asked who are you the turk grunted in muddled dutch is the tavern private i did not know i did not say it was i did not say it wasnt i only asked who you are im not sure my name will mean anything to you i am miguel lienzo the turk nodded senhor alferondas friend you may come in senhor alferondas friends will always find themselves welcome here senhor alferondas friend miguel had no idea that alferonda had even heard of coffee but apparently he was well known among the mohammedans miguel followed the turk into the building hardly more impressive on the inside than the outside rough chairs and tables sat on a damp earth floor at once he was overwhelmed by the scent of coffee far more intense and pungent than what he had smelled at geertruids cousins tavern on a half dozen or so benches sat an odd assortment of men turks in turbans seafaring dutchmen a hodgepodge of foreignersand one jew alonzo alferonda sat conversing with a tall turk in faded blue robes he whispered something as miguel approached and the turk departed alferonda stood to greet miguel though standing only emphasized his shortness he was a rounded fellow with a wide face and large eyes hidden behind a thick beard of slightly graying black miguel could scarce believe there were many men who trembled before this pudgy face one night they had walked together after drinking at a tavern near the docks a pair of thieves had leapt from an alley knives brandished set to take their purses one look at alferonda and they scurried away like frightened cats i was surprised you asked to meet here alferonda said i had no idea you had any taste for coffee i might say the same of you ive only just learned of it i wanted to see what a coffee tavern would be like alferonda gestured for them to sit it is not much but they obtain good fruit and the demand is low enough that they rarely run out but supplies are sometimes short they can be the usurer studied miguel coffee is controlled by the east india company and as there is not much demand in europe the company doesnt import a great quantity it mostly trades the fruit in the east what do you care about the supplies miguel ignored the question id forgotten youd lived in the orient of course you know coffee he opened his hands wide alferonda has lived everywhere and has connections everywhere which is why you seek him out miguel smiled at the hint you have information excellent information miguel had asked alferonda to inquire into a rumor hed overheard regarding paridos involvement in an impending whaleoil trade hed been hesitant to pursue this affair it would be dangerous to oppose the parnass in matters of business still miguel only sought information he told himself he neednt act on it you were certainly right about parido alferonda began he has a spy inside the east india company miguel raised his eyebrows i would have thought that beyond even his ambition the company is not so powerful as it would have you believe gold works for company men as it does for everyone else parido has learned that they plan to buy large quantities of whale oil to sell in the japans and cathay but these company fellows have the patience to wait for the price to drop since they know production has been climbing steadily of late parido has been quietly collecting whale oil on other exchangesjust a little here and there you understandand hopes to flood the market slowly enough to lower the price without raising suspicion meanwhile he and his combination are also buying calls which will allow them to secure the current low prices miguel let out a breath i am no friend of that man but i am impressed at some point the east india company will decide the price is low enough to buy and stock their own warehouses and when that happens the price goes up meanwhile paridos combination has the calls which allow them to buy at the artificially lowered price and then turn around and sell at the new inflated price trading combinations manipulated the markets all the time but this planbuying on other exchanges creating a market to tempt a buyerwas beyond anything miguel had ever heard how did you learn all this alferonda smoothed his beard anything that is known can be learned you hear rumors about whale oil i ask some questions and soon everything is revealed when will this trade take place sometime next month between this reckoning day and the next i hardly need say anything to you but as your friend i must warn you to proceed carefully you may hitch a ride on paridos venture if you like hell scowl that you should have profited from his work and thats nothing but do him no harm that he can see or hell never forgive you you must think me addled to lecture me about that miguel said goodnaturedly not addled but i would hate to see your eagerness undo your ambitions now ive already bought whale oil at its low price and i suggest you do so too as quickly as you can it will have to wait until after this reckoning day i hope to have a few coins to my name then a turk placed two small bowls before them they were smaller than any drinking vessels miguel had ever seen and contained a liquid black and thick as mud what is this miguel asked its coffee have you not tried it yet i have miguel said as he picked up the bowl and held it closer to an oil lamp but it seemed a different thing than this altogether this is how the turks drink it they boil it three times in a copper pot to darken and distill it in their native land they often serve it with great ceremony but amsterdammers have no time for the frivolity of ritual be careful let the powder rest at the bottom when i drank it before miguel said eyeing the drink skeptically it was made with milk or sweet wine i cant recall the turks believe that combining milk and coffee causes leprosy miguel laughed i hope not you seem to know a great deal about coffee what else can you tell me i can tell you about kaldi the abyssinian goatherd i dont know that i have any interest in goatherds youll find this one interesting he lived quite some time ago tending his flock in the hills of abyssinia one afternoon he noticed that his goats were much more lively than usual dancing about raising up on their hind legs bleating out their little goat songs kaldi spent several days watching them and they grew increasingly more lively they ran and played and hopped about when they should have been sleeping they danced and sang instead of eating kaldi was certain a demon had possessed the goats but he summoned his courage and followed the beasts hoping to catch a glimpse of this fiend the next day he saw that the goats had come upon a strange bush after they ate the fruit of the bush they once again began to leap about kaldi ate some of the berries himself and soon he could not resist the urge to dance with the goats a holy man happened by at that time and asked kaldi why he capered with his herd he explained that he had eaten the fruit of the bush and it had filled him with untold vigor so the holy man who was rather a boring fellow took some fruit home he was plagued by the fact that his students would fall asleep while he was lecturing so he made a drink out of the berries and fed it to his students before he lectured soon he was known throughout the world of the mohammedans as a man who could deliver discourses from sundown to sunup without his students falling asleep miguel paused for a moment that is very interesting but i thought to inquire about the coffee trade as it is now not among abyssinian goatherds alferonda raised one eyebrow there is no vigorous coffee trade outside of the orient and the east india company controls that not much remains for the rest of us but you are speaking about the east perhaps coffee would be of interest to men here in europe i for one have no love of sleep i see it as a waste of time if i could drink coffee instead i would be most pleased you would have to sleep in the end alferonda said but i take your point men who drink coffee come to love it beyond all things ive heard that among the turks a woman can divorce her husband if he does not provide her with enough coffee and the coffee taverns of the east are strange places there the drink is combined with powerful medicines like poppy extract and men go to such places in search of pleasures of the flesh miguel looked around i see nothing so pleasurable here the turks dont look kindly upon women in social places such as a coffee tavern the pleasures you pay for in those places are the pleasures of boys not women that is a strange way to do things miguel said to us but they enjoy themselves in any case you must keep me informed about your interest in coffee if i can be of any help you may depend on me but you must remember to be careful coffee is a drink that brings out great passions in men and you may be unlocking great forces if you trifle with it miguel drank down the rest of his bowl swallowing a bit of the powder at the bottom it coated his mouth uncomfortably youre the second person to warn me off coffee he told alferonda while he wiped at his mouth with his sleeve the usurer cocked his head i hate being second at anything who was the first my brother if you can believe it daniel reason enough to pursue it if he warns you off what did he say only that it was dangerous miguel said he somehow knew id developed an interest he told some story about me muttering drunkenly but im not sure i believe him more likely hes been searching my things again i would pay his warning no mind your brother if you will excuse me for saying so has no more brains than the idiot son parido keeps locked in his garret i thought it odd miguel said i wonder if hes somehow learned that i have been thinking of the coffee trade and wants to set me off out of spite he doesnt like that i carry on with his serving girl oh shes a pretty one are you fond of her miguel shrugged i suppose im fond of her looks he said absently in truth miguel found her somewhat impertinent but she was the one who had begun the dalliance and miguel had known from an early age that a man never turns away an eager serving girl not so pretty as the mistress though eh alferonda said true enough my brother doesnt much like the way i speak to her oh a wide grin spread across alferondas face what way is that miguel had the feeling hed fallen into a trap shes a pleasant girl a pretty thing with a quick mind but daniel never has a kind word i think she takes a great deal of pleasure from the occasional bit of congress with me alferonda was now moving his eyebrows up and down and flaring his nostrils i for one thought it was a fine thing when the rabbis revoked the commandment against adultery dont be foolish miguel said turning to hide his blush i only feel sorry for her ive known miguel lienzo to have dealings with pretty girls and what he feels is generally not sorry i have no intention of bedding my brothers wife he said in any case she is far too virtuous a woman to allow it may the holy one blessed be he help you alferonda said when a man starts protesting about a womans virtue it means hes either had her already or would kill to do so i will say that it is one way to get back at your brother for his foul temper miguel opened his mouth to protest but thought better of it justification was for the guilty and surely he had done nothing wrong from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda i had been plying my trade with a fair amount of success for some time when i was approached by a tudesco merchant with a proposition that appeared to me both lucrative and rewarding for some years now the tudescos the jews of eastern europe had been making their presence increasingly felt in amsterdam and this development was not at all to the maamads liking while we jews of the portuguese nation have no shortage of beggars among our number we also enjoy our share of wealthy merchants and these can afford to be charitable our community had struck a deal with the amsterdam burgomasters to remain a city apart taking care of our own charitable cases and producing no burden on the metropolis itself thus we took care of our own but the tudescos had few men of significant wealth and most were desperately poor though with our beards and our bright colors we looked different from the dutch we thought ours a dignified difference a hebrew of portugal could not go anywhere in the city no matter how neatly trimmed his beard and no matter how dull his clothes without being recognized for a member of his nation but the maamad believed the merchants among us were ambassadors we might say in the silence of our finery behold us we are different but we are worthy people with whom to share your land more important they might look on our poor and think ah those jews feed and dress their own mendicants relieving us of the burden theyre not so bad thus the problem of the tudescos they had heard that amsterdam was a paradise for jews so they fled to our city from poland germany lithuania and all manner of other places where they were savagely abused i had heard that poland in particular was a land of ghastly torments and scarcely believable cruelties men made to watch while their wives and daughters were brutalized children tied in sacks and thrown on burning fires scholars buried alive with their murdered families the parnassim surely sympathized with these refugees but they had grown to depend on the comforts of amsterdam and like the fat and rich of all nations and beliefs they were unwilling to sacrifice their ease for the wellbeing of others their concerns were not unfounded and they dreaded a future in which the streets of amsterdam were crawling with jewish beggars and jewish hucksters and jewish whores the dutch would then surely rescind their former generosity the maamad concluded that the tudesco community would be best handled if kept small there were several plans for accomplishing this goal but they all centered around keeping these troubling people at a distance from iberian wealtha maneuver they believed would make amsterdam less appealing than cities where their own kind thrived tudescos were therefore forbidden to enroll their children in schools run by portuguese jews they could have no position of standing in portuguese synagogues their meats were declared unclean and off limits to portuguese households so their butchers could not sell to our people the maamad even declared it a crime punishable by excommunication to give charity to any tudesco except through one of the official charitable boards these boards believed that the best charity would be passage on ships heading out of amsterdam so it could do no good to encourage them to stay by dropping a stuiver or two into their greedy little hands i knew all this but i did not have it much in my thoughts when i was approached by a member of the tudesco community many of the refugees he told me managed to escape from their oppressive lands with a precious stone or two hidden away on their persons would i be willing to broker these stones to portuguese merchants he suggested that i would ask for a bit more than the lowest price explaining that the stones belonged to wretched wanderers who longed to begin anew and take only a fraction of the usual brokering fee i might make a few extra guilders and still do a good deed that would win me favor in the eyes of the holy one blessed be he for several months i went about this business during what time i could spare for it a bottle of wine purchased a smile a word about the importance of charity and i soon found most gem merchants willing to pay a few extra guilders for a stone if it would help a poor family enjoy a peaceful shabbat so it went until i one day came to my home and found a note for me composed in florid spanish written in a fine hand i had been summoned to the maamad i still thought nothing of the matter sooner or later every man found himself standing before that council a rumor of unclean food eaten or a dutch slut got with child the council itself was little better than a pack of old women wanting only a soothing word to make them calm again i knew that my old enemy solomon parido now held a place on the council but i hardly thought he would use his power for nefarious ends yet that is precisely what he did he sat there stiff in his laced suit glaring at me senhor alferonda he said you are surely aware of the ruling of the council that no help shall be given to the tudescos other than through the charitable boards of the synagogue of course senhor i said then why have you ensnared men of our nation lawabiding men into your wicked schemes of jewel peddling my wicked schemes as you style them provide aid to the poor and while you have made it clear that you do not want us throwing our coins to tudesco beggars you have said nothing about buying and selling with them is it not the same as tossing coins if you intentionally ask merchants to give more than they wish to pay that the seller might take that money and do with it as he will as he will i pointed out often means buying bread that is not your concern one of the other members of the council said there are charitable boards to see that these people dont starve the offense was minor enough but parido wished to cast it in the most dire light possible he turned the other parnassim against me he prodded me into speaking angrily and yet though i saw all that i could not help but be angry i had done nothing wrong i had violated none of the holy laws indeed i upheld the commandment to give charity was i now to be punished for doing as the torah commands this question in particular may have been what set them against me no one likes to have his hypocrisy exposed after much interrogation the parnassim asked me to wait outside when they called me back in after more than an hour they announced their decision i was to ask the men for whom i had brokered to rescind their sales they were in other words to buy back their stones i had seen the men for whom i had brokered they were poor dressed in rags crushed by hardship and despair many had lost parents or children or wives to the cruelty of poles or cossacks to go to them and ask them to return money which they surely no longer had because they had spent it rather than starve or go naked seemed to me not only preposterous but depraved i supposed it was meant to be so to undo these sales i would have to buy those stones back with my own money and surely parido had known i would refuse to do so the council urged me to reconsider but i swore i would never obey such an unreasonable demand the parnassim then told me i had forced their hand and they had no choice but to put me under cherem the banto excommunicate me men fell under the ban frequently most times it was but for a day or a week but in some it was permanent and so they meant it in my case more than that parido made it clear to the tudescos that if they admitted me into their synagogue they would be made to suffer for their kindness he wrote to the maamads of every community upon the face of the earth giving them my name and speaking of my crimes in the most exaggerated terms i had become an outcast with nowhere to go the mark of cain upon me they chose to treat me like a villain what choice did i have but to become one in earnest miguel first met geertruid nearly a year before she proposed a venture in coffee it was in the flyboat a tavern off the warmoesstraat close enough to the exchange that merchants regarded it as adjunct a place to continue business when the gates of the bourse closed though owned by a dutchman it catered to jewish traders by offering drinks that conformed to the dietary codes jewish boys of the portuguese nation were hired to keep separate the serving glasses for the jews and to clean them in accordance with jewish law and a rabbi would occasionally come to inspect the kitchens strolling like a general with his hands behind his back as he peered into cabinets and pried open containers the owner charged almost twice the going rate for wine and beer but jewish merchants gladly paid higher prices in exchange for the chance to conduct business in a dutch tavern with an easy conscience miguel had been continuing a conversation with a sugar merchant after the close of the exchange and the two men had taken a table and talked of their business for hours all the while drinking with netherlandish intensity the sugar merchant was one of those goodnatured dutchmen who found jews fascinating as though their alien beliefs and customs made them a puzzle the vlooyenburg crawled with these men who came to learn hebrew or study jewish theology in part because it helped them better to understand their own religion but also because the dutch were curiously attracted to foreigners the maamads strict injunction against religious debate with gentiles made miguel only more irresistible and the merchant had bought drink after drink with the playful intention of breaking miguels defenses at last he abandoned the effort announcing that he must go home to his wife lest he face her fury warm with beer miguel had been in no mood to return to the solitude of his own home so he remained at his table quietly drinking while he puffed lazily upon a pipe of good tobacco conversations swirled all around him and he half listened for any useful rumor or tip then he heard a fragment of conversation that jolted him out of his stupor a sad end for the indian flower a voice pronounced with the kind of narrative fervor only to be found on the lips of a drunk dutchman cleaned out to her core until there was nothing left but a pack of unmanned sailors shitting themselves silly miguel turned slowly he owned shares in the indian flowerquite a few in fact wading through a swamp of boozy confusion he tried to recall how much he had invested five hundred guilders seven hundred not enough to ruin a man who stood as he had at the time but well enough that he could not count the loss insignificant particularly since he had already invested his anticipated profits what did you say miguel demanded of the speaker the indian flower he took his first look at the fellow a grizzled man well into his middle years with the blotchy face of a lifelong sailor his companions were all the rougher sort of dutchman who frequented taverns closer to the docks the indian flowers been taken by pirates the older fellow told miguel i heard they were pirates at any rate theyre all in service of the spanish crown if you ask me how do you know this miguel demanded he twisted his hands which felt awkward and spongy from too much drink but his head had already begun to clear ive got a mate on the glory of the palm the man explained which came into dock late this afternoon he told me the news this afternoon no one knew yet he might yet salvage this wreck have you a particular interest in that ship one of the mans companions spoke he was younger than the rest with less of the look of the sea suppose i have he meant no challenge the two men were testing each other i might be able to offer you my services the raggedy trader told him by this time tomorrow word will be out and those shares of yours wont be good for much more than wiping your ass but tonight they just might be worth something something other than wiping your ass one of his friends clarified what are they worth tonight miguel knew a schemer when he saw one but schemes were the blood flowing through the citys veins and only a fool would refuse to listen if you want to sell at fifty percent id be willing to unburden you miguel had no taste for losing half his investment but even less for losing all of it still something sat ill with him if the ship has been taken what good are the shares to you ill sell them of course tomorrow the exchange opens and ill unload them at seventyfive or eighty percent by the time the news hits the exchange ill be rid of them then why should i not do the same miguel asked i could have eighty percent back rather than a mere fifty you could the man said but theres always the chance that the news may beat you to the exchange besides men know you if you sell your reputation might suffer im used to plying my trade in the hague so i wont lose for my deeds here miguel put his hands to his forehead he could not entirely ignore the moral issue that presented itself if he sold his shares to this fellow he would be knowingly allowing an unknown person to buy something that was worthless did the sages not say that the man who robs his fellow of even the smallest coin is as sinful as a murderer on the other hand all investment was risk miguel did not know when he bought the shares that the ship would be taken by pirates yet it had been perhaps it had been destined to be so taken surely the most high knew of the boats fate but miguel did not believe that the holy one blessed be he had cheated him what difference did it make if someone knew beforehand the trader read miguels uncertainty you do what you like jew ill be here for another hour or so if you want to do business it had best be done quickly before miguel could respond a new voice rose up aye quick enough that this man not learn the truth the woman sounded like a heroine from a stage play there she stood hands upon her hips ample bosom thrust outward her soft features pointed defiantly at these men in her yellows and blacks she looked like a honeybee and a pretty one at that if a bit older than miguel liked his women he couldnt decide if she were more wench or virago what truth is that he asked cautiously not for the first time suspicious of these schemers against these grizzled fellows stood this handsome woman both confident and defiant miguel decided in an instant that he trusted her far more than the sailor and his friends that the ship they speak of remains unharmed she announced at least it does as best they know the men at the table exchanged glances have i met you mother the older fellow asked i think you ought to think carefully before you accuse a man in public ruining his trade and such otherwise he added with a glance to his companion he and those hes friendly with might take some offense and offer your plump bottom a spanking aye you know me my name is geertruid damhuis and you were the kindly stranger who told me of the wreck of the angels mercy a ship in which i owned shares you were good enough to take those shares off of me for half price then the ship sailed into port a few weeks later on schedule and bursting with cargo youve made a mistake the older man said at the same moment that the trader said i cannot guarantee the truth of every rumor i hear seeing that they had undone themselves the party arose in a single movement and dashed out the door should we pursue miguel asked or call the night watch geertruid damhuis shook her pretty head ill not raise my skirts to go running in the dark for a gang of ruffians who would only knock me down miguel laughed feeling a sudden rush of friendship and gratitude i thought you valiant enough just this moment she grinned wide beautiful white as pearl miguel sucked in his breath feeling as though he had caught a glimpse of something forbidden its an easy thing to be valiant when surrounded by a few dozen men who would never stand to see a woman set upon quite another to go chasing after thieves in the dark she let out a long sigh and pressed her fingers to her chest by christ i could use a drink see how i shake she held up her trembling hand while she drank geertruid explained that these men made it their business to learn the names of those who had invested in particular ships and then to track them down and tell stories so the investors might overhear from there it took only a little trickery to convince even the most skeptical man to part with his shares it is the urgency that undoes their victims geertruid told him i had to make a decision at that moment or suffer the consequences and i could not endure the thought that i might have avoided total disaster yet lacked the resolve to do so as they say the patient dog eats rabbit while the hasty dog goes hungry miguel was taken at once with geertruids easy demeanor somehow both mannish and seductive she explained that her husband who had never done her a kind turn before he died had left her comfortable and though most of her money was bound up in neat little investments she had some few guilders with which to play since that night they had made a habit of smoking and drinking together but there were many things miguel did not understand about this widow she kept much about herself quietmiguel hardly even knew the part of town she called home she would ask him to broker for her but only small quantities surely far less than she had at her disposal she would disappear for weeks at a time neither telling miguel before she departed nor explaining her absence after her return she would flirt with miguel incessantly leaning in close to speak with him showing him her deep cleavage intriguing him with talk both lascivious and vague one summer night after they had both had too much beer and were wet from an unexpected rain shower geertruid had leaned in to whisper some silly thing in his ear and he kissed her hard upon the mouth knocking his teeth into hers as he attempted to slide a hand between her breasts geertruid extricated herself from his clumsy grip and made some little quip but it was clear that miguel had crossed a line she would not have him cross again the next time she saw miguel she handed him a tiny volume as a present t amsterdamsch hoerdom a guide to the whores and bawdy houses of the city miguel had thanked her with good cheer but in truth had felt a humiliation greater than that of his bankruptcy and he vowed never again to fall victim to her amorous nonsense and then there was the matter of hendrick a man some fifteen years her junior geertruid kept him at her feet almost all the time he would sit sometimes apart from her at taverns while she chatted with men of business but he always kept one eye upon her like a halfsleeping hound was he her lover her servant or something else miguel could not quite fathom she would never say eluding his questions with graceful ease so that miguel had long since ceased to ask them often when they met hendrick would slink off glowering at miguel for a moment before he took himself to wherever such a man might go yet he never quite acted with resentment he called miguel jew man as though to do so were the height of wit or a sign of their private friendship he would clap miguel on the back always just hard enough to seem something other than amicable but when the three of them sat together if miguel grew quiet or preoccupied with his troubles it was always hendrick who tried to draw him out hendrick who would burst into a bawdy song or tell some ribald tale often at his own expense such as the time he nearly drowned in a trough of horse dung if such a thing had happened to miguel he was sure hed never recount the tale not even to bring cheer to the messiah miguel resented geertruids refusal to talk about her companionship with hendrick but he understood her to be a woman well able to keep a secret and that was a quality not to be underestimated she knew their friendship could cause miguel problems with the maamad and so rarely showed herself at taverns where jews congregatedor if she did have business there she pretended not to know miguel certainly he had been seen speaking to her a little intimately once or twice but that was the very beauty of her being a womanshe was invisible to the men of the nation if they saw her at all they saw her as miguels whore he had even been teased once or twice for liking his dutchwomen overripe miguel arrived at the dam a quarter of an hour before noon when the exchange gates would open already the din of trade had begun to echo off the walls of the surrounding buildings the burgomasters had limited the hours of trade from noon until two because the guilds complained that the din of commerce disturbed all manner of business across the city miguel thought the charges absurd the sound of trade was a monetary aphrodisiac it drove men to empty their purses if the hours of trade were twice as long each day the city would be twice as rich miguel loved the excitement that spread across the plaza in the moments before the exchange gates opened the conversation quieted to a hum dozens of men looked like racers awaiting the signal to begin their sprint all along the dam peddlers hawked bread and pies and trinkets in the shadow of the great wonders of the plaza the monuments of dutch grandeur the massive and imposing town hall which stood like a civic cathedral the nieuwe kerk and the exchange and puny by comparison the weigh house along the damrak fishmongers shouted their wares in the busy market and whores cast their lines for amorous investors moneylenders operating outside the law looked for the eager and desperate fruit and vegetable sellers wheeled their pushcarts through the maze of merchants eager to spend newly got money on anything polished or juicy or bright with color tradesmen joked amiably with fatpursed merchants and women attempted to shock men into purchases with talk so bawdy that even miguel blushed to hear it among the brokers and speculators black suits such as miguel always wore remained the height of dutch fashion here was perhaps the height of the austere influence of the calvinist divines the preachers of the reformed church ruled that gaudy fashions and bright colors only indulged vanity and thus the men of amsterdam dressed in modest black but spiced their dark ensembles with fine cloth expensive lace silk collars and costly hats the sea of black occasionally sparkled with an iberian jew in red or blue or yellow or perhaps a defiant dutch catholic who dressed in what colors he liked in other lands the locals would gawk at foreign dress but there were so many aliens in the city that strange clothes were admired more often than ridiculed miguel believed the dutch the most curious of all racesthe perfect blend of protestant faith and business ambition as miguel gazed out at the crowd he noticed a desperatelooking fellow moving directly toward him he thought the man might be a petty tradesman perhaps in the midst of a dispute with a customer but as he stepped aside the ruffian continued to fix his gaze on miguel the fellow stopped and flashed a mouth full of wretched teeth you dont know me lienzo the sound of the voice steadied him miguel saw that he did indeed know the man joachim waagenaar joachim who had once dressed like a gentleman in velvet suits and fine lace now wore the closefitting leather cap of a farmer a stained doublet of rough cloth and torn baggy breeches once a man to wear perfume and trim his mustache just so joachim now smelled of piss and sweat like a beggar joachim he said after a moment i didnt recall you at first i suppose not he unfurled another strained grimace hed always had unhealthy teeth but several that had been broken before were now gone and along the bottom they were all cracked and had the rough edges of gravel times havent gone well with me i was sorry to hear of your losses miguel answered speaking so quickly that his dutch sounded garbled even to his own ears i lost greatly too he added hastily in answer to unspoken charges he had after all urged joachim to put his fortune in miguels failing sugar futures believing that if he found enough investors he could keep the price of sugar buoyant but these efforts were like sandbags set against the force of a flood and the price had tumbled all the same joachim had not lost nearly as much as miguel but his fortune had been much smaller so he had fallen fast and hard those are fine clothes you have upon your back joachim looked him up and down and ran a hand along his own face which was rough with a beard that grew in a great diversity of lengths as though he had taken to shaving by hacking at himself with a dull blade they did not take your clothes he said they took my clothes they forced me to sell them who might they becreditors pawnbrokers miguel had been abducted and taken to taverns where he was held prisoner until he agreed to pay bills he had suffered the humiliation of having his hat knocked into the mud by a particularly angry wine merchant he had been threatened and insulted and angered beyond all reason but hed never been made to sell his clothes who could say what might happen to an odd fellow like joachim the son of a fishmonger who had profited in the tulipomania thirty years before joachim had come of age believing that only fools labored for their money when they might buy and sell for it instead even so he seemed to know nothing of the exchange but which taverns were closest and he always depended on brokers to do his thinking but for a man who was little more than a drunk with money he was remarkably anxious about holdings and hed always fretted over a stuiver lost here and there suspicious of the very means by which he chose to make his money the business of the exchange is like the weather miguel had told him once you might see signs of rain but then nature delivers sunshine but what has happened to my guilders joachim had asked him after losing a trifling fifty guilders in an east india deal that had not gone quite as miguel had expected miguel forced a laugh where is the wind after it blows on your face he almost added that any man who wonders such things should remove his money from the exchange and return to selling joachim seemed to miguel illsuited for this new species of investment but miguel did not have so many clients that he could afford to send one away joachim now stood there panting like a dog letting his breath blow in miguels face in the distance the gates to the exchange opened and the traders began to file inside some of the more eager men shoving like unruly boys although everyone had his own affairs to tend to miguel worried that someone might see him with this wretch the burghers of amsterdam had forbidden jewish traders to broker for gentiles and though the maamad claimed to punish this crime with excommunication miguel believed it to be the second most violated law in the city just after the law prohibiting brokers to trade for their own profit as well as their clients nevertheless a man in miguels situation had to fear being prosecuted for crimes that others could perpetrate with impunity this conversation with joachim would have to end quickly i am sorry things have gone hard with you but i havent the time to speak of it now miguel took a tentative step back joachim nodded and stepped closer forward i would like to do a little business with you to make up for what ive lost perhaps as you say everything was unintentional miguel could not think quite how to respond perhaps everything was unintentional did this man have the audacity to accuse miguel of deceiving him of having set some sort of trap as though miguels losses in sugar had been some ruse to get joachims five hundred guilders not a day goes by that a broker does not give unsound advice perhaps ruining those he aims to serve those who cannot live with risk have no business in trade i want what you owe me joachim insisted at once miguel recognized joachims ragged voice he could see it transposed in his mind into an awkward hand scratchy and uneven youve been sending me those notes i want my money joachim affirmed i want you to help me get back my money its no less than what you owe me with no more room in his life for debt miguel disliked this talk of what he owed hed made an error in judgment nothing more they had both suffered it should end there what manner of business is this when you send such notes what am i to make of your strange communications joachim said nothing he looked at miguel the way a dog looks at a man who lectures it miguel tried once more we will talk about this when i am at leisure he told joachim looking about nervously for signs of maamad spies i understand that you are a busy man joachim spread his hands wide i as you can see havent many demands on my time miguel cast a glance at the exchange every minute here could mean lost money what if even now the man on whom he could unload his brandy futures at perhaps not too significant a loss was buying those shares from someone else but i have he said to joachim well talk later he took another exploratory step backwards when it came out hard a command more than a question the word had a power to it as though he had shouted stop joachims face had changed too he now gazed at miguel sternly like a magistrate issuing a decree in the butcher stalls several people halted in their steps and looked over miguels heart began to thump a panicky beat joachim moved along with him in the direction of the dam how will you contact me when you dont know how to find me very true miguel agreed with a foolish laugh how thoughtless of me well speak on monday after the close of the exchange at the singing carp it was a little outoftheway tavern that miguel visited when in need of a quiet spot for drink and contemplation good good joachim nodded eagerly i see it will all be made right whats done can surely be undone so now well shake on it like men of business but miguel was not about to touch joachims flesh if he could help it so he hurried away pretending he had not heard after pressing into the crowd outside the exchange he risked a look behind him and saw no sign of joachim so he took a moment of rest before entering merchants filed past him many shouting a greeting as they headed through the gates miguel straightened his hat caught his breath and muttered in hebrew the prayer said upon receiving ill news he should have known better than to stand still in the exchange for the moment miguel stopped moving he found himself descended upon by a dozen traders of the lowest sort each out to test the limits of his indebtedness senhor lienzo a man he hardly knew stood inches away nearly shouting lets take a moment to talk of a shipment of copper from denmark another edged the first aside good senhor you are the only one i would tell this to but i have reason to believe that the price of cinnamon will shift dramatically in the next few days but will it go up or down come with me to learn more a young trader in portuguese attire probably not even twenty years of age tried to pull him from the crowd i want to tell you how the syrup market has expanded these past three months after the unnerving encounter with joachim miguel was in no mood for these scavengers they were of all nations the fellowship of desperation requiring no single language or place of origin only a willingness to survive by leaping from one precipice to the next miguel was attempting to force his way past when he saw his brother approach the parnass solomon parido by his side he hated for daniel and parido to see him in such low company but he could hardly run off now that he had been spotted it is all posture he told himself gentlemen gentlemen he told his gathering of unfortunates i think you mistake me for a man who might have interest in doing business with you good day he pushed off and nearly collided with his brother who now stood inches away ive been looking for you said daniel who since the sugar collapse had rarely so much as glanced at miguel during exchange hours now he stood close leaning in to avoid having to shout above the clamor of trade i did not however expect to see you dealing with miserable men such as these what is it you gentlemen wish he asked directing his attention in particular to parido who had thus far remained silent the parnass had developed a habit of turning up far too frequently for miguels taste parido bowed to miguel your brother and i have been discussing your affairs the holy one has truly blessed me that two such great men take the time to discuss my dealings miguel said parido blinked your brother mentioned that you were having difficulties he ventured a half smile but he looked no less sour for it miguel looked at him icily not quite sure how to respond if that fool brother of his had been talking about coffee again he would strangle him in the middle of the exchange i think he said that my brother is not so well informed of my business as he would like to believe i know youre still receiving letters from that heretic alferonda daniel said blithely as though unaware that he revealed information that could put miguel under the cherem parido shook his head your correspondence is of no interest to me and i think your brother in his eagerness to help you speaks of family matters best kept private we are in agreement there miguel said cautiously what did this new generosity mean it was true that paridos anger seemed to have abated somewhat since miguel lost money in the sugar collapse he no longer approached merchantseven while miguel stood there speaking to themto advise them to pursue their affairs with a more honest broker he no longer left a room simply because miguel entered it he no longer refused to speak to miguel when daniel invited the parnass to dinner even after miguels losses however parido would find ways to inflict injury he would stand with his friends and openly mock miguel from across the dam pointing and smirking as though they were schoolboys now he wished to be friends miguel did not bother to conceal his doubt but parido only shrugged i think youll find my actions more convincing than any suspicions take a walk with me miguel there was nothing to do but agree miguels difficulties with the parnass had begun because he had followed daniels advice to take paridos only daughter antonia as his wife at that time nearly two years before miguel had been a successful trader and it had seemed both a good match and a way of solidifying his familys standing in amsterdam already married himself daniel could not make himself part of paridos family but miguel could he had gone too long without remarrying the wives of the vlooyenburg said and he grew weary of matchmakers hounding him besides antonia came with a handsome portion and with paridos business connections he had no reason to dislike antonia but neither did she appeal to him she was a handsome woman but he did not find being with her a handsome experience miguel had seen a picture of her before they met and he had been most pleased by the miniature portrait but though it was a good likeness the painter had rendered her features far more animated than nature had done herself miguel would sit in paridos front room taking stabs at conversation with a girl who would not meet his eye asked no questions not directly related to the food or drink set out by the servants and could answer no questions with words other than yes senhor or no senhor miguel soon became intrigued by the idea of teasing her and began asking her questions touching on theology philosophy and the political skullduggery of the vlooyenburg such inquiries produced the far more entertaining i could not say senhor he knew he ought not to take such pleasure in torturing his future wife but there was little else of interest to do with her what it would be like to be married to so dull a woman surely he could mold her more to his liking he could teach her to speak her mind to have opinions possibly even to read and in the end a wife was merely someone to produce sons and keep an orderly house an alliance with his brothers patron would be good for his own business and if she was good for nothing more there were whores enough in amsterdam so possessed of every intention of following through on his promise miguel had been discovered by antonia in her maids roomhe with his breeches down she with skirts lifted the shock of walking into the room and facing miguels bare ass aimed in her direction had proved overwhelming and she had let off a shriek before fainting and knocking her head against the door on her way down the planned marriage between the two was certainly ruined but disgrace could have been avoided and miguel considered it entirely paridos fault that the incident had turned to scandal miguel wrote him a long letter begging forgiveness for having abused his hospitality and unwittingly bringing embarrassment upon him i cannot ask you to think no more of these events or to put them from your mind i can only ask that you believe i never wished to see either you or your daughter harmed and i hope the day may come that will provide me with an opportunity to demonstrate the extent of both my respect and my remorse parido had sent back only a few harsh lines make no effort to contact me again i care nothing for what you imagine as respect or how you scheme to frame your meager remorse you and i must be now opposed in all things the letter did not mark the end of the conflict much to the delight of the gossiping wives of the vlooyenburg the maid it was soon discovered was with child and parido publicly insisted that miguel provide for the bastard once born with popular sentiment on paridos side for he had kept his breeches on through the whole affair miguel endured a week in which old women hooted at him and spat in his direction and children tossed rotten eggs at his head but miguel would not accept these accusations experience had taught him a thing or two about reproductive rhythms and he knew the child could not be his he refused to pay with a mind set to vengeance rather than justice parido insisted that miguel be brought before the maamad to which parido had not yet been elected the council was well used to these paternity disputes and its investigators revealed the father to be parido himself finding himself publicly humiliated he retired to private life for a month waiting for some new scandal to entertain the neighborhood during that month believing that antonia could never find a husband in a city that knew she had seen miguel lienzo with no breeches he sent his daughter to marry his sisters son a merchant of moderate standing in salonika the world knew the storythat miguel was to have married antonia parido that the engagement had fallen into ruin and that parido had made accusations that had come back to haunt him there was something that the world did not know miguel had been unwilling to sit idly by while the maamad decided the case for parido was a powerful man destined for the council and miguel was but an upstart trader so he had gone to see the little doxy and conducted his own inquiry after miguel had prodded her for some time she finally admitted that she could not name the childs father she could not name him because there was no child she only claimed that one grew in her belly because she wanted something for her trouble being cast out on the street as she was miguel might have tried to convince her to tell the truth and in doing so perhaps restore himself somewhat in paridos eyes but parido might also have spat upon that gesture instead miguel explained to the girl that if she convinced the maamad investigators that the child was paridos she would profit most handsomely for her trouble parido in the end gave the girl a hundred guilders and sent her on her way miguel could once more walk the streets of the vlooyenburg without fear of assault from grandmothers and children however a new disquiet had taken the place of the old if parido were ever to learn of miguels treachery he would show no mercy the great openair exchange spread out before them in structure no different from every other bourse in every trading center in europe amsterdam s exchange was an enormous rectangle three massive redbrick stories in height with an overhang along the inner perimeter the center remained exposed to the elements such as the misting rain that now fell so light as to be indistinguishable from fog along the interior and beneath the overhang supported by thick and magnificent columns scores of men gathered to shout at one another in dutch or portuguese or latin or a dozen other tongues of europe and beyond to buy and sell to trade rumors and to attempt to predict the future each section of the exchange had by tradition its own designated business along the walls men traded in jewels real estate woolens whale oil tobacco a merchant could converse with dealers in goods of the east indies the west indies the baltic or the levant in the less prestigious roofless center gathered the wine merchants paint and drug sellers traders with england and toward the far south end dealers in brandy and the sugar trade miguel regularly saw spaniards and germans and frenchmen less frequently he might encounter turks and even east indians it was something of a mystery why this city should have emerged in the last fifty years as the center of the worlds trade attracting merchants from every land of importance it should hardly have been a city at all the locals liked to say that god created the world but the dutch made amsterdam carved out of swamp plagued with a port only the most skillful pilot could navigate and then only with luck on his side lacking any native wealth except for cheese and butter amsterdam rose to its place of greatness because of the sheer determination of its citizens parido walked silently for only a few moments but miguel could not shake the feeling that the parnass derived some pleasure from withholding his business i know your debts weigh heavily on you parido began at last and i know youve been trading in brandy futures youve gambled that the prices will rise by closing two days hence however they will surely remain as low as they are now if i calculate correctly you stand to lose close to fifteen hundred guilders this was about brandy not coffee thank the most high but what did parido know about itor care for that matter it is closer to a thousand he said hoping to keep his tone even i see youre well informed of my business the exchange is little able to hide secrets from the man who wishes to learn them miguel let out a barking laugh and why should you wish to know my secrets senhor as i said i want to make things more comfortable between us and if you are to trust me to believe that i will not use my influence as a parnass against you you must see me act in your benefit now as to the problem at hand i may know a buyer a frenchman who will relieve you of your futures the irritation dropped away here was just the sort of lucky turn for which miguel had hardly dared to hope based on rumors of an impending shortage received from a very reliable source he had bought the brandy futures at a percent margin paying only percent of the value of the total quantity up front and then either losing or gaining as though he had invested the entire sum come reckoning day if brandy increased in value he would profit as though he had gambled on a much larger amount but if brandy lost value as now appeared inevitable he would owe far more than he had already invested an eager buyer was just what he needed a gift from the heavens to be rid of this new debt would surely be a sign that the tide of his misfortune had turned could he really believe that his enemy had out of the goodness of his heart decided to present the solution to miguels most urgent problem where could he produce a buyer for these futures futures that the world knew would only bring debt to their owner i cannot imagine that any man french or otherwise would be mad enough to buy my brandy holdings when the market has turned against them the value of brandy wont much change in the few days between now and the monthly reckoning unless miguel thought a trading combination plotted to manipulate the price more than once miguel had lost when he thought he saw a new trend in prices and only later learned that he had become the victim of a combinations plot the price may change and it may not parido shrugged it should be enough that he is willing to buy something of which youd like to be rid before he could respond to the proposal miguel heard his name called out and saw it was a boy with bright orange hair and blotchy skin the unsightly fellow waved a letter and shouted the name lienzo again in a voice more loud than shrill miguel called him over and offered him a coin for the letter he recognized the hand at once as geertruids he took a step backwards before tearing it open senhor i hope all fares well with you on the exchange but any profits you might make for yourself are but a mere shadow of the wealth that the fruit of the coffee tree can offer you while you attend to your daily business let the spirit of this marvelous berry animate your mind and increase your profits i write these words only in the capacity of one who is your friend geertruid damhuis parido smiled thinly it looked to me like a womans hand i hope you arent allowing yourself to be distracted by intrigues during hours meant for business youre an amorous fellow but these gates open only two hours each day miguel returned the false smile theres no intrigue here it is nothing of consequence parido scratched at his nose then lets do something that is of consequence well find this merchant i know and see if we cant set things right they forced their way to the south end of the exchange where brandy changed hands some traders came to fill orders or to sell what their ships brought into port but increasingly men bought calls and puts and futures trading in goods they never sought to own and would never see it was the new way of doing things turning the exchange into a great gaming pit where outcome was determined not by chance but by the needs of the markets around the world in his earlier days miguel had believed he possessed an uncanny ability to predict those needs he had enjoyed connections among the most influential west indian merchants and had been able to acquire sugar at excellent prices and then sell at superior ones the redbrick warehouses of the brouwersgracht had been bursting with his acquisitions and all of the exchange knew miguel as the man to see for sugar but then fortune had taken miguel by surprise and now all that sugar was washed away toward the corner where men bought and sold brandy parido introduced miguel to a stunted little frenchmanno taller than a childwith a sad fleshy face and a nose like a walnut he wore a high ruffled collar such as had been popular fifty years earlier and his reddish coat had turned almost brown with amsterdam mud never judge worthiness by the clothes parido whispered assuming his role of the great sage of the exchange fools may be tricked by baubles and bright colors but who does not know that a chicken makes better eating than a robin this frenchman whom miguel would have taken for a hardpressed fellow of the middling ranks croaked out in his clumsy accent an interest in doing business he thrust forth his hands in miguels direction you are the man with the brandy futures to sell he said in halting dutch id like to talk about these holdings but do not think to be grasping with me monsieur or you will find you have no sale at all i always conduct business like a man of honor miguel assured him his heart knocked in his chest as he explained to the frenchman that he was in possession of futures for hogsheads of brandy he kept his voice free of inflection not wanting to urge his holdings on the merchant the situation called for a lighter touch thats what you have the frenchman shouted as though miguel had just tipped his hand ha not so much as i thought nor nearly so good neither but it is worth a little something to me six hundred guilders is more than you can expect but i shall pay it that is an absurd offer miguel replied and indeed it was though not for the reasons he wished to imply the frenchman must be mad to enter into a deal almost guaranteed to lose money either that or he knew a great secret from which miguel might profit still miguel had invested just over five hundred guilders so the offer could not be dismissed idly it would mean a slight profit rather than a significant loss ill not part with them for less than six fifty he said then youll not part with them at all i have no time for your dutch haggling back and forth this way and that way well make this trade or ill find another man and offer him the same and he will be more grateful than you miguel smiled by way of excusing himself and led parido a few feet away needless to say you will take his offer parido announced here was the worm dangling so deliciously and miguel was the fish he might well get the worm but did he want a hook through his cheek for the trouble im skeptical miguel said rolling his thumb and index finger together as though feeling the air for something suspicious why should he want these futures so badly it might be wiser to hold them myself so i can profit from whatever it is he knows profits on the exchange are the treasures of goblins changing from coal to diamond and back to coal once more you must take your profits where you can find them i prefer a bolder approach miguel said dryly there are times for boldness and times for prudence think a moment what do we know of this frenchman he may want those futures for a scheme of his own that cant possibly benefit you he may only wish to thwart an enemy by hoarding what another fellow seeks he may be mad he may know the price will triple in value you cannot tell you can only know that if you sell now you will have saved yourself a debt and even earned a little profit that is how a fortune is madein small pieces and with great caution miguel turned away few men were as well connected on the exchange as parido and if he had decided that he wished to end his animosities with miguel this transaction could be the first step in a friendship that would help extricate him from debt would parido attempt to worsen miguels affairs in full view of the world still parido had been sour for nearly two years and miguel sensed something sinister in this new altruism his instincts told him to reject the offer to hang on to these futures and see what the market offered him but dare he follow his instincts the thrill of being rid of the cursed futures was tempting he could end this month with a profit next month he could trade in whale oilanother guaranteed gainand begin his coffee venture he might at this moment be staring at a turning point in his fortune faced with a grave decision one on which his future might well depend he asked himself what had become the only question that came to mind in these circumstances what route would charming pieter take would he defy parido and follow his instincts or would he surrender his will to the man who had once been his enemy but now protested friendship pieter miguel knew never foreclosed an opportunity and it was better to make a man who intended trickery believe he had succeeded than to expose him to his face pieter would follow paridos advice ill make the trade miguel said at last that is the only thing to do perhaps it was miguel should have been euphoric perhaps he would be in a few hours when the inexpressible relief of being rid of those poisonous shares finally seemed real he said a prayer of thanks but even as he recognized his luck he could not quite shake the bitter taste from his mouth he had liberated himself from these difficulties only with the help of a man who two weeks before would have gladly sewn him in a sack and tossed him into the amstel it might be as parido saidhe wished only to mend their riftso miguel turned to the parnass and bowed in thanks but his face was dark parido could not mistake its meaning if this turned out to be a trick miguel would have his revenge from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda it will be hard to explain to my christian readers precisely what the cherem excommunication can mean to a portuguese jew to those of us who had lived under the thumb of the inquisition or in lands such as england where our religion was outlawed or in places such as the cities of the turks where it was barely tolerated to dwell in amsterdam seemed a small taste of the world to come we were free to congregate and observe our holidays and our rituals to study our texts in the light of day for us who belonged to a small nation cursed with having no land to call our own the simple freedom to live as we chose was a kind of bliss for which i never not for a single day i lived with my brothers in amsterdam forgot to give my thanks to god of course there were those cast forth from the community who cared not at all some were happy to leave what they saw as an overly scrupulous and demanding way of life they would look at our christian neighbors who ate or drank what they liked for whom the sabbath even their sabbath was but another day and they would see those freedoms as a release yet most of us knew who we were we were jews and the power of the maamad to take away a mans identity his sense of self and belonging was truly terrifying solomon parido did all he could to make me an outcast but in truth i might have gone far away and changed my name no one would have known i was alonzo alferonda of amsterdam i knew deception the way other men knew their names and such was my plan i would do it but not quite yet i had plans for parido and i would not leave until i had seen them through hannah believed she knew what coffee was but she had no guess as to why daniel would want to keep miguel from trading in it or why miguel would think anyone would want to buy the stuff miguel and daniel had talked suspiciously about coffee and there in miguels cellar she found a sack of curiously pungent berries the color of dead leaves she put one in her mouth it was hard and bitter but she chewed it anyway despite the vague ache in her teeth why she wondered would anyone care about so foul a substance she supposed she probably ought not to be rummaging around in miguels things but it wasnt as though she would let her husband know what she found in any case miguel never told her anything about his life and how else would she learn if she didnt pursue these things herself only through her own guile had she learned about his debts and his troubles with parido and the strange threatening notes hed been receiving annetje whom hannah sometimes sent to follow miguel at a distance told her he maintained a curious friendship with a pretty dutch widow one time annetje had even led hannah to peer through the window of a tavern and shed seen the woman for herself proud and convinced of her own importance what had this woman ever done that was so significant other than marry a man with money and then outlive him another time when the two of them had clearly been drinking he brought the widow home believing that she and daniel were off eating with one of his business associates the widow had stared at her until hannah blushed and she and miguel hurried outside erupting in childish laughter hannah thought that if miguel wanted to be friends with a woman surely he ought to choose one far less silly one who lived in the same house she opened the bag of coffee again and took out a handful of the berries letting them run through her fingers maybe she should eat more of them develop a taste for their bitterness when miguel someday suggested that she eat coffee she could laugh and say oh coffee how delightful and toss a handful in her mouth as though she had been eating bitter fruit all her lifewhich after all she had she carefully picked out another berry and crushed it with her back teeth it would take some time before she could find it delightful still there was something pleasant about it by the time shed eaten her third berry shed come to like the way the bits of coffee shards shattered in her mouth the flavor seemed to her less bitter even slightly satisfying sneaking through miguels things and eating his secret berries left her feeling guilty which was probably why annetje caught her by surprise when she went back upstairs the girl slyly raised her narrow eyebrows its almost time to go senhora she said hannah had been hoping shed forgotten why should the girl even care if they went or not well hannah knew why it made annetje feel powerful it gave her something to hold over hannah to get from her another few guilders when she wanted them to get hannah to look the other way when she found annetje frittering away her time with some dutch fellow instead of tending to her chores there was a place in their own neighborhood but hannah had never dared to visit it not with the thick crowds that gathered on the breestraat and wide walkway on their side of the verversgracht when they went they went instead down near the docks just off the warmoesstraat trekking circuitously through crooked streets and over steep bridges only when they were far from the vlooyenburg a good distance past the dam walking along the crumbling narrow alleyways of the oldest part of the city did hannah pause to remove her veil and scarf terrified as she did so of the maamad spies who were known to lurk everywhere covering herself had been one of the most odious adjustments to life in amsterdam in lisbon her face and her hair had been no more private than her outer coat but when theyd moved to this city daniel had told her no man but he could ever see her hair again and she must cover her face when in public she later learned that nothing in jewish law demanded that women hide their faces the custom had come from the jews of north africa and it had been adopted here hannah surreptitiously ate a few of the coffee beans on the way slipping them into her mouth as annetje forged ahead by the time shed eaten more than a dozen shed come to find them pleasant almost reassuring and she regretted that with each berry she ate there was one less in her little stash when they were near annetje helped her place a simple white cap upon her head and in an instant she could hardly be distinguished from any dutchwoman with her face and hair exposed hannah now walked to the open street emerging on the oudezijds voorburgwal the canal named for the old city wall and there it stood several houses had been combined to make a space that was handsome if paltry by lisbon standards and though the street was not far from some of the most dangerous parts of amsterdam here all seemed quiet and contained great oaks lined the canal on either side and men and women walked along in their sunday finery a small cluster of gentlemen had gathered in their bright suits of blues and reds and yellows unencumbered as they were by the reformed churchs dislike of gaudy colors their wives wore jeweled gowns with shimmering silk bodices and sparkling caps they talked loudly laughed and pressed hands to shoulders still following annetje hannah climbed to the fourth floor a single room hollowed out and turned into a holy place the large windows let in the soft cloudfiltered light but the church was made brighter by the countless smokeless candles flickering on the chandeliers she glanced at the paintings christ upon the cross saint veronica with the burial shroud saint john in the wilderness once theyd given her some comfort made her feel as though she recognized herself but increasingly they had begun to make her uneasy as if saints were annetjes conspirators winking and smirking as the two women passed the burgomasters had not ruled catholic worship illegal in amsterdam but it was condoned only if conducted privately and churches must be unrecognizable as such from the outside inside they could be as opulent as the catholics liked and the wealthy merchants of the catholic community had been generous with their donations the church served as a sanctuary as well though catholic worship enjoyed legal protection papists were not well loved by the populace the memory of spanish oppression running deep as it did hannah had once seen father hans of this church hounded through the streets by a pack of dungthrowing children hannah found a seat on the first level for the church was not crowded today and began to relax a little she liked the familiar sounds of the organ and she allowed herself the luxury of letting her mind wander she thought about her childa daughter she decided shed had a dream the night before that the child was a beautiful girl most dreams were only silly illusions but this one had the firm substance of prophecy what a blessing a girl child would be she wrapped herself in the thought until she could almost feel the baby in her arms but when the priest began to intone his prayers her fantasy shattered perhaps it had been wrong to seek comfort in the old religion but annetje had sweetly convinced her to go onceand after that she had no more choice in the matter besides all those men who had kept the truth from her or given her sad half versions of it had no right to pull her this way and that how could she decide for herself if she wanted to be jew or no she could not choose her religion any more than she could choose her own face or disposition as she sat there only half listening to the prayers echoing through the chamber hannah felt her irritation with daniel gathering force who was he to tell her that she had to worship in a new way and then not tell her anything about the new way ought she not to complain of this injustice other women spoke their minds to their husbandsshe could hardly step out on the streets without seeing a dutch wife scolding her man for drunkenness or sloth it was wrong she determined fiercely she surprised herself by slapping a hand against her thigh after the service the maid chatted amiably as they walked down the stairs but hannah was in no mood for idle talk she wanted to get out to go home to go somewhere she ought to enjoy annetjes easy mood she told herself the girl made herself most companionable when she had her own way and she was so delighted with having taken hannah to church that she would now be at her most agreeable but why hannah asked herself as she slipped a coffee berry into her mouth should she require the agreeableness of her maid this was one injustice she ought not to tolerate she could hardly rebel against her husband but her maid was another matter these threats to report her worship to daniel were nonsense why would daniel believe the girl he thought no more of her than of a dog they emerged from the church and walked along the oudezijds voorburgwal with the other worshipers hannah allowed herself to enjoy the anonymity of the crowd for a few sweet moments before deciding that the time for playing at freedom had ended my veil and scarf please she said to the maid she spoke faster than she had intended so the words sounded like an order she took several more steps before she realized that annetje had stopped and stood behind her grinning come quickly hannah said someone might see me a woman shouldnt have to hide herself from the world annetje told her taking a step forward not when she is as pretty as you come well take a stroll i dont want to take a stroll sharp words began to well up inside her and she was in no mood to restrain them the girl loved to tease to take liberties to push the limits of her power but that was because hannah always let her win what would happen if hannah refused to let her order everything as she liked give them to me she demanded dont be a prude i think we should show the world your great beauties my beauties hannah said are none of the worlds business give me my things annetje took a step back she reddened and for a moment hannah feared she would grow angry instead she burst into a shrill laugh come and get them then and she lifted her skirts just a bit and ran out of stoofsteeg the way they had come hannah remained motionless too stunned to move out of the alleyway the girl turned right and disappeared and here was hannah across town from the vlooyenburg alone and unescorted with no covering for her head and face what could she say to daniel that she had been attacked that some ruffian had stolen her veil and scarf and sent her on her way maybe the girl only made sport she would be waiting just outside the alleyway on koestraat that impish grin on her face should she run and give annetje the satisfaction of showing terror or should she stroll slowly and preserve the illusion of dignity she walked but she walked quickly outside the alley crowds of handsome men and women strolled along a group of children loudly played a game with a ball and some ragtag jugglers performed for spare stuivers along the canal side but no annetje then she heard the maids voice her laughter across the canal and moving away from her toward the zeedijk she waved the scarf in the air as though it were a flag of victory then she began to run again hannah lifted her skirts and ran after her she hardly ever had cause to exert herself in this way and her lungs began to ache after only a few steps up the steep canal bridge men paused to stare at her children to call her names she did not understand annetje slowed her pace to let hannah gain ground and then began to run south on the zeedijk what did she mean by running toward the nieuwmarkt in that part of the city they would be attacked for certain but an attack could be hannahs salvation she envisioned herself returning home bloodied and bruised to be cared for rather than condemned so she followed the maid who ran and ran and ran and then stopped hannah stopped too and turned around to observe annetje coming toward her and then she turned to face the weigh house at the north end of the nieuwmarkt it marked the divide between the clean and the unclean the foul and the fair it was no place for the wife of a jewish merchant seeing that her mistress had stopped running annetje laughed loudly and ran back the way she had come hannah thought the clouds had begun to empty themselves of a hot rain but then realized they were tears moistening her face and cursed herself for being so weak it took a moment for her to recognize that these werent tears of fear or sadness but of rage run she thought as she watched the little bitch scurry off you had better run because if i catch you ill strangle you for an instant she forgot where she was so clear was the image in her mind of wrapping her hands around annetjes slender neck when she snapped out of her reverie she realized that a face had caught her eye over by the weigh house was a woman in a red and black dress cut low to expose her ample bosom a pert little red cap sat aside her head showing off to the world the generous pile of nutbrown hair she stood conversing with a pair of men they looked most serious but not the woman no the woman hardly knew seriousness hannah looked too long and too hard and somehow the woman felt her gaze and returned it and in an instant hannah knew it was miguels friend the widow the woman glanced over and her pretty gaze locked with hannahs and recognition washed over the widows face and the widow recognized more than her face she knew with an understanding beyond words that hannah was on a secret errandand hannah though she could not say how understood that the widow was on a secret errand of her own the widow smiled at hannah and then raised a finger to her red lips in a gesture of silence absolute and unambiguous hannah would see it again in her dreams she would see it whenever she closed her eyes it was with her when she wandered dazed as a soldier limping off the battlefield back toward the secret church where annetje returned her clothes and tried to make idle chat as though they had only been teasing each other like little girls hannah had no mind to make chatter to forgive annetjeor not to forgive her she could only think of that finger to those lips it would be some days before hannah was to learn whether this gesture had been a command or a promise on monday the exchange opened once more and miguel approached the dam with an excitement fueled partly by an eagerness to see how his affairs closed and partly by the three bowls of coffee hed taken that morning he deserved a reward for having freed himself of the brandy futures and hed been unable to resist any longer the seductive odor that had begun to permeate his chamber that morning hed slipped off to the kitchen for a mortar and pestle back in the cellar hed removed the bag which seemed not so full as he recollected no matter he told himself and ground the coffee into a coarse grain and mixed it with some sweet wine stirring constantly hoping to see the grains dissolve he then recalled that this was not sugar or salt so he let the grounds sink to the bottom and drank deep it was not as good as what he had taken with geertruid or even what hed tasted at the turkish tavern but he nevertheless liked the way the bitterness and the sweetness played off each other he took a sip and savored how the coffee washed into his mouth like a kiss he sniffed at the bowl and looked at it in the light of the oil lamp and before he finished he knew he would make another helping as he poured the coffee he nearly laughed aloud he had made himself one bowl only one bowl and he had done it badlythis much he knew because he had tasted betterand he still could not resist the urge to drink another geertruid had been right she had latched onto something that would bring them wealth if only they could find a way to act quickly and decisively but how how how how miguel grew so agitated he kicked one of his shoes across the cellar and watched it fall to the floor with a satisfying thud coffee he muttered to himself but drinking it would have to be enough for this moment he still had too much to do miguel stood before the town hall that great palace of white stone built by merchant wealth not the smallest chunk of marble could be found in all the united provinces yet the interior was lined with marble countless tons of the stuffmarble and gold and silver everywhere the finest paintings upon the walls the finest rugs upon the floor exquisite woodwork and tiling miguel had once taken pleasure in strolling about the town hall with its bank and courts and prisons exploring the public spaces dreaming of the opulence hidden in the private chambers of the burghers since he had learned firsthand what secrets lie in the private chambers of the bankruptcy office the town hall had lost its charms miguel looked up and saw a shadow directly in his path a few quick blinks of the eyes and the figure came into focus short rounded with long hair and a neat beard he was dressed in a suit of bright blue the color of the sky and he had an enormous widebrimmed hat to match pulled to just above his heavylidded eyes alonzo alferonda lienzo he shouted as though they met only by happenstance wrapping one arm around miguels shoulder he continued to walk dragging miguel with him by christ are you mad to approach me in this place anyone might see us together no i am not mad miguel i am your most ardent wellwisher there was no time to risk with notes and errand boys the business with parido and whale oil it is to happen today today now it was miguel who led he pulled alferonda down the narrow path behind the nieuwe kerk today he said again when they stopped in the damp darkness of the alley a rat stared at them defiantly what do you mean today why do you say today alferonda leaned forward and sniffed have you been drinking coffee never mind what ive been drinking alferonda sniffed again youve been mixing it with wine havent you you waste your berries that way mix it with sweet water what do you care if i mix it with the blood of christ tell me about whale oil the usurer let out a little laugh its certainly put the devil into you hasnt it dont give me that look ill tell you what i know my contact in the east india company a ruddy little fellow who owes me forty guildershe sent me a note this morning i dont need every detail of your discovery just speak the thing is the whale oil trade will happen today miguel felt a pain build inside his skull and burst like a muskets report today i havent yet bought my whale oil futures i was waiting for after reckoning day he spat on the ground the rottenness of it all planned as it was and now for nothingfor want of a single day i would have bought those futures tomorrow morning forget futures for a moment alferonda shook his head youve been trading so long in airy pieces of paper that you neglect simple commerce go buy whale oilnot futures but the thing itself you may recall that the rest of the world still transacts their business in that quaint manner then before the close of the exchange today you may turn around and sell what youve bought at a handsome profit its all very simple miguel let out a laugh and grabbed alferondas shoulders you are right it is simple i suppose thank you for the warning oh its nothing im always happy to lend a hand to my friends i know you are miguel said shaking his hand dutch style youre a good man alonzo the maamad knew nothing when it treated you so rottenly miguel now wished for nothing so much as to break free and get to work on the exchange geertruid was right coffee is the drink of commerce for the coffee hed swallowed that morning now combined with greed proved too powerful a pull to be ignored before you scurry off alferonda said i wish to ask you something i heard that parido helped you broker brandy futures that had been dangling around your neck like a noose yes thats so what of it what of it what of it you ask let me tell you miguel that solomon parido does not forget a grudge if he has helped you it is because he has some other scheme in mind and you would be wise to be on your guard do you imagine that such thoughts never occurred to me parido is from salonika and i am from portugal he grew up a jew i grew up pretending to be a catholic in a war of deception he can never hope to defeat me he defeated me alferonda said bitterly he may not be as sharp as we secret jews but he has the power of the maamad and that counts for a great deal before you dismiss him so lightly you had better think of the bitterness of never being able to enter a synagogue on yom kippur of never again attending a seder for passover of never again greeting the sabbath bride and what of your business dealings would you see them crushed your colleagues fear to trade with you if you plan to trade in coffee my friend you had better keep an eye on parido and make sure he doesnt sour your scheme of course youre right miguel said impatiently believe no pretended gestures of friendship alferonda urged him i understand good then i wish you luck with your venture today miguel needed no luck he had knowledge no one else possessed and he had coffee as he passed through the great arch of the exchange he closed his eyes and muttered some halfrecalled prayer in an effort to sustain his trading efforts that day the holy one blessed be he had not yet abandoned him miguel was sure of it he was almost sure of it the business with alferonda had only taken a few minutes but already the tone of the exchange had calmed since the riotous opening of the gates on reckoning days traders roamed the bourse checking how their prices stood in order to hedge their accounts against unexpected changes within the first quarter hour most had already learned what they needed to know miguel hurried to the northwest corner of the exchange and found a dutch acquaintance in the muscovy trade from whom to purchase whale oil the current price was thirtyseven and a half guilders per quarter ton and miguel bought fifty quarters at just under nineteen hundred guildersan amount he could ill afford to lose particularly since it was all debt miguel then took a turn around the exchange always keeping an eye on the clock and the far end of the plaza he did a little business buying some cheap lumber that a fellow needed to unload to raise capital and then chatted with a few friends until he noticed five blackclad dutchmen approaching the whaleoil corner they were young roundfaced and cleanshaven and had the confident expression of men who traded in large sums that were not their own they were east india company agents and they wore their affiliation like a uniform men halted their conversations to watch them all five began at once they cried out for whale oil they slapped hands in agreement and they moved on to the next deal in almost an instant miguel heard someone calling out to buy at thirtynine a quarter the cries began in dutch latin and portuguese buying one hundred quarters at forty and a half another voice returned selling at forty miguels heart pounded in the thrill of trade it was just as geertruid had saidthe coffee was like a spirit that had taken hold of his body he heard each cry with clarity he calculated each new price with instant precision nothing escaped his notice with his receipt clutched in one hand he read the mood of the crowd more clearly than he had ever done before he had seen dozens of these frenzies but never before had he felt he could see its currents in the river of exchange each price sent the current in a new direction and a man who paid close attention whose wits were sharpened with this marvelous drink could see everything unfold miguel now understood why he had failed in the past he had always thought of the future but he now understood that the future counted for nothing only this moment this instant the price would peak today in the excitement tomorrow the price would plummet now was all that mattered fortytwo guilders per quarter ton fortyfour guilders it showed no sign of slowing fortyseven always before he had wondered how to know when to make his move it took skill and luck and clairvoyance to know when prices had peaked it was better to sell just before the peak than just after for prices fell much more quickly than they rose and being off by an instant could mean the difference between profit and loss today he would know the right instant miguel stuck close watching the faces of the merchants looking for signs of panic then he noticed the five east india agents just beginning to turn away from the chaos they had created without their presence purchasing would now slow down considerably and the price would soon fall the cry went out for fifty quarter tons at fiftythree guilders each it was time to strike now the coffee screamed do it fifty quarters miguel called out loudly for fiftythree and a half guilders a fat little broker named ricardo a jew of the vlooyenburg slapped miguels hand to acknowledge the trade and it was done his heart pounded his breathing came in quick rasps as the prices fell around him fifty guilders then fortyeight fortyfive he had sold at precisely the right moment seconds later would have cost him hundreds the doubt that had been plaguing him the sluggishness the murky thinking were all gone now he had used coffee to banish them the way a great rabbi uses the torah to banish demons miguel felt as though he had just run all the way from rotterdam everything had happened so quickly it had all whirled around him in a murky coffee haze but now it was done the space of a few frantic moments had yielded a pure profit of eight hundred guilders he could barely keep himself from laughing out loud it was like waking from a nightmare when he would tell himself that the terrors of the dream world were not his he need not worry any longer this debt that tormented him might as well disappear in the wind that was how little it now mattered he hadnt planned it but miguel grabbed a young broker a fellow fresh to amsterdam from portugal he took this neophyte by the shoulders miguel lienzo has returned he shouted do you understand me hide your money in the cellar fellow its not safe on the exchangenot with miguel lienzo here to win it from you by the clock on the tower he could see that there was scant time left before the exchange closed for the day why flitter about doing little things it was time to celebrate the most wretched time of his life had just come to an end the indebted struggling lienzo was banished and a new era of prosperity was upon him he let loose a fresh burst of laughter caring nothing for how the young broker hurried away as though miguel might hurt him caring nothing for the cluster of dutchmen who now stared as though miguel were a lunatic they mattered not at all but lest he forget the author of all good fortune he called out his thanks to the holy one blessed be he for sustaining him and allowing him to reach this season and then as though in answer the idea descended upon him all at once it came with unexpected force and even at the time it seemed as though something had fallen from the heavens for he did not pull it from himself it came upon him from outside it was a gift miguel forgot about whaleoil profits he forgot about his debts and parido in a glorious instant he knew with perfect clarity how he would make his fortune from coffee the idea paralyzed him he understood that if he could truly midwife this idea into the world he would have wealth on an order of which he had only dreamed not comfort money not prosperity money opulence money he would be able to marry whomever he wished and at last fill the empty holes in his life he would be able to bring forth hebrew children and situate them as he liked they would not be merchants toiling for their bread as he had been made to do the descendants of miguel lienzo would be gentlemen rentiers anything they might choose and with the leisure to devote their lives to the study of torahor if they were daughters to marry great scholars his sons would be dedicated to the law they would give money to the charities sit upon the maamad and give wise rulings and scatter petty men like parido to the fringes of jewish society he needed a moment to collect his thoughts which were jumbled and sluggish standing still in the midst of the exchange merchants and brokers pushing past him like gusts of wind he repeated his scheme back to himself to make sure he could fully articulate it in all its glory he engaged in a silent dialogue a session of interrogation as intense and merciless as any maamad inquiry if he were to be struck on the head and lose consciousness and sleep until the next day he wanted to be certain that he would remember this idea as easily as he remembered his own name he had it he understood it it was his now he had to begin with his back straight his pace measuredmiguel thought of a murderer he had once watched walking to the hanging scaffold erected yearly in the damhe pushed his way toward the portion of the exchange where the east indian merchants congregated there among the group of jewish traders he found his friend isaiah nunes for a man so young nunes had already proved himself a remarkably capable factor he possessed invaluable contacts within the dutch east india company who fed him news and gossip and no doubt profits as well he obtained goods other merchants could only wish for and he did so frequently and in doing so always looked as guilty as a man trapped under his lovers bed while her husband searched the room despite his nervous disposition nunes chatted easily with a group of merchants most more than twenty years his senior miguel marveled at the paradox of his friend at once anxious and so eager when the price of sugar had plummeted nunes alone of all miguels friends had volunteered his help he had offered a loan of seven hundred guilders unbidden and miguel had repaid this money within weeks with funds borrowed from daniel nunes might shrink from attracting paridos attention he might do nearly anything in his power to avoid the scrutiny of the maamad but he had proved himself in an hour of crisis now miguel approached his friend and asked if they might exchange a few words nunes excused himself and the two men moved over to a quiet corner cool in the shadow of the exchange ah miguel nunes said i heard you had a bit of luck with whale oil im sure your creditors are already off scribbling notes to you the power of rumor never ceased to amaze him the trade had only happened moments before thank you for taking the taste of victory from my mouth he said with a grin you know that whaleoil upheaval was paridos doing his trading combination was behind it really miguel asked well how fortunate for me that i happened to stumble upon his machinations i hope your stumbling has not hurt his machinations he hardly needs any excuse to be angry with you oh were friends now miguel said i heard that too it is a strange world why would parido go out of his way to help you if i were you id be on my guard nuness voice trailed off as he looked at the clock on the exchange tower have you come to try your fortune in the east for these last few minutes i have a project i wish to pursue and i might need someone with your particular contacts you know you can rely on me nunes told him though perhaps without the warmth miguel would have liked in all likelihood nunes would want to avoid doing too much business with paridos enemy even if the parnass now professed friendship miguel took his time to consider how he wished to begin his inquiry but he could think of nothing clever so he began directly what do you know about the coffee fruit nunes remained silent for a moment as they walked coffee fruit he repeated some east india men acquire it from mocha and much of that is traded in the orient where the turks drink it as their wine its not very popular in europe most of what i see traded on this exchange is sold to factors for london with a little for men in marseilles and venice its taken on some appeal at foreign courts as well now that i think about it miguel nodded i know of some parties who have shown an interest in coffee but it is a delicate matter it is difficult to explain fully but there are those who would see this trade fail i understand you nunes said cagily let me be blunt then i wish to know if you can import coffee berries for mea large quantitytwice what is brought in now during a years time and i wish to know if you can keep this transaction secret from all prying eyes certainly it can be done i think about fortyfive barrels come in each year and these are sixty pounds each coffee is selling now at just over a half guilder a pound which is thirtythree guilders a barrel youre asking for ninety barrels yes at just under three thousand guilders miguel tried not to think about the enormity of the sum yes thats right quantities are hardly unlimited but i think i can get ninety barrels ill speak to my east india contacts and commission them to bring it in for you i must emphasize the importance of secrecy i wouldnt want even the sailors to know what they carried for how many deals are made and lost owing to their loose lips oh that is nothing i need only instruct my factors to mislabel the manifest with a more common commodity i make such maneuvers more often than not i would not be in business long if i could not keep such things secret miguel wished to clap his hands with joy but he held himself in check show nothing but calm he told himself look slightly bored as though these plans are hardly of interest this sounds promising once i place my order how long will it take for the goods to appear in a warehouse here in amsterdam nunes considered the question to be safe ill need two months perhaps three it may take a little time to collect the amount you want and miguel i can keep things silent here but i cannot say how quiet this business will be regarded in the company once my factors start buying coffee in large quantities someone will notice and the price will go up i understand he almost said no matter but stopped himself best not to reveal too much nunes could be trusted but that didnt mean he should know more than was necessary my buyer has accounted for that possibility nunes ran a hand along his closecut beard it occurs to me that the company has taken a renewed interest in coffee too the port of mocha where coffee is now bought is crowded with ships from the east it can take days for a ship to obtain its consignment but you say you can get what i require the company likes to hoard its supplies ill tell you something else the turks you may know have made it a crime punishable by death for any man to remove a living coffee plant from their empire they wish no one to grow and sell the fruit but themselves the world knows what a wily lot they are but i can tell you they are but lost little lambs compared to the dutch a sea captain named van der brock has managed to smuggle a plant out and now the company is beginning its own plantations on ceylon and java it hopes to produce enough to gain leverage with oriental trading partners but it must have other plans as well miguel nodded once the crop begins to yield the company will want to build a market in europe precisely i wont ask you what you are planning but i think we might make a pact ill be happy to let you know what news i hear of the trade if you will think first of me as your supplier here on the exchangeprovided you dont mention this to anyone i consider it a bargain well struck miguel told him they slapped their right hands together formalizing the agreement nunes must certainly have felt he would make a little money on this deal and might even hope that his friends interest signified a shift in the markets he might exploit miguel could not recall when he last felt such excitement so even when he heard that the price of brandy had improved at the last minuteand if he had held on to his futures he would have made four or five hundred guildershe hardly cared what did such petty sums mean to him in a years time he should be one of the richest men among the portuguese in amsterdam from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda after i had been cast out of the community most of my friends and associates would have nothing more to say to me many shunned me because they feared the power of the maamad others because they were but cattle who could not for a moment imagine i would have been put under the cherem unjustly and if i am to be honest as i have promised there were those who believed i had cheated them or used them ill and were delighted to see no more of alferonda men who owed me money boldly refused to pay as though the ruling of the maamad somehow superseded all civic law and personal honor old business contacts returned my notes unopened paridos influence left me without a livelihood and though i had some money saved i knew it would not last me long i cannot say precisely how i fell into lending money at interest an inquiry here a promise there and one morning i awoke and could not longer deny that i had become a moneylender the torah speaks ill of usurers but the talmud teaches us that a man may bend the law in order to live and how else was i to live if those responsible for upholding the law unjustly took away my livelihood there was no shortage of my kind in amsterdam we were as specialized as taverns each of us serving one particular group or another this lender serves artisans that one merchants yet another shopkeepers i resolved never to lend to fellow jews for i did not want to travel down that path i would not want to have to enforce my will on my countrymen and then have them speak of me as one who had turned against them instead i lent to dutchmen and not just any dutchmen i found myself again and again lending to dutchmen of the most unsavory variety thieves and bandits outlaws and renegades i would not have chosen so vile a bunch but a man has to earn his bread and i had been thrust into this situation against my will i knew at once that i would have to be something of a villain if i were to see my money returned for i lent to those who earned their bread by taking what did not belong to them and i had no reason to believe my capital would be any more sacrosanct than a travelers purse or shopkeepers strongbox the only way to force these men to make good on their promises was to let them fear the consequences of not doing so sadly alfonzo alferonda is not a villain he cannot find it in his heart to be harsh and cruel and violent to his fellow man but what he lacks in cruelty he compensates for in guile i let it be known therefore that i was not a man with whom to trifle when the body of a nameless mendicant was found floating in a canal it was no hard thing to circulate a story that there floats a fool who thought he could avoid paying alferonda when an impoverished fellow broke his arm or lost an eye in some unfortunate accident a few coins in his hand easily persuaded him to tell the world that he wished he had paid alferonda in a timely fashion though i believe the holy one blessed be he has granted me a warm face one full of kindness it was not long before the thieves of amsterdam trembled at my countenance a scowl or a raised eyebrow was enough to make the gold flow when i confronted a debtor who truly could not pay me i made him believe that here for the first time in his life alferonda had decided to show a measure of mercy a mercy so tentative and fragile that even to think of abusing it would be the greatest madness in the world this thief would pay me before he would put food into his own mouth these small deceptions fooled my audience easily thieves are by nature simple and easily duped inclined to believe in monsters and ogres some when they paid me even believed i knew the contents of their purses the locations of their paltry stashes as though i were more witch than moneylender i did nothing to make them believe otherwise alferonda is no fool i knew my name was spoken in the most unflattering terms among my fellow jews in the vlooyenburg but i also knew i was blameless in the sight of the lordat least as blameless as a man who lends money to thieves can ever hope to be miguel met geertruid in the three dirty dogs a tavern near the docks where great ships lay at anchor packed with goods desired the world over the day was warm and uncharacteristically sunny and miguel paused to look at the ships glimmering in the light reflecting off the harbor some of the vessels were great monsters from ports around the world ships whose captains knelt in prayer while their pilots maneuvered the treacherous waters of the amsterdam port these giants were awesome to behold but not nearly so awesome to dutch eyes as the smaller vliebootenflyboatssleek little vessels that were handled with far more agility by a smaller crew and yet held more cargo than the massive ships of other nations thanks in part to these maritime miracles the dutch now stood supreme not only in trade but in transport for who would not want his goods shipped in dutch bottoms when such conveyances reduced costs by as much as a third the three dirty dogs was infrequently visited by jewsits patronage consisted of warehouse workers and ownersand miguel knew that any man of the nation who saw him there would have his own secrets to keep it had become a regular habitation for geertruid whose husband had been part owner of one of those great buildings along the brouwersgracht the windows of the tavern had been placed strangely toward the ceiling and bright sharpangled shafts of sunlight crisscrossed the dusky interior most of the tables were occupied but the space was not crowded groups of men sat in small clusters near the door someone read a news sheet aloud in a booming voice while a dozen men listened and drank geertruid sat at the back dressed in gray skirts and a blue bodice modest and nondescript she did not go to the tavern to make merry today but to do business and she wore no bright colors with which to attract attention she puffed at a pipe and sat in close quarters with her man hendrick who whispered something conspiratorial when he saw miguel good afternoon jew man the dutchman said with what might have been genuine warmth he was a tricky one he might present himself as a villain one instant and the grandest man in the world the next join us how have we managed all this time without you we have been as parched as the desert without your company miguel sat the knowledge of his impending wealth vied in his heart with the chafing impression that hendrick mocked him you look cheerful geertruid told him i hope your month closed well marvelously well madam miguel could not contain his grin ah id been hoping that smile on your face meant you have some firm plans to do business with me it might mean that too miguel answered he hardly liked to give his name or the time of day with hendrick around but we need not discuss these things at this moment what sound is this hendrick grinned and leaned to the side with a hand cupped to his ear someone calls my name well then ill let you get on with your chatter for i have no interest in things of business thats a jews affair and ive christian matters to look after whoring or drinking geertruid inquired he laughed thats between me and my maker then i shall see you on the morrow geertruid told him squeezing his hand gently hendrick pushed himself to his feet and swayed violently toward geertruid he snatched the side of the table to steady himself rot these crooked floors eh jew man rot them i say rot them he paused for a moment as though waiting for miguel to rot the floors a woman who saw her servant or lover in such a state might have shouted in anger or blushed in embarrassment but geertruid had already turned away her attention arrested by some story read by the man with the news sheet therefore she did not see that after hendrick had taken a few uneasy steps toward the door he spun around almost so quickly that he fell over but instead caught himself on miguels shoulder the brawny mans breath smelled remarkably sweet for a man who had been drinking beer and feasting upon onions but his mustache was slick with grease and miguel shrank back from the disquieting intimacy last time i saw you he said directly into miguels ear his voice hardly more than a whisper a man asked me as i left if i might be your acquaintance some jew fellow i believe asked me if id be interested in helping him out a bit miguel looked at geertruid but she paid them no attention at all she was laughing aloud at something in the news sheet and much of the tavern laughed with her i think this fellow must have been some rogue out to trick both you and me lied miguel who could this jew fellow be parido one of his spies daniel joachim somehow pretending to be a jew just as i thought besides i wont squeeze a friends friend its not my way i am glad to know it miguel murmured hendrick patted his shoulder once more this time a bit harder something just short of a blow and then swayed off knocking one table and then another on his way out miguel wondered if perhaps he should have thanked the fellow both for the information and for not as he had so menacingly phrased it putting the squeeze on him but miguel had no mind to go about thanking men such as hendrick for the harm they didnt do well now beautiful madam miguel said to summon geertruids attention we have much to discuss havent we she turned to face miguel flashing something like surprise as though she had forgotten that anyone sat at her table oh senhor i long to hear what you have to say geertruid pressed her hands together her left eye showed a sudden twitch with any luck you have been thinking about coffee as much as i have miguel called for a beer while geertruid brought out a small leather pouch containing the sweet tobacco she favored i have he told her you have seduced me with your proposal she beamed at him have i now ive been lying awake thinking of it i never knew my ideas had such an effect on you the serving boy placed a tankard before miguel so let us discuss particulars geertruid finished refilling her pipe lit it with the oil lamp on the table and leaned forward i love to talk of particulars she said in a breathy voice she puffed at her pipe sending forth clouds of smoke i wont pretend to be surprised to hear you are with me however i knew from the beginning that you were my man miguel laughed well before we proceed i thought we should work out a few details if i am to enter into trade with you i should like to know the conditions the conditions will depend on your plan you do have a plan dont you without a sound idea my capital will hardly be put to good use a genuine laugh escaped miguels throat but his emotions ran somewhat higher than he demonstrated geertruid had the capital that was the very thing he needed to hear madam ive devised a plan so clever you will think youve gone mad this idea of mine he shook his head even i can scarcely believe it geertruid set aside her pipe she pressed both palms upon the table and leaned in toward miguel tell me everything so miguel told her everything he spoke of his idea with a kind of clarity he had not known he possessedfrom the earliest details of the planning to the many layers of execution to the final vastly complicated and yet elegantly simple conclusion his tongue flowed easily perhaps because of the beer yet he never stammered or slurred or stumbled he spoke like an orator and before he was halfway through his explanation he knew he had her geertruid remained silent for a moment after he had finished finally she sat back remarkable she ventured to take a sip of beer she took another sip and looked up with the appearance of a woman who has just been awakened from an unplanned nap you have taken my most optimistic hopes and rendered them laughable do you think such a thing can work why the very size of iti can hardly take it all in miguel felt himself grinning like an imbecile his life was changing before him how many times does a man stand by foolishly while his life changes form with no idea that anything out of the ordinary transpires but for a man to rise to greatness by his own plan and to know the moment that this greatness beginsthat was a glorious thing to be savored weve a great deal to do its true well have to plan this business down to the minute well have to hire agentsat least a dozen of themto act for us where we cannot act ourselves it is all coordination orchestration but once done the business will take care of itself she slapped the table with her handnot hard but hard enough to send miguels nearly empty tankard rattling by the grace of god this scheme of yours iswell i cannot even say however miguel cleared his throat before beginning anew trying hard to get the smile off his face this was after all a serious topic however it will take money we must clarify that part of the arrangement this was the moment he had dreaded had geertruid merely been talking to sound impressive or did she have access to sufficient capital as she had hinted without money they could do nothing she picked his hand up gently as though fearing it might fall and shatter were she to drop it i have been my own mistress long enough to understand that capital is but one element of the business do not think because i put forth the money that you will suffer for it i propose a split of fifty percent with all the capital in the world i could not do this thing without you is that not the way in amsterdam the way that has made this city great we rule the world because we have devised joint stock companies and corporations and trading combinations to share the danger she gave his hand a good squeeze and the wealth the thing of it is miguel said hesitantly i cannot make any moves in my own nameowing to some small debts if these niggling creditors were to learn of the business they might make demands on me that could prove disruptive then well use my name virginal as an infants it hardly matters what name we use of course he agreed we should perhaps be clear on the degree of the togetherness and determine to keep our business from everyone including our nearest friends you mean hendrick geertruid laughed he hardly understands the nature of a transaction so complex as buying a prune pie i would never tax his brain with such a thing as this even if it were not a secret you neednt worry there and even if he were to catch some wind of our plan and even if he were to understand it he would never tell a soul there is nowhere to be found a man with more loyalty he paused to consider how he wished to word his next concern we have not yet discussed the requirements of this plan or the scope of your resources my resources have their limits geertruid agreed how much do we require miguel spoke quickly wanting this most difficult part resolved i believe that in order to perform these tasks ill require of you no more than three thousand guilders he waited a man could live in great comfort for a year on three thousand guilders could geertruid have so much at her disposal her husband had left her an estate of some value but did she live the life of a woman who could summon three thousand guilders upon command its not easy geertruid answered after a thoughtful pause but it can be done when will you need it miguel shrugged trying hard to contain his glee a month best to act as though three thousand guilders were of no importance in fact seeing how easily she agreed to the sum he at once regretted not having asked for more had he requested four thousand he might have used the extra money to pay off some debts and provide a little room to breathesurely a legitimate business expense geertruid nodded with great seriousness ill arrange for the funds to be transferred to your account at the exchange bank so you may proceed without the world knowing that my hand is thrust in with yours i know we dont like to look into each others affairs but now that we are business partners not merely friends you will understand if i am curious about a thing or two i would be surprised if you were not geertruid answered happily you wonder how i can produce so great a sum so easily she remained cheerful careful that miguel not even suspect a hint of bitterness the question after all was certainly proper as youve brought it up i must admit curiosity i havent buried it in my cellar geertruid said i propose to sell off some holdings it may take a few weeks to be certain that i obtain the best prices but i can raise the funds without undoing myself would you like for me to broker these matters for you she clapped her hands together i should be delighted if you would do so it would relieve me of a great burden then her eyes narrowed yet i wonder if you should i know you fear your evil council do you wish to do anything in public that might link our partnership more than necessary the council is not evil only overzealous but i take your point have you other men to whom to turn ill take care of everything geertruid rolled her head back looked toward the ceiling and then turned to miguel it must have been the will of god that brought us together senhor i am in awe of you soon the world will be in awe of us both he told her this plan this child of miguels mind seemed to him so simple he could not believe that no one had thought of such a thing before of course it required certain conditions a man had to make his move at just the right time in the life of a commodity and this was the time he knew with ferocious certainty for coffee first miguel would arrange to bring a large shipment of coffee into amsterdama shipment so large it would flood the market which was now very small and specializedin this case ninety barrels no one would know of this consignment so the first stage of making money involved the element of surprise to take advantage of this secret miguel would purchase a large quantity of puts guaranteeing him the right to sell at the predetermined price of approximately thirtythree guilders per barrel when news of the shipment spread the price of coffee would drop and miguel would profit handsomely from the difference in price as dictated by the puts but these profits would only whet his appetite a small first course in the larger feast ahead by that time miguel and geertruid would have hired agents to do their bidding on the dozen or so most active import commodity exchanges in europe hamburg london madrid lisbon marseilles and several others he would carefully select each agent would know his own task but not that he was part of a larger scheme a few weeks after their shipment arrived in amsterdam once the rest of europe had learned that the coffee market was flooded and the price had now dropped at every exchange these agents would move every man would buy all the coffee upon the market at its now artificially lowered price they would act at a single timethis was the part so brilliant it made miguel need to empty his bladder just to think of it if word were to reach london that a man sought to buy all the coffee in amsterdam the price in london would soar making the acquisition unprofitably expensive it was the simultaneity that miguel embraced as his most clever stroke before anyone knew what had happened he would own all the coffee in europe the price would be his to dictate as he pleased and they would be in a position to give the law to the importers they would have that most soughtafter of powers a rare thing upon which unimaginable fortunes are built a monopoly maintaining the monopoly would require some skill but it should be possible to manage it at least for a while the east india company which imported the coffee would find itself in a position to break miguels control of the prices but only if it could dramatically increase the amount of coffee on the european market true the company had plantations in ceylon and java but it would be many seasons before those crops yielded significant quantities and to deplete its warehouses in the east would mean sacrificing a trade of far more importance the company would have no motive to act for some time it would be content to watch and wait it would plant and it would hoard only when the company had enough coffee to break his hold would it strike let it strike miguel thought five ten perhaps even fifteen years will go by first the company had the patience of a spider by the time it moved miguel and geertruid would be immeasurably wealthy perhaps long before that time the maamad would learn of miguels partnership with geertruid what could it say once he had donated tens of thousands of guilders to charity miguel was only a few months away from the kind of wealth that most men only dream of but already he could hold it in his hand and know its taste it tasted savory indeed so great was his enthusiasm that later that night as he lay in bed when he recollected that he had utterly forgotten to meet joachim waagenaar as planned miguel felt only the slightest twinge of regret from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda i talk about myself too much i know that ive looked over the pages ive penned and what do i see but alferonda and alferonda to this objection my readers will surely say but my dear alonzo what more interesting subject can there be but your life and your opinions fair enough dear readers you have swayed me with your gentle arguments but there are other things to write about reasons why i began this memoir in the first place for one thing there is coffee not so long ago in the time of my boyhood coffee was like any other exotic powder or dried berry you might find in an apothecarys musty cabinet it was given in small doses for diseases of the blood and bowels too much is poison they would say even now as this elixir spreads like a murky tide across europe the apothecaries cry out to drinkers to stay their hands great quantities of this medicine will make you weak they say it dries out the blood it leads to impotence and infertility coffee leads to nothing of the sort i promise you i consume it in great quantities and my blood is as robust as that of a man half my age it has always been looked on dubiously this poor drink that only wants to improve us to make us more than we are it first became known among the men of the orient who were suspicious of its marvelous effects those of the mohammedan faith shun alcohol so they had no experience with drinks that change a mans disposition over a hundred years ago in the land of egypt the viceroy summoned the great imams to debate whether coffee was permitted or forbidden by the dietary code of their sacred teachings coffee is like wine one imam declared and is therefore forbidden but who could agree or disagree these all being righteous men who had never themselves tasted wine and could only guess they knew wine makes a man sleepy yet coffee makes him alert therefore coffee could not be like wine another shouted that coffee is black and the beans when roasted are like dirt the eating of dirt was forbidden by mohammed and therefore coffee is forbidden but another argued that since fire purifies the process of roasting the berries makes them not unclean but rather cleanses away that which was once unclean in them in the end they could only say that coffee was neither forbidden nor permitted but was mekruh undesirable of course they were mistaken coffee is nothing if not desirable all men desire its power and when it first emerged there were those who desired the wealth it might bring one such man of course was miguel lienzo the benefactor of my youth how good he had been to my family providing us with warning about the inquisition when no one else thought to save us did he do this for profit no there could be none did he act out of love he barely knew us he did it i believe because he is a righteous man and delights in thwarting the plans of evildoers i had no desire to make him uncomfortable so when i formed a friendship with lienzo in amsterdam i did not embarrass him by recollecting the kindness he had done my family instead i did some small business with him joined him at taverns and eateries and studied with him at the talmud torah until the time of my exile when i saw him we talked of little of consequence then one day he informed me that he wanted to enter into the coffee trade i knew about coffee from the years i had sojourned in the east i knew that a man who drinks coffee is twice as strong twice as wise and twice as cunning as the man who abstains i knew that coffee unlocks doors in the mind and i knew other things too i knew things i was not quite prepared to tell my friend senhor lienzo not because i wanted him to fail oh no nothing of the sort i held on to my secrets because i wanted him to succeed and i had every reason to believe that this new coffee venture could be just the thing i needed coffee it was a fire that fed on itself miguel sat in his cellar his feet cold from canal water as he drank bowl after bowl of coffee and wrote to brokers and traders on every exchange he knew it would be weeks of course before he would get responses but soon they would come he urged quick replies he promised generous commissions it was as alferonda had said he remained awake half the night reading through his letters tearing them up and rewriting them he studied the weeks torah portion and knew he would dazzle his study group at the synagogue he reread eight tales of charming pieter the next day he felt weary but if that was the price of productivity he was willing to pay in any case morning coffee paid the debts incurred by the coffee of the previous night miguel heard that parido and his trading combination had lost a great dealthat is to say they had not profited as handsomely as they had intendedbecause of miguels interference in whale oil when the two men saw each other on the exchange however parido showed no ill will i hear your month ended well the parnass said he might have been discussing the death of a friend for all the cheer in his voice miguel smiled brightly it might have been better i could say the same for my own did you know your machinations in whale oil caused me to incur some unpleasant losses im terribly sorry to learn that miguel said i had no idea you were involved or i would never have ventured there myself so you tell me but things appear somewhat dubious parido said there are those who whisper in my ear to tell me your whaleoil scheme was a slap in the face i would not let my brother whisper in your ear if i were you his breath would fell a horse if you dont have faith in my honesty at least have faith in my caution why would i risk your displeasure by trading knowingly against your interests i cannot say what compels a man to act as he acts nor can i you know brandy surged at the last moment some dutch fellows bought a massive quantity and sent the price soaring you had no knowledge of that i suppose though men might whisper a thing or two in my ear if i let them parido frowned you dont think i would trick you out of your futures do you things appear somewhat dubious miguel said parido let out a sour little laugh perhaps we are on an equal footing you lost far less in brandy than i did in whale oil but your losses are surely more significant to you than mine are to me surely miguel agreed let me ask you one thing however how is it that you just happened upon whale oil it is an odd coincidence dont you think miguel could think of no answer but parido spoke again before the silence became too conspicuous did someone advise you to trade in whale oil it was as though charming pieter whispered the name of course why not say so to implicate this man could not be counted as a betrayal because the man was out of paridos grasp i did receive a noteunsolicited of coursefrom that fellow alferonda he advised me to buy into whale oil and you believed him this man we had cast out of the community i thought he had no reason to lie and when i examined the commodity for myself and asked around the exchange i concluded that the advice had been good parido scratched at his beard thoughtfully i had supposed it might come to this i would advise you to have no more dealings with him lienzo pay him a brokers fee if you must but be rid of him the man is a danger to anyone he touches miguel could hardly believe his luck having so easily escaped paridos anger certainly he seemed irritated that he had lost money but he was too eager to blame alferonda to waste his anger upon miguel meanwhile he had begun to realize that obtaining his whaleoil profits might be more difficult than he thought after reckoning day when no money had been deposited into his account at the exchange bank and he began receiving letters from his muscovy agent regarding his nineteen hundred guilders miguel thought it was time to hunt his money he found ricardo the broker to whom hed sold his shares at a tavern popular with portuguese jews he was already slightly drunk and looking like he wanted more than anything else to be in his own bedor at the very least away from miguel how are you lienzo he asked and then walked away without waiting for an answer oh ive been a busy man ricardo miguel said hurrying after him ive made a few trades here and there and earned a few guilders the thing of it is when a man earns a few guilders he expects to have those guilders appear in his account at the exchange bank ricardo turned ive heard your creditors say much the same thing oh ho miguel shouted back youve a sharp tongue today well you may sharpen your tongue all you like so long as you also sharpen your pen before signing over my money as youve only been in amsterdam five years ricardo said quietly and you clearly havent mastered the art of doing business here let me make bold by explaining something to you the flow of money is like the flow of water in a river you may stand by the shore and urge it on but doing so wont earn you much advantage youll get your money in due time in due time the fellow i borrowed from in order to buy that whale oil isnt talking about due time maybe you should not have extended credit when you had none to extend i would have thought you might have learned that lesson before now youre in no position to lecture me about extending credit when you wont pay me who is your blackguard client anyhow who holds back ricardo sneered under his unkempt mustache you know i wont tell you that the broker explained i wont have you making trouble for my clients or for me either if you dont like the way i do business you know what you may do about it here was something of a bind had ricardo been a dutchman miguel could have taken the matter to the exchange board or to the courts but the maamad discouraged jews from resolving their differences so publicly instead it preferred to resolve these things itself but miguel was disinclined to bring a matter before the council parido might choose to lead the maamad against miguel out of spite and then he would have no recourse i dont much like the tone youve taken with me ricardo miguel said and i promise you that this incident will not shine favorably on your reputation youre a fine fellow to talk about reputations the broker answered as he turned away later that week miguel left his brothers house early and strolled along the herengracht whose handsome wide streets were bursting with linden trees newly rich with foliage grand houses rose upward on either side of the canal glories of the prosperity that the dutch had built for themselves in the last half century these were enormous redbrick dwellingstoo well constructed to require the sealing black tar that covered so many houses in the citygrand structures with ornate angles and dazzling flourishes miguel loved to study the gable stones above the doorways coats of arms or symbols of the source of the households wealth a bound bundle of wheat a tallmasted ship an african brute in chains just ahead a beggar wound his way through the street stumbling like a drunkard he was filthy covered in rags and missing most of his left arm from an accident still new enough to leave the wound raw and rancid miguel who was kind sometimes too kind with the citys mendicants felt the pull of generosity why should he not be munificent charity was a mitzvah and in a few months time he would hardly miss a handful of stuivers as he reached for his purse something stayed his hand miguel felt the burn of eyes on him and turned not fifteen feet behind him joachim waagenaar flashed his wincing smile dont let me stop you he said as he approached if you in your goodness meant to give a few coins to that unfortunate i would hate to think i stood in your way a man with money to spare must never be shy in giving charity joachim he called out with all the semblance of cheer he could muster well met keep your false kindness he said after you so rudely spurned our meeting miguel deployed the easy voice with which he convinced men to buy what they did not want an unfortunate turn of events prevented me from arriving it was all very disagreeable and i assure you i would rather have been with you than those unpleasant gentlemen oh such dreaded circumstances can only be imagined joachim said raising his voice like a mountebank such horrible circumstances as would prevent you not only from fulfilling a promise but from sending along word to tell me that you could not make it as we had agreed it occurred to miguel that he ought to be worried about this public encounter should he be spotted by a maamad spy parido might well undertake an official investigation a quick glance revealed only housewives maids and a few artisans he had walked a route not generally frequented by those of his neighborhood and he believed he might continue this conversation at least for a few more minutes without risk of exposure i must tell you that i dont believe any business arrangement between us is possible at this time he said making an attempt to keep a kindly tone in his voice my resources are limited and if i may speak frankly i am encumbered by a great deal of debt it pained him to say the words aloud to this wretch but at the moment the truth struck him as the best strategy i too have debtswith the baker and the butcherand both have threatened action if i do not pay what i owe at once therefore lets go to the exchange joachim suggested we can put some money into a likely trading ship or some other scheme you devise what manner of investment is this miguel asked when you cannot pay for bread youll lend me the money he answered confidently ill repay you from my portion of the profits which ought to motivate you to invest more wisely than you have sometimes done in the pastwhen you invested someone elses money miguel stopped walking i am sorry you believe yourself wronged but you must understand that i too lost a great deal in that unfortunate affair he took a breath better to say it than to endure joachims fantastical notions you speak of your debts but i have debts that would buy your baker and butcher outright im sorry for your need but i dont know what i can do for you you were going to give to that beggar why give to him if you will not give to me are you not being merely willful will a handful of stuivers make a difference to you joachim if so you may have them with all my heart i would have suspected that such an amount would only insult you it would he snapped a few stuivers against the five hundred you took from me miguel sighed how could life hold such promise and such tedium all in the same morning my finances are a bit disordered just now but in half a year ill be able to offer you somethingill be able to help you in this plan as youve suggested and ill do it gladly half a year joachims voice had begun to grow shrill would you lie in shitsmeared straw and dine on piss gruel for half a year my wife clara whom i promised to make comfortable and content now sells pies in the alleys behind the oude kerk shell turn whore in half a year i tried to take her to live with relations in antwerp but she wouldnt stay in that wretched city you think you can make things easy for us by telling me about half a year miguel thought about joachims wife clara he had met her once or twice and she had proved to be a spirited woman with more senseand certainly more beautythan her husband thinking about joachims pretty wife left miguel feeling more generous than he might have been otherwise i dont have very much on me he said nor have i much elsewhere but i can give you two guilders if that will help your immediate needs two guilders is but a paltry beginning joachim said ill consider it but the first payment of the five hundred i lost im sorry you believe yourself injured but i have business to attend to i can hear no more what business is this joachim asked stepping in front of miguel blocking his exit business without money is it yes so you may find it in your best interest not to hinder my efforts you should not be so unkind to me joachim said shifting to heavily accented portuguese a man who has lost everything can lose nothing more some time ago when they had been on far more pleasant terms miguel had muttered something to himself in portuguese and joachim had astonished him by answering back in that language then he had laughed and told miguel that in a city like amsterdam one must never assume that a man does not understand the language you speak joachim used portuguese now perhaps to suggest a dangerous intimacy a familiarity with the ways of the portuguese nation including the power of the maamad was the portuguese a threat an indication that if he did not get what he wanted joachim would tell the council that miguel had been brokering for gentiles ill not be menaced he said in dutch he held himself straight joachim pushed miguel the gesture lacked power it was almost contemptuousjust a little shove enough to make miguel take a step and a half backwards i think he said mocking miguels accent that you will be menaced miguel had no idea what to say he hated joachim well enough for threatening him with the maamad but to threaten him with violence was more than he could endure but what could he do strike at him the dangers of striking a madman aside miguel could not risk a violent confrontation with a dutchman the maamad would expel him without a moment of hesitation back in lisbon he hardly would have hesitated to beat this wretch bloody but here he could only stand impotently sensing miguels hesitation joachim flashed his broken teeth with animal menace around him miguel noticed the glances of passing strangers a neatly dressed jew locked in uncomfortable conversation with a beggar among the openly curious catholic portuguese this strange pair would have been surrounded by a crowd of curious maids and peasant housewives staring with open amusement as they wiped their floured hands on their aprons laughing and heckling as though this conflict were a puppet show staged for their pleasure here among the dutch who had taken to heart the introspective doctrine of their reformed church the curious looked away politely as if to cast their eyes upon someone elses business was shameful surely they had troubles of their own that needed tending we understand each other joachim said ill take those two guilders miguel took a step back but he considered it a defiant retreat youll get nothing from me now i offered you kindness and you repay me with impudence keep your distance from me or shitsmeared straw and piss gruel will seem to you the greatest luxuries in the world miguel turned in the other direction and headed toward the exchange pushing his legs now heavy and stiff as quickly as he could trying to erase the discomfort of the encounter by doing something decisive he replayed the incident again and again in his mind he should have given the fellow his two guilders he should have given him ten anything to make him go away damn my pride he murmured a madman might say anything to anyone including the maamad if parido should learn that miguel had been brokering for a gentile all his protests of goodwill would be like smoke in the air a few weeks before miguel might have even struck joachim and allowed the consequences to come as they may now he had too much to lose he would not put his new expectations at risk for a disgruntled vagabond he would see joachim at the bottom of a canal first hannah loved to visit the fish market during exchange hours because she had to pass along the dam and would occasionally catch sight of miguel he would be oblivious to her presence locked in conversation with some great merchant or other his confidence radiating one hand contemplatively rubbing his bristly beard he would laugh and slap his friend upon the back she had never seen him so at ease as when he was upon the dam and she liked to believe that this agreeable happy man was miguels secret self at home in the shadow of the palatial town hall and the glorious exchange the self he would become once he cleared himself of his debt and his brothers yoke daniel had grown particularly fond of herring since their arrival in amsterdam and wanted to eat it three times a week prepared in stews or in sauces with raisins and nutmeg and sometimes smothered in butter and parsley the stall keepers down at the fish market had a hundred ways to sell bad herring but annetje knew all their tricks and made herself useful in testing the most handsome specimens for signs of being slicked with oil dyed or salted to hide the smell of rot after the women bought their fish they crossed the dam to seek out sellers of vegetables and as daniel had been generous with money that morning fruit for after the meal as she went about her purchases hannah kept her eyes on the exchange never knowing when she might be treated to a glimpse of miguel aglow in his pecuniary glory annetje had been unusually kind to her since their church outing she knew nothing of hannahs fleeting encounter with the widow so she could not guess why hannah had returned to her care so sullen the girl had brought her home and given her hot wine with extra cloves she had cooked leafy cabbage for her to improve her blood but if her blood had improved hannah showed no signs of it annetje joked with her snapped at her coddled her poked fingers in her sides and by turns kissed and pinched her cheeks but nothing worked the girl eventually settled in with hannahs new moodiness and declared she would not waste her time attempting to coax so sad a mope into better spirits hannah had thought to tell her she wanted to tell someone but she had been in no mind to share more secrets with the girl so she said nothing she lay in bed at night thinking of that wicked stare and once or twice she had thought to awaken danielor merely shove him for he was often enough awake with aching teethand confess all to him he would never cast her out not while she carried his child still she kept her tongue she thought about telling miguel the widow was his friend after all but she could not even dream of explaining to him what she had been doing in that part of town no one need know she repeated to herself during those long nights no one would find out and there would be no consequences if she just kept silent only the coffee berries comforted her now she had slipped down to miguels cellar once more and slid a handful into her apron one handful how long would that last so she took another and then a half handful to be sure she need not come again so soon inside the sack the beans appeared diminished but miguel would hardly notice if he traded in the fruit he might get more as easily as he pleased for all she knew this was a new sack entirely now as she and annetje returned to the vlooyenburg their baskets heavy with fish and carrots she chewed on her berries working them slowly so they might last longer but even though she had eaten a dozen berries or more the fear pulled at her and she began to wonder if the effect of the fruit was no match for the terrors that now lurked everywhere she hardly noticed where they walked so annetje observing her absent frame of mind led her through the narrow and ancient hoogstraat where the stones were red with blood from the hog butchers that lined either side she took obvious pleasure in the idea of trailing pig blood into a jews house hannah snapped alert to avoid the congealing puddles but when they were halfway through the aisle she was distracted by the burn of eyes upon her like the hot breath of a predator she dared not turn around so with her free hand she gripped annetjes arm hoping her intent would be clear let us hurry it was not annetje sensed something was amiss so she stopped and turned to look there was nothing left for hannah but to turn around too pretty as a portrait the widow approached her smiling her wide irresistible smile she hardly looked where she walked but her natural grace steered her past the puddles of blood and offal a few paces behind lagged her man young fairhaired and handsome in the most menacing way imaginable he held back to keep a watchful eye on her my dear the widow said to hannah do you understand my language she turned to annetje girl does the senhora understand hannah was too frightened to lie or even to answer her head clouded with the pungent scent of pigs blood surely the widow now wanted something for her silence and if hannah could not provide it she would find herself her husband her child destroyed to save himself daniel would surely divorce her he might be able to repair his reputation in the community by acting cruelly to the wife who had defiled his name and then what would hannah do throw herself and her child upon the mercy of some convent she understands well enough annetje said making no effort to hide her confusion she knew who the widow was and could not imagine her business with hannah but her tongue is too ill made to form the sounds of dutch wicked though she might be annetje proved her worth now if hannah could not speak it would shorten their conversation force the widow to be clear and direct very well sweetheart you just nod if you understand me and shake your head if you do not can you do that my dear hannah nodded you are a stout girl you know and a pretty one too under those cruel clothes how sad such beauty must be hidden senhor lienzo has often spoken of how pretty you are and of his brothers good fortune to have such a pretty wife hannah did not know if she should nod it seemed to her immodest to affirm her own beauty but miguel thought her pretty and that was something unable to resist she reached into her apron and grabbed one of the last coffee berries dirty with lint and street dust with it clutched in her fingers she lifted her hand as though holding it to her mouth in fear and slipped the hard fruit inside it was too soon to chew she told herself and took comfort in clenching the berry with her molars a little too much pressure and the bean split it would be fine if she just chewed it carefully on sunday annetje was repeating some words hannah had missed the girls mind churned through possibilities near the weigh house near the weigh house the widow agreed affably the senhora and i saw each other is that not right my dear hannah nodded again a fine opportunity to work at some of the larger pieces of the berry i saw you chasing after your girl i can hardly imagine what she had done to make her mistress chase after her but i suppose that is none of my concern annetje clucked her tongue i am certain the antics of youth are a distant memory to you and so they appear puzzling such a witty slut ill indulge you your barbs so i may sooner get to the heart of my meaning she looked at hannah i only want you to know that i happened to be near the weigh house all morning indeed i saw you as i came by way of the oudezijds voorburgwal and i saw from which house you came i know what it would mean if the world were to know you were inside it she reached out and pressed her fingers ever so gently on hannahs belly just for an instant i only wanted to beg you to be more careful do you understand hannah nodded once more what does she care for your concern old woman annetje demanded the widow smiled thinly you probably know nothing of who i am i cannot imagine dear senhor lienzo speaks of me to you so i must think you concerned about this knowledge i now possess i only wanted to tell you that you neednt fear anything from me i have many talents dear senhora but none so precious to me as that of keeping secrets you may sleep at night knowing i will never speak of what i saw to a living soulnot to senhor lienzo though he is a great friend of mine not even to my dear hendrick hendrick bowed at hannah all i ask in exchange began geertruid but she stopped herself no not in exchange i wont make a bargain with you i wont have you believe my silence some precious thing easily broken i will keep your secret yet i would ask a favor of you lamb may i do so hannah nodded and swallowed the last of her coffee im so very glad you see i only ask that you not speak of what you sawnot to senhor lienzo or your husband or your friends or even to this sweet girl here upon whom you depend i think it best we both forget we saw each other that day do you not think so another nod im so glad may i kiss you this time geertruid did not wait for a nod she leaned in and put her soft lips against hannahs veil pressing through so she could feel the warmth the widows mouth were things ordered differently im sure we could be friends its sad that it cannot be but know that i always wish you well goodbye my dear geertruid turned and walked toward hendrick who offered the ladies another bow christ annetje said loudly i hope the senhor doesnt fuck anything that withered hannah began walking quickly annetje remained a moment watching them depart and then hurried after her mistress by jesus annetje swore you had better tell me what that was about hannah kept her eyes straight ahead a group of women thickwaisted matrons passed them by glancing at hannahs veil you may speak now annetje urged theres no harm in it i wont speak of it hannah said she felt as though the widow had been some kind of witch that a spell had been cast and that to defy the widows wishes would bring down her curses how could she be sure the widow was not a witch dont be a silly annetje urged quietly because that old whore says it doesnt mean it must be so she cant know of what we speak if im to hope she keeps her silence i must keep mine a peculiar sort of logic annetje clicked her tongue i want to know her secret hannah stopped she looked annetje full in the face my child is in danger i beg of you not to speak a word of this to anyone you must promise me annetje laughed airily i will not she said i can ruin you more easily than that widow can and ill not make any vow because you tell me hannah did not turn away she would not be intimidated not about this you will promise me and honor your word too annetjes laugh ended and her smile retracted into her face like a cats claws you want my promise i promise that if you keep secrets from me ill tell what i know of them to your husband there is my promise keep your affairs hidden from me again and youll have cause to regret it she said now stop staring at me like a puppy and lets go hannah nodded helplessly still she had won hadnt she annetje had demanded that she not keep more secrets not that she reveal this one the girl had backed down perhaps her will was worth something after all but what to do about the widow she hated to hold something back from miguel but what choice had she been given in any case the widow was his friend perhaps she planned something for him as a surprise perhaps she secretly helped him with some business yes that made a great deal of sense she helped miguel behind his back and did not want him to know lest his pride be injured all would be well she told herself again and again each time hoping to believe it after a disappointing afternoon nothing would have been so welcome as the cool isolation of his brothers cellar sad home though it was it offered some retreat from the world it had been more than two weeks and still no word from any of his prospective agents true it was still early but after two weeks it was now within the realm of the possible that he might have word that was what he had told himself dont look for answers before two weeks had passed though he had secretly hoped to receive word sooner now all that might comfort him would be a few struck candles a glass of wineor perhaps even some coffee miguel had stopped by the bookseller that afternoon and found a new tale of charming pieter and his goodwife mary it was only eighteen pages long so he took no more than a glance at it in the shop not wanting to spoil the pleasure of the discovery miguel had received yet another note from his muscovy agent that day the fellow had too many debts and too many creditors pressing for them he needed to call in his own loans and if miguel could not comply there would certainly be consequences there were always consequences he told himself and hed ignored his share of similar communications but not with dutchmen who might well drag him before the courtssomething he could little afford now that he was beginning to order his affairs so he spent the day in search of ricardo but no luck instead he ended up at the flyboat drinking with isaiah nunes what do you know about ricardo miguel asked his friend nothing more than you know hes just a broker of middling skills you have no idea who his clients are that is one thing ricardo does well he keeps quiet hes very popular among men who dont want to pay a moment before they choose to pay i dont think ricardo would risk tricking you outright but it could be another month or even more before he pays i heard he once sheltered a client for more than a year miguel had no intention of waiting a year i would blacken his eye if i thought he wouldnt go running to the maamad trouble from the council is the last thing i need while i work out this business with coffee are you still committed to that project nunes let his eyes wander around the room miguel felt the hair on the back of his neck tingle of course maybe now is not the best time nunes suggested half swallowing his words miguel leaned forward what are you telling methat you cant get what you promised by christ if you cant you had better tell me who can of course i can get what i promise he answered hastily ill not promise what i cant do even the east india company would not cross me an idle boast of course i am utterly certain that the east india company would not hesitate to cross me miguel said but i hope you would nunes let out a nervous sigh i only wondered if perhaps now that you have made a little money in whale oil and are feeling confident it might be a poor time to invest in something so full of risk why not make yourself safe my brother tried to warn me off coffee too miguel said im not trying to warn you off nunes assured him if you suggest your brother put me up to this you are wrong you know how little i value him if parido did not befriend him hed be without two stuivers to buy bread i just dont want to see you lose in a risky venture just do what i pay you to do miguel said loud enough to make his friend cringe on the walk home hed begun to regret his words to nunes miguel had lost a great deal of money and the loss had hit him hard his friends were right to worry about him and he had not exactly told nunes the truth about his coffee venture he would find nunes tomorrow apologize by buying him a few tankards and the matter would be forgotten on entering his brothers house miguel found his plans for a quiet retreat quickly dashed daniel sat smoking a pipe in the front room with hannah who appeared lost in thought oblivious to her husband a word please daniel said with a little more urgency than his brother liked i must speak to you for a moment leave the room wife hannah picked up her glass of mulled wine and retreated to the kitchen stealing a glance at miguel their eyes locked for an instant but she turned away first she always did daniel rose to meet his brother he held up a few pieces of paper which looked very much like letters you received these today miguel took them the letters appeared on the surface nothing special but miguel already recognized the hand on one of them joachim thats the one daniel said noticing miguels frown i can see just from the handwriting that the letter is written by a dutchman i wonder at your receiving such communications and receiving them in my house as well is this some man for whom you broker you know that these transactions with gentiles are illegal miguel checked to make certain that the letter was unopened but the seal was of simple wax it could easily have been broken and sealed again i see nothing wrong with receiving any letter at my place of lodging he would soon control all the coffee in europe even having this conversation was beneath him do you suggest that you never have need to communicate with dutchmen all your affairs from your banking to the acquisition of wall paintings are transacted only with jews of course not please dont bombard me with absurdities but i dont think this letter is of such a nature and i wish to know what it contains so do i but i have not read it he leaned forward i wonder if you can say the same i might remind you that were no longer in lisbon miguel said after a moment here a man need not keep so suspicious an eye on his brother thats not the point i charge you to open that letter in my presence so its contents may be revealed before the community revealed before the community had daniel grown mad and come to believe that parido had steered him to a seat on the maamad shall i translate it for you as well miguel asked would portuguese or spanish be more to your liking am i to be upbraided for not speaking the language of gentiles of course not let us continue our conversation in hebrew im sure your mastery of the tongue is superior to mine daniel began to turn red i think you forget yourself now open the letter if you please unless you have something to hide ive nothing more to hide than any man of business miguel returned unable to choke back the words he knew he could not afford to utter my letters are my own concern my wife is with child i wont have strange dutch letters plaguing her quiet of course miguel looked downward to hide his mirth his wifes quiet surely existed independent of any dutch letters that came to the house if you like he proposed knowing he was now being provoking ill have all my letters directed to a tavern where it will be the barkeeps task to protect his own wifes quiet no daniel answered too quickly no perhaps i shouldnt interfere with your business a man has a right to order his own affairs you are very kind miguel had not meant for his words to sound quite so bitter i only inquire into your business out of curiosity brotherly curiosity you know for example i should love to learn more of this coffee trade you mentioned miguel felt the tingle of panic i told you i have no such trade lets be open with each other im certain it must be a safe topic within these walls i have no plans miguel said as he walked away but if you think the coffee trade so promising ill be certain to look into it miguel passed through the kitchen where hannah and annetje busied themselves with moving carrots and leeks from this place to that in an effort to appear as though they had been tending to the meal and not listening at the door once in his cellar he struck a few candles and then ground some beans with the mortar and pestle he had not yet returned to the kitchen and which had not yet been missed and heated some wine only once he had poured the mixture into a bowl and allowed it to settle did he break open the letter from joachim senhor lienzo when we spoke earlier i may have grown unnecessarily heated nevertheless i think you will agree that my anger is well justified and that you indeed owe me more than you have been willing to admit therefore please accept my regrets i wish you to know i am glad that we may enter into a matter of business that will serve our mutual interests i remain your servant joachim waagenaar he took a sip of his drink though he might have been drinking beer for all he noticed the bitterness surely this man was far madder than miguel had imagined had joachim understood nothing of their conversation even his own part after folding the letter and placing it upon the fire miguel went through the rest of his correspondence which included more troubling lines from the muscovy trader who it seemed had taken to writing twice a day now miguel had not the heart to reply to these meddlesome words and instead took out his new pamphlet but the tricks of charming pieter held no allure for him he set down the little volume when he heard footsteps upon the stairs he thought he might have to face annetje whose silliness would only irritate him but instead he saw that hannah had descended halfway down to the cellar she held a smoky candle in her hand and she peered with seeming difficulty into the dimly lit room are you there senhor she called softly miguel could not think how to reply hannah had never before come into the cellar and that she did so without knocking seemed to him unthinkable he might have been undressed he recalled that he had not closed the door so perhaps hannah believed that to be a sign of his willingness to receive guests such a mistake he determined must never again be permitted im here senhora he set down his bowl of coffee and moved toward the foot of the stairwell do you require me i smelled something strange she told him taking a few more steps down i wanted to make certain all was well no odor other than fire or vomit ought to provoke such a response the coffee was certainly the culprit since he had received the beans of geertruid miguel had grown accustomed to the aroma but recognized that it might smell alien to someone unfamiliar with it oh the floor is all wet hannah observed have you spilled something it is the canal senhora it floods at night i know she said quietly i worry that youll grow ill i do well enough senhora and it is better to sleep in the damp than in a heated room with no windows i inquired of a physician i wanted to see about the odor she sounded confused as though she had taken too much wine now that he thought about it her voice did have a loose unformed quality she seemed to be making an effort to say something more as though she could not bring herself to her topic he knew she took undue pleasure in his company that she loved to look upon him and make idle chatter with him but to descend to the cellarhad she discovered some new boldness there is no need to so trouble yourself senhora the smell is nothing but a new kind of tea i am sorry it disturbed you a new kind of tea she nearly shouted as though this had been what she had longed to hear miguel however did not quite believe it it was more he thought as though she had latched onto some opportunity hannah now ventured another step until she hovered only a few inches above the wet daniel thinks tea a waste of money but i love it miguel noticed that hannahs scarf had come askew and he could see a thick lock of her black hair dangling across her forehead as a woman who had returned to jewish ways only recently she perhaps did not feel to the depth of her soul the force of the law that prohibited a married woman from showing her hair to any man but her husband miguel had found the injunction strange when he had first arrived in amsterdam but he had absorbed its urgency to such a degree that he would hardly have been more shocked had she exposed to him her bare breastswhich were large and of significant interest to him as it was he found this lock of hair strangely exciting perhaps you might taste it someday miguel said in rapid words that betrayed his discomfort his face grew hot and his pulse quickened his eyes fixed upon this lock of hair in an instant he knew what it must feel like to the touchsmooth and brittle at onceand he could smell its musty aroma did she know she so exposed herself miguel could hardly think so he wanted to say something so she might undo the error before daniel discovered it but if he were to tell her that she had so disrobed herself mortification might overwhelm her ill be happy to share the tea with you some other time he told her i hope you will close the door to the room when you depart hannah could not mistake his meaning i am sorry to have bothered you senhor she retreated up the stairs he thought to call out to say she had not bothered him he could not let her walk away feeling foolish but he knew that was precisely what he ought to do let her feel foolish let her come down here no more no good could come of it miguel returned to his writing table and finished his drink he would not allow himself to think about her having trouble enough without letting thoughts of his brothers wife confuse him better he should think of how to extract joachim waagenaar from his affairs miguel stumbled upon no solutions though the problem kept him awake many hours after the household had fallen into quiet he slipped up to the attic to awaken annetje and only after he had spent himself with her did he find any rest from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda since miguel lienzo developed an interest in the wondrous fruit i had been meeting him in a little coffee tavern in the plantage run by a turk i called mustafa this may have been his true name or it may not i have no way of knowing it was the name of the turk in a play i had seen once and this fellow reminded me of that fictional mohammedan if he objected to my calling him by that name he never told me so one afternoon when i met lienzo i had been fortunate enough to be served a most unusual delicacy by mustafa i was sitting and enjoying the drink when lienzo showed himself most eagerly he had enlisted my aid in a matter of whale oil and it had turned out rather well for him i hear youve done well i said as i signaled mustafa to bring a cup of the strange mixture hed been brewing how lucky you are to have alferonda as a friend i may have done well but i havent yet got that money miguel said the broker who bought it that fellow ricardo is refusing to pay me i knew ricardo probably better than miguel did and i could not have been less surprised what hes paid you nothing nothing hes promised in a month or so and meanwhile my muscovy agent is demanding i pay in full what i borrowed of him i for one advise that a man should always pay his debts but i have a proprietary interest in these matters mustafa now set the drink before miguel it was served in a little white bowl not much bigger than a hollowedout eggshell the drink inside had a yellow almost metallicgold color and there was not much of it for it was very expensive and very rare of course i would not say as much to miguel i would pay for his drink what is this he asked me you think there is only one kind of coffee coffee is like wine a hundred varieties and flavors a hundred nations around the world drink it each with its own preferences and each has pleasures for the discriminating drinker my turkish friend managed to get a small quantity of this treasure from the east indies and i convinced him to share it with us miguel sniffed as cautiously as a cat and after saying a blessing raised the little bowl to his lips his forehead wrinkled at once curious he said it is muskier than the other coffees ive had but at the same time thinner what is it its called monkey coffee i said there is a particular kind of beast in those tropical forests that eats the coffee fruit indeed it eats only the most perfect berries and so the locals have learned that a flavorful drink can be made from this creatures droppings miguel set down the bowl this is made from monkey turds i would not have put it so boldly but yes alonzo how can you have fed me this abomination besides being disgusting surely it violates the dietary laws how so it comes from a monkey and monkey flesh may not be eaten but can monkey turds be eaten i have never heard of them being forbidden if we may not eat its flesh how can we eat its turds i dont know i said with a shrug however i do know that a chicken is flesh but its eggs are neither flesh nor dairy thus we can conclude that the sages believed that what comes out of a creatures guts may not be of the same quality as the creature itself miguel pushed the bowl away from him you make a convincing case but i dont think ill drink any more shit brew i smiled and sipped at my own bowl i hear that paridos help is not so valuable as one might hope yes he said the brandy theres no way of knowing if he intended for me to lose out or if the change in price caught him by surprise of course he intended it parido has been your enemy these two years and when he suddenly declares himself your friend and acts on your behalf it costs you money i dont believe in mere happenstance miguel hes shown his colors i took at least as much from his pocket when i traded on whale oil that may be i observed but if you took that money from his pocket it has not shown up in yours are you saying that ricardos client is parido that its he who refuses to pay me it neednt be that direct parido could simply be using his influence to keep that money from you i suggest you press ricardo a little more forcefully you cant bring him before the maamad but you may be able to find other ways to make him yield have you any suggestions i shrugged if i think of something i will be certain to inform you thats not very helpful i feel like everything is getting away from me i earned money in whale oil but i cannot get it i begin a trade in coffee but the world warns me off it who has warned you isaiah nunes and my brother nunes trembles at the sound of his shit falling in his chamber pot you oughtnt let his cowardice affect you and as for your brother he is paridos creature before he is your kin what are you saying im saying that parido may know of your trade in coffee and want you to stay away from something that will make you successful you must remain fast and cling to your purpose i have no intention of doing otherwise he said that was precisely what i wanted to hear in the kitchen annetje chopped onions while hannah cleaned the soursmelling fish she slid the knife into its soft grayish belly fighting the fishs fibrous resistance and pushed up with more force than necessary the fish slid apart easily and she scraped its innards into a wooden bowl annetje would use the guts for a hutsepot she made out of ingredients permitted by jewsjoodspot she called it ive been thinking about your encounter with that old widow annetje said hannah didnt look up from the offal she had a few coffee beans in her apron but she did not want to touch them with her fishy fingers still the fruit called out to her she hadnt eaten one for hours now hours her supply had been running low and after her embarrassing visit to miguels cellar the night before she thought she had better make do with what little she had you must not say anything to senhor lienzosenhor miguel lienzo i mean of course you know you should not say anything to your husband ive been thinking of it as well hannah confessed and im not certain i should remain quiet that woman claims to be his friend he ought to know shes keeping secrets people must be permitted their secrets annetje said this time more generously she sprinkled a pinch of cinnamon onto a bowl of onions you have your secrets and you are better your husband is better and the world is better for your keeping them who is to say that the same is not true of the widow there had been a time when these words would have silenced her but now things were somehow different but we dont know that it is true her finger probed the meat under the fishs skin what if she means him harm i am sure it is nothing we need concern ourselves with and even if it were theres nothing to do about it you dont want her speaking of your secrets after all hannah thought about it for a moment but senhor miguel is not my husband he can be trusted to keep silent you dont know that you dont know the senhor like i do she closed her eyes perhaps not annetje bit into an onion as though it were an apple and chewed with her mouth wide open hannah had many times asked her not to eat onions if daniel learned that she helped herself so freely to their food he would lose himself in wrath hes found your behavior curious he told me you came to him in the cellar last night with your scarf askew and your hair exposed the girl would see a scarf askew if hannah used it to strangle her i didnt know it was loose until after i left him i think he found it exciting she said her mouth full of onion i smelled something in the cellar she said and i smell something now and its foul you cannot tell him he will betray you he cares more about his devils religion than he does you i can promise you that he thinks you are only a fool girl and if you speak to him hell discover how right he is why would he think me a fool for trying to help him help him nothing hell betray you for the pleasure of it i tell you that you must not trust him if you do speak to him i will consider myself betrayed do you understand me i understand you hannah said quietly thinking only of the coffee in her apron the letters started coming in all at once miguel had sat in the cellar lighted two oil lamps and opened the days correspondence hardly daring to hope but there it was a letter from a cousin of a friend who now lived in copenhagen he didnt understand why miguel needed to buy at a particular moment on a particular day but he was nonetheless willing to comply based on the commission proposed miguel made a celebratory bowl of coffee and read the rest of his letters nothing from prospective agents but the next day he heard from an old acquaintance in marseilles and a distant cousins husband in hamburg by the middle of the next week hed heard from three more a week later produced another four and surely more on the way the thing was nearly done there remained only one major problem to discuss with geertruid she suggested they walk to the plantage miguel thought a visit to the coffee tavern might be in order but geertruid had no interest there are things in life besides coffee she said you must not forget that i am a dutchwoman and like to drink great quantities of beer staying up all night to look at ledgers and booksthats for jews they walked along treelined paths where bright torches blazed to turn night into day handsomely attired couples passed by wealthy burghers with their beautiful or plain wives young couples out to gaze upon the fashionable life cleverly disguised thieves back in lisbon these happy pleasure seekers would have been well born and of old families but these were new men merchants of the exchange and their pretty wives the daughters of merchants miguel took geertruids arm in his and they strolled as though they were married but even if he had a wife could he take her to the verdant paths of the plantage no she would remain at home with the children and geertruid would still be the woman upon his arm geertruid raised her eyes and smiled at her friend she seemed to like nothing more than to stroll with him on such nights she had worn one of her most handsome gowns all dark blues and reds where do things stand she asked tell me all the wonderful tidings delight me with tales of our impending wealth things stand quite well miguel told her as soon as you have transferred the money to my account dear woman ill be able to pay my east indian merchant for the coffee from that time on we have to make certain weve contacted our agents and orchestrated the plan perfectly before the goods arrive i estimate two months two months she repeated dreamily two months and well have accomplished all you say you speak of it as though you anticipated trout for your dinner well i like trout he looked at her her face aglow in the torchlight dim enough to hide the imperfections of age they stopped to look at a sloppily erected stage where the players performed some adventures of the sea beggars maritime rebels who fought off the spanish tyrants to win the united provinces their freedom miguel had never bothered to learn the names of the celebrated heroes or the pivotal battles but geertruid became absorbed instantly they watched for a quarter hour and geertruid clapped and cheered with the crowd losing herself in girlish glee as the players spoke of the miraculous storm that saved the town of leiden from the spanish then she decided shed seen enough and began to walk again i must still coordinate with our agents for the exchanges he continued after a moment and do you have your agents selected miguel nodded i have contacts at this very moment in marseilles hamburg vienna antwerp paris and copenhagen a cousin of a friend of mine at this moment is in rotterdam but he plans to return to london and ill make arrangements with him soon enough i can handle the business in amsterdam myself still i foresee a few problems only a few problems geertruid said thoughtfully thats wonderful it is utterly wonderful i should have thought there might be countless problems but you have managed things so handsomely it is a great comfort to me miguel smiled at her he looked at her lips wondering if he saw a vaguely ironic smirk nevertheless you might wish to hear the nature of those problems i have every confidence in you but if you wish to speak of problems ill certainly listen miguel cleared his throat i am concerned about my ability to establish agents in the iberian exchanges lisbon madrid and perhaps oporto i have not continued to trade there and many of my former contacts there have fled to places of safety indeed the contacts i have in marseilles hamburg and antwerp are all refugees as i ammen i knew in lisbon cant you make new contacts youre an amicable enough fellow im still exploring that possibility but doing so is difficult when dealing with those nations a man such as myself must conceal his true name and not let it be known that he is of the hebrew faith to reveal that would invite rejection for any man whether a secret jew or no would fear to do business with a known jew should the inquisition learn of his activities it wouldnt hesitate to punish him for suspicion of being a judaizer that sounds like a rotten business the inquisition funds itself by confiscating the property of those they convict that makes merchants especially attractive to evil inquisitors can we proceed without those exchanges after all how many do we need we might perhaps fare well without oporto and even lisbon though i should hate to risk it we must however have madrid coffee has gained some small favor in the spanish court which acquires its fruit through the madrid bourse if we lose madrid the project fails whatever shall we do her voice was high and youthful as though she tested miguel to learn the depth of his concern there are always maneuvers and schemes in the world of trade it is all thrust and parry and its not such an impossible thing to perform a little alchemy and make leaden problems turn to golden opportunities i know you know your business so ill not worry unless you tell me to worry miguel began to turn left upon the path but geertruid pulled him right she had some destination in mind but offered no more hint than the slightest of smirks how soon do you think you can have the money transferred to my account he asked her should we not wait if this situation with madrid does not resolve itself and we have purchased the goods shall we not be the losers for it it cannot happen he assured herand himself they had now arrived at a wooden house far more handsomely put together than most geertruid led him inside to a welllit space decorated with sturdy wooden furniture drunken dutchmen perhaps a dozen of them staggered about and almost as many pretty girls in closefitting dresses served tankards and whispered into ears geertruid had taken him to a brothel what do we here he asked her oh i thought you a little lonely and i have heard such tales about a lass at this placethey made me quite blushand i wanted you to sample the goods for yourself i thought he said with a mockingly stern voice that we were to spend the evening together discussing our business concerns you may pretend you are with me if you like she told him but as to business i think we have concluded our talk an eagerlooking woman now appeared at miguels side and took his other arm she was small in height and slightly built but with a charmingly round face and full lips this must be the gentleman you spoke of she said to geertruid he is a fine one indeed senhor this charming creature is called agatha and i hope you will treat her as kindly as i would want to be treated myself miguel laughed if only i knew how kind that was geertruid tossed her head a sort of shrug i think we should conclude our conversation first before i take your generous gift he smiled at the girl so she would not feel unappreciated you are a mighty man to keep your mind upon business with two beauties on your arm agatha observed you need only tell me when i can expect the money to be transferred and we may forget the matter for tonight very well geertruid sighed i see you are not to be put off all the more lucky for our friend agatha who they say likes a determined fellow i can transfer the money before the end of the week if need be miguel had been sneaking a gaze at agathas lively brown eyes but he turned quickly to geertruid so soon you already have it geertruid pressed her lips together in a smile surely you dont think my words have been all wind you asked me to raise the money and i have done so if you have raised it why did you not tell me i should think after securing that kind of capitalno easy trickwould you not feel more celebratory indeed i do are we not celebrating here tonight miguel had been in trade long enough to know when someone lied to him and badly too he held himself absolutely still afraid to move until he thought this thing through why would geertruid lie two reasons she did not truly have the money or she did have the money but its source was not what she had earlier said miguel had not realized he had been quiet for so long until he saw both women staring at him you can transfer this week thats what i say why have you turned so dour you have your money and you have a woman what more could any man desire not a thing he said breaking free of their hold and placing a hand on both of their soft rumps it was a freedom he would not have normally taken with geertruid but she had taken one with him so why not return the favor as for her lie he would think no more of it tonight geertruid had her reasons and she had her secrets miguel was content to live with them i think the senhor would rather you than me agatha said to geertruid something flashed across the widows face i think youll soon discover what the senhor likes my dear he has something of a reputation agatha led him to a back room where miguel soon found he hardly thought at all about geertruids lies and what she might wish to conceal from so great a friend among his letters the next day miguel found a favorable note from his prospective agent in frankfurt he read the letter through with satisfaction and then tore open the next this one from the muscovy trader he politely explained that miguel still owed him a sum approaching nineteen hundred guilders and that as he knew of miguels past difficulties he could not let the matter rest i must demand immediate payment of half this debt or i am afraid i shall have no choice but to allow the courts to decide how i might most effectively see my money the courts meant another public humiliation before the bankruptcy board which would mean exposing both his connection to geertruid and his coffee scheme miguel swore drank a bowl of coffee and began his search of the most likely taverns luck was on his side that day for he found ricardo in the third place he looked sitting alone drinking a tankard of beer sullenly no business today miguel asked as to business ricardo answered without looking up you should mind your own miguel sat across from him make no mistake this is my business senhor you owe me a great deal of money and if you think im content to do nothing you are mistaken ricardo at last deigned to look up dont threaten me lienzo you dare not go to the dutch courts without risking the anger of the maamad and we both know that if you go to the maamad you run the risk of a ruling against you a ruling that could tie up your money for months or years you have no choice but to be patient so get you gone before you anger me and i obstruct you even further miguel swallowed hard what had he been thinking coming here ricardo was right he had nothing with which to threaten himexcept perhaps a public airing perhaps ill take my chances with the maamad he said if i dont get my money ill be no worse off than i am now and i can use a hearing as a public forum to expose you for the blackguard you are more than that i can expose your master indeed the more i think about it the more appealing this becomes to me the other parnassim are only swayed by him because they think him scrupulous if they learn about his tricks hell lose power i dont know what you are talking about ricardo said but he looked worried i am my own master you work for solomon parido he is the only one who might arrange this outrage and i intend to expose it if the money you owe me is not in my account by the close of business tomorrow you can be sure i will seek justice miguel left without waiting for a reply certain he had done what could be done but by the end of business the next day no money had been deposited in his account miguel realized he had no choice he could not risk a court appearance that would look into his funds so he transferred just over nine hundred guilders of geertruids money into the agents accounts he would worry about how to make up the money some other time the exchange heaved and pulsated around miguel as he sought out an east india company broker only half an hour ago a rumor had come sweeping through with the might of a collapsing building a powerful trading combination plotted to sell off a large portion of its east india shares often enough when a combination wished to buy it would circulate rumors that it wished to do just the opposite and the force of that rumor would drive prices down those who had invested with the idea of very short turnarounds would dump their stock at once miguel had been plying his trade on the exchange long enough to know how to use these rumors to his advantage whether or not they were based on truth whether the combination intended to buy or sell made no difference such were the riches of the orient that east india company stock alwaysalwaysrebounded from a dip and only a fool refrained from buying during a frenzy miguel had fortified himself that morning with three bowls of coffee rarely had he felt so awake so eager this madness could not have come at a more propitious time buyers and sellers pushed through the crowd frantically each screaming for his contacts as the usual cacophony of the exchange rose to nearmaddening levels a rotund little dutchman had his hat knocked off in the fray and after watching it trampled hurried away content to lose something worth a few guilders rather than risk losing thousands the men who dealt in diamonds tobacco grain and other such items and who shunned speculative trade stood by shaking their heads at the disruption of their business the east india shares were traded based on the percentage of their original value the shares had opened that morning at just over percent miguel found a broker and laid out guilders he did not have buying when the price dropped to he assured his agent that the money could be found in his exchange bank account though he knew that he could afford to spend no more of that money on his own trade once he had his shares in hand miguel moved toward the edge of the trading cluster to monitor the change in prices he then noticed solomon parido who also appeared to be buying company stock upon seeing miguel he sauntered over these combinations the parnass said loudly to make himself heard above the noise without them there would be no market they keep commerce moving in and out like the tides miguel nodded paying less attention to the parnass than to the sellers calling out their prices the shares had dropped again and were now selling at parido put a hand upon miguels shoulder i hear rumors senhor lienzo that things are on a new footing with youthat you have something planned sometimes a man may not desire to be the subject of rumors miguel told him with a smile he hoped looked genuine and now may not be such a good time to talk of this he gestured toward the crowd of east india stock dealers he heard a cry of pay that no mind east india stocks go up and down so fast it hardly matters what a man buys or sells this day or that surely you wouldnt want to insult a parnass by refusing to speak with him because of this mayhem miguel heard a call to buy for more than he had paid but not enough to think about selling i must be able to conduct my affairs he said trying to keep his voice calm i find it odd that you dont want to know the subject of these rumors on the maamad ive learned that when a man does not ask with what he is charged he is invariably guilty thats in the maamads chamber not on the exchange when that man is attempting to see to his business and ive not been charged with anything even so parido said the price dipped once more to and miguel felt the tug of panic not to worry he assured himself he had seen these dips before in moments of frenzy and they would last only a few minutes he had a moment to spare for this nonsense with parido but just a moment yet he could not quite stay calm then tell me what you have heard miguel said that you are upon some new venture something in the coffeefruit trade miguel waved a hand dismissively this coffee rumor plagues me maybe i should involve myself lest i disappoint so many eager devourers of rumor miguel heard new calls to sell youre not trading in coffee i wish i were senhor i long to undertake a trade of so much interest to men like youand my brother parido frowned it is a terrible sin punishable by the cherem to lie to a parnass before he could check himself the indignation fed by coffee became his master do you threaten me senhor we have a history filled with mistrust have we not lienzo i have spoken ill of you in the past but remember that you have spoken ill of me as well you must know that i have been more than willing to forgive your actions with my daughter and with the maid and her child the child wasnt mine and you know it miguel blurted out nor mine parido said with a thin smile nor anyone elses either i know about your little trick with the whore a few coins pressed in her hand and she told me everything ive known it for more than a year and yet i have never brought forward that information ive never used it to harm you and now i never can for how could i explain knowing something of such importance and keeping it secret all this time is that not proof enough that i am not the enemy you think i am miguel could think of nothing clever to say you have been very judicious senhor he managed in a croaking voice i believe kind is more the word but i would hate for my kindness to be misunderstood it hasnt been misunderstood has it what in the devil was he talking about no good parido patted miguel on the back i see youre upset so well continue this conversation another time if you have no interest in coffee that is the end of it but if i learn that you have lied to me in this that you have turned me away when i offer you friendship youll discover you have angered the wrong man miguel spun around and heard a buyer call for shares at what had happened since miguel had no choice other than to sell what he had rather than risk a sudden dip and lose everything within two days the price rose to but miguel had done little more with his shares than break even isaiah nunes looked half drunk more than half drunk miguel decided he looked fully drunk and half asleep they sat in the flyboat drinking thin provençal wine and miguel began to get the feeling that he was boring his friend he comes to me and speaks of friendship but he does all in his power to confuse me and prevent me from going about my trade nunes raised one eyebrow perhaps you had best keep your distance from parido that is sound advice miguel said but i have hardly been chasing after him both he and my brother hound me about coffee yet they seem to know nothing of my plans i told you to stay away from coffee i dont need to stay away from coffee i need to stay away from parido and my brother and i need a man or two in iberia well theyre hard to come by these days i hear you must have contacts miguel suggested nunes raised his head slightly what do you mean precisely what i mean is that if you know someone who can act as my agent in iberia i would be grateful if you would write to this person and tell him to expect to hear from me nunes began to shake his head what are you doing miguel you tell me that parido is troubling you looking to pry into your business and you want to involve me i wont risk paridos anger or even his notice he hardly recognizes me when he sees me on the street and i prefer it that way you already are involved miguel reminded him youre the one who is bringing my coffee into amsterdam and i regret having agreed to do it he said ask no more of me you wont put me in touch with your man in lisbon i have no man in lisbon nunes drained his glass four days later miguel found himself in need of a piss on a horsedrawn barge headed to rotterdam geertruid had not lied when she said that coffee would provoke urine and here he was his bladder full and nowhere to piss but in the canal there were women on this boat and though a dutchman would do his business without a second thought miguel could not bring himself to expose his alien member so freely he did not need a group of strange dutchwomen staring and pointing at his circumcised anatomy just another hour to rotterdam he told himself his old associate fernando de la monez would soon be leaving that city and heading back to london where he lived as he had in lisbon as a secret jew no amount of money would ever serve as incentive for miguel to once more take to worshiping in darkened rooms groping in ignorance for some semblance of jewish ritual all the while knowing that the world outside would see you dead before permitting this hidden and undignified exercise of faith in his letters fernando had insisted that things were not quite so bad in london there he said men of business knew him and his compatriots to be jews but they didnt mind so long as they were discreet in their practice there were perhaps a dozen or so other people on the long brightred boat drawn steadily along by a team of horses that clopped along the side of the canal it was of a flat design more like a raft than a boat but it was sturdy and included a hutlike structure in the center where passengers might take shelter during the rains miguel had been on larger horsedrawn boats some so large that a tap man sold the passengers beer and pastries but this conveyance was too small for such amenities miguel paid the other travelers no mind he hid from the mist in the muted light of the enclosed area and attempted to distract himself from his bladder with a tale of charming pieter it was one he had read many times concerning the cruel owners of a country estate who had robbed their tenants of their crops pieter and mary pretend to be regents interested in purchasing the land and once they gain the owners trust they rob them in the night stopping on their way out of the village to return to the peasants what belongs to them miguel had already looked through his pamphlet twice by the time the boat arrived and he wasted no time finding a private spot to take care of his pressing concerns once relieved of distractions he felt free to take in the city in many ways rotterdam was like a smaller neater version of amsterdam he had visited there often enough to know how to navigate its streets and he found the tavern fernando had specified with little difficulty there he and his friend met and discussed the particulars of fernandos duties in london s exchange fernando seemed puzzled by miguels insistence that the trades take place at a particular time but he agreed nonetheless once miguel assured him that nothing he did would in any way bring suspicion upon him or the fragile community of jews in london it grew late by the time they had finished and miguel accepted fernandos offer to remain in rotterdam where he attended evening prayers at the small synagogue and then took the morning boat to amsterdam he settled into his wooden bench on the boat and closed his eyes thinking of what tasks remained to him before he could consider the coffeefruit scheme in hand in the cool of the morning he fell asleep he knew not how long and awoke from a hazy dream with a loud mutter embarrassed he looked around to see who had heard him a quick glance told him he recognized no one and he almost turned back to his thoughts before something caught his eye he looked again in the back of the boat quietly engaged in private conversation he saw a pair of finely dressed gentlemen miguel dared take only a passing glance but it was enough for him to see they wore beards true they were cut very short but beards all the same one man was particularly dark and his closely shorn facial hair crept like a black fungus halfway down his throat any dutchman would shave such a thing away the only man who would wear his beard thus was a jewone trying hard not to look jewish there could be no mistake about it these were maamad spies when the boat reached amsterdam miguel walked a short distance out of his way to see if the two men would follow him but after huddling together in a brief meeting of bobbing heads they both walked off toward the exchange miguel stood for a few minutes by the canal and gazed at the overcast sky before buying a pear from an old woman with a pushcart it tasted mealy like parsley root and after one bite he threw it down on the road the woman urged her wobbling cart along determined not to notice miguels displeasure while two filthy boys lunged for the remains rolling the taste of bad pear around in his mouth for a moment miguel decided that the day was too far gone for there to be much to do on the exchange so he headed home the spies had disordered him and he kept turning around searching for signs of treachery in beggars and servants and burghers as they strolled along the streets this is no way to live he told himself he could not spend his days jumping at every shadow but just when he had convinced himself to be calm he crossed the bridge into the vlooyenburg and saw hannah in the middle of the streetdespite the veil miguel recognized her instantlyand alongside her annetje and joachim waagenaar joachim had backed them into a corner there was nothing threatening in his gestures and he appeared calm a passing stranger might not have noticed anything oddalthough it would have been unusual for a veiled woman to speak casually with so low a man annetje saw miguel first her face brightened and she sucked in her breath her bosoms heaved in the pretty blue bodice that matched her handsome cap oh senhor lienzo she exclaimed save us from this madman miguel answered in portuguese addressing hannah has he harmed you speechless she shook her head no then the stench hit him the wind must have shifted for the smell drifted in his direction miguel felt himself overwhelmed the dutch were a fastidiously even recklessly clean people washing themselves far more frequently than was healthy for the body joachim had clearly abandoned the practice he smelled more foul than the least washed portuguese peasant it was more than odors of the body too but smells of urine and vomit andit took miguel an instantrotted meat how does a man smell of rotted meat he shook his head trying to break the numbing effect of the stench hurry home he told hannah speak of this to no one and keep the girl quiet they began to ease away from joachim be sure she knows to hold her tongue he said to hannah or ill turn her out he turned to joachim step back to miguels relief he did so the women slipped past him pressing their backs against the wall to increase as much as they could the distance between themselves and the dutchman as soon as they had cleared him they hurried into a brisk walk lets go miguel demanded across the bridge now again joachim obeyed like a servant who has been caught by his master at something naughty miguel looked around to see if anyone he knew had witnessed the encounter and muttered a prayer in thanks to the holy one blessed be he that the spies had not followed him home and that this disaster had happened during the hours of the exchange when any man who might wish him ill was off attending to business once they had crossed the bridge over the houtgracht miguel led joachim to a little thicket of trees by the canal where they could speak unobserved have you nothing left of your former self how dare you approach my brothers wife miguel shifted his position to put himself downwind of joachim lessening the stench a bit joachim hardly looked at him instead he watched a duck that pecked at the ground near their feet oblivious to the two men why do you go on about your brothers wife i approached your whore too dont forget he said she is a luscious one senhor do you think shed have me she seems to me the sort whod take to just about anyone miguel sucked in a breath dont let me see you bother anyone of my family again dont let me see you in the vlooyenburg as if he had never existed the softspoken compliant joachim was replaced by the angry one or what should happen tell me what you will do senhor if you find me upon your streets talking with your neighbors telling tales tell me what will you do miguel let out a sigh surely you want something you didnt come to the vlooyenburg because you have nothing better to do with your time as it happens i have nothing better to do with my time i have proposed that we engage together in some business or other but youve rejected my proposals and made sport of me no one has made sport of you miguel said after a moment and as to this matter of business i hardly know what you mean you wish me to set you up in some project but i know not what that would be i cant even think of what i might do to satisfy you and i have far too much to do to take the time to puzzle out your meaning but thats my very point you have much to do but i have so little i thought perhaps your brothers wife or her pretty servant might feel the same waya little too much time which our preachers tell us is the source of much evil in the world people take their time and they use it to think and do evil instead of using it to think and do good it occurred to me that i might help you by giving your family a chance to do good works through charity i was under the impression that salvation through works was a catholic principle not one of the reformed church oh you jews are so clever you know everything but still theres value in charity senhor i begin to believe that you have not acted on our plans to engage upon a business venture and so my mind must in the absence of other options turn to charity ten guilders would go a long way toward removing me from the vlooyenburg miguel pulled back disgusted joachims stench hovered thick in the air and if i havent ten guilders to give you he folded his arms determined to be put upon no longer if you havent the money senhor anything might happen he flashed his hideous grin bravery and prudence might not always appear to be compatible virtues miguel told himself as he opened his purse and a wise man knows when to bow to circumstance charming pieter himself might have preferred to take his revenge another time but miguel did not know if his pride could stomach pieters philosophy in this instance he briefly considered giving him more than ten guilders the funds geertruid had entrusted to him had already diminished significantly what mattered if they diminished more what if he were to pay joachim a hundred guilders right now even two hundred when offered the coin joachim might think himself content with so little surely a man in his condition would not turn away a hundred guilders maybe the reasonable man miguel had once known was truly lost but was it not possible that money could be the thing to restore him perhaps he was like the woman in an old tale who needed only a magical shoe or ring to return her to her former beauty give joachim a bath a good meal and a soft bed to sleep on and hope for the future and would he wake up himself if you came to me like a decent man miguel said at last and only asked me for the money in a humble way i would help you but these tricks of yours make me disinclined go away the next time i see you here ill beat you senseless do you know what makes me smell so wretched joachim demanded his voice growing loud and shrill without waiting for an answer he reached into his pocket and pulled out a lump of something gray and slick andit took miguel a moment to see that it was not merely a trick of his eyesmoving its rotten chicken flesh i put it in my pocket to offend you and your ladies he laughed and threw the meat upon the ground miguel stepped back you would be surprised how quickly a poor man learns where to buy maggoty flesh and sour milk empty bellies must be filled with something though my dainty goodwife has no love of rancid victuals come joachim took a step closer he held out his right hand which was still slick from the meat let us shake upon our new friendship get gone miguel hated to cringe but he would not touch the mans flesh ill go when i choose if you dont shake my hand like a man of honor ill be insulted and if im insulted i may have to do something that will harm you forever miguel clenched his teeth until they began to ache he hadnt the energy to spare in wondering when joachim in his madness might decide to tell his story before the maamad but giving the fool money would not help hed drink it and then demand more miguels only choice was to give him nothing and hope for the best go now miguel said quietly before i lose hold of my anger miguel turned wanting to hear no reply but joachims quiet parting words echoed in his ears as he walked home ive only just begun to take hold of mine miguel slammed the door upon his return sending a ripple through the house and through hannahs body she had been sitting in the drawing room drinking hot wine annetje had tried to comfort her by insisting that she calm herselfthough hannah had shown no signs of agitationand by assuring her that she did not want to have to slap her she knew he would come for her he would come for her and calm her attempt to placate her silence her as the widow had that was all they wanted from her and at least she thought silence was something she knew how to provide after a moment he entered the room he offered her a hapless smile in an effort to appear at ease his black suit was disordered as though he had been exerting himself and his hat sat askew on his head what was more his eyes had turned reddish almost as though he had been crying which hannah considered unlikely she knew that sometimes when he grew intensely angry a redness spread across his eyes like blood poured into a bucket of milk miguel then turned to annetje his expression hard silently asking her to leave hannah tried to hide her smile at least someone dared to be harsh to the girl the moment annetje stood however miguel went after her outside the drawing room in the front hall hannah could hear miguel whispering to her in rapid dutch she couldnt understand the muffled words but she sensed that he was giving her instructions explaining something very carefully listening to the girl repeat everything back to him miguel returned sat down in a chair across from hannah and leaned forward hands pressing on his thighs he appeared somewhat more orderly now perhaps he had straightened his clothes in the hall or corrected his hat in the mirror the buoyant handsomeness that had drained from his appearance had been restored i trust you are unharmed senhora yes i am unharmed she said quietly her voice sounded strange in her own mouth so long had she been thinking about what he would say and what she would answer that speaking at all had an unreal quality did the fellow say anything to you she shook her head as she spoke nothing of consequence it was true enough he had talked to her softly in thickly accented portuguese but his words had been nonsensical hard to understand they were about his suffering much like any beggar might speak and it had been hard to concentrate with the wretched odor wafting from his body miguel leaned back now in an effort to appear at ease do you have a question for me yes she thought may i have more coffee berries her supply had run out that morning and she had meant to raid miguels secret sack before he returned but the girl had not let her alone and then came the business with the beggar on the street shed eaten no coffee in more than a day and her desire for it made her head ache i dont understand she said after a moment would you like to know who he is i assumed she said cautiously he was some beggar or other senhor i have no need to learn more had she not secrets enough already yes thats right he told her he is a beggar of sorts something unspoken remained in the air but you know him he is no one of consequence miguel said rapidly she remained silent for a moment to prove to him that she was calm i do not wish to pry i know how my husband hates when i pry but i wonder if i have anything to fear from him and then because she found his silence frustrating should we tell my husband no miguel said he stood and began to pace about the room you must not tell your husband or anyone else do not make more of this incident than is necessary i dont understand you senhor she said studying the tiles on the floor he is but a madman miguel waved his arms about the city has an endless store of these wretches youll never see him again and so there is no need to alarm your husband i pray you are right her voice sounded whiny and weak and she hated herself for it just then annetje returned with a platter in her hands upon which she balanced two bowls of a dark liquid steam poured off from them like twin chimneys the maid set down the tray and paused to glare at miguel before departing miguel laughed after she had left she thinks im poisoning you what would the widow say there are two bowls senhor you are too wise a man to poison yourself as well miguel cocked his head slightly this is the new tea you smelled the other night it is made of a medicinal fruit from the orient he took his seat once more it will enhance your understanding hannah did not think she wanted her understanding enhanced she felt she understood well enough unless the drink imparted knowledge and wisdom also it would hardly do her any service you take it as well but i dont believe senhor needs his understanding enhanced he laughed the drink has its own pleasures he handed her a bowl hannah gripped it in both hands and smelled it it was familiar like something from a dream then she took a sip and knowledge flowed into her this was coffeeglorious glorious coffeehere before her like a gift from the heavens she understood so much now it was a tea not a food she had been eating what she should have been drinking in its liquid state it filled her with a glowing warmth a comfort she had not known for years its wonderful she breathed and it was it filled an emptiness inside her the way she had imagined love would when shed been younger its wonderful she murmured again and took another sip to hide the moisture in her eyes miguel laughed again but this time he seemed less superior the first time i tasted it i almost spat it out from the bitterness how strange that you should like it so i hope you are not only saying so to be polite she shook her head no and took another cautious sip lest he see her gulp it she wanted to drink the entire bowl at once and demand more but she could not let him see how much she loved this thing that she should not know at all i am not being polite she said they sat together in silence for some time sipping and not quite looking at each other until hannah felt the urge to speak it was as though something had broken inside of her some kind of restraint she wanted to stand up and walk around the room and speak she did not stand but she did at last decide to say something i believe you are trying to distract me senhor do you treat me to this new tea so i shall forget the strange man who spoke to me she almost put a hand to her mouth she ought never to have said such a thing it was precisely the kind of sauciness her father would have answered with a slap but it was said and there was nothing to do but see what happened now miguel looked at her and something flashed across his face something hannah found pleasing i did not mean to distract you i only wished toto share this with you you are generous she said astonished by her own boldness before the words had even passed her lips could she not control herself now had some demon taken her body from her you think me elusive he said looking upon her as though she were some new discovery of natural science but ill tell you all you see that man is a terrible villain he has a daughter whom he wishes to marry to a very old and mean merchant a miser of the worst sort he arranged that her true love should be abducted by pirates but he learned of the incident and fled the daughter has fled too so the miser knowing that i am friends with the lovers came to try to force me to give him their location hannah laughed loud enough that this time she felt obliged to place a hand over her mouth this tragedy of yours would play prettily upon the stage for a moment she wished her fatheror anyone elsewas there to slap her how could she have spoken so pertly nevertheless it was true miguels lie sounded like the stage plays she had seen with some regularity back in lisbon some men took their wives to the jewish theater here in amsterdam but daniel thought it improper for a woman her foot rotated back and forth like a pigeon by a bakers stall searching for crumbs this coffee is not a drink of the mind she realized it is a drink of the body and the mouth and it made her want to say all sorts of things i find you remarkably attractive how i wish i could have married you instead of your cold brother she said none of them she still could censor herself you dont believe me senhora i believe you must imagine me to be remarkably foolish to accept your tale the words seemed to come out on their own her parents had always taught her to be mild her husband had indicated with a thousand unsaid words that he would tolerate only mildness from her yet she did not feel mild she had never felt mild but she had never before forgotten to act mild the coffee she told herself miguel has knowingly or not bewitched me and perhaps himself how long until they began to shout insults at each other or fell into an unrestrained embrace there was no point putting the blame on coffee the drink had not bewitched her no more than a glass of wine could cast a magic spell it made her eager in the same way wine rendered her calm this sauciness this pertness that grew inside her mouth came not from witchery but from herself the coffee drink only let her bad behavior out in recognizing the truth in admitting it to herself much became clear to her but nothing so much as a resolution she would be pert and saucy every chance she had for the nonce however she had her most distressing encounter to contend with and no amount of coffee or wine or any other tea she could think of would make the true terror she had felt any less real she found miguels efforts to deceive her both charming and infuriating i know that the world does not work the way it does in plays and that misers do not send their daughters lovers into the hands of pirates she paused nevertheless you can depend on me to keep your secret miguel leaned back and looked at hannah as though seeing her for the first time he glanced at her face her neck his eyes lingered at the swell of her breasts concealed in her highnecked gown men often thought women had no idea of what their eyes studied but a woman knew as surely as though a glance left a handprint he had looked at her before of course she had sensed that he admired her face and her shape but this glance was something different miguel and men like him rarely thought much of the women they admired and bedded a woman was an object sometimes to be consumed like food other times to be admired like a painting miguel now saw her as something more and the idea of it thrilled her i trust and believe your promise of silence he told her so ill tell you the truth the man you saw has an old grudge against me for a wrong that was none of my doing and he wishes to ruin me he understands the ways of our community well enough to know how to ruin with whispers as easily as with deeds and that is why you must not speak of what happened he had entrusted her with the truth and she still betrayed him with her silence then i wont speak of it she said her voice hardly above a whisper senhora miguel shifted uneasily i beg that your silence extends to your husband i know that such vows of secrecy often include an implicit exception for the special bonds of matrimony but in this case it is very important that your good husband know nothing hannah sipped at her coffee a black mulch had formed at the bottom and not knowing if she should drink it and thinking it would be rude to ask she set the bowl back down i of all people know what my good husband should and should not hear ill not tell him but you must promise me something he raised an eyebrow of course that you will let me drink coffee again she said soon i would consider drinking coffee with you a great pleasure he said warmly she studied his face were i a servant or a tavern girl he would kiss me at this moment but i am his brothers wife he wont kiss me ever he has too much honor unless of course she thought i kiss him first but that was unthinkable and she blushed at her own boldness well then she said with a sigh ill call the girl to clear away the dishes lest my husband come home and find that weve been secreted together drinking forbidden things she enjoyed the look of wonder upon miguels face for a moment before relieving him of his discomfort by ringing for the maid miguel believed he had learned a great deal that day about women and about hannah he could never have imagined what spirit lurked beneath her quiet exterior he had feared the worst of her that she would repeat all she knew to every wife in the vlooyenburg it seemed inevitable that a silly woman would run off with this bit of gossip like a dog who snatched a piece of meat from the kitchen counter now he believed he could depend upon her to be quiet he couldnt explain why he had given her the coffee why he had confessed to her what he wanted to hide from daniel it had been an impulse to give her something a new secret to make her feel the bond of trust between them perhaps it had been sound reasoning and perhaps not but the thrill of trusting her had been impossible to resist and he knew with absolute certainty that she would not betray him miguel shook his head and cursed himself did he not have enough trouble without looking for unspeakable intrigues if something were to happen to daniel he thought he would happily take a closer look at hannah and a man might die in many ways disease accident murder miguel took a moment to indulge in thoughts of daniels body being dragged from a canal his eyes openly staring at death his skin somewhere between blue and white he felt remorse at his pleasure in such thoughts but they left him less agitated than thoughts of removing hannah from the unhappy bondage of her clothing wasnt coffee supposed to inhibit such thoughts but even coffee was no match for the thrill of hannahs conversation he had always thought the girl no more than a simple and pretty thing charming but empty now he knew it had all been for show an act to placate her husband give the woman a bowl of coffee and her true self blossomed how many other women he wondered merely played the fool to escape the notice of their men the thought of a world peopled with cunning and duplicitous women did nothing to calm his spirits so he said his afternoon prayers adding his silent thanks to the holy one blessed be he for having disposed of joachim without all of the vlooyenburg knowing of his business miguel soon learned his thanks were premature he had thought it fortunate that joachim had pulled his impudent prank while the men of the vlooyenburg were scattered about the city in pursuit of their business but he had forgotten to account for the women women who sat in their parlor chairs and stood in their kitchens with their eyes upon the streets praying that this day heaven would release them from their tedium by manifesting the miracle of scandal joachims crude behavior had been witnessed from doorways and windows and side streets wives and daughters and grandmothers and widows had seen it all and they had talked eagerly to one another and to their husbands by the time miguel saw daniel that evening there was hardly a jew in amsterdam who did not know that a strange man had threatened hannah and her maid and that miguel had driven him off supper creaked under the weight of the incident miguels brother hardly spoke a word and hannahs weak attempts at conversation failed utterly later daniel crept down to the cellar he took a seat in one of the old chairs his feet slightly lifted out of the damp and remained silent long enough to expand the discomfort that already crept over them his eyes half focused on miguel while he poked at a back tooth all the while making sucking noises finally he extracted his finger what do you know of this man it does not concern you the words sounded feeble even in miguels own ears of course it concerns me only rarely did daniel lose his temper with miguel he might condescend and lecture and express his disappointment but he shied away from anything like anger do you know that this encounter is so upsetting to hannah that she will not even speak of it what horrors have befallen my wife that she will not gossip miguel felt some of his own anger subside he had asked hannah to protect a secret and she had done so he could not let himself worry about what damage he had done to his brothers domestic quiet daniel after all only believed his wife upset im sorry hannah had a scare but you know i would never let her come to harm and that foolish maid every time i try to inquire of her what happened she pretends not to be able to understand what i say the girl understands my dutch well enough when i go to pay her wages you are more practiced with those words miguel suggested dont play the fool miguel and dont play the father with me my younger brother miguel boomed i assure you i am not playing your father daniel replied tartly i am playing the father to an unborn son and i am playing the husband a role that would have taught you much had you not botched your agreement with senhor parido miguel almost lashed out with some hateful words but he checked his tongue in this case he knew his brothers grievance had merit i am truly sorry that anyone unpleasant should have had contact with the senhora you know i would never consciously expose her to any danger this matter was nothing of my doing everyone is full of this miguel i cannot tell you how many conversations broke into harsh whispers at my approach today i hate hearing people talking of my business of how my own wife had to be saved from a madman set upon her by your doings perhaps that was the source of daniels anger he did not like that it was miguel who had saved hannah from the madman i had always believed you had larger concerns than what wives and widows say about you make sport if you like but this kind of behavior is a danger to us all you have threatened the safety not only of my family but of our entire nation what madness is this miguel demanded of what threat to our nation do you speak your wife and annetje were accosted by a madman i fended him off i hardly understand why that should be fodder for scandal we both know there is more to it first i hear you have dealings with the heretic alferonda now i have heard that this man who accosted hannah was seen speaking to you two weeks ago i have heard he is a dutchman with whom you have an irresponsible familiarity and now he lashes out at my wife and my unborn child you have heard a great deal miguel answered i might even go so far as to say it hardly matters if it is truethe harm may be the same either way i have no doubt the maamad would regard these transgressions very seriously you speak very authoritatively for the maamad and its outdated policies daniel looked worried as though they were in public miguel you go too far i go too far he snapped because i disagree with the maamad in private i think you have lost your ability to judge the difference between power and wisdom you mustnt criticize the council without its guidance this community would be lost the maamad was instrumental in creating this community but now it rules without accountability or mercy it threatens excommunication for the slightest offense even the act of questioning its wisdom shouldnt we be jews in freedom rather than in fear daniels eyes widened in the flickering candlelight we are foreigners in a land that despises us and needs only an excuse to cast us out the council stands between us and another exile is that what you wish to bring ruin upon us this is amsterdam daniel not portugal or spain or poland how long must we live here before the maamad understands that the dutch are not like these others do not their clergy condemn us their clergy condemn us but they condemn paved streets and lighted rooms and food with flavor and sleeping while lying down and anything else that might bring pleasure or comfort or profit the people mock their preachers you are naive if you think we cannot be expelled here as we have been elsewhere miguel sucked his teeth in frustration you hide in this neighborhood with your countrymen knowing nothing of the dutch and so you think them evil because you cannot trouble yourself to learn otherwise this land rebelled against its catholic conquerors and then allowed the catholics to continue to live among them what other nation has done such a thing amsterdam is a stew of foreigners the people thrive on having aliens around them daniel shook his head ill not say you are wrong about these things but you are not going to change the maamad it will continue to act as though we are in danger at every moment and it is better for it to do so than grow complacent particularly when solomon parido is a parnass you must treat the maamads power with respect thank you for your advice miguel said icily ive not yet given you advice my advice is that you do nothing to endanger my family you are my brother and ill do what i can to shield you from the council even if i think youre deserving of its anger but ill not place you before my own wife and unborn son miguel could say nothing there is more daniel said he paused to play with a tooth for a moment i have not said anything of this to you before he mumbled one finger still in his mouth because i knew you to be in a great deal of difficulty but i have heard that things have changed with you there is the matter of the money i lent yousome fifteen hundred guilders miguel nearly gasped the loan had been like a fart at shabbat meal everyone notices but no one says a word after all these months daniel now finally spoke of the money and the spell of silence was broken we have all heard about your success in the whaleoil tradewhich came i might add at the expense of other men in any case now that you have some guilders in your account i thought you might repay me at least a portion of what you owe i should very much like to see a thousand guilders transferred into my account tomorrow miguel swallowed hard daniel you were very good to lend me that money and of course i will repay it when i can but i have not yet received the funds due to me from that trade you know that broker ricardo he wont pay me or disclose his client i know ricardo ive always found him a reasonable man then perhaps you might reason with him if he pays me what he owes i will be happy to lighten my debt to you i have heard daniel said now staring at the floor that you have more than two thousand guilders in your exchange account right now i must conclude that the rumors you have been spreading about ricardo are an abuse of a good mans name meant to help you avoid paying your debts geertruids money how had he learned of it that is not money from ricardo it is money from a partner for a business transaction and accounts at the exchange bank are supposed to be private little can remain private in amsterdam miguel you should know that by now nothing was so infuriating as daniel playing the great merchant with him i cannot give you any of that money it is not mine to give whose is it thats a private matter though im sure no such private matters are beyond your reach why private are you brokering for gentiles again do you dare to risk the wrath of the maamad after you have so angered senhor parido i never said i was brokering for gentiles but you dont deny it either i suppose all this is related to your coffee dealings i told you to stay away from coffee that it would ruin you but you would not listen no one has been ruined why do you jump to these absurd conclusions ill have at least part of that money before you lose it daniel assured him i must insist that you transfer a thousand guilders to me if you are unwilling to pay a portion of your debt to me when you have money he said you insult the charity i have offered you and your continuing to live here will no longer be acceptable for a fleeting instant miguel seriously considered murdering his brother he imagined himself running daniel through with a blade of beating his head in with a candlestick strangling him with a rag the outrage of it all daniel knew that if miguel moved out took his own lodgings the world would see it as a sign of his solvency and his creditors would descend and pick away with their ravenous beaks until there was nothing left there would be demands and challenges and hearings before the maamad it would be only a matter of days before his dealings with geertruid were exposed i might consider an alternative however daniel said after a moment what alternative i might withhold my demand for the money you have long owed me in exchange for information about your coffee dealings and perhaps the opportunity to invest in your project why will you not believe that i have no dealings in coffee miguel demanded daniel stared at him for a moment and then looked away ive given you your options miguel you may do as you like daniel had given him no choice surrender a thousand guilders now or lose everything in a matter of days ill transfer the funds to you miguel said but you must know that i resent your demands which harm my business and make it all the more difficult for me to extricate myself from my debts but i promise you this i will not allow your pettiness to undermine my affairs ill be out of debt in a matter of months and it is you who will come begging to me for scraps daniel smiled thinly well see he said the next morning miguel swallowed the bitter medicine of transferring the funds to his brother he nearly choked as he gave the order to the clerk at the exchange bank but it had to be done as he went about his business that day he tried hard not to recollect that of the three thousand guilders geertruid had entrusted to him little more than a thousand remained from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda i believe i may have mentioned that miguel lienzo was some years my senior and i did not know him well when i was a boy i knew his brother however and if i had not heard from my father that miguel was a superior and wily boy i would have had no interest in knowing more of the family daniel lienzo was a child who knew his assets and shortcomings from an early age he had not nearly the physical strength of the other boys we played with but he was much faster understanding how to manage his gifts he would have nothing to do with games of wrestling but insisted we race all day he only wanted to play at sport in which he could win though he was known to be his fathers favorite he complained bitterly about his older brother unable to accept the unfairness that miguel should be older larger and farther along in the world my brother wastes his time studying jewish books he would tell us in conspiratorial whispers as if the rest of us were not secreted away by our fathers and taught forbidden things by candlelight my brother thinks himself a man already daniel complained he is always after the serving girls daniel would have studied torah if only to prove himself his brothers master he would have chased girls though he knew not what to do with them if only to prove he could catch where his brother could not the idea was absurd miguel had a quicker mind than daniel and his appearance was far more pleasing to the ladies still daniel could never forgive the slight of being born second i can recall that when i was but twelve years of age only a few months before we fled lisbon daniel came to us and said he had a trick he wanted to play his older brother had spirited a kitchen girl away into a quiet closet in their house and he thought it would be amusing to expose them of course it was a foolish thing to do but we were children and doing foolish things had a great deal of appeal we followed daniel into his fathers house and then up three flights of stairs until we stopped outside an old door that sat crooked on its hinges daniel signaled for us to be quiet and then threw open the door there we saw miguel sitting on a cushion with a serving girl no more than his own age her dress was in a state of disrepair and it was clear she had been behaving as no good girl ought the two of them reacted to our presence with utter confusion and in truth we reacted in utter confusion too the girl attempted to lower her skirts and close her bodice in a single gesture and frustrated at her efforts broke into tears she called upon the virgins mercy she was undone miguel reddened not from embarrassment but indignation leave us he hissed you may tease a man but only a coward teases a young woman before we had been only eager and curious and full of childish giggles over we knew not what now we were shamed by our curiosity and his hard glare wed committed a crime we were too young to understand and our lack of understanding made it all the more terrible we all backed up and raced down the stairs but i paused because i saw that daniel did not move he stood in the doorway preventing miguel from closing it i could not see his eyes but i somehow knew he stared hard at miguel the girl i dont know but he was utterly unmoved by miguels majestic wrath or the girls tears go miguel told him cant you see the girl is distressed but daniel stood there staring listening to the girls muted sobbing he never moved for as long as i dared to remain for what reason do i mention this my reader may wonder well it is to help explain some of the animosity between these two men which went back many years and was as near as i could tell utterly senseless but such was the way with these brothers thus the reader may not be entirely surprised to learn that it was daniel lienzo himself who owed miguel more than two thousand guilders in whaleoil debt far from being in debt to his brother miguel was his creditor and never once suspected it the letters had been coming in at the rate of two or three a week and miguel stayed up late straining his eyes against the thin light of a single oil lamp to answer them animated by coffee and the thrill of impending wealth he worked with jubilant determination making sure his agents understood precisely what he required of them miguel had not seen geertruid since his return from rotterdam which made it easy to avoid dwelling on having lost most of her capital he knew of men who had lost their partners money and they invariably broke down in confession immediately as though the burden of living in falseness was too much to endure miguel felt he could live with the falseness as long as the world let him get away with it nevertheless he wanted to see geertruid and tell her of his progress and he had other things to say too but geertruid was nowhere to be found it was a cursed time for her to hide herself miguel sent messages to all the most likely taverns and paid visits to those places at even the most unlikely hours but he found no sign of her once by coincidence he ran into hendrick who stood idly near the damrak he leaned against a wall and busied himself with his pipe watching as men and women paraded past him ho jew man he called out he puffed smoke cordially in miguels direction miguel hesitated a moment wondering if he could pretend to have neither seen nor heard hendrick but it was no good what news of madam damhuis he asked what hendrick asked you dont ask after my health you injure me i am sorry for the injury miguel said he had over time learned to defuse hendricks bombast by pretending to take it seriously as long as youre sorry thats the important thing but its madam damhuis you want and i cant hope to serve as madam damhuis serves i havent her charms was he jealous do you know where i might find her i havent seen her hendrick turned his head and blew a long cloud of smoke perhaps at her home miguel began hopefully oh no not at her home still i should not mind looking for myself miguel pressed wishing he could be more clever and subtle where might i find her home its not for me to say hendrick explained you foreigners are perhaps not so clear about our customs if madam damhuis has not told you it would not be my place to do so thank you then miguel said as he hurried off eager to waste no more time if i see her hendrick called after him ill be sure to give her your regards such was his luck that day he decided on a whim to visit the coffee tavern in the plantage but when the turk mustafa opened the dooronly a crackhe stared suspiciously at miguel im senhor lienzo he said ive been here before this is not the time for you the turk said i dont understand i thought this was a public tavern go away the turk said and closed the door hard hannah sat in the dining room eating her breakfast of whiteflour bread with good butter and some yellow apples that an old woman had been peddling doortodoor the previous evening her wine was more heavily spiced and not nearly so watered down as usual annetje knew how to be parsimonious with the wine and generous with the watermore wine for herself that wayso hannah understood what the strength of her drink meant the maid wanted to talk with her and so tried to loosen her tongue miguel had given her coffee and now annetje gave her wine the world plied her with drink in order to make her do its bidding this thought saddened her but even so hannah could not quite forget the thrill of having consumed miguels coffee she loved learning the true nature of that fruit she loved the way it made her feel animated and alive it was not as though she discovered a new self rather coffee reordered the self she already had things at the top sank to the bottom and the parts of herself she had chained down rose buoyantly she had forgotten to be demure and modest and she loved casting off those constraints she now recognized perhaps for the first time how miguel had always seen her quiet foolish stupid those iberian virtues of femininity held no allure for him he enjoyed connivers like annetje and his wicked widow well she could be wicked too the thought almost made her laugh aloud of course she could not be wicked but she could want to be wicked annetje came up from the kitchen and stood in the doorway eyeing as hannah had suspected she would the nowempty goblet daniel and miguel had both left to attend to their business so the girl took a seat at the table which she loved to do when they were alone together poured herself some wine from the decanter and drank it down quickly apparently unconcerned with how loose her own tongue became did you and the senhor have a pleasant talk yesterday she began hannah smiled you didnt listen at the door something violent flickered across annetjes face you spoke too rapidly in your language i could hardly understand a word of it he asked me not to talk of what had happened i am sure he told you the same thing he did but he did not give me any special potions to make me obey perhaps he has more faith in my silence perhaps he does hannah agreed and perhaps youve no faith in mine thats what you want to know about yes if i spoke to him about the widow well i would know if you spoke about the widow you may count on that just as i know from your face now that you havent but that youve done something else hannah said nothing she cast her eyes downward feeling the familiar rush of shame that gripped her when she spoke out of turn or made eye contact with a guest of her husbands annetje arose and took a seat next to her she took hannahs right hand in both of hers are you ashamed of talking so intimately with the senhor she asked sweetly her pretty green eyes locking onto hannahs i dont think it so wrong that you should enjoy a little innocent congress the women of my nation do so every day and no harm comes to them she squeezed hannahs hand between hers here was the annetje who had first shown herself who had lured hannah into revealing her secrets hannah would have no more of it i dont see anything evil in speaking with him i may say what i like to whom i like of course you are right annetje cooed lets forget this incident altogether shall we go this afternoon go has it been so long that you do not recall both had understood from the beginning that the name of the place must never be spoken aloud not in the house not in the vlooyenburg not anywhere jews or maamad spies might lurk hannah swallowed she had known this conversation must come and she had done all she could to brace herself even so she felt unprepared and perhaps even surprised i cannot go you cannot go annetje asked are you afraid because of that silly widow its not that hannah told her i wont risk it my child the child again she snapped you act like no one has ever been with child before i wont take any more chances god has shown me he has warned me of the dangers i was almost caught once and i would be a fool to ignore his mercy god did not save you annetje told her i did i am the one who saved you from being discovered god will damn you to hell if you do not go today and your child too hannah shook her head i dont believe it you know its true the maid said petulantly well see how many nights you can endure lying awake knowing that if you are to die in your sleep you are destined for hells torments then you will change your mind perhaps hannah said ambivalently in any case annetje announced more cheerfully you must remember to say nothing to senhor miguel you must keep silence will you promise me to do so i promise as she said the words she knew she lied and felt a strange new pleasure in how easily the lie came she knew she would tell miguel though she could not say when or why or what would be the consequence of an act that could well mean her ruin a week after his conversation with hendrick miguel sat with geertruid in the singing carp she had sent him a note announcing that she wished to see him and miguel had hurried over he found hendrick in the midst of telling a story when miguel arrived and though geertruid stretched her pretty neck to kiss miguel she made no effort to interrupt hendrick spoke in a rapid rural dutch and miguel had a hard time following the circuitous narrative which had something to do with a childhood friend and a stolen barrel of pickled beef when he finished he laughed in appreciation of himself thats some story eh jew man i like it very much answered miguel he likes it very much hendrick said to geertruid he is kind to say so why did geertruid not send away this clown but miguel could tell that she had been drinking a little too much hendrick had been drinking too now it is your turn he said to miguel he grinned broadly but his eyes had a kind of cruelty in them you tell a story this was a test of some sort but miguel had no idea how to proceed i have no story to tell he answered or none that can compete with your pickled beef tale in truth miguel could not make himself calm he had only a third of geertruids money remaining and when the time came he would have no way of paying nunes hed been able to put the lost money out of his mind but here with geertruid he could not bring himself to forget it i have no story to tell hendrick repeated imitating miguels accent come now jew man show yourself to be game for once you enjoy my generous entertainment and i would so like you to give something in return would you not like to hear a story madam id love to hear a story geertruid agreed the senhor is so witty i see im outnumbered he said making a show of good nature what sort of story should i tell thats for you to say something that tells of your mighty adventures you can tell us a story of your amorous victories or the strangeness of your race or some incomprehensible plan to conquer the exchange miguel had no time to respond for a man had come behind hendrick with a tankard in his hand and swung hard aiming to hit hendrick in the head it was his good fortune that hendrick had leaned in a few inches to make some comment to geertruid so the pewter tankard came down hard but it struck the dutchman in the shoulder and then flew from the assailants hand spraying beer into miguels face before it clattered upon the wooden floor gods fucking whore hendrick said with surprising calm he leapt from his seat in an instant and turned to face his attacker a man at least a head shorter than hendrick and thinalmost shockingly sobut for an enormous belly his face had turned red with the exertion of his blow and the failure to bring it home you rotten bastard the man shouted i know who you are and ill kill you christ hendrick said petulantly as though he had been asked to perform an unpleasant chore he let out a puff of breath and struck the man hard in the face the blow came fast and his assailant went down on the floor to the cheers of the patrons in an instant the barkeep came out and with the help of a servant dragged the attacker toward the kitchens miguel guessed he would be thrown into the alley out back hendrick smiled sheepishly id wager that fellow doesnt much like me miguel nodded as he wiped the beer from his face i dont think there will be any trouble geertruid said but you may wish to get gone hendrick nodded i take your meaning good day to you jew man the pair sat in silence for a few minutes once hendrick had left and miguel pondered the unanswerable question of how geertruid understood what had passed tell me once more why you associate with him miguel said after a moment anyone can make enemies geertruid said unconvincingly he is a rough man with rough friends and they sometimes settle their differences uncouthly it was true enough miguel found himself secretly hoping that joachim might someday confront him with hendrick nearby in any case geertruid said still sounding a little drunk i am sorry you had to witness such trouble he shook his head where have you been these past days i never stay in one place for long she told him she set a hand on top of his i like to visit my relatives in the countryside it is a sad bird who never leaves her nest i wish you would inform me of when you plan to go away and when you plan to return if we are to do business together i must be able to find you she patted his hand and looked directly into his eyes of course ill be good to you miguel took his hand away he was in no mood for her nonsense it is not a matter of being good to me but of being good to our business this is not some silly womans game and i am not some silly woman she answered her voice now hard as steel i may be soft but i am not a fool to be lectured miguel felt himself go pale he could not recall her ever having spoken to him thus like a dutch husband he wanted nothing so much as to placate her madam i of all men would never call you a fool i only wished to say that i must be able to speak with you she turned to him her head at an angle her thin lips spread in a warm smile her eyes wide and inviting of course senhor i have been at fault it doesnt matter miguel muttered and we have more important business to discuss i have received several letters from our agents and im optimistic that well receive more good news within the next few weeks she took a drink from her tankard have we all the agents we require not quite we still lack madrid lisbon and oporto he made every effort to sound unconcerned but the truth was that there could be no control of the market without iberia it is a problem miguel added geertruid studied him how will you solve this problem her voice sounded icy if i could answer that question i would have already solved it i put forth the money ive done my part your part is to make it workotherwise i should hardly need you miguel shook his head if you have no faith in this project you must tell me now there is still time to cancel the sale though we lose the premium geertruid shook her head i dont want to cancel the sale i want the problem solved and if it cannot be solved i want to know that i can trust you to tell me so very well he said sullenly he had hardly been prepared for her to take this posture if i have not resolved the question of the iberian agents in two weeks well cancel miguel showed no emotion but even the thought of abandoning the deal filled him with misery perhaps he could find someone else someone in the jewish community to fund him but that idea presented its own host of problems he would have to discuss the plan in order to try to bring someone on board once he discussed it it would no longer be a secret his brother might have put up the money if they were on better terms but daniel had no faith that miguel could manage his own affairs no if he lost geertruids money he could never proceed then there was the matter of canceling the sale geertruid had been concerned about her money and her lack of trust irritated miguel though he had lost two thirds of her investment he wasnt the sort of person who handled money irresponsibly he had only been unlucky guessing that geertruid had no idea how such sales were actually ordered miguel had simply invented his twoweek estimate he doubted he could get nunes to cancel the deal in two weeks or even right now but that difficulty could be dealt with another time now miguel had no concern greater than regaining geertruids confidence she nodded two weeks is a goodly amount of time i had better redouble my efforts miguel stood up i should hate to disappoint you dont think ive lost faith she reached out and took his hand in both of hers it is a great deal of money ive put forth and i must protect my investment of course madam miguel said i understand your heart in all things miguel stopped next at the flyboat where he found isaiah nunes engaged in conversation with a few other merchants of miguels acquaintance nunes knew well how to read the expressions on a mans face and understanding that miguel needed to speak with him he pushed his muscular form upward the tavern was far too noisy so they stepped outside into the cool of the late afternoon both men looked around carefully to make sure their conversation could not be overheard if i choose to cancel the sale miguel began abruptly by what date must i do so cancel nunes demanded his face darkened whats gone wrong nothing miguel told him warily i have no real plans to cancel but one of my partners is nervous and asked me to make an inquiry besides you were the one who advised me to be rid of coffee but not to be rid of our contract you may tell this partner of yours it is far too late to back out we dont deal here with some friend of our nation you know we deal with the east india company and the company does not allow a buyer to change his mind no matter how politely one might ask nunes paused for a moment i know you understand how things stand i would hate for you to put me in an awkward position miguel miguel forced a smile of course nunes shrugged in any case i had actually been planning on sending you a little note tomorrow i have made all the arrangements and i now require a portion of the payment i had thought i would pay upon delivery said miguel who had thought no such thing you know better than that nunes said his brow wrinkled in obvious displeasure shall we say a quarter up front nunes laughed and put a hand on miguels shoulder youre making me laugh now you know how these things are done if youll transfer half the amount to my account by the end of next week id be most appreciative miguel cleared his throat sadly one of my partners has suffered a smalland temporary i assure yousetback we cannot come up with the entire sum by next week the smile dropped from nuness face i can pay you a thousand miguel suggested no small sum and certainly an indication of our seriousness nuness hand had remained on miguels shoulder but it now pressed so hard he pushed miguel up against the tavern wall have you lost your wits he asked in a husky whisper there is no maneuvering with the company if i say i need fifteen hundred i need that sum not some token ive contracted with them youve contracted with me and the deal is to be done if you dont give me that money i will have to pay it out of my own account youre my friend miguel but you have put me in a terrible position i know i know miguel held his hands up like a supplicant its these partners of minegood for the money but slow with payment but ill have the fundsby the end of next week as you say miguel would have told him anything to end the talk of contracts perhaps he suggested as he turned away you could say a word or two to ricardo on my behalf ill not fight your battle for you nunes called after him nor get between you and parido hed had enough disquiet for one day but when he walked into his brothers house he knew at once that something terrible had happened daniel sat in the front room with a strange look on his face disappointment and satisfaction all at once what is it miguel asked him have you been searching he stopped it was a line of inquiry that could lead to no good daniel stretched out his arm to present a sealed letter a sealed letter how many times would daniel confront him about his correspondence but even as he thought the words miguel knew this letter was differentand daniel already knew its contents miguel numbly broke the seal and opened the triply folded paper he did not have to read the ornate handwriting or the carefully chosen words in formal spanish he knew what it said miguel had been summoned to appear the next morning before the maamad there were only a few hours of daylight remaining and miguel wished to use them to his advantage he could feel the hot breath of ruin upon the back of his neck but he might still arm himself against the battle and prevail for all his grievances with the maamadand he had manyhe believed it did possess one quirk that might work in his favor the council did not condemn on mere principle parido might speak against him might try to persuade the council to act but the parnassim would listen to reason they wanted the community to thrive so they were inclined to accept apologies and consider particular circumstances many a man had pulled his fat out of the maamads fire by having a careful argument at the ready to prepare such an argument miguel would have to learn precisely why the maamad wished to see him though he felt almost certain he knew surely joachim had spoken ill of him to the council now he needed to know what he had said and what kinds of charges were to be brought against him and that presented a terrible irony he had wanted nothing so much as to avoid that madman but now he must seek him out before miguel had even begun to formulate a plan whereby he might find joachim he recalled something else something hendrick had said before he had been attacked in the tavern you can tell us a story of your amorous victories or the strangeness of your race or some incomprehensible plan to conquer the exchange geertruid had sworn to keep their business a secret from her dog so why was he barking on about it and what was the true source of her money could she and her loose lips be the source of this summons without taking a moment to explain himself to daniel miguel rushed out of the house and returned to the singing carp muttering hopeful half prayers that geertruid would still be there she was not miguel asked the tap man who let it be known he might very well have heard something of her destination and a coin might help his memory for two stuivers the fellow recalled that she attended a banquet at the far end of the bloemstraat miguel found the entrance to the banquet hall in the upper portion of an unpretentious redbrick house he climbed the stairs and pounded when a servant boy answered the door miguel only said he had come for the feast and the boy ushered him up the stairs to a wide room with six or seven dark wood tables spread out on a series of mismatched eastern rugs sconces with good smokeless candles reached out of the doorposts and along the walls and great chandeliers descended from the ceiling dozens of paintings had been hung without regard to spacing or ease of viewing two large fireplaces on the far sides of the room blasted out oppressive heat and in the corner a pair of fiddlers played madly to make their music audible above the din of drunken chatter on the tables at each of which sat ten or twelve banqueters were piles and pots of food oysters boiled fowl a steaming vessel of hutsepot with the leg of some unclean animal thrust outward like the desperate grasp of a drowning man there were enormous wheels of cheese and plates of herring pickled baked and stewed there were bowls of hot milk with melted butter floating at the top also white breads figs and dates roast parsnips and dutch sla made of chopped raw cabbage and carrot while miguel struggled to preserve himself geertruid feasted buxom girls moved from table to table pouring drink into cunning goblets with no stems miguel had seen and fallen victim to these vessels himself they could not be set down and so they encouraged drinking far beyond ones limit this merry crowd consisted mostly of men but there was a woman or two at each table as red and drunk and merry as the assortment of blackclad tallhatted gentlemen diners who managed to drink smoke and eat all at once at the table nearest the entrance a man with one eye and one arm took notice of miguel in his remaining hand his left he clutched his goblet tight unable to let go even to dine ho there he shouted above the din who called for a jew miguel had not noticed geertruid until that moment even from a distance the length of two or three men he could see the gracelessness of her movements and the unfocused wonders of her eyes with one hand she pushed herself from her chair and walked unsteadily to meet him by the door sober yourself miguel snapped i must have words with you what is this anyhow with whom do you feast it is the brewers guild she said what business have you with these men he demanded oh miguel i may have friends and acquaintances outside your approval you know now tell me what has happened her eyes went as wide as a childs it is the maamad it has summoned me to appear before it tomorrow morning she let out a loud laugh that pierced through the clamor of drunken revelry you and your mohammed are you a jew or a turk he took a deep breath geertruid i must have some answers he hardly ever called her by her given name he recalled that he had done so the night he had tried to kiss her and the memory still left him mortified have you spoken of our business to anyone of course not she shook her head rapidly and then reached up with one exploratory hand to make sure her prim little cap beaded with rubies had not been knocked out of place ho jew one of the men from her table called send us back our merry friend geertruid waved them off a quick gawky gesture with the back of her hand you havent told hendrick hendrick she repeated that ox i would not trouble him with the secret of making rocks sink in a canal miguel swallowed hard what about the money i know you were not honest with me how did you get it who said i was not honest with you who said that i am very angry she lost her balance and held on to the wall though her gentle swaying continued miguel took her arm to steady her i havent time for your anger i have to know where the money comes from if it wasnt left to you by your husband whence does it come she laughed a little and then covered her mouth oh it comes of my husband sure enough that bastard knew only how to take his fill of me never thinking of my pleasure even in death thats how he fucks me her eyes narrowed and something dark passed across her face he left me some little money but not nearly so much as he should have for what i endured something twisted in miguels guts where did you get the capital from the wretched children of his foul first wife they live with their aunt his sister but the bastard left me to guard the funds he gave me the work of ordering their trust and instructed them that when they came of age they should reward me as they saw fit can you imagine such treachery guardians and children from other marriagesnone of it made sense tell me the rest i have some freedom in what i may do with their wealth though in order to have such freedom i must convince a wretched old lawyer in antwerp that i invest for the good of those evil children not so easy to do but i have been known to charm a man or two in my time a lawyer in antwerp now at least miguel could guess to what place she disappeared she was off lifting her skirts for this pettifogger so you have used money meant to be held in trust for your late husbands children you have done this before she nodded sometimes i have invested it and sometimes i have simply spent it there is a matter of a few thousand guilders i should like to replace she had stolen from her husbands children and when they came of age there would be a reckoning when do they collect their inheritance the eldest is not of age for another three years so i have time to set things right she reached out and put her arms around his neck you must help me miguel you are my only true friend she laughed again her yeasty breath blasting his face not my only friend but my only true friend and that is something do you not think so careful a dutch reveler shouted lest you become entangled in hebrew scripture geertruid only pulled him closer but miguel worked his way out of the embrace which now only made him uneasy he sucked in air until his lungs hurt and then took her hand and held it in both of his ignoring the jeers of the drunken dutchmen please understand that everything i value is at risk you must tell me who knows of this she shook her head no one only you and of course my lawyer but he wont tell for i have secrets of my own and hes afraid to cross me miguel nodded his fortunes he now understood would be built upon stolen money it troubled him but not so much as next mornings meeting with the maamad and he now believed that meeting had nothing to do with geertruid or her trickery he cursed himself for the time he had wasted night would soon be upon him it was time to begin his hunt for joachim because miguel had no precise knowledge of where joachim lived finding him would be timeconsuming but yet possible the fellow said he and his wife had been forced to move to one of the worst parts of the city the rundown hovels in the shadow of the oude kerk where seedy musicos attracted whores and sailors and thieves someone in the area would know joachim so disorderly a man is always conspicuous before entering the most unsavory part of town he took out his purse and counted his money he had more on him than a man in those neighborhoods would like so he separated his coins leaving some in his purse some in his pocket and some wrapped in a nose cloth as he walked toward the oude kerk buildings began to take on a gloomy dilapidated cast the people in the street seemed to belong almost to a different race of man than those in the rest of the city foreigners often wrote that one of the great marvels of amsterdam was its absence of beggars that was untrue though miguel knew well enough that compared to most cities in europe the beggars were few indeed at least in most parts of town those foreigners had no doubt not crossed into this district where they would have found enough of the legless and leprous tribe to satisfy anyones requirements miguel walked quickly among the poor among the whores who slouched in doorways dangling to one side or the other like hanged men until they spotted a fellow to their liking more than once in his short walk miguel pushed away some greedy shedevil or other who sprang from her lair and attempted to drag him inside he was about to ask a man pushing a cart of root vegetables if he knew of joachim waagenaar when he saw a woman with a tray of pies round the corner calling out her goods though she was dressed in stained and loose clothes and somewhat dirty in the face miguel was sure he knew this woman and then at once he understood where he had seen her before she was joachims wife clara no longer quite the beauty he remembered she remained pretty enough for the sailors to shout out to her with their cheerful obscenities one approached her staggering and lecherous and miguel thought to step forward but clara spoke a couple of pleasant words to the man who then doffed his cap and wandered off miguel then stepped forward have you pies with no meat he asked he thought it unlikely that she would recollect his face so he said nothing to her to give himself away her neck linen was torn and stained yellow but the cap that covered the crown of her head appeared new where could she have acquired such a thing miguel recalled joachims fears that his wife would turn whore i have an onion and radish pie sir she told him watching him with evident caution her caution was well founded miguel thought what business had a jew looking for his evening meal in this part of the city ill be glad of it he ought not to eat such a thing he had no knowledge of its preparation and it had certainly sat upon her tray in close proximity to pork and other unclean meats but there was no maamad here if this pie allowed him to obtain wealth and thereby become a better jew its preparation hardly mattered he bit into it and discovered that he was ravenous he liked his crust flakier his vegetables less cookedthe dutch did not consider vegetables done until they were almost turned to liquid did you bake these yourself he asked she eyed him while pretending to look upon the dirt yes sir miguel smiled what is your name my dear my name she said holding her hand forward that he might see her little pewter ring is another mans wife its not so pretty a name miguel told her but you misunderstand me if i wished for that sort of companionship i might easily find it without buying a pie for my troubles some men like the sport she smiled at him and her eyes widened slightly yet i take your point my name is clara and id be curious to know what your business is sir you appear to buy your pie as a means and not an end miguel felt an unexpected tingle of interest were he on a different kind of business it might be no difficult thing to convince her to continue this conversation in the private room of a tavern but what kind of a man would that make him regardless of joachims current treachery he hadhowever unintentionallywronged the poor fellow and he was hesitant to make matters worse by cuckolding a madman perhaps i hardly know my business myself he told her it is only thatwell if i may be so boldyou have not the look nor the sound either of a woman i might expect to find selling pies near the oude kerk and you have not the look of the sort of man i might expect to buy one miguel bowed i speak to you in earnest youre a beautiful woman who i think is used to better things how does your husband permit you to ply such a trade some of the humor drained from claras face my husband has fallen on hard times she said at last we once had a fine place to live and fine clothes but he lost his money alas to the trickery of one of your race now he has nothing but debts senhor miguel smiled you know something of our forms of address i like that how long has it been since your husband lost his money several months senhor this time the honorific was missing its touch of irony she began to see something of value in this conversation and you still have debts yes senhor how much do you owe three hundred guilders senhor not so very much money as what we used to have but now it is enough i hope you will at least accept my charity miguel took out his nose cloth heavy with coin here are five guilders she smiled when he pressed the handkerchief into her hands without taking her eyes off her benefactor she slid the little package into her own purse i cannot thank you enough tell me he said brightly where i can find this husband of yours find him her eyes narrowed and her brow folded upon itself you say he was done wrong by one of my race perhaps i can do right by him i might be able to find him some employment or introduce him to someone who could youre very kind but i dont know that he would want to speak with you and i know not in what way you might help he is beyond such simple charity beyond what say you clara turned away he has been taken senhor for refusing to work and for lying in a drunken state in the street he is now at the rasphuis miguel felt a vague elation the thrill of revenge when he thought of the rasphuis that place of cruel discipline from which few emerged and none emerged unbroken but he was not here for revenge and joachims suffering brought him nothing of value i must find him there miguel said more loudly than he should have his hands beginning to twitch with excitement ill see him at once see him at once clara repeated back what care you if you see him never thats no matter he answered miguel began to hurry off but clara grabbed him by the wrist he could feel her jagged nails scrape along his flesh youve not told me the truth senhor i think i know you after all you are the man who ruined my husband miguel shook his head no not ruined but shared in his ruin his affairs and my own suffered together she cast an eye upon his clothes perhaps a bit soiled but finely wrought and what do you want with him now her tone seemed to miguel not one of protective feeling or even concernmore of curiosity and an eager curiosity too she moved closer to miguel and let him take in her sweaty and feminine scent i have business of the most urgent sortit cannot wait until the morrow i think you will find that the rasphuis does not offer such liberal hours as our musicos she told him with a little laugh and i think miguel said with a bravado he did not himself believe you will find that any building is open at any time if a man has but the right key clara turned her head just so and her eyes widened just enough to let miguel know that she took some pleasure in his firm resolve she liked a strong man he could tell that at once joachim if he had ever been such a one had long since relinquished his strength allowing his losses to undo his manhood more the pity for a woman so fine as she i must go miguel said gently prying loose his hand i hope ill see you more he said if only for the pleasure of flirtation who can say what the future holds clara lowered her eyes miguel walked away with the confident stride of a man who could have taken a woman but chose not to still if joachim persisted in incurring miguels ire if he continued in his absurd program of abuse and revenge miguel thought he might have no choice but to seek out clara again were he to plant a cuckoo in joachims unhappy nest one would then see who had revenge and who looked the fool located in the narrow heiligeweg an alley just north of the singel in the old center of the city the rasphuis stood as a monument to the reverence with which the dutch viewed labor from the old cobbled streets outside it appeared no different from any other great house a heavy wooden door above which stood a gable stone depicting a blind effigy of justice presiding over two bound prisoners miguel studied the image for a moment in the fading light it would be dark soon and he had no desire to be caught on the street without a lantern nor did he wish to be alone in an ancient ghostridden street like the heiligeweg miguel rapped on the door three or four times before a surlylooking fellow with a greaseslicked face opened the upper portion streaked with the light of a candle he had set down on a bench behind him the guard stood offering his studied scowl at miguel he was a short man but broad and thicknecked the better part of his nose had been cut off in what looked like the not too distant past and the inflamed skin glistened in the thin light of dusk what do you want he asked with boredom so intense he could hardly bring himself to move his mouth i must have a word with one of the prisoners within these walls the fellow let out a snorting and gurgling sound the tip of his nose became even more reflective in the candlelight theyre not prisoners theyre penitents and there are hours to visit the penitents and there arent hours these arent them miguel had no time for nonsense what he asked himself would charming pieter do those hours ought to be considered flexible he suggested holding up a coin between his thumb and index finger i suppose youve a point the guard took the coin and opened the door to let miguel enter the front hall indicated nothing of the horrors below the floor was of a checkered heavy tile and a series of arches on either side separated the entrance hall from a handsome openair courtyard miguel might have thought this the outer garden to some great mans home rather than the entrance to a workhouse famed for its torments he had heard little of what actually took place inside these walls but what he had heard bespoke cruelty vagabonds and beggars the lazy and the criminal all thrust together and made to do labors of the cruelest sort the most incorrigible of these men were given the task of rasping brazilwood sawing it down to extract the reddish dye and those who would not do this work who steadfastly refused to labor found a worse fate awaited them the rasphuis was said to contain a chamber down below called the drowning cell into which were thrown those who would not work water flooded the room which contained pumps that the inmates might save their lives through their toil those who failed to pump would meet their end those who learned the value of hard work would live the dutchman led miguel who strained his ears for the sound of sloshing water down a set of cold and stony stairs and into a chamber none the most pleasant but hardly a dungeon of terrors after they left the courtyard the floor turned from tile to dirt and the only furniture included a few wooden chairs and an old table missing one of its four legs whos the fellow youre looking for his name is joachim waagenaar waagenaar the dutchman laughed your friends made a reputation for himself in as short a time as any they got him rasping away even after most have finished for the night and if he dont meet the demands theyve set hell find his way to the drowning cell soon enough im sure hes difficult enough but i must speak with him miguel pressed another coin into the dutchmans palm best to keep the wheels greased the fellow set down his candle upon a rough wooden table speak with him he asked that cannot be there are hours for visiting and there are hours for not visiting begging your pardon i had meant to mention that before but i must have forgotten myself miguel sighed the money he reminded himself was nothing in a few months time he would laugh at these little expenses he reached into his pocket and withdrew the last coin he had tucked there five guilders the noseless dutchman pocketed it and disappeared from the room locking it from the outside a cold panic spread through miguel and when no one had returned for nearly a quarter of an hour he began to wonder if perhaps he had become the victim of some horrible trick but then he heard the door unlatch and the dutchman entered pushing joachim before him each time miguel saw joachim the fellow was the worse for it he had lost weight since their last meeting and had now grown sickly gaunt his hands and arms and much of his face were stained red from sawing at brazilwood so that he looked more like a murderer than a penitent in a house of correction you dont mind that ill listen to your conversation the dutchman said i have to make certain nothing improper happens here miguel did mind but he sensed at once that he would have little success removing the fellow so he simply nodded to what do i owe the pleasure of this visit senhor joachims voice sounded even devoid of sarcasm he wished to play at formality i must know what you have said to the maamad have you sent a note is that how you communicated from these walls i must know joachims lips curled just slightly how badly would you like to know i must have the answer tell me precisely what you revealed to them every word i have no time to play games no games youll not have the answer of me in here they have cast me in and i may not even know the length of time i am to be a prisoner nor even my crime other than i did not wish to work as their slave so i say that if you can get me from this prison ill tell you all i know get you out miguel nearly shouted i am no magistrate to get you out how do you propose i do such a thing the noseless dutchman coughed into his fist these things may be ordered if one but knows how not for every man but for those thrown here without a crime save only vagrancy miguel sighed very well he said speak plainly oh i think twenty guilders should do the business miguel could scarce believe that he was now prepared to bribe a guard twenty guilders to free from the rasphuis an enemy he very recently would have paid a much larger sum to have cast in but joachim knew why the maamad had summoned him and he would consider such information acquired cheap at twenty guilders miguel peered into his purse embarrassed that the guard now discovered he had apportioned out his money into different piles he had only a little more than what was required the guard counted out the coins what is this twenty guilders i said forty do you think me a fool surely one of us is a fool miguel replied the guard shrugged ill just take this fellow away then and well say no harm done miguel opened his purse once more i have only three and a half guilders remaining to me you must take that or nothing he handed it to the guard hoping that by so doing he would seal the bargain are you sure you have no more purses or pockets or piles about you this is all i have i promise you his words must have conveyed an element of truth for the dutchman nodded get on with you he said i wont have you loitering in front of the premises they took a few steps in silence i cant thank you enough joachim then began for this kindness i should have been happy to see you rot there miguel murmured as they passed through the courtyard but i must know what you said to the maamad they stepped into the heiligeweg the guard closed the door behind them and the series of locks and bolts echoed into the street i must first ask you a question joachim said please i have little patience it had better be relevant to these matters oh it is it could not be more relevant my question is this he cleared his throat what the christ is a maamad miguel felt an ache in his skull gathering force and his face grew hot dont play the fool with me it is the council of portuguese jews and why should i have ever spoken to so august a body did you not tell me before that you would tell me what you know i did promise and i have kept my promise i know nothing of your ruling council though i believe i now know something of it i know that you fear i should speak to it damn you you scurvy devil miguel spat he felt his fist clench and his arm tighten it is all the more shame to you that you should need to be tricked to rescue an old associate from so horrible a fate as the rasphuis but you will find me not without gratitude ill thank you now and be on my way joachim bowed deeply and then ran into the night it took a moment before miguel could begin to collect his thoughts he could not even allow himself to consider how he had just humiliated himself before his mad enemy it was of far more importance that the maamad had called him forward and he did not yet know why if it had not been joachim who had reported him this appearance must be the work of parido the spies he sent to rotterdam had seen nothing they could use was it the matter of joachim in the street with hannah and annetje perhaps but they could hardly excommunicate him if he had a good explanation he was certain he could think of one before morning miguel was out of bed before first light after urinating furiously from the coffee hed taken before bedto keep his thoughts active in his sleephe washed and said his morning prayers with a kind of pleading enthusiasm he dressed ate a breakfast of bread and dried cheese and hastily drank a large bowl of coffee last night he had been driven by desperate need to do something to further his cause but in the silence of his room he could not escape the hard ball of fear that tightened in his belly this was no ordinary summoning there would be no indulgent lectures on the importance of the dietary laws or on resisting the charms of dutch girls could he really turn his back on everything as alferonda had done instead of remaining in amsterdam a usurer and a known villain alonzo could easily have gone elsewhere changed his name settled into another community there were other jews in the world besides those in amsterdam and miguel need not remain here but the cherem would mean more than having to choose between being a jew elsewhere and an outcast in amsterdam to leave the city would mean abandoning his plans in the coffee trade abandoning the money ricardo owed him if he stayed his creditors no doubt including his sanctimonious brother would descend upon him and pick his bones clean even if he did move to a city where no one knew him how would he live there a merchant without connections was no merchant at all was he to be a pushcart peddler miguel made his way to the talmud torah unobserved by anyone from the community at this hour the vlooyenburg had just begun to stir and though he heard the early morning cries of the milkmen and bakers he crossed the bridge unheeded by all except a pair of beggars who sat eating a loaf of stale and mudsplattered bread while eyeing miguel suspiciously the maamad held its meetings in the same building as the synagogue but a separate entrance led to the chambers at the top of a winding stairwell miguel stepped into the small familiar room where supplicants awaited their summonses a few chairs had been set along the wall with semicircular windows behind them allowing the early morning light to filter into a room smelling strongly of mildew and tobacco no one else awaited the call that morning but miguel and that was something of a relief he hated making conversation with other penitents whispering resentments and laughing off accusations better to wait alone he paced back and forth and played out in his mind fantasy after fantasy complete exoneration excommunication and all imaginable variations the worst would not happen he told himself he had always extricated himself from the councils anger and there was paridoparido who was surely not miguels friend but who wanted something from him parido who had long known enough to have miguel cast out and yet had not there was no reason to believe he would let miguel be cast out now he waited for nearly an hour before at last the door opened and he was ushered into the chamber at a table at the far end of the room sat the seven men who would pass judgment on the wall behind them was mounted the great marble symbol of the talmud torah an immense pelican feeding its three young the congregation having been formed of smaller synagogues some years before the room reflected the wealth of the communitys elite with its lush india rug handsome portraits of former parnassim and an ivory cabinet in which records were stored the men sat behind a massive dark table and looked both solemn and princely in their rich attire to be a parnass a man must have the wealth to dress like a parnass senhor lienzo thank you for answering the summons aaron desinea who led the council spoke with a kind of arch seriousness please he gestured to the narrow tooshort chair that sat in the center of the room where miguel would sit while in discussion with the council one of the legs was shorter than the rest it took far more concentration than miguel could spare to keep from wobbling in the middle of his seventh decade desinea was the oldest of the parnassim and had begun to display signs of the ravages of age his hair had gone from a stately gray to a sickly white and now had the coarse quality of dead leaves his beard had grown spotty and molten and it was generally known that his eyes were failing even now he stared beyond miguel as though looking for a friend in the distance but desinea had sat on the council many times serving his threeyear limit standing down for the required three years and then finding himself always reelected you know everyone here so ill dispense with introductions i shall read the charges against you and you will have an opportunity to answer them do you have any questions no senhor miguel felt himself longing for another bowl of coffee to sharpen his senses already he had become distracted and he had to fight the childish urge to fidget of course desinea allowed himself the vaguest hint of a smile by now you know the procedure well he held out a piece of paper but his eyes made no contact with it he must have memorized it earlier senhor miguel lienzowho is also known by and does business under the names mikael lienzo marcus lentus and michael weaveryou are charged with irresponsible conduct bringing shame before the nation you are accused of consorting with dangerous disreputable and inappropriate gentiles and bringing such gentiles into our own neighborhood where they have behaved disruptively do you wish to respond to these charges miguel suppressed a smile though he succumbed to the urge to breathe in the sweetness of the air the meeting might be brought to its conclusion now for the council would do him no harm they did not know joachims name or miguels relationship with him all the parnassim wanted was to hear an explanation and to issue a warning senhors i should like to begin by offering my sincere apologies to this council and to the nation the man you mention is a dutch unfortunate with whom i admit i have been friendly but i can assure you that my intentions were always good he disliked lying in so holy a place for it is written that a liar is no better than one who worships idols but it is also written that the holy one blessed be he hates a man who speaks one thing with his mouth and another with his heart therefore it seemed to miguel that if he believed in his heart that his lie was justified it was not so sinful after all he is a sad man ruined in a business misadventure he continued and seeing him begging upon the street i gave him a few stuivers some days later he engaged me in conversation and not wishing to be rude i made small chatter with him the next time i saw him he became aggressive and began to follow me shouting things finally he came into our own neighborhood and accosted members of my brothers household i then spoke to him harshly warning him that if he continued to behave thus i would be forced to report him to the city authorities i believe he wont disturb our quiet again the giving of charity is one of our most important mitzvot said joseph ben yerushalieem he was a wealthy merchant who had come to amsterdam some months after miguel and had been elected to the council after fulfilling by a matter of weeks the requirement that a parnass must have been living as a jew for at least three years miguel knew he interpreted his duties as sourly as the law would allow showing no mercy to new arrivals who refused to embrace an equally strict adherence i commend you on your generosity senhor for charity exalts the holy name this council is aware that you have suffered in business but the rabbis say that a beggar must be treated kindly for the lord is with him thank you senhor said miguel who refused to believe that the lord could possibly be with joachim however ben yerushalieem continued this incident demonstrates something that this body has warned you of many times in the past your easy interactions with the dutch your fluency in their language and your comfort with their companionship can lead only to difficulties between our two peoples this community has thrived because it has kept its distance from our dutch hosts this incident with the beggar may seem small and you have been guiltless of any ill intent but it suggests that you are unwilling to follow this councils advice that you keep a more formal distance from these people this problem has been brought to our attention before desinea chimed in you are a man who habitually breaks the laws of this council because he believes he knows better than we do what is right for the nation precisely ben yerushalieem pressed on you have broken the rules of the maamad because you thought yourself the best judge of right and wrong it makes no difference senhor if you are seeking the affections of a pretty dutch girl or giving alms to an inappropriate gentile both are forbidden and forbidden for good reasons miguel found the pressure more intense than he had at first anticipated i thank you for taking the time to discuss these matters with me and allowing me the opportunity to improve my behavior i shall redouble my efforts to be more vigilant in considering my actions in light of the larger good of this community i can only hope that you will desinea told him sternly you are a grown man senhor lienzo not a boy whose transgressions can be overlooked desineas words stung furiously but miguel knew his pride would recover the tide had begun to recede after all the maamad had made its point he had been warned i wonder if that is enough solomon parido leaned forward as though scrutinizing something on miguels face though animated by his expectation of triumph he appeared if anything more morose than ever even the taste of victory brought him no joy such warnings can be effective i grant you but i am not convinced they will suffice in this case i am a friend of senhor lienzos family so i speak with genuine concern when i say he has been issued many warnings in the past now we must ask have they led him to change his ways have they ever inspired in his heart a new love of the law forgiveness is a blessing in the eyes of the most high but we must not forgive too easily or too often without damaging the community miguel swallowed hard perhaps he thought parido only meant to appear harsh that he might better disguise his true intentions of protecting miguel why would he have pretended friendship this past month only now to turn on him if he sought to impose the cherem why had he not made use of his knowledge that miguel had bribed a servant girl into fingering parido as the father of her child none of it made sense we cannot know how those warnings have shaped the senhor ben yerushalieem commented is it therefore not pure speculation to say that warnings have had no effect we may have changed senhor lienzos behavior greatly and rescued him from his own worst self senhors i must commend your generosity but i wonder if generosity may not do our community more harm than good miguel felt himself wobble in the chair this was no mere pretense at harshness parido was after blood really senhor ben yerushalieem said this denunciation is unbecoming you and senhor lienzo have had disagreements but holy torah commands us not to hold a grudge this is no matter of grudges all amsterdam knows that ive set aside our former differences but that does not mean that i must hold my tongue when i see evil i have it on good authority parido pressed on that this man is engaged in a matter of business that presents a direct threat to this community so this is his move miguel thought as he tried to keep his face from twitching he could not yet see the whole of the plan but he recognized the pieces the gestures of friendship now allowed parido to claim only the best motives is this true desinea asked by no means miguel managed to answer though his mouth had grown painfully dry senhor parido might wish to reexamine his source of information can you tell us more senhor parido ben yerushalieem asked i believe it is lienzo who must tell us more senhor lienzo miguel corrected the members of this council need no lessons in etiquette parido explained softly you are here to answer our questions senhor parido is right another parnass gideon carvoeiro announced true these two men have had words but that means nothing the senhor has set forth a question we cannot bring a man before us and allow him to choose which questions are to his liking parido made a halfhearted effort to hide a smile precisely you must tell us the nature of your new venture and there it was parido had sought miguels friendship to learn about his plans in the coffee trade when that had not worked he had deftly use his position on the maamad not to arrange miguels excommunication but to use their old animosity as an excuse to discover the nature of his business now parido surely thought that miguel had no choice but to divulge his secretsotherwise he would almost certainly face the cherem for defiance of the council was among the most serious of crimes in its eyes parido had set his trap brilliantly miguel must give up his secrets or be destroyed but miguel would not be so easily ruined a jew from salonika could not hope to scheme like a former converso miguel believed he might still teach parido a few things about deviousness senhors he began after taking a moment to formulate his reply i hope you will consider that a man of business is not always at liberty to answer questions concerning his affairs i have agreements with other merchants who depend on my silence i need not explain to you the role of rumor on the exchange and the importance of keeping some dealings quiet quiet is not a luxury you possess right now parido said the maamads need to protect the nation must take precedence over your inclination toward secrecy miguel swallowed hard he might ruin himself if he spoke with too much arrogance but the right tone would win the day then i must respectfully refuse to answer senhors desinea leaned forward i must remind you that our nation knows no greater crime than refusal to cooperate with the maamad any business scheme upon which you have embarked lawful or no may prove itself difficult to execute if you earn the enmity of our nation senhors he repeated careful to keep his tone modest and respectful for everything hinged on their response to what he now said i beg you consider what it is you ask of me whether answers must be pursued regardless of costs there is no one in this room who does not have a relation or friend who was destroyed by the inquisition in portugal this council has established itself in the hopes that our people may never have to face those horrors again but i fear that in truly understanding our enemy we may have become too much like him ben yerushalieem slammed his palm down on the table i advise you to think before you speak further veins bulged out in his neck you dare liken this council to the inquisition i only suggest that we must think about the cost of inquiry and if the answers are worth the price of the asking particularly if those costs are yours parido quipped the council laughed paridos comment having eased some of the tension but miguel clenched his teeth in frustration yes he shot back particularly if they are mine this council is designed to protect the wellbeing of the nation as a whole it wants nothing so much as to see the nation flourish yet that nation is composed of people i believe it wrong that you ask one of those people to sacrifice his wellbeing to satisfy the vague curiosity of the community must i give up my chance of regaining some small portion of my fortune so that you may know i have done nothing wrong perhaps if there were specific charges but to force me to reveal secrets that protect my business interests in order that you might learn if they may prove dangerous to the communitythis is an injustice no one spoke for a moment parido opened his mouth but understood that miguels spirited outburst had changed the councils tone he could not push too hard here i believe that senhor lienzo has argued an important point desinea said at last we need not ask him to expose himself without just cause such a pursuit could send a chill throughout the city and discourage others of the nation from seeking refuge here or embracing their ancestral faith moreover if by speaking here the senhor does any damage to dutch businessmen the results could do us greater harm than we can endure what sort of dutch businessmen parido demanded that is what we must find out we have already established his unappealing connections please senhor ben yerushalieem shook his head slightly we all know there is a subtle divide between business and improper relations the other parnassim nodded in agreement all but parido how can we learn the truth if we may not inquire into it you would smash a vessel senhor parido to learn its contents thinking nothing of the value of the vessel itself ben yerushalieem asked perhaps the vessel has no value desinea stared at parido you assured this council that you would not allow your personal feelings concerning senhor lienzo to affect your judgment and they have not he answered i defy him to tell this council how the revelation of his plans will harm him can you do so desinea asked particularly since you know well that we of the maamad know how to keep secret the inner workings of this chamber miguel surrendered to the urge to smile parido had trapped himself within his own scheme and the world would now see who was the cleverer man miguel would win this battle in a manner worthy of charming pieter senhors miguel began not very long ago senhor parido stopped me on the exchange and demanded to know for the sake of his business the nature of my trades i refused to tell him at the time believing silence to best serve the ends of myself and my partners now as a parnass he demands the same information claiming that he inquires not for the sake of his own affairs but for the sake of the nation you tell me that the workings of this chamber remain in this chamber but i hope i do not seem overly suspicious if i wonder if every member of this body will honor the tradition of secrecy a chill quiet fell upon the room several members of the council glared at parido others looked away in discomfort desinea studied a spot on the table please step outside ben yerushalieem said after a moment miguel waited clearing his mind of all expectations while the members of the maamad talked privately among themselves occasionally paridos voice would pulse through the walls but miguel could not discern the words at last he was summoned to reappear it is the opinion of this council desinea announced that you have ignored the laws of our nation without malice but to ill effect we have therefore decided to invoke the cherem to place you under the ban for a period of one day beginning with sunset tonight during that period you may not attend the synagogue consort with jews or involve yourself in any way with the community at the conclusion of that period your place among us will be as it was miguel nodded he had not escaped unscathed as he had wished but he had escaped let me add ben yerushalieem said that should this council learn that you have misrepresented your affairs you will find it far less lenient if your relationship with this beggar is other than what you have said or if your business is improper you will find us unwilling to listen to excuses have you anything to add senhor miguel told those gathered that he was sorry for his offense and deserving of their punishment and after thanking the parnassim for their wisdom he silently withdrew to be placed under the cherem even for a single day was a great disgrace it would be the topic of gossip for weeks to come men had fled amsterdam in disgust after being so punished but miguel would not be one of them he walked home hurriedly repeating over and over again the prayer of thanks he had prevailed parido had revealed himself he had sprung his trap but miguel had outmaneuvered him he paused to hug himself and then regained his stride he had won yet it was necessarily a temporary victory parido had struck and missed and the signs of his former kindness would dry up leaving only ashes more than that now miguel knew he had an enemy an angry enemy one who no longer needed to act with subtlety or with subterfuge but would attack boldly and surely fiercely but why why did parido care so much about miguels coffee trade if he did not want miguel excommunicated his scheme somehow depended upon miguels scheme which the cherem would ruin but since parido could not get what he wanted through the maamad he surely would in some other way if he had not thought himself wronged before he would surely be stinging after miguels victory today there could be no doubt that parido was now far more dangerous than ever before from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda i made it a habit to employ a few dutchmen of the lower sort to perform little tasks for me they were rough fellows as inclined to steal as the men to whom i lent but there was no helping that these ruffians claes or caspar or corneliswho can remember these odd dutch nameswould help me terrify the wretches who had borrowed money from me and were disinclined to pay me back im sure a few of my guilders found their way into those dutch purses but what could a man do i hadnt the inclination to order my business with the iron fist of a tyrant and i discovered that a little laxity in such matters promoted an odd sort of loyalty one afternoon i sat in the basement of a dank tavern sipping thin beer across from me sat an aging thief and a pair of my men lurked menacingly behind me i always had them peeling apples with sharp blades or carving pieces of wood at these moments it saved me the tedium of uttering threats aloud this thief presented a bit of a problem he was perhaps fifty years of age and looked ancient from his time of toiling upon the earth his hair was long and clumped together in thin strands his clothes stained his skin a web of ruptured veins he had borrowed some ten guilders of me at a very unreasonable rate of interest i should add to pay for the expenses surrounding the death of his wife now nearly a year later he had given me nothing and what was more announced he could give me nothing now here was not one of those men who claimed he could pay nothing while his ringed fingers stroked a belly big with bread and fish no he truly had nothing but though i pitied him i could not forgive the debt where then would i be surely you must have some article of value you can pawn i suggested some clothes you have failed to mention old jewels perhaps a cat i know a pawnbroker who will give a fair price for a proven mouser i have nothing he told me you are a thief i reminded him you can steal it or have i in some way misunderstood the nature of thievery i am not much of a thief anymore he held up his hands my fingers are no longer nimble and my feet are no longer swift i dare not make the attempt hmm i scratched at my beard how long has this been going onthis clumsyfinger and leadenfoot difficulty awhile yes he admitted a long while let us say more than a year i would say so yes so when you borrowed this money of me you knew you would not be able to repay am i a charitable board to hand out alms do you come to me because you have heard of my generosity you must tell me because i am confused i admit this harangue served no function but to buy myself time as i decided what course of action to follow rarely did i find someone who could pay me nothing and who had no skills i could put into service for myself what i asked him do you think i should do with one such as you he gave this some long consideration i think he said at last that you should cut off the little fingers from each of my hands i havent the skill of a cutpurse any longer so i wont much miss them except as any man would miss parts of his body and in doing this you can let the world know that you are determined not to be cheated i think that would be the merciful thing here was a handsome situation how could i avoid cutting off his little fingersfingers he volunteered for their severingwithout revealing myself to be the sort of man who simply refrained from those sorts of cruelties i truly believed he had forced my hand and i had no choice but to cut off the mans fingersthough being merciful i was prepared to cut off only one how else could i save my fierce reputation i know not what dark path i might have followed if i had not been rescued by the most unlikely of men as i stared at the old fellow and contemplated his fate i heard the slap of metal on wood i and my dutchmen turned and saw a figure standing in the dim light erect as a royal guard it was none other than solomon parido here is the ten guilders he owes you he said coolly i wont allow this thing to transpire i had no idea you possessed such charity in your heart i said i cannot stand by and see a man mutilated by so cruel a beast this display sickens me but i am at least gratified to know that the moral judgment i made of you has proved sound senhor the air circulates poorly in this room and i fear your sanctimoniousness will suffocate us all nevertheless im sure our friend here is grateful for your intervention the old thief knowing an opportunity when he saw one chimed in ten guilders is but the principal you have neglected the interest claes and caspar looked at me awaiting orders i did not want this farce witnessed so i sent them all out of the room i told the dutchmen to free the thief with a slap or two for good measure and they were gone i sat facing my old enemy in the thin light of a musky closet i had not had private words with parido since my exile there had been a few barbs exchanged on the street or in taverns where we crossed paths but nothing like this it occurred to me that here was a fine opportunity for revenge why could i not have claes and caspar remove his little fingers or give him a slap or two for good measure but that was not the sort of revenge i craved have you come to apologize to me i asked i gestured for him to sit on one of the old stools in the room and lit my pipe by dipping a large splinter into the oil lamp and then into the packed bowl parido remained standing too great a man to place his ass on a stool that one such as i might use you know i havent i know you havent i agreed well then it must be something for you to come here i believe it to have worked this way you had your maamad spies track me to this place and you thought it perfect for surely no one would see you enter or leave you were willing to tear open your purse for that old thief because you could not imagine a more private meeting than this and you were willing to take the opportunity when it presented itself so now that we know all that let us move on i blew smoke at him what do you want parido his dignity would not permit him to swat at the smoke but i could see him struggling not to gag i have questions for you to answer he said i suppose then well see if i feel like answering but i can promise you nothing you see parido i cant think of any reason why i should want to help you or provide you with answers about anything you treated me as no jew should treat another this is not the maamad chamber of the talmud torah this is the belly of amsterdam and if i decide you are never vomited out no one will hear from you more dont threaten me he said evenly i admired his courage and laughed at his stupidityperhaps i had not secured my villainous reputation as carefully as i ought he had every reason to be frightened yet did not seem to know or care i only shrugged in return i suppose well see whats a threat and what isnt in the meantime i am nothing short of astonished at your pluck showing up as you have as though i might be happy to forgive your wrongs i wont defend my actions i have only come to ask you if you encouraged miguel lienzo to pursue a trade in whale oil knowing that his trade would harm me while keeping that possibility hidden from lienzo himself in other words did you use him as your pawn quite the contrary i had gone so far as to warn miguel lienzo about just this sort of thing but i was not about to tell parido that much why should you ask me that because that is what lienzo says ah lienzo i thought using my name to his advantage well why should he not surely parido cornered him and rather than risking himself he blamed the souring of paridos finances on alferonda the way peasants blame the souring of milk on imps the parnass could do me no more harm than he already had i was in no danger i therefore did not feel any anger toward miguel who had only been behaving prudently i shook my head i would have done so if i could have but i will not commit the sin of lying to protect any man i had nothing to do with any whaleoil futures of yours i suspect lienzo is protecting himself or protecting another man by suggesting that it was me but you may wonder if i did not resent miguel for taking liberties with my name why did i not protect him why did i expose him to paridos anger when i might so easily have absorbed that anger myself i did so because i could not risk a rapprochement between the two far better that miguel should face paridos wrath during his brief period of exile miguel thought it best to avoid other jews of the neighborhood their stares and whispers would only sour his victory men who had suffered temporary bans always hid themselves away in their homes until they were again free to go about their business they lurked about like thieves they closed their shutters they ate their food cold miguel had too much to do and hadnt the luxury of hiding in his cellar for the day he sent a note to geertruid telling her he wished to meet the next afternoon he suggested the golden calf that disgusting little place where they had first discussed coffee might not suit his taste but at least he knew geertruids cousin did not serve other jews and on the day of his cherem he wished for secrecy geertruid wrote back and suggested instead another tavern one near the warehouses as it promised to be equally obscure miguel sent his agreement after sending out letters to his agents miguel prepared a bowl of coffee and took a moment to think about his most pressing needs how to raise five hundred guilders to complete the amount isaiah nunes required instead of obtaining the missing money he might transfer to nunes the thousand that remained to him at the very end of the week nunes would not notice or he would not be able to speak of it until the beginning of next week being too cowardly to face miguel directly when it came to such awkward things as debt he would send a letter requesting the remaining amount and thensince miguel planned to ignore the requesthe would send another note a few days later miguel would return a vague reply that would give nunes some hope that the money was forthcoming at any moment so long as he avoided running into his friend he could extend the payment date for weeks before nunes grew angry enough to threaten him with courts or the maamad clearly this matter of five hundred guilders was not nearly so dire as he had led himself to believe in a much brighter mood he indulged himself with a charming pieter pamphlet he had read only twice before he had not even set the water for his second bowl of coffee to boiling before annetje appeared from around the winding staircase her head cocked at an impish angle miguel mistook for lust he had not been feeling amorous but with a free morning before him there was no reason why he could not summon some enthusiasm annetje however only wished to tell him that the senhora awaited him in the drawing room why should she not summon miguel to speak with her she had never done so before but hannah could not see that there was anything improper in having friendly relations with her husbands brother daniel would be at the exchange and he neednt know anything of it even if it were improper which it was not and of course she could count on annetjes silence the maid if she had betrayal on her mind had far deeper wells from which to draw miguel entered dressed in his austere dutch attire and bowed slightly his eyes were sunken and the skin below them dark as though he hadnt slept in days yes senhora he said in a voice that managed to be both weary and charming you honored me with a summons annetje stood behind him and grinned like a bawd girl hannah said to her fetch me my yellow cap the one with the blue stones senhora you have not worn that cap in a years time i cannot say where it is then you had better start looking she answered she would hear about that later annetje would lecture her tell her mistress it was wrong to speak to her so threaten and tease her but hannah would face those problems when they arose for now annetje would not dare disobey in front of miguel yes senhora she replied in a convincingly subservient tone it is best to give her a task so she does not spend her time at keyholes hannah said miguel took a seat she is a well enough girl he answered absently im sure you know best hannah felt herself redden i must thank you for taking the time to sit with me senhor it is i who should thank you conversation with a charming lady will pass the time far more amiably than will books and papers i had forgotten that you have those things available to you i had thought you must be sitting alone and in silence but your learning frees you from dullness ive thought it must be terrible not to read he said is it a loss you feel hannah nodded she liked the softness in his voice my father thought learning improper for me and my sisters and i know daniel thinks the same should we have a girl child even though i have heard the rabbi senhor mortera say that a daughter may engage in learning for which the wife has no time she lifted her hand to place it upon her abdomen but then changed her mind she had become conscious of growing big of the swelling pressing against her gown and while it was a sensation that usually comforted her she did not want miguel to think of her as nothing more than a woman growing big with child they say it is not so among the tudescos she continued half afraid that she prattled like a fool their women learn to read and they are given holy books translated into the common tongue i think that way is better a strange thrill shot through her body as though she had just thrown herself off a bridge or before a speeding cart never before had she dared to say such things aloud miguel was not her husband of course but he was her husbands brother and for now that seemed to her dangerous enough he stared at her at first she thought she saw anger and she pressed herself into her chair in preparation for the sting of rebuke but she had misread him his eyebrows raised slightly a little smile upon his lips she saw surprise amusement too and maybe even delight i had never thought you had such opinions have you discussed them with your husband he might very well permit some learning i have tried she told him but your brother does not wish to hear me speak on matters of which i know nothing he asked how i can have an opinion on something of which i am entirely ignorant miguel erupted into a raspy laugh you cannot fault him for his logic hannah reddened but after an instant she realized that miguel mocked not her but daniel and so she joined him and together they laughed at her husband may i ask a favor of you she said and then squirmed uncomfortably at the sound of her own words she had thought to wait longer before mentioning it but found she grew impatient and nervous best to have it said of course senhora may i once again try that coffeetea you let me drink before what else could she do she dared not steal any more of miguels diminishing supply and she had eaten all the fruit shed taken besides now that she knew that it was supposed to be a drink and not a food she did not think there would be as much pleasure in grinding down the berries with her teeth miguel smiled it would be my great pleasure so long as you recall my request of your silence then without waiting for her reply he rang the bell for annetje who appeared too rapidly to have been searching through hannahs trunks she allowed her eyes to lock with hannahs but miguel alone spoke to her reminding her of how to prepare the drink when the girl left hannah could feel her face turn hot but she was almost certain that miguel did not noticeor that he was most adept at pretending not to notice which was nearly as good hannah burned in the heat of his attention he smiled at her he met her eyes he listened when she spoke this is what it would be like to have a husband who loved her she thought the women in stage plays must feel thus when they talked to their loves still she knew it was but fantasy how long could she talk with him how long before a clever man like miguel recovered from his stumble and moved into his own house leaving hannah alone with her husband not alone of course there would be god willing her child and her childher daughterwould be her salvation were you to marry again and have children she asked would you allow your daughters to learn i must be honest with you senhora and tell you that i have never thought about it i always assumed your sex cared nothing for learning and was happy to be spared the pains of study but now that you tell me otherwise i would look at the matter with new eyes then you and i are of a mind after moving to amsterdam daniel had been busy with his studies learning the ancient tongue and the law and hannah thought she should do the same if she was a jew she should know what it meant to be a jew she could not know how her husband might respond to such a thing but she had hoped he would warm to her display of interest she considered the wording for days playing out conversations in her mind finally one shabbat night after they had engaged in the mitzvah of marital relations she decided she should never find her sleepy and sated husband in a more receptive mood why have i not been taught the law senhor she asked there was only a vague hastening of his breath i have thought she continued speaking hardly above a whisper that i too might learn to read and understand hebrew and perhaps i might learn to read portuguese too perhaps you might learn to transform rods into serpents and to part the waters of the sea he had answered rolling away from her hannah lay there afraid to move gritting her teeth with anger and shame he must have felt some remorse for dismissing her for a few days later when he returned home in the evening he pressed into her hands two silver bracelets you are a good wife he said to her but you must not wish for more than what belongs to a wife learning is for men it must be she now said to miguel that learning is not forbidden to women else the tudescos would not allow it for they have the same law do they not it is not forbidden miguel explained i am told that there have even been great talmudists among the ladies in times past some things belong to law and some things belong to custom it is written that a woman may be called to the law but her modesty ought to forbid her from answering but what is modesty he asked as though puzzling out the question himself these dutchwomen know nothing of it and yet they do not feel immodest annetje now arrived with the bowls of coffee hannah breathed in the scent and salivated at the thought of drinking more than its flavor she loved how it made her feel if she had been a scholar she would have been able to unravel any point of law had she been a merchant she could have outwitted any man upon the exchange now she again lifted the bowl to her lips and tasted the engaging bitterness a taste she realized that made her think of miguel this is the taste of miguel she told herself bitter and inviting she waited for annetje who flashed all sorts of knowing looks to leave before she began to speak again may i ask you what happened between you and the council miguel opened his mouth in surprise as though she had spoken of something forbidden but he also appeared pleased perhaps he found her boldness exciting how bold should she be it is nothing of substance there were some questions about business partners some on the council do not like the people with whom i trade so they placed me under this cherem for a day as a warning these are pretty questions from so pretty a woman hannah turned away so that he would not see her blush do you suggest that a woman should not ask such questions not at all i delight in an inquisitive woman perhaps she suggested you delight in an inquisitive woman in the same way you delight in defying the council miguel smiled warmly i think you may be right senhora i have never much cared for authority and i love to see it challengedbe it the authority of a husband or the maamad hannah felt herself redden again but met his gaze all the same when you were married she asked did you love to see your wife challenge you he laughed most times he said if i am to be honest i must say that i am as prone to grow comfortable in authority as any man that is no reason why i should not be questioned however i might have followed my fathers example and never studied the ways of our race had i not thought this way for it is what i love best about the teachings of the rabbis everything must be questioned and disputed looked at from all angles examined and held up to the light the parnassim and men likewell like many men i knowforget that they wish to see things always as they are and never ask how they might be and is this the reason your delight in challenge why you were called before the maamad my husband tells me you have defiled holy law as i say senhora there is law and there is custom and custom is often little more than a fable so long as i tell the parnassim what they want to hear all is well what they want to hear hannah asked permitting herself the slightest of smiles you lied to them he laughed only little lies they do not want to hear important lies but is it not a sin to lie you tease me senhora i suppose it is a sin but an insignificant one a man of business lies all the time he lies to put trades to his advantage or to construct circumstances just so a man may lie to make his position look better than it is or weaker than it is depending on his goals none of these are the same as lying in a way that may harm another man these lies are merely the rules of business and such rules surely apply when dealing with the maamad but those rules would not apply to a woman speaking to her husband hannah had meant only to clarify but she realized the moment she spoke the words that they carried weight she had not intended it depends on the husband miguel answered pointedly her stomach flipped in fear she was going too far this difference between law and custom is very confusing she said quickly hoping to return the conversation to safer matters the maamad is a political body he said among the tudescos there are rabbis who give the law to the politicians but among us it is the other way sometimes they forget the glory of the holy torah they forget why we are here the miracle of our being living jews rather than dead ones or living papists he took a final sip of his coffee and then set down the bowl i thank you for your company he told her but i must now go i have an appointment to keep how can you have appointments while under the ban he smiled warmly i am full of secrets he said just as you are maybe he knew everything after allthe church the widow everything as she watched him go she thought she must tell him regardless of the consequences she must tell him then she could tell him about the widow too and her life would be in his hands as she sipped her drink she considered that to have her life in his hands would not be so very terrible at all the first thing miguel saw when he walked into the singing carp was alonzo alferonda his squat form spread out toadlike on a bench speaking quietly to a pair of low dutchmen he rose upon seeing miguel and hurried over on his short legs senhor he called out eagerly i am delighted to hear of your victory miguel looked around though he was inclined not to worry about maamad spies on a day when technically he was not a member of the community i hardly expected to see you here i should like to buy you a drink to celebrate your victory over the pharisees another time perhaps ive a meeting just now you run some errand of the coffee trade alferonda asked this coffee trade will be my undoing parido cornered me on the exchange and demanded to know my dealings in coffee i refused and before i could turn my head i stood before the maamad oh hes a tricky one but the greatest way to foil him will be for you to succeed in your business miguel nodded let me ask you something alonzo you know more about coffee than i do youve been drinking it for years i read in a pamphlet written by an englishman that coffee suppresses the urges of the flesh but i have been feeding some to my brothers wife and she seems rather animated by it your brothers wife you say ho miguel you are more of a rascal than i had thought and i commend you for she is a pretty thing and now plump with child too so you neednt worry about unfortunate results i have no plans to cuckold my brother i have problems enough i only wonder if the coffee may be the difficulty with her you cannot cuckold a man whose wife you cannot get with child but well set that aside for the moment id advise you not to put too much faith in those english pamphlets those people will write anything to sell their scribblings here is something i do know however when the queen of sheba came to visit the court of solomon among the gifts she brought him was a great chest full of the most exotic spices of the east that night after the palace had gone to bed king solomon was so full of desire he forced himself on her i have heard the story miguel said among the turks it is said that the chest of spices included coffee berries and it was this fruit that spurred his lust i would feed your brothers pretty wife no more coffee fruit unless you want to follow solomons path only in wisdom it is always wise to take a handsome woman when there will be no consequences i dont know if i would say that it is wise to do so only desirable then you admit it alferonda said poking his finger gleefully in miguels chest miguel shrugged i admit only in seeing beauty where there is beauty and finding it a sad thing when it is neglected merciful christ alferonda shouted youre in love alonzo youre no more than a gossipy grandmother with a beard now if youre done inventing tales ive business to tend to ah his other love the dutch widow alferonda said i understand your haste lienzo i would surely rebuff myself for her sake geertruid made her way through the crowd and smiled at miguel as though she were hosting him at her own table miguel winced somehow he did not like the idea of introducing geertruid to alferonda one illicit presence ought not to consort with another good day senhor he said and started to pull away ho ho alferonda shouted after them are you not going to introduce me to this lady he pranced forward to stand by geertruids side in a sweeping move he lifted his wide hat from his head and bowed deeply alonzo alferonda at your service madam should you find yourself in need of any assistance a gentleman can provide i hope you will do no more than to summon your humble servant i thank you she smiled warmly im sure the lady will sleep better tonight for having had the offer miguel said pulling her away i should love to know more of her sleeping alferonda shouted but he didnt follow what charming friends you have she said as they took a seat if she felt any embarrassment about her revelation of the previous night at the brewers guild feast she did not show it none more so than you he looked across the tavern and saw that alferonda had left geertruid took a small pipe from a leather sack and began to stuff it with tobacco now she said on to business have you looked into getting our money returned miguel could hardly believe her i have hardly had time to tend to that matter have you no questions of how i fared before the council she lit her pipe with the flame of the oil lamp i am sure you prevailed i have faith in you and you would not be in such good spirits had you not won the day now on to the matter of my investments miguel sighed angry that she was souring his victory with this peevishness about money why had he ever involved himself with this dutchwoman with her secrets and stolen capital i know we agreed to wait two weeks she told him but if you have no solution to our iberian problems we must get the money returned miguel refused to show his concern madam where is your adventurous spirit i begin to suspect that you would rather see your money returned than you would the fortune it will bring you you must have faith that i will sort out these small difficulties i dont believe you will sort them out she shook her head slowly with her face turned downward and her hair dangling just over her eyes she looked like a mournful madonna in a painting then she lifted her gaze and grinned i dont believe you will sort them out she explained because i silly woman that i am have found our solution too much had happened in one day and miguels head had begun to ache he put one hand to his brow i dont understand you he moaned did i not love you so well i would demand another five percent for doing your work but i do love you and well let the matter pass as they say the good farmer makes his own rain so while you were playing cat and bird with your foolish council i found an agent of my own to work for our cause in iberia you you have sent an agent into the most pernicious nation on earth where did you find this person how can we be certain he wont betray us you neednt fear she puffed on her pipe with obvious satisfaction i found him through my lawyer in antwerp a city you know that retains many ties to spain im assured he can be trusted with my very life your life is in no danger but you had better hope he can be entrusted with your wealth if the inquisition suspects he is a jews agent hell be tortured until he reveals all thats the very beauty of it he has no knowledge that he works for a jew only that he works for a delightful amsterdam widow he cant betray what he doesnt know and his motions shall attract no suspicion for even in his own mind he does nothing worthy of notice she had been reckless to embark upon this plan without consulting him but he could find no fault with her actions only a moment ago he had lamented his connection with her but now he recalled well why he so loved this remarkable woman you trust this man ive never seen him but i trust my lawyer and he says we may depend on him and what are his instructions the same as you have given the others she licked her lips slowly as though paused in thought to secure agents in lisbon oporto and madrid men who will do our bidding to the letter though in this case it will only be my bidding these agents are to await my instructions and then purchase as directed at a particular time and place she studied miguels face attempting to register his mood you cannot object he could not object and yet somehow he did of course not i am only surprised we had discussed that these plans were to be mine geertruid placed a hand on top of his dont feel unmanned she said softly i promise i think you as great as ever but an opportunity arose that i had to seize he nodded you were right to do it he continued to nod yes this is all very good perhaps he had reacted too strongly what did it matter whence the agent came geertruid for all her faults was no fool miguel sighed tasting the cheap tobacco in the air and savoring it as though it were perfume a thought suddenly flashed before him and he stood up very straight do you realize what has happened to us this moment what has happened geertruid asked she lounged lazily upon the bench like a satisfied whore waiting to be paid we faced one obstacle the one thing that stood between us and our riches and we have just removed that obstacle geertruid blinked we must still set our agents in place and count upon them to do our bidding she said as though she understood not the first thing of his own scheme a mere formality miguel assured her the exchange bank may as well give us unlimited credit for we are already wealthy we now only wait for the rest of the world to recognize what we now know he leaned over to her and placed his lips as close to hers as he had dared since the night she had rejected his kiss he didnt care about the cherem or joachim or even that he had lost her money those were only details and details can be managed we are already wealthy madam we have already won though he had been avoiding the east indies corner of the bourse all week miguel had only finished a small trade in pepper when he felt a hard tap on the shoulder more like a jab there stood an impatient and sheepish isaiah nunes nunes miguel shouted cheerfully and grabbed his arm you are looking well my friend i trust all is on schedule with our little business and we may expect the shipment as planned nunes could never resist the blunt force of miguels cheer yes all is on schedule you know the price of coffee has been going up but i secured our price before the price rose you will still pay shipment at thirtythree guilders per barrel he swallowed some of us honor our words miguel ignored the jibe and the contents remain a secret just as i promised my agents have assured me that the crates will be marked as you have instructed no one will know their true contents he looked away for an instant now i must raise another matter i know what you are going to saymiguel held up a handand do you think i would come seek you out like this if i had no intention of paying you i promise you the money will be there in two days three at the latest nunes sighed you did not seek me out i came to you and youve made promises before i expect any moment to receive the money i need he lied all will be made easy youve not a thing to worry about it was miguel who had not a thing to worry about the business had been contracted with the east india company and it could not be canceled nunes would simply have to float the five hundred guilders for a little while he had the money it was no hardship for him miguel decided it was time to set the next phase of his plan in motion he visited a broker with whom he had done business before and bought coffee puts to be due in ten weeks time thereby guaranteeing himself the right to sell at the current high price miguel wanted to buy a thousand guilders worth of puts but the broker seemed reluctant to advance miguel so large a loan having no other choice he used his brothers name as security there could be no harm in doing so miguel would profit from his puts and pay the broker without daniel ever learning what his brother had done ill need to send a letter to your brother confirming his agreement the broker said of course my brother however has a tendency to let his correspondence sit for days mark the outside of the note if you would with a circle and i will see he addresses your concerns immediately miguel would have annetje keep an eye out for the note it should be easy to keep it from attracting daniels notice once the transaction had been completed miguel fought off the queasy remorse certainly it was tricky putting his brothers money at risk but everything was in hand he would not have been so desperate if his brother hadnt demanded payment on the loan at so rotten a time it would be one thing if miguel had been struggling but never before had he known the market so well as he did now and with coffee he would be creating and shaping the market not merely responding to it the price of coffee would go down because he would make it go down daniels money could not be safer he expected the news of his puts to travel fast but he did not expect it to travel quite so quickly as it did one hour later as miguel shuffled out of the exchange and onto the dam solomon parido appeared by his side he smiled politely with no signs of resentment over what had happened before the council i hope i have not violated any rules today miguel said appearing on the exchange without properly greeting you perhaps i expect ill receive another summons before long i expect the same parido laughed softly as though making light with a friend you must not think there was anything of a personal nature in what transpired in that room with the maamad i merely acted in accordance with what i believed to be right and proper of course miguel agreed flatly however your likening the maamad to the inquisitionthat will make you no friends there are too many in this city who have lost loved ones to the inquisition you forget that the inquisition took my father i know what it is and so does my brother if he ever sees things as i do he may not be so quick to follow you blindly you judge him too harshly he only wishes to do what is best for his family and that family includes you i suspect he will be very proud of you when he learns of your brilliant scheme in the east indies trade my scheme miguel studied his face for some sign of what might be coming yes i had no idea how clever you were but now i see in its fullness your plan wait until the price of coffee rises because of the growth of demand and then gamble a large sum of money you do not have on the price falling yes very clever indeed miguel smiled back parido knew nothing but what miguel had intended the world to learn though he had learned it with disturbing speed im glad you approve i hope nothing happens to make the price rise again in ten weeks time i hope so too miguel told him he would not appear too clever or too confident let parido believe he knew miguels plan rather than look for more you think the price will rise but ive heard that since i wagered others have followed suit and more will follow well see what sort of momentum has begun i suppose we will parido agreed clearly thinking about something else already there was another note from joachim when he returned home another note in that uneven drunken hand if you speak to my wife again i will kill you it said i will creep up behind you so you wont know im there and slit your throat ill do it if you again approach clara there were two lines that had been crossed out and then underneath he wrote in fact i may just kill you anyway for the pleasure of revenge the note had a kind of manic sincerity had miguels silly banter with clara how could she have been so stupid as to tell him about it pushed her husband over the edge he cursed joachim and he cursed himself it would be a long time before he would again feel at ease in the deceptive shadows of twilight a figure crept up behind him but slipped back into the dusk before miguel could spin around to face it an indeterminate shape lurked behind a tree just out of his vision something splashed into the canal a few paces behind his hurried steps each street brought miguel closer to some deadly confrontation with joachim out of the corner of his eye he saw a madmans foul grin the glimmer of a knife blade a pair of lunging hands miguel was no stranger to death in lisbon he had lived in terror of the arbitrary power of the inquisition and of the bands of bloodthirsty villains that had roamed the streets almost with impunity in recent years amsterdam had been subject to horrible visitations of plague men and women turned purplishblack in the face developed rashes and died within days thanks to the holy one blessed be he people now smoked so much tobacco for it alone prevented the spread of that disease still death lurked everywhere miguel knew as well as anyone how to live with its random assaults on the living he did not know how to live while being hunted and so joachim began to win his war upon his enemys quiet miguel found his concentration wandering even upon the exchange he watched helplessly as parido made his way through the crowds of merchants buying coffee futures betting that the price would continue to rise if something should happen to make miguel unable to control the price of the coffee he would lose money on his puts and then daniel would learn that miguel had abused his name and his funds what if nunes refused to deliver the goods until miguel paid his debts it all struck him as futile when he might be dead at any moment of an assassins blade miguel knew he could not live with that possibility even if joachim never intended to draw blood he had already done great harm no one could doubt miguels need to put an end to it he needed to live his life without fear of some madman stalking him it took him a few more days to determine how to proceed but once he had his idea firmly in mind it seemed to him both sordid and clever it would involve some unpleasantness but he could not expect to deal with a person like joachim without confronting the unsavory certainly that had been his problem all along he had tried to engage with joachim as though he were a sound man as though he might be convinced by reason but time and time again joachim had shown himself unable or unwilling to act as a man of sense he recalled a tale of charming pieter in which a ruffian sought revenge against the trickster outmatched by an enemys physical prowess pieter had hired an even more dangerous ruffian to protect himself at the singing carp they told him geertruid had not been seen in half a week and that meant she might be gone for a few days more often hendrick would go with her but not always and miguel had no need to wait for her return in fact he thought this might be the better way why should geertruid know all his business he spent the better part of the day scouring the taverns where he might expect to see hendrick but it was not until late afternoon that he found his man sitting at a table with a few of his rough friends smoking a long pipe that smelled like a mixture of old tobacco and dung hendrick had mentioned the tavern in passing before but miguel had never imagined that anything would lead him to enter such a place he could taste in his mouth the scent of rotten wood from the tables the flood had been covered with filthy straw in the back a crowd of men made a game of watching two rats fight each other seeing miguel hendrick let out a barking laugh and then whispered something to his friends who joined in the cackling why speak of the devil it is the very jew man hendrick puffed furiously at his pipe as though the clouds of smoke might engulf miguel ive been looking for you miguel said i need to talk with you for a moment drink up boys hendrick shouted to his companions i must take my leave for a time i have a meeting of importance as you can see outside the tavern the deadfish smell of the canal coated miguels throat the summer heat had begun to settle upon the city and the stink with it he breathed in deep through his mouth and led hendrick toward the alley which had a slightly more pleasant odor of soil and old beer a distressed cat with filthy white fur and a mangled ear opened its pink mouth and hissed at them but hendrick hissed back and the cat fled into the shadows my lady has gone away for the nonce and i am used to it being that where there is no madam damhuis there is no senhor either has she gone to her lawyer in antwerp again so youve come in search of her after all he punched miguel congenially in the arm ive not come for her miguel offered a knowing look of his own but im curious ha hendrick barked youve kept that curiosity in check havent you good jew man shes a lady with many secrets from you from me from the world some say shes as ordinary as buttered bread but she keeps secrets to seem otherwise but you know the truth he nodded i know the truth miguel had so many questions about his partner that he had thought to never have answered now hendrick hinted he might learn them all but could he trust the dutchman not to talk of miguels questioning the man liked to drink and his tongue was known to wag this conversation was proof enough tell me only what the lady herself would tell me miguel said at last ill not pry into any secrets she wishes to keep hendrick nodded you are a cautious man arent you i respect that you like the lady and wont have her not liking you and i think youd like her all the same if you knew the truthwhich is at best a dull sort of truthfor she might just as easily tell the world where she goes when she goes a visit to her lawyer or his sister or her brothers widow need not be a great secret ive not asked to be told all this but ive chosen to tell you hendrick said the levity draining from his voice because i love madam damhuis with all my heart but she can be cruel she likes to torment men she loves to drive them mad with desire and then send them on their way and she likes to drive them mad with curiosity too she keeps the most trivial details secret and all whisper her name its no crime miguel volunteered feeling the need to defend her hendrick nodded jew man if you said otherwise id slit your throat no one would insult that lady while i stand by for i owe her my life and more but i tell you these things because i know you love her and you would not love her less for the knowing miguel held out his hand in the dutch style i thank you for your trust hendrick grinned and shook firmly theres been too long an uneasiness between us i want only to see it end you and madam are friends and i would be your friend too miguel could not but rejoice at his good luck i am glad to hear you say this for ive come to you with a most delicate problem and i had hoped you would be able to assist me you need but name it miguel took a deep breath ive been bothered by a madman this fellow believes i owe him money which is not the case for we both suffered in the same transaction which was managed both fairly and legally now he follows me and has begun to threaten my life ive been unable to deter him with reason and i cant go to the law because he has not done me or my property any real harm i shit on the law the law wont help you hendrick said still puffing merrily once he slices you open then you may seek your redress with the law what good is that you need but tell me his name and ill see to it that he never does another man harm again i have seen that you are a man who knows something of how to defend himself miguel explained with some difficulty it pained him to offer hendrick even this brutal flattery i recall how well you reacted in the tavern make no excuses my friend i understand that you cannot risk yourself by engaging in a scrape with a low fellow were you jews not watched i know a man such as you are could tend to this matter without help now you need only tell me who he is his name is joachim waagenaar and he lives by the oude kerk if he lives by the oude kerk i suppose any number of accidents might befall a fellow in that part of town without the world taking notice of course good feelings between us being what they are such things cost money fifty guilders should do nicely miguel blinked several times as though this price had poked him in his eye just what did he hope hendrick might do joachim was a madman so why did miguel feel so uneasy about this transaction thats rather more than i thought we may be friends enough now but i still take a risk you understand of course of course miguel said i did not say i absolutely would not pay it only that it was more than i thought think as much as you like when youve made up your mind come see me i will do so and in the meantime hendrick grinned of course ill say nothing to the lady i understand you well enough and now that we have each others secrets you need not wonder if you can trust me or no miguel took his hand once more i offer you my thanks knowing that i may depend upon you has put my mind at ease im happy to serve you he blew out a cloud of smoke and returned to the tavern a light mist had begun to fall it was just the sort of weather for a villain who might hide himself in fog and dark the rain mixed with his perspiration making him feel heavy and encumbered in his clothing nevertheless having spoken to hendrick made him more comfortable already he had options he could concoct a strategy of his own joachim had not outmatched him perhaps he considered it was not necessary to have hendrick give joachim a thorough beating now that he had almost commissioned the job he winced at its brutality if there was a way to avoid it it would be best avoided after all he had not sought out hendrick to harm joachim but to make himself feel safer and the simple act of having discussed the option of the beating rid him of many concerns he might see that joachim came to harm at any time he wished having that power the righteous thing would be to spare the creature mercy after all was one of the seven highest qualities of the holy one blessed be he miguel too could aim to be merciful he would wait joachim surely never meant to actually kill miguel but should he again make these threats he would learn that miguel understood justice as well as mercy before he reached the vlooyenburg the mist had turned to rain miguel wanted nothing so much as to change his clothes and sit before a fire and perhaps read a little torahall this contemplation of mercy left him longing to feel closer to the holiness of the most high first he might review the story of how charming pieter had tricked the greedy horse trader a tale always certain to cheer him once inside he removed his shoes after the dutch fashion so as to avoid tracking mud through the house though his stockings had soaked through and he left wet footprints upon the tiled floor he had only gone a little way toward the entrance to the cellar when he saw hannah hovering in the doorway the shadows accentuating the swelling of her belly good afternoon senhora he said too hastily there could no longer be any doubt of her intentions her eyes wide and moist under her black scarf fixed on him greedily i must speak with you she said in a quiet voice he replied without thinking you wish another taste of my drink she shook her head not now i must say something else may we go to the drawing room he asked she shook her head again no we mustnt i cant have my husband finding us there together he will suspect he will suspect what miguel almost blurted out did she believe them already lovers had she so lively an imagination that it did not end with women scholars miguel too had indulged in the delicious crime of flirtation but he did not believe he could take it to the next stage that of secret meetings of hiding from her husband of reveling in one of the worst of sins no one cherished the delights of a fanciful mind more than miguel but a mana personmust know where fancy ends and truth begins he might hold hannah in a new esteem find her winsome as well as pretty he might even love her for all he knew but he would not act on those feelings we must speak here she said but quietly we cannot be overheard perhaps youve made a mistake miguel offered and we neednt speak quietly at all hannah offered a smile slight and sweet as though she were humoring him as though he were too simple to understand her words may the holy one blessed be he forgive me for unleashing coffee upon mankind he thought this drink will turn the world upside down i am not mistaken senhor i have something to tell you something that concerns you very nearly she took a deep breath it is about your friend senhor the widow miguel felt a sudden dizziness he leaned against the wall geertruid damhuis he breathed what of her what could you have to tell me of her hannah shook her head i dont know precisely oh forgive me senhor for i hardly even know how to say what i wish to say and i fear to do so will put my very life in your hands but i also fear your betrayal if i do not speak betrayal what do you say please senhor i am trying not very long ago only a few weeks really i saw the dutch widow on the street and she saw me we both had something to hide i dont know what she had to hide but she seemed to think i did and she threatened me to keep silent i thought it could do no harm but now i am not so certain miguel took a step backwards geertruid what could she have to hide and what did it mean to him it could be anything a lover a deal an embarrassment or it could be a matter of business it made no sense what did you have to hide senhora she shook her head i wish i didnt have to tell you but i have made up my mind to do so i know i can trust you senhor and if you must confront her and you make it clear you already know my secret perhaps she wont tell others and the worst may be spared can i tell you and trust that you will tell no one else of course miguel said hastily though he wished desperately that he could somehow avoid this entire conversation i am ashamed she said and yet not ashamed to tell you this but i saw the widow on my way from a sacred place a church of catholic worship senhor miguel stared at her with unfocused eyes until she blended into the dark wall he hardly knew what to think his own brothers wife a woman for whom he had cared and felt desire had revealed herself a secret catholic you have betrayed your husband he asked quietly she swallowed hard the tears had not yet come but they would come soon they filled the air like a coming rain how can you speak of betrayal i was never told until the eve of my wedding that i was a jew have i not been betrayed you betrayed miguel demanded once again forgetting to keep his voice quiet how can you say so you live in the new jerusalem have you or your brother or the rabbis spoken to me of what is in your torah or talmud other than to tell me what i must do to serve you when i go to your synagogue the prayers are in hebrew and the talk is in spanish yet i may not learn these tongues if i have a daughter must i raise her to serve an arbitrary god who will not even show his face only because she is a girl it is well for you to talk of betrayal when the world hands you all you desire i am offered nothing and if i wish to take for myself some comfort am i to be condemned yes miguel said though he did not believe it and instantly regretted having said so but he was angry he could not have said why but he felt wounded as though she had violated some trust between them he had not seen the tears start but there they were glistening upon her face he fought the urge to pull her to his body to feel her breasts against his chest but he couldnt so instead he pressed on i have nothing more to say to you now leave me so i may think on what to do with this knowledge that i wish i had never heard the cruelty of his words stuck in his throat he knew what they would mean to her she would wonder if miguel might keep quiet he now knew his brothers wife was a papist and that information could destroy daniel miguel might reveal this information to usurp his brothers place in the community or he could use it to threaten daniel into forgiving his debts miguel would do none of these things no matter how repulsive her sin he would not betray hannah even so he felt such sudden rage that he had to punish her and his words were the only way he knew how i heard voices is something wrong daniel appeared at the doorway of the kitchen looking pale his little eyes focused on his wife standing far too close to a retreating miguel it is only your silly brother hannah said hiding her face in the poor light i saw him come in wearing these wet clothes but he refuses to change out of them it is not for a woman to decide if a man is silly daniel pointed out not unkindly he merely illuminated information she may have forgotten nevertheless he said to miguel she may be right i wont have you catch plague and kill us all the entire household has an opinion on my clothes miguel affected as best he could an easy manner ill go change at once before the maid is summoned to speak her piece hannah took a hurried step back and miguel turned instinctively toward the stairwell daniel had seen nothing miguel could be almost certain of that what after all had there been for him to see yet he must know the full vocabulary of his wifes expressions and surely he had seen one upon her face that could not be a simple matter of housewifely advice his confusion about hannahs romish inclinations was so intense that he did not even consider what she had said about geertruid for several hours once he recalled her words however he found himself awake much of the night regretting his cruelty and wishing there were a way to go to hannah and ask her questions and perhaps apologize hannah was first out of the house the next morning stepping onto the stoop to look for the bread man whose cries she heard through windows hazy with morning cool before her husband had opened his eyes before annetje had even washed and begun to prepare breakfast for the house hannah had dressed herself put her veil firmly in place and stepped outside she found the pigs head it sat upon the stoop just inches from the door angled in a congealed pool of blood already ants had begun to crawl upon it in such numbers that at first it appeared to hannah black and writhing her shriek roused the house and the closest neighbors miguel had slept badly and had already risen prayed and dressed he sat struggling with the weekly torah portion when her shrill voice penetrated the tiny windows of the cellar and he was the first to find hannah upon the steps a hand clasped over her mouth she turned to him and fell into his arms burying her head in his shirt as she wept they called immediately for the doctor who gave her potions to help her sleep and explained that if she could be kept calm for a day the danger to her life would pass hannah had insisted that she needed no potions she had been only startled but the doctor would not believe a woman could receive so great a shock without its disordering her humors and more important he explained the humors of the unborn baby daniel shot miguel hard looks but said nothing made no accusations nevertheless miguel could no longer ignore the simple truth that things between himself and his brother would never be the same from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda i returned home one night from evening prayers yes evening prayersthere were still thank god a few small synagogues that defied the maamad and permitted me to worship among their number so long as i was careful not to be seen when i felt a hand grip my shoulder i looked up expecting to see some desperate debtor who fearing for his life thought to strike at alferonda before he could be struck instead i saw solomon parido senhor i said swallowing my relief i hardly thought to receive another visit from you again so soon parido appeared hesitant he no more liked coming to see me than i liked seeing him perhaps he liked it less i had nothing to lose from these encounters but he had his pride i had not thought to seek you out and yet i observed here you are lurking in the streets waiting for me i had cause to be anxious that he knew i had been at worship but he said nothing and i could only conclude that he would not have failed to play so valuable a card my friends at the small synagogue were safe parido set his jaw as though bracing himself and turned to me i want to know more of what you have planned with miguel lienzo i picked up my pace if only a little it was a trick i learned so long ago i hardly even notice doing it most times varying your pace of walking sets your companion on edge he has to think more about trivial things than he ought and that takes his concentration from where it needs to be i marvel at your presumption i said what makes you think if i had anything planned i would tell my enemy i may be your enemy as you style it but lienzo is not you are manipulating him i let out a laugh if you think so why not tell him things have gone too far now hed never believe me ive asked his brother to warn him off you but i doubt that will do much good i doubt it too a better strategy might have been to have his brother encourage him to do business with me i winked at him i heard someone left the head of a pig on his brothers doorstep i wonder if you senhor might know who would do such a thing how dare you accuse me of so wretched a crime listen to me alferonda if you bear any friendship for lienzo youll stop this if he crosses me ill destroy him i shook my head you think you can destroy anyone you like you think you can work miracles of destruction your power as parnass has corrupted you utterly parido and you cannot even see it youve become a distortion of the man you once were you threaten me you threaten lienzoyou see plots everywhere i pity you you can no longer tell what is true and what is your own fancy he stared at me for a moment and i could tell by his face that i had struck something this was the oldest trick of them all but i knew it well i had practiced it often the appearance of sincerity can truly unman even the most stalwart foe think i said eager to press the advantage of what you have accused me of what you have accused miguel do you really think it plausible that men engage themselves in these wild plots is it not far more likely that your suspicion and greed have misled you not only to suspect things that are untrue but to do real harm to others i see ive wasted my time he said and turned away i was not one however to let the fish go once hooked you havent wasted your time i called after him if you will only think of what i have said you are wrong parido you are wrong about me and wrong about lienzo and it is not too late for you to atone for your sins he began to walk faster and hunched his shoulders as if to protect himself from whatever i might hurl at him and i did hurl i hurled lies powerful lies that fell like stones because they so clearly resembled the truth in the same way you can make a simple peasant who has given you his last coin think that a mere lout with too much hair on his back is a werewolf he fears it may be a werewolf so all you need do is point and whisper a suggestion and the peasant will hear the howling for himself though still in bed hannah ate her soup that evening and chatted calmly with her husband miguel and daniel both showed their relief though the storm had not yet passed miguel had been doing his best to stay out of daniels path but that night annetje brought him word that his brother wished to see him in his study miguel found him hunched over his writing table scribbling in the light of a good candle three or four more flickered in the breeze of the open window daniel had been smoking an acrid tobacco and miguel felt a headache gathering its forces how does your wife miguel asked i no longer fear for her life these frights you know can be fatal to a womans delicate humors particularly one in her condition but the doctor tells me there is no risk to the child im glad its a terrible thing daniel paused for a moment he picked up a pen and then set it down again it is a terrible thing what do you know of it miguel though he had considered how he might respond to this line of questioning for the better part of the day miguel still had no clear idea of what he could say to put matters at ease did daniel want a confession or did he want to be comforted i cant say for certain he told his brother at last but you have ideas it was a statement not a question i cant say that i have no guess but i have no way of knowing for certain perhaps you should tell me about your guess miguel shook his head it would be inappropriate for me to speculate it is wrong to make accusations where i can prove nothing prove nothing daniel slammed his hand down on the table is not the head of a pig proof recollect that you are staying in my house and your actions have endangered my family i nearly lost my wife and child today i insist you tell me what you suspect miguel sighed he had not wanted to speculate too wildly but who could deny that his hand had been forced very well i suspect solomon parido what daniel stared incredulously he forgot to finish puffing on his pipe and smoke drifted lazily from his mouth you must be mad no it is precisely the sort of scheme to hatch from paridos vile mind and i believe you suspect him as much as i do he has been plotting against me and what better way to sully my name than to leave this thing at my door as though i have brought it upon myself preposterous your conclusions require a contortion of logic why would senhor parido do such a thing where would so righteous a man acquire an unclean animal have you some better way to explain this madness yes daniel said with the solemn nod of a judge i think you owe someone a great deal of money i think this money may be the result of a gambling debt or some criminal doing which is why the person you owe cant go to the courts this abomination upon the stoop of my house is meant to warn you to pay or face the most unpleasant of consequences miguel concentrated to keep his face from revealing anything how did you reach this fanciful conclusion quite inevitably daniel said hannah found a note rolled up and slipped through the ear of the pig he paused for a moment that he might study his brothers response she tucked it away in her pocket for reasons i cannot guess but the doctor found it and presented it to me with the greatest concern he reached to the bookshelf behind him for a small piece of paper which he presented to miguel the paper was old and tornclearly ripped from a document used for another purposeand it was badly stained with blood miguel could not make out much of the writing except a few words in dutchi want my moneyand a few lines down my wife miguel handed it back i have no idea of its meaning you have no idea none i will have to report this incident to the maamadwhich will no doubt investigate we cant keep the matter quiet at any rate too many neighbors witnessed hannahs distress you would sacrifice your own brother to lend a hand to parido while he carries out his petty vengeance miguel spoke so urgently that for a moment he forgot that circumstance suggested no more likely a culprit than joachim ive wondered about your loyalties and i always chastised myself for suspecting that you might favor this man over your own flesh and blood but now i see youre nothing but a player in his puppet show he pulls your strings and you dance my friendship with senhor parido is no breach of loyalty daniel snapped back yet you value him over your own brother miguel said it need not be a contest why must i choose one over the other because he has made it so that you must you would sacrifice me for this man and you would do so in an instant you know nothing of me then i think i do miguel said answer truly if you were asked to choose between the two of us to make a choice in which you had to definitively side with one or the other would you even for a moment entertain siding with me i refuse to answer your question it is madness then dont answer it miguel said you need not bother that is right i need not bother why even speak of such choices senhor parido has shown his goodness in the kindness hes shown to our family particularly after the harm you did his daughter it was no harm it was but a silly affair and would have been of no lasting consequence if he had not allowed himself to lose all reason i had a dalliance with his maid and his daughter saw why must he make all this thunder over nothing there was harm and permanent harm too daniel replied harshly and if senhor parido feels anger over the damage done to his daughter i for one cannot blame him for you came close to doing the same harm to my unborn child miguel began to reply but checked himself there was something more to this affair than he knew what damage he asked she had a fright it is nothing i should not have said anything daniel looked away if you know something you must tell me ill ask parido himself if need be daniel put a hand to his forehead no dont do that he insisted ill tell you but you must not let him know that you know or that you learned from me despite his fear miguel could have smiled daniel would betray parido if only to save his own flesh from the fire more happened to antonia than the senhor wanted the world to know when she came into the room and saw you in your unspeakable act with her maid she fainted i know that miguel said testily i was there you know she struck her head what you dont know is that she and her husband in salonika have since had an idiot child and the doctors say it is the result of this injury she can have nothing but idiot children miguel ran a hand along his beard and inhaled sharply through his nostrils antonia rendered unable to bear healthy children he could not fathom the connection between her injury and its consequence but he was not a medical man to solve such riddles he knew enough however to figure out the rest paridos own idiot boy was a shame to him and antonia had been his only hope of perpetuating the family particularly since he had wed her to a cousin also named parido the parnass was a wrathful man by nature what anger would he reserve for the man he believed had destroyed the future of his line how long has he known this no more than a year and i beg you to recall that you must not tell him i spoke of it miguel waved a hand at him no one told me he rose from his chair no one told me he repeated this time far more loudly parido had more reason to hate me than i could have known and yet you said nothing and now you doubt that he has sent this vile message to injure me your loyalties are as preposterous as your beliefs i wont listen to any such lies about solomon parido then we have no more to discuss miguel hurried down the narrow staircase almost stumbling as he did so in his rage he had nearly convinced himself that there was no more likely explanation for the pigs head than parido could there be any doubt that in his rage and twisted sense of rectitude he would do all he could to harm miguel damn his brother for thinking otherwise in the damp of the cellar he listened to the familiar scrape of floorboards as daniel dressed and left the house he had not been gone for more than a quarter hour when annetje came down the stairs and handed miguel a letter it was addressed to daniel and contained a circle in the upper corner the note was from the broker asking confirmation of daniels willingness to support miguels trade the letter was standard nothing of consequence but there was a line at the end that intrigued miguel you have always been a respected man on the exchange and your friendship with solomon parido is more surety than any man could wish nevertheless owing to your recent reversals and the rumors of insolvency i hesitated before considering your guarantee solid enough to back your brothers trade nevertheless i shall gamble on miguel lienzos cleverness and your honor so daniel was in debt that explained why he insisted on receiving miguels money right away well it was no matter miguel forged a reply which he gave to the girl to send off she hesitated a moment and only when pressed did she explain that the senhora had requested his company hannah lay propped up her head wrapped in a bluish cloth and her skin pale and wet with perspiration but she appeared to be in no great danger she was stretched out comfortably on that proper bed of hers long enough that she could lie flat on her back unlike the cupboard bed that tortured miguel this one had been built of an elaborate oak frame that rose above her among the wealthy dutch these new beds had become the fashion and miguel vowed he would buy one for himself the moment he left his brothers house the bed had no curtains to part so she lay there for him to see her eyes wide and sorrowful we should talk quickly she said her face grave but without accusation i dont know where your brother has gone so i dont know when he will return i suspect i know where he has gone miguel observed hes gone to see parido that may be she said miguel took a step closer i only want to say that i am sorry for what happened to you and for your distress i never meant for you to be hurt i promised you would not she smiled slightly your brother made more of it than was necessary i was frightened for a moment but i soon recovered i have felt the baby moving all day as she always does i have no fears there she miguel noticed would she dare speculate on a girl child in front of daniel did her speaking of it in front of miguel constitute an intimacy i am very happy to hear there are no lasting consequences im only sorry i couldnt do more i found a note and i dont know what it said but i hid it thinking it might do you harm your brother took it from me i know it was of no importance do you know who left that vile thing there miguel shook his head i wish i did but still i thank you for your efforts im sorry he said taking a sharp breath that i behaved so poorly i wish to discuss this matter with you again perhaps another time when you are rested he had not planned to but he took her hand in his and held it tight feeling its coolness the contours of her smooth skin he expected her to pull away to chastise him for his unforgivable presumption but she looked up at him as though this gesture of devotion were the most natural thing in the world i am sorry toothat i was so weakbut i knew nothing else then we shall have to teach you what you want to know he told her kindly hannah turned her head away for a moment burrowing into her pillow i must ask you something else he said rubbing her hand with his and then ill let you rest you mentioned madam damhuis what more did you wish to tell me hannah remained motionless as if she might pretend not to have heard him finally she turned back to face him with her reddened eyes i hardly even know she was speaking to some men when i saw her and i scarcely looked at all but she thought i had seen something i ought not to have miguel nodded did you know the men did they appear to you of the nation or dutch or something else she shook her head i cant even say that i think they were dutch but one might have been a jew i am not certain you did not know them you had never seen them i think one was her servant man but i cant say she shook her head senhor i was too frightened to see them miguel knew the feeling well ill let you sleep he said he knew he should not do it he told himself not to that he would regret it that it would only bring trouble but he did it anyway before gently setting her hand down upon the bed he raised it to his lips and softly kissed her warm skin and thank you senhora he didnt wait for a reply but hurried out of the room fearing he might cross paths with his brother on the stairwell but no such thing happened hannah closed her eyes not knowing what to think or even how miguel had forgiven her he understood her he had taken her hand and kissed it could she dare to hope for more than that oh what had she done to deserve such mercy she slid a hand down to the comforting bulge of her belly caressing this unborn child this daughter whom she would protect from all the evil that threatened them both when she opened her eyes annetje stood before her her face was immobile jaw thrust outward eyes little more than slits where had she come from hannah had heard no one climb the stairs the girl could do that she went in and out of rooms like a ghost you told him annetje said so quietly hannah could hardly hear her she briefly considered lying but what good would it do yes she said i thought it important he know you foolish bitch she hissed i told you to keep quiet you must not be angry with me hannah said hating the tone of pleading in her voice but there were things far more important than that tiny shriveled thing she called her pride the doctor said that i must not grow warm in temper lest i risk the child the devil take your child annetje said i hope he does along with the rest of you heathen jews she took a step closer hannah pulled the comforter up to protect herself he wont betray us annetje now stood over her looking down with her cold eyes green as the eyes of an evil spirit even if he does not do you think the widow will honor his silence and do you think he is so clever that he can avoid betraying you even without so meaning youre a fool and you ought never to be allowed to have a child in your care i came here with the intention of thrusting a knife up your quim and killing that wretched child of yours hannah gasped and pushed herself backwards oh calm yourself you are as timid as a rabbit i said i came up here with that intention but i have since changed my mind so you neednt move about like that i only hope you are grateful that i am not seeking a more fitting punishment and youd better hope that the senhor is as good at keeping secrets as he is at learning them because if you are betrayed you can be sure ill not help you if need be ill tell your husband all i know and the lot of you may go to the devil annetje hurried out of the room hannah listened to her feet slap clumsily against the stairs and then in the distance the slam of a door hannah took a deep breath she felt her pulse pound in her temples and she concentrated on soothing her anguish but even more than fear she felt confusion why did annetje care so much if miguel knew about the widow what did it matter to her hannah shuddered why had she not seen it before annetje was in the widows service within two days the doctor permitted hannah to rise from her bed but things had grown uncomfortably tense in the house no one spoke more than a few words at a time and miguel remained out of the house as much as he could on shabbat he invited himself to the home of a west indian merchant with whom he maintained a friendly acquaintance not all had turned sour however he had received a message from geertruid saying that she had gone to visit relatives in friesland she would be back in amsterdam any day but in the meantime she had heard that her man in iberia had secured agents in oporto and lisbon and now traveled to madrid where he felt sure of success the news was good but nevertheless troubling in light of hannahs story what secret could geertruid have that she wanted kept from her partner did he dare trust her did he dare do otherwise he had received a few notes from isaiah nunes who was finding it difficult to conjure up language that sufficiently expressed his irritation he wanted his five hundred guilders and the bonds of friendship that restrained him were growing increasingly frayed miguel had no difficulties penning his replies which made vague promises of immediate action meanwhile the price of coffee continued to go up stemming miguel believed from solomon paridos influence he bought calls in anticipation of an increase and he made it known that he bought them on the amsterdam bourse that was enough to alter the price merchants who had hardly ever noticed coffee now began to gamble on its continued rise but miguel still had no idea what parido planned would he entice his trading combination to exercise the calls and buy large quantities making a monopoly even harder to obtain further such a move would destroy the value of miguels puts ruining his chance to erase his debts and putting him further in debt to his brother but paridos strategy would have to be approved by all members of his combination and most were not content to make business plans based on the desire to shame a rival buying calls would cause the price to rise even further and since the market would become artificially inflated the combination would have a hard time selling at a profit parido might not have the strength of his combination behind him but he might happily content himself with the thought that miguel would lose on his investments at the flyboat that afternoon miguel turned and nearly collided with isaiah nunes who smiled in the awkward manner of a guilty child miguel had been drinking coffee almost constantly that day and he felt equal to anything so he approached the merchant and embraced him warmly how are you my friend just the man ive been looking for nunes said without a hint of irritation oh whatever for nunes laughed i wish i had your easy way about you miguel but come with me for a moment i need to show you something he led miguel to the back of the tavern near a window and in the muted light he spread out a piece of paper he removed from his coat it was his contract with miguel i hate to be so particular with you he said but i must bring some of the wording to your attention miguel had felt full of optimism as he strolled along the canal sides his puts bought though illicitly with his brothers money joachim no longer a problem if he wished to unleash hendrick his agents in place if he could trust his partnerbut now confined in the dark tavern the energy of the coffee began to work against him he wanted to move but it was hard to breathe the quick words came not so easily as they once had i know what you have to say my friend and if you will but hear me out and then i will hear you it is only fair yes nunes did not wait for an answer you see what it says here of course he smoothed out the contract and pointed to a few neat and closely written lines it says that you will pay half the delivery cost upon demand of the agentbeing myselfwhen such a price is demanded by the providerbeing the east india company miguel nodded eagerly i understand the terms please let me speak nunes took a breath you see the wording it says here that the money must be paid when the company demands it not on the date of delivery the company may demand payment when it agrees to sell the goods and deliver them by the earliest date convenient you understand that yes of course i understand that miguel said and i have every intention of getting you that remaining five hundred guilders i know you have had to advance the money out of pocket but i assure you it will be forthcoming i am sure it will i only wanted you to understand the terms of the contract because there has been some rather troubling news this contract business had been irritating but he now realized that nunes had been building up to something how troubling i hope not too troubling these things can always be resolved i think he kept his voice steady his back erect like a man awaiting a blow i fear your shipment will be delayed miguel pounded the table delayed why by how long nunes let out a sigh it is an unfortunate business but you know i can only factor out my requests to men on east india company vessels the ship that had been promised changed its plans in accordance with the will of the company its not going to mocha at all and it cannot therefore obtain coffee what can one do with such bad luck miguel put his head in his hands for a moment he thought he might faint delayed he whispered and then released his face and held on to the side of the table he looked up at nunes and forced a broken grin delayed is it i know this seems as though it bodes ill for you but all is not so bad as you think nunes said quickly my man at the company promises to obtain the goods for us it will only take a little bit longer i asked for a delay of the payment but the contract as i showed you only requires them to send the shipment upon the first convenient vessel and it is for the company to determine its own convenience how much time his voice cracked and he had to repeat the question again with a forced smile he dared not display any fear yet a tingling panic radiated out to his extremities his fingers went numb and he flexed his hands as though they had fallen asleep nunes bobbed his head as if to encourage a calculation its hard to say precisely there are so many details to consider when trying to organize a shipment they must find a ship that sails the route in question and then make certain it has room in the hold you had concerns about secrecy that i assume you still wish honored which is something that cannot be accommodated on every ship each detail must be planned with the greatest care of course i understand that he lifted his hat and ran a clumsy hand across his head but you can speculate cant you the hat fell on the floor and miguel stooped to retrieve it speculate nunes repeated trying not to be made anxious by miguels jittery antics under these conditions sometimes it can take a year to set things right but ive already written some letters and called in some favors i hope to have your shipment within two or three months of the original date perhaps a bit longer two or three months he might yet avert disaster with their agents in place surely they could delay that long yes there was no good reason why they could not delay a few months meant nothing in the grand scheme of things not if they had their coffee in the end a year from now they would laugh at those two or three months then there was the matter of his investments the puts that depended on the arrival of that shipment the puts he had bought with his brothers money miguel had bet a thousand guilders on the price of coffee going down and with no coffee to flood the market he had no way of manipulating the price if he lost that money on coffee months before the shipment arrived he could face a new ruin to make his last look like a mere inconvenience once the world knew that miguel had committed daniel without his brothers permission his name would be a byword for deception even if he avoided prosecution he might never do business on the exchange again there is something else nunes sighed the price of coffee as you are aware has gone up since we struck our first deal coffee has risen to sixtyfive hundredths of a guilder per pound which makes it thirtynine guilders per barrel of course you knew that you bought puts and such in any case youll have to pay another five hundred and ten guilders half of which ill need immediately along with the five hundred you now owe or you must reduce your order from ninety to seventyseven barrels to cover the price difference miguel waved his hand in the air very well he said he had nothing to lose now by risking more debt i must have the ninety barrels cost what they may and the money i hate to be so insistent but i am myself somewhat extended if you take my meaning had i but a little room for my own affairs i would not so trouble you but right now seven hundred and fiftyfive guilders signify quite a lot to me ive just now spoken to my partners the words sounded like gibberish to him but he had told such lies so many times he knew he could tell them again and tell them convincingly in his sleep if he had to he slapped his hands together and rubbed vigorously ill have to speak to them again of course they will be disappointed but they love a challenge as much as i do and the money miguel put a hand on nuness shoulder they promise to put the money in my account no later than tomorrow or the next day i promise you will be paid by then very good nunes twisted out of miguels embrace i am sorry about the delay this sort of thing was always a possibility you understand surely you considered a delayed shipment in your plans absolutely please keep me informed of any news i have a great deal to tend to miguel suddenly found the tavern unbearably hot and he hurried outside charging into the streetand without seeing joachim until the man stood only a few feet away if anything the fellow looked worse than when they had last met he wore the same clothes which had grown filthier the sleeve of his outer coat had a rip from the wrist almost up to the shoulder and his collar was streaked with blood im sorry i havent had much time for you of late joachim said but ive been occupied he swayed back and forth a little and his face flushed red miguel did not pause to consider or contemplate or measure black swirls of hatred clouded his vision he could feel nothing but all the rage in his guts spurred on by the coffee turning his humors black and evil in an instant he was no longer himself but a beast beyond all thought he came toward joachim and shoved him hard using both hands and without breaking his stride the pressure against his flesh felt good and right there was a momentary sensation of a fragile body against his handsand then joachim was gone blasted out of existence miguel felt joy elation he felt like a man with a simple push he had banished joachim from his life only joachim did not stay banished for long miguel had intended to continue walking but he saw from the corner of his eye that his enemy landed somewhat harder than he had intended he went down on his side sliding like a fish tossed along a slick dock miguel froze in his tracks joachim was dead only a dead man would lie like that limp and motionless and defeated he struggled to break free from the haze of dreamlike disbelief all his hopes had been dashed in a single act what might he now expect trial and execution scandal and shame he a jew had struck down a dutchman the dutchmans lowness would not matter then joachim moved he stirred briefly and with his back to miguel pushed himself to his feet a crowd had gathered and there was a gasp as the onlookers saw his face which had been scraped hard against the brick of the road he turned slowly to show the injury to miguel the skin on his right cheek looked all but torn away as did the very tip of his nose neither wound bled very much but both bled steadily and the image of blood and dirt sickened miguel joachim looked straight ahead and remained motionless as though on display before a body of judges then after a moment he spat out a mouthful of blood and what looked like the better part of one of his precious remaining teeth the jew attacked that poor beggar and without cause too he heard a woman say ill call the constables men the relief vanished were he to be arrested for attacking a dutchman for no reasonand there were witnesses aplenty to testify that the attack had been unprovokedthe maamad would have no choice but to issue the cherem and no temporary one either all lay in ruins except that joachim saved him joachim had the power to destroy him in his hands and he held back miguel had no illusions he knew that joachim had saved him only that he might continue his torments a destroyed miguel served no purpose no need to send for anyone joachim called out his words slow and syrupy he was surely drunk though it seemed likely that the injury to his mouth also made speaking difficult i am content to settle this matter privately he took a halting step forward and spat another thick mass of blood i think we should make a hasty departure he said to miguel before someone chooses to send for the law despite my best efforts to protect you he put one arm around miguels shoulder as though they were wounded comrades fresh from the field of battle joachim stunk of vomit and shit and piss and beer but miguel ignored it all he dared not show his disgust as he helped the poor fellow limp away from the crowd they walked toward the oude kerk with a slow and deliberate pace miguel couldnt spare the energy to worry about who might see them he only wanted to keep moving once they were in the shadow of the church joachim pulled himself free of miguel and leaned himself against a building settling into the grooves in the stone you neednt have attacked me he said he put his free hand up to his cheek and then examined the blood have you not threatened to kill me many times miguel answered blankly i only greeted you and you knocked me down upon the street i wonder what this maamad of yours would think were i to report this incident miguel looked around as though something might offer him inspiration there were only thieves and whores and laborers ive grown weary of your threats he said weakly maybe so but what does that matter now you tried to fuck my wife you have attacked me perhaps i should go right away to that fellow you mentioned solomon parido i have no heart for this miguel said wearily i never touched your wife tell me what you want so we may end our conversation the sooner i want what ive always wantedmy five hundred guilders you might have given it to me because it was the just thing to do but now that i have something you want i am willing to take the money in exchange and what do you have that i want joachim wiped away some of his blood with the sleeve of his shirt my silence you have brokered for a gentile and youve attempted to commit adultery with a christian woman and even more ive seen you with your friend i know where she gets her money and i wonder if this maamad of yours would be interested to learn joachim could have seen miguel with geertruid but how could he know about geertruid taking money from her husbands children it made no sense but miguel hadnt the heart to find out how joachim knew what he knewhe only wished to end the conversation i wont discuss this with you with so much hanging in the balance joachim said evenly i think youll find a way to get that money youll borrow it steal iti dont care just so long as you get it to me your threats are worth nothing and they wont change what is miguel turned away and began walking very quickly sensing somehow that joachim would not follow his hands shook and he had to concentrate to make sure he walked properly his luck this day could not have been worse but nevertheless he believed with absolutely certainty that joachim would not go to the maamad if he had wanted to ruin miguel he would have allowed the woman to call the watch but once miguel was punished the game would be over and it now appeared that joachim had become attached to playing it he fed off his injuries blossomed with the issuing of new warnings it was all he had left miguel needed geertruid it hardly mattered now what secrets she kept from himlet her have her secrets just as he had his he needed her capital not her honesty if he could get another thousand guilders from her it might be enough to save himself he could pay off nunes and he could buy more puts to counter paridos calls with a little luck he could yet turn the tide on the price of coffee then he would use those profits not to pay off his debts as he had planned but to restore geertruids original investment it was not all he had hoped but with another thousand guilders or fifteen hundred if he dared hope he might make everything easy even though there had been some sort of falling out miguel thought that the foul golden calf might be his best opportunity miguel hurried over and found the fat barman crispijn nearly alone in the tavern sitting on a stool behind the bar slurping at a bowl of beer soup and washing it down with a redundant tankard of beer good morning crispijn miguel shouted cheerfully as though they were old friends how does the day find you who in christ are you crispijn studied miguel for a moment and then lost interest wrapping his large hands once more around the soup bowl we met many weeks earlier miguel explained attempting to keep his cheer intact i was with geertruid damhuis crispijns forehead wrinkled were you now he spat inexplicably into his own soup well ill have no more to do with that devils bitch if i can help it lets be civil miguel took a step forward i dont know what has happened between the two of you but i must contact madam damhuis and i thought you might know how i could do so or know someone who would how should i know how to contact that she wolf i have heard shes gone south and while that is not nearly so good as her going to the devil ill take it as good enough differences asidemiguel pressed onyou are still family crispijn laughed hard enough to make his large body undulate shes no kin of mine nor would i want any such i have better family than that come out my ass each morning miguel put his index finger and thumb to his forehead you are not her kinsman another laugh but not nearly so forceful now the barkeep showed something like compassion you seem to be confused i know nothing of either my father or my mother i havent a relative in the world i can call my own and no cousins neither maybe she would be kinder to a man if she were his relative but ive no luck to call her that more than once she had called crispijn her cousin perhaps the term was some new cant she used freely it hardly mattered and miguel lacked the energy to sort out the confusion he might again try hendrick the dutchman had made it clear he could reach geertruid even if he seemed unwilling to reveal how do you know where i can find her man he asked hendrick youll do better to run from him than seek him the barman said i dont understand you friend youre no ruffian to be seeking out someone of hendricks sort and you dont seem to understand that youre plunging into deep water what want you with such filth ive dealt with hendrick before do you know where i can find him or no crispijn shrugged his heavy shoulders miguel understood perfectly though in his mood he would have preferred a simple request he handed the tavern keeper a half guilder crispijn smiled i hear hes got something planned at the spaniards lame horse a musico on the far end of the warmoesstraat hell be there tonight i heard but not too late and if i know hendrick which i do more than id like hell be in and out quickly youll want to be there no later than when the tower strikes seven i think then maybe youll be able to catch him though maybe it were better that you didnt miguel muttered his thanks and headed out wishing it were not already too late to visit the exchange he despised the feeling of a day of business entirely lost damn the east india company he cursed silently was there not another ship for them to have rerouted than his his coffee would be on its way and therefore he would not have struck joachim with no business to conduct miguel wanted to avoid being seen particularly by joachim he visited a bookseller and purchased on credit a few pamphletsand on a whim a simple book in the most elementary portuguese on the basics of holy law he would give it as a gift to hannah she could not read but perhaps she might learn someday after passing the day in taverns reading his lurid tales of crime he took crispijns advice and traveled to the spaniards lame horse miguel generally avoided musicos of this nature catering to low sorts of fellows a band of three string musicians played simple tunes while the whores drifted from table to table seeking business miguel suspected there were rooms in the back and he briefly considered inspecting them with one buxom beauty with dark hair and fetching black eyes but his business was with hendrick and he considered it no good bargain to miss his opportunity while gaining the clap within an hour the whores knew they would get nowhere with him and they kept their distance ignoring him except to administer the occasional scowl miguel drank quickly and ordered repeatedly he reasoned that he would have to pay for his seat in beer or the owner might toss him out after nearly two hours of steady drinking hendrick had not yet shown himself sleepy with beer miguel wondered if he might not be better off abandoning his station this was no place for a man to fall asleep unless he wanted to awaken stripped of all his goods he lifted his tankard and set it down again a loud conversation a few tables over began to distract him something about cargo ruin a lost ship called the bountiful providence carrying slaves in the africa trade then something happened a drunk fellow rose to his feet and turned toward the sailors the bountiful providence saliva flew from his mouth are you certain aye one of the sailors said shes been taken by pirates all right vicious spanish pirates too bloodthirsty bastards the very worst of the lot my brother was a seaman aboard her and barely escaped with his life do you know the ship friend or have kin upon her i know her he put his face in his hands i owned stock in her good god ill be ruined i have sunk my fortune in a ship now sunk miguel stared even in the murkiness of beer he knew the scene was far too familiar it reminded him not only of his recent misfortune with the coffee but of something else from many months before it was like watching his own life played on stage before him you might not be entirely ruined said one of the sailors companions in a voice full of hope such as one might use with a frightened child you see the news has not yet reached the exchange and that might work in your favor the stockholder turned to the new speaker he alone of the party did not look like a sailor not exactly a man of substance he yet had something more to him than his companions what do you say the stockholder asked that you may take advantage of the ignorance still to be found upon the exchange or at least someone could i would be willing to take those shares from you sir for fifty percent of their value that should be far more lucrative than if you lose it all and sell them at a discount at the exchange tomorrow the stockholder said rolling the words about on his tongue why should i not do that as well as you you are welcome to try friend but then you assume the risk and when the world learns that you have unloaded your stock only hours before news of the loss becomes general you will become mistrusted i on the other hand do not spend much time upon the exchange and can escape from such an adventure entirely unscathed the man said nothing but miguel could see that he stood on the precipice of acquiescing i might also add the prospective buyer told him that not every man might sell spoiled goods with an honest look in his eye you might find yourself ready to sell and with no one to buy because you cannot conduct yourself like a man who has nothing to hide you however do a mighty good job of looking like an honest man a new voice a heroic voice announced though as sure as i am standing here i know you to be a scoundrel and there was hendrick dressed in black like a man of business he stood behind the prospective buyer with his arms crossed and he appeared nothing if not heroic i know you jan van der dijt hendrick announced and you are a liar and a knave he turned to the shareholder nothing has befallen your ship sir these men are tricksters who prey upon the fear of investors they seek to rob you of your shares at half their value and then reap the rewards when the cargo arrives safely the sailors and their companion rose from their seats and hurried out the door the shareholder stiffened and looked as though he prepared himself to sprint after the cheats but hendrick put his arm around the mans shoulders and held him back let the villains run he said soothingly youve undone their scheme and you cant defeat so large a group come he led the man to a table and applied pressure upon his shoulder so he would sit miguel had just witnessed the precise events that had transpired when he had met geertruid and become her friend but their friendship was a sham and everything had been false the men who had offered to buy his shares hadnt been exposed by geertruid they had been in her employ it had been no more than a trick to gain miguels trust making sure the fellows back was toward him miguel quickly paid his reckoningindeed he overpaid that he might get out quickly and with little conversation he then found the door and slipped out unseen out in the cool night he lit his lantern which barely penetrated the thick fog off the ij what did it mean how could he explain it in an instant all became clear geertruid had laid some scheme that involved gaining his trust not for a single night at a single moment but over a period of days or weeks then miguel had lost almost everything when sugar collapsed surely that explained why hendrick appeared so uneasy around himthe man did not understand what geertruid wanted with this jew who had now become penniless and of no value to them so geertruid had created value she had hatched this coffee scheme in order toto do what what plot had she constructed it could not be that geertruid planned to take anything from miguel she had provided money money that by her own admission did not truly belong to her perhaps it did not belong to her late husbands children either that story miguel realized had the hollow ring of a lie how could he have not seen it sooner he who made his livelihood by distinguishing truth from falseness though it was but a scurvy livelihood now and coffee which was to save him from his ruin was now revealed to be but another disaster but why why would geertruid advance money why would anyone advance money to dupe a ruined man into ruining himself further there could be only one answer there could be only one person willing to expend capital on miguels destruction geertruid he concluded with perfect clarity served solomon parido the idea that one might see things more clearly upon a new day or that matters of importance could be worked out during sleep seemed to miguel foolishness his restless sleep offered him no answers the next day nor the day thereafter the sabbath on the following morning however he did wake up with one important detail on his mind standing outside the singing carp joachim had spoken suggestively about geertruid he could remember the precise smell in the airbeer and piss and canal stinkas the wretch suggested he knew something at the time miguel had assumed joachim had somehow learned about geertruids money but now miguel thought that unlikely the business with the husbands children was almost certainly a lie a plausible deception meant to sound like a dishonest but forgivable means of generating capital surely it was more likely that solomon parido had provided the money but if geertruid did paridos work why did the parnass not know the details of miguels plans would parido let miguel and geertruid obtain their monopoly on coffee and then strike ruining miguel for his partnership with geertruid and splitting the proceeds no miguel said aloud he sat upon his cupboard bed throwing the heavy feather duvet aside in the morning heat none of it made sense but someonegeertruid hendrick paridosomeone would make a mistake that would reveal the truth and he would be ready when they did two days later annetje announced that miguel had a visitor her voice quivered slightly and she could not bring herself to meet miguels eye when he followed her out to the front room he saw joachim standing just inside the doorway a new widebrimmed cap in his hand looking about the house with a kind of childlike curiosity so this is where a jew lives youve lost your mind miguel said calmly joachim wore new clotheswhere had they come fromand while they were not the finery he had once been used to he presented himself neatly and with dignity much like a tradesman in his white shirt new doublet and closefitting woolen jersey the wound on his face belied any hint of gentility but it also made him less recognizably a mendicant and he certainly no longer carried with him the stink of decay i must speak with you he said in an even voice miguel hardly recognized had a bath and new clothes driven out his madness im already in your house to cast me out now would do you no good particularly if i made a great deal of noise about it surely you would be better off if i left quietly when my business is done could not the rascal have had the courtesy to knock upon the kitchen door miguel was not about to stand in the front of the house with this fellow so he stepped aside and led the villain down to his cellar joachim examined his surroundings as he descended the stairs and stood uneasily in the damp room perhaps surprised that miguel did not live in luxury he sat on a stool with uneven legs and let a moment pass while he stared into the flame of the oil lamp upon the table finally he took a deep breath and began i have been under the influence of a lunacy that has now passed i have made demands and issued threats some of which may have been unreasonable and for that i apologize i still think i should be paid the five hundred guilders i lost but it need not be immediately or all at once that is to say i would like to set upon a schedule of repayment such as one might have if he took a loan then ill no longer bother you i see miguel spoke slowly trying to give himself time to think someone had provided joachim with money that much was evident that someone could only be parido im glad you see so on to business i will accept a gradual repayment of what you owe though in order for me to feel comfortable ill have to know how you plan to make your money so you see thats the bargain you tell me about this business project in which you plan to make money over the next few months and understanding your strategy i may feel confident that you will repay my five hundred guilders over shall we say the next two years it could not have been more simple or more obvious parido had engaged joachim to find out what miguel had planned whatever parido had done he appeared to have quite tamed the man had money been enough to effect this change miguel thought there must be more joachim held himself with the uneasy bearing of a man awaiting trial miguel felt a sudden unexpected exhilaration things had gone badly in the past few weeksvery badlybut now he knew how to take command he knew what others were planning and knowing their plans he could manipulate them to his advantage how do i know that you wont prey on whatever information i provide he asked stalling for time while he considered his options you have not been so long away from the exchange that you have forgotten the value of secrecy i dont want anything to do with the exchange those days are past for me i only want to provide for my wife and retire into a quiet existence in the countryside he winced for a moment if you pay me ill buy a plot of land and work it or perhaps ill open a tavern in some village very well miguel said carefully i promise to pay you but you must tell me what i ask joachim said he ran his fingers through his long hair recently washed smooth miguel tasted blood must i what will you do if i dont tell you i only want assurance that i shall not be ill used then you have my assurance miguel smiled that wont be enough joachim shifted uneasily we have had our differences yes but you see now that i come to you somewhat humbled i am ready to admit my wrongs i only want a little thing from you and yet you withhold it what could he give parido that would satisfy him and also buy miguel some time the answer came to him in a sudden burst of inspiration fear he would give the man cause to tremble to doubt his allies to look upon the unknown and the future as his enemies miguel nodded slowly in an effort to look thoughtful unfortunately i can give you no details of my business because there are other men involved and i havent the right to say on my own something that may affect the wellbeing of the combination you have joined with a trading combination he asked eagerly diving for the scraps a combination of sorts we have joined together that we may better engage in a rather momentous piece of business each of us has a particular skill or contribution making the whole stronger than the sum of its parts miguel felt a twinge of sadness that had been the case with his partnership with geertruidat least until he learned that geertruid had betrayed him what will this combination be doing i cant tell you thatnot without breaking a vow i made to the others please understand that no matter how much you may make your case i cant give you those details i must have some information joachim was nearly pleading surely you can see that for the first time miguel began to wonder if joachim was paridos servant or his slave he appeared to be genuinely afraid of leaving without information for his master with what could parido have threatened joachim without betraying confidences i can tell you theres a great deal of money to be made you no longer follow the affairs of the exchange so i will confide in you if you promise not to repeat it to another soul do you solemnly promise joachim inexplicably joachim hesitated and swallowed in discomfort i promise he said do you swear by your own jesus christ miguel asked twisting the knife i dont make such oaths lightly joachim said despite all that has happened i hope i shall do nothing blasphemous i ask nothing blasphemous miguel explained with a broad smile only to swear a holy oath to do what you have already promised to do i suppose you could break your word any man who would threaten to take anothers life surely among the most serious of sins could break a vow made to his god but if you make the vow it will offer me some small comfort very well joachim said examining the light that filtered in through one of the small windows i swear by jesus christ not to repeat what you tell me miguel smiled what more could i ask for know then that with this scheme we plan to make a great deal of money an amount so large that the five hundred you ask for will seem as nothing men will talk about it ten years hence it will be the very model to which young upstarts on the exchange aspire joachims eyes widened he straightened himself in his stool can you say no more can you not tell me if you deal in a particular commodity or route or stock scheme i cant answer that question without violating my own vows miguel lied there are other jews of importance involved in this business and in order to protect ourselves we have all taken vows of silence other jews of importance joachim asked he had been in paridos service long enough apparently to know when he had hit upon something of note yes miguel told him his little deception was so sinister he could hardly contain his pleasure i have thrown my lot in with several members of the community of the highest standing thats why i never feared your bringing our history to the maamad i only wished to avoid being embarrassed before my partners i have an enemy on that board but i also have very powerful friends he paused to lean forward and assume the hunched pose of a teller of secrets you see one of the members of the council is part of my combination and another has invested heavily in our enterprise joachim nodded and appeared to visibly relax it would seem that he now had enough information to return to his master and not fear his dissatisfaction he had the glimmering jewel he had sought does that satisfy your curiosity joachim for now joachim said though i believe i may have more questions later when you think of them you mean yes i might think of more you always were a curious fellow i suppose theres nothing to be done about that miguel ushered him up the stairs and saw him out the kitchen door when he closed it he barked out a laugh miguel need no longer fear the maamad surely parido would never agree now to have miguel questioned he had too much to lose one week later miguel received a note from geertruid she had returned from her trip all was well and she wished to meet later that day at the singing carp when he arrived miguel thought she looked uncommonly beautiful in a gown of bright red with a blue bodice and a matching bluetrimmed red cap her lips were deep red as though she had been biting them its good to be back she said kissing him on his cheek my ailing aunt in friesland has made a complete recoveryso complete i wonder if she was ever truly sick at all and nowshe took miguels handtell me what news my handsome partner miguel wished he could have doubted his own eyes but he had seen what he had seen geertruid had tricked miguel into their friendship and miguel still did not know why im happy your aunt is well miguel had spent some time thinking about this problem and he had come to a comforting conclusion if geertruid worked for parido she would provide any reasonable amount he asked for otherwise whatever scheme the parnass hatched would fail miguel would get the money he needed to cover his own investments and then he would show parido how foolish it was to attempt to outwit a man who was well read in the stories of charming pieter but after days of thought he was still unsure how to make his request well then geertruid said she took a long drink of beer any news of our shipment any news upon the exchange i am feverish with the desire to press forward there has been some news miguel began though not as good as i would like you must understand that these arrangements almost never happen as smoothly as planned and as a merchant runs along he must always do his best to avoid hidden dangers geertruid licked her lips hidden dangers you see the price of a commodity is subject to any of a variety of changes over a period of time no one can truly predict its movementsthat is unless one has a monopoly as we plan to dothough we do not have one yet the price of coffee has risen she asked flatly it has and somewhat more than i could have predicted then there is the matter of the shipping costs which have turned out to be significantly more than i had been led to believe and secrecythat costs money too a palm greased here and a palm greased therea man looks down and his purse is empty i begin to suspect where this conversation is taking me i thought you might you see i think we must have more money to make this thing certain for just a little bit more we can remove any element of doubt a little bit more fifteen hundred guilders he told her breezily though when he saw the look on her face he realized he might have been too ambitious although a thousand might do our business you must think me a far greater woman than i am she said i told you how difficult it was to raise the three thousand now you casually ask me for half again as much is this money to gratify my own needs madam no it is to assure our wealth you asked me to work with you because you trusted that i knew how to order matters of business i do know how and i tell you we need this money if we want to depend on victory miguel had expected her to be sulky and chastising but also amused instead she glared at him in anger when we began i asked you how much you required and you told me three thousand guilders i committed that money to you if you had told me fortyfive hundred i would have said the thing could not be done will not the three thousand i gave you carry this is the money lost not lost he told her hurriedly i promise you that the worst danger we face is that we make not so much as we wished and that you return your investment whence you got it i only thought that if more money was to be had it would serve us well more money is not to be had geertruid said and i need you to speak truthfully to me i know the truth comes hard to a man who has been a secret jew that is unkind miguel protested youve told me so yourself you told me that out of necessity you were schooled in the arts of deception i want no deception now however i want the truth just because a man knows how to deceive doesnt mean that he has forgotten how to be truthful i would not lie to you just as i know you would not lie to me he probably should not have said it but he felt sure that his face betrayed nothing of the irony your money is safe and though more money would have made my task far easier i believe i can still order everything better to do it then she said you cannot eat the same rabbit twice miguel youve got all there is to get from me then i will have to make do he said with an easy grin geertruid said nothing for a moment she took a deep drink of her beer and stared past miguel i believe you she said i know you are my friend and i know you would not hurt me but if there is something i must know you had better tell me because if you do hurt meif it even appears to unschooled eyes that you have hurt meyou must understand that hendrick will kill you and i wont be able to stop him miguel affected a laugh hell have no cause to resent me when all is done and neither will you now if things are to be this way i had better go and make certain all is in order when will the shipment be in port she asked his speculations on coffee came due in three weeks time he had planned originally that the coffee be in port some two weeks later it would not happen but no one need know that not for what he had in mind a month he said maybe less the meeting left a sour taste in his mouth but that could not be helped as he crossed the warmoesstraat miguel saw a pair of men who pretended that they did not keep their eyes upon himsurely maamad spies it was no matter there was no crime in being on the street still he felt compelled to lose them and ducked into a side alley that led to a back street he took another alley and then another side street which took him back again to the main road he turned around and the spies were still behind him perhaps they had never turned in the alleys knowing miguel would come back to where he started he picked up a flat stone and tossed it into the canal to make it skip but it sank the instant it hit the murky water miguel lifted up the sack of coffee berries it was light light enough to toss from hand to hand he would have to start being careful how he used it or he would soon have none left perhaps the people at the turkish coffee tavern would allow him to buy for his own use having taken an inventory of the problems before him miguel now saw what he faced his coffee scheme was on the brink of foundering owing to late shipments and insufficient funds his partner geertruid was not what she seemed perhaps in league with parido perhaps not joachim was certainly in league with parido but that made miguels life easier not harder since paridos money seemed to have returned the fellows sanity miguel could not pay his debt to isaiah nunes because he had used the funds to pay off his brother and to pay his muscovy agent the money hed earned from his brilliant whaleoil trade was unavailable because the broker ricardo would not pay miguel or reveal the name of his client miguel could do nothing about ricardos treachery since using the dutch courts would bring upon him the anger of the maamad and going before maamad was too risky because of parido rather it had been too risky miguel swallowed the last of the coffee in his bowl there was at least one thing he could resolve he realized and he could do so at once after searching a half dozen taverns miguel called on ricardo at his home the broker was notorious for hiring the cheapest servants he could find and the creature who opened the door must have been a rare bargain well into her last years in life she was hunched and trembling her eyes were mere slits and she had trouble propelling herself forward what is it she asked miguel in dutch you here for the jews supper miguel smiled brightly certainly come in then the rest are already eating the jew doesnt like for the people he invites to be late has it occurred to you miguel asked as he followed her along at her shuffling pace that as you speak of the jew you are speaking to yet another jew take that up with him she said its none of my business the woman led him down a long brightly tiled hallway and into a spacious room furnished with hardly more than a large table the walls however were thick with paintings portraits landscapes biblical scenes miguel recognized one portrait a painting of samson as being in the style of that curious fellow who had lived in the vlooyenburg and was in the habit of paying poor jews to model for him the models however were the only poor jews who graced the inside of this house surrounding the table which seemed to miguel to have relatively little food on it were some of the wealthiest men of the portuguese nation including solomon parido from the volume of the conversation miguel guessed that ricardo had been more liberal with his wine than with his food the broker who had been laughing at something now looked up and saw miguel standing with the old servant its another jew for you she announced lienzo ricardo spat surely i didnt invite you here you told me to come join you and your friends for a merry feast so here i am parido raised his glass let us toast lienzo then amsterdam s most uncanny trader ricardo pushed himself to his feet walk into my private chambers for a moment he lurched forward stumbling briefly and then after taking a breath seemed to have regained his balance miguel bowed at the guests and followed ricardo let him up a narrow half flight of stairs to a smallish room furnished with a writing table a few chairs and piles of papers that rested on the floor the windows had been pulled shut and the room was nearly entirely dark the broker opened one of the shutters so there was just enough light for them to see each other but hardly more than that im beginning to suspect miguel said that you drink more wine than is healthy for one of our nation the dutch are bottomless vessels but you seem to have reached your limit and i think ricardo said that you may be more of a rascal than i had first suspected what do you mean coming here while i am entertaining my friends a category i might point out that certainly does not include you i had no idea you had friends here i was merely looking for you in some obvious places had you not hired your serving girl out of the graveyard she might screen your visitors a little more thoroughly ricardo lowered himself into a chair well what is it you want speak quickly but if it is about that cursed money again i will have to tell you what ive told you before youll get what you have coming in due time and not before miguel chose not to sit but instead paced back and forth in the room like an advocate making a speech before the burgomasters i have thought about what youve said and found it wanting you see i am owed money and if i cannot have it i am entitled at the very least to know who is my debtor ricardos mustaches twitched with superior amusement you may think so but we both know there is nothing you can do about it so you say you believe i wont risk the anger of the maamad by going to the dutch courts and i wont go to the maamad because one of its members might lead the council against me that at any rate is what you think i suppose you also know about my recent encounter with the council and my daylong banishment but because those proceedings are held secret you dont know what was revealed so let me tell you this my enemy on that council betrayed himself and revealed his antipathy for me to the other parnassim that man would be unable to lead the council against me ricardo made a hissing noise like a snake very well if you want to take that chance you may bring your complaint forward we will see what happens miguel nodded i thank you for your courtesy i am sure the council will find this case very interesting as it will find it interesting when it learns that you have hidden behind that mans protection in order to avoid giving me my due that will be very embarrassing for him and im sure he will resent your having put him in so awkward a position but miguel said then again he may not resent it at all as you say well see what happens ricardo pulled himself to his feet are you threatening me senhor miguel belched out a laugh of course i am i am threatening you with the very thing you have challenged me to do not much of a threat really but it does seem to have you agitated ricardo nodded rapidly as though discussing something with himself you dont want to bring this before the maamad he said no i dont but if you give me no choice i will do it and watching you and parido squirm will prove more than ample compensation for my trouble i have nothing to lose in this ricardo but you do you can pay me you can give me the name of your client or you can allow the maamad to compel you to do both while embarrassing you and making solomon parido your enemy it is your choice but i intend to request a hearing first thing in the morning you might want to make your decision soon miguel turned to leave not that he thought ricardo would let him but his statement required a pretended exit wait ricardo said he slowly lowered himself back into his chair wait wait wait wait im waiting ive been doing a great deal of it i understand he held up a hand in a stayyourtongue gesture here is what i will offer you i will tell you the name of my client and you may pursue your debt yourself but you must not tell him i was the one who betrayed him and you must not say anything to parido he doesnt know ive used his name in this and i would have him continue to not know miguel swallowed hard at last this money would be his and he had wonsomething that happened far too infrequently of late i agree he said ricardo sighed very well understand that my client instructed me very clearly to keep this information a secret it was not my choice or my doing just give me the name i said i would the name he said is daniel lienzo he let out a squealing little laugh it is rather funny when you think about it he put the squeeze on you for the thousand you had borrowed of him but all the while he owed you more than twice that he has been lording it over you because you are in his debt but these past weeks he has been your debtor do you find that as amusing as i do miguel picked up a stack of papers and threw them at ricardo scattering his notes and ledgers and correspondence all over the room by doing so he hoped to indicate that he did not in fact find it as amusing as ricardo did miguel had known that daniels finances were in trouble but he had not known to what extent all his sneering all his grumblings about miguels dealing in mischief when he was making mischief of his ownmiguel could forgive that he could forgive the superiority and the judgmental glares he could not forgive daniel for taking moneyfor stealing moneywhen he knew his brother needed it but even with his resentment miguel did not dare to speak of it he did not dare to complain because until he resolved this coffee matter one way or another he could not risk moving from his brothers house a move that would attract far too much notice some days later annetje came again to miguels study with an announcement that would have been far more shocking if it had been unprecedented joachim waagenaar was at the door and wished to meet with him joachim climbed down the narrow stairs using one hand to steady himself the other to clutch his hat he stumbled when he reached the floor teetering like a drunkard well now senhor i see things have come full circle as the saying goes a bird always returns to the place of its nest joachim was not so drunk as he had first seemed an idea came into his head joachim had drunk just enough to give himself courage but courage for what once more miguel looked for anything that could be used to protect himself is this your nest miguel asked i hardly think so i disagree joachim sat without being asked i feel like this very room is where i was bornthe me i have become and what i have becomeeven i hardly know that now is that what you came to say no only that ive been thinking and in a strange way ive decided you may be the greatest friend i have right now strange isnt it once we werewell not friends really but friendly like then we were enemies ill take most of the blame for that though my anger was justified im sure you know that and now we are friends at last true friends i mean the kind who must look after each other how do you come to such an unusual conclusion very simple senhor i have information you want i have information from which you can make a great deal of money in fact i have information that will save you from ruin i cannot help but fear you may be too much of a fool to take it but just the same i have it and i am willing to share it and for this information you want the five hundred guilders of which ive heard so much the dutchman laughed i want instead a piece of your profit you see the joke i hope i want my success my fortune once again to be bound with yours i see miguel took a deep breath he hardly even recognized his own life anymore here he sat in his cellar negotiating with joachim waagenaar were he to be caught doing so in all likelihood solomon parido would argue to the maamad that the crime should be forgiven the world had become an unknown wilderness joachim shook his head you dont see lienzo but you will here is what i propose i agree to give you information from which you will make wondrous profits if im right you give me ten percent of what you make because of that informationa brokers fee shall we call it if i am wrong you owe me nothing and youll never hear from me again arent you overlooking an important detail what detail is that miguel swallowed that you are a madman and nothing you say can be trusted joachim nodded as though miguel had made a sage point of law ill ask you to trust me now im never been a madman only a ruined man can you say what would become of you senhor if you lost everythingif you had no money no home no food can you say that you would not fall victim to the lunacy of desperation miguel said nothing ive never wanted revenge joachim continued only whats mine and ill not sit by and watch one man destroy another for the pleasure of it ive no love for you i suppose you know that but ive learned what ruin is ill not bring it on another joachim now had miguels full attention im listening youll have to do more than listen youll have to agree suppose i listen to what you have to say and dont believe you thats well and good but if you decide that you do believe me and you act on that information youll have to give me ten percent of what you make or theres no or joachim said there can be no more threats between us ill not make you sign a contract i know you risk ruin if you put something on paper with one of us i will leave it to your own sense of what a gentleman should do miguel took a gulp of his wine joachim no longer spoke like a madman would paridos coin be enough to drive the evil vapors from his brain or could only joachims own clarity and determination do that ill listen joachim breathed in deeply you have any of that wine for me or maybe some beer im not your host joachim speak or get out theres no need to be so unfriendly senhor youll be serving me drinks aplenty when you listen to what i have to say he paused again all right then you see last time i came to you i was not entirely honest about what i wanted as it happens i fell in with this man who sent me here to do his bidding solomon parido miguel said you might as easily have brought him with you for all that i was fooled i suspected you knew but i didnt say a word to him i was already thinking about what might come of our sad partnership and i figured you told me what you did because you wanted him to believe it i had already begun to hate him more than i hate you so i held my tongue lets take this path more slowly how did you find yourself in paridos employ hes a tricky one he came to me said he knew id been following you through the town and said he knew why he said maybe we could do some business together he was very kind to me he even gave me ten guilders and told me he would come see me in a weeks time a week goes by and he wants me to start coming to talk to you i tell him i wont do such a thing that things have taken a turn for the worse between us i admit i only wanted to hear what he might offer me but he offers me nothing he tells me that if i feel that way he would just as soon i repaid that loan and its interest and that would be all between us i told him i couldnt repay the loan and he began to threaten me with the rasphuis he knows men on the city council he says who will lock me away without cause or regret and perhaps raise some questions about how i had been released so quick after my previous detention i had no desire to return to that dungeon i can tell you go on so i do what he tells me for a while but all the time im thinking about what i might do for myself which as it turns out has a lot to do with what i might do for you i liked the little trick you tried to play by the way but he didnt believe it when i told him what you had said to me he said that of all the conversos he knew you were the one best made to be a liar miguel said nothing joachim rubbed his sleeve against his nose in any case i managed to fit a few things together you know someone named nunes a trader in goods from the east indies miguel nodded for the first time really believing that joachim might have some information of importance this nunes works for parido theres something to do with a shipment of coffee a drink i had once by the way and very much despised for its pisslike taste nunes working for parido how could that be why would his friend betray him what about the shipment miguel spoke so quietly he could hardly hear himself nunes lied to youtold you a shipment is late never obtained or such nonsense that he concoctedbut its all false they changed the ship so its on something called the sea lilywhich near as i can tell is to come in next week i dont know much more than that except that parido doesnt want you to learn this and he wants to do something with the prices miguel began to pace about the room only vaguely aware that joachim stared at him parido and nunes together he would not have thought nunes such a traitor but it explained a great deal if nunes was paridos creature he would have reported miguels sale parido would then have begun conspiring to find ways to ruin miguel while simultaneously making money himself but parido knew only about the coffee itself and how miguel had gambled on its price falling perhaps he did not know about the plan to establish a monopoly the shape of the scheme eluded him but miguel knew he had to assume one thing if geertruid did work for parido also she had not told parido all she knew you mentioned geertruid damhuis to me before does she work for parido miguel asked hoping he might resolve the question forever youd be wise to keep clear of that one what do you know of her only that shes a thief and a trickster she and her companion both that much i already know what does parido have to do with her he narrowed his eyes nothing that i am aware two such jackals could never run in the same pack ive only heard him say he knows you have some business with her miguel returned to his seat if geertruid did not work for parido what was her plan and why had it been necessary for her to deceive him into a friendship perhaps joachim did not know all of paridos secrets he might have hired her and then realized she had been deceiving him as well as miguel he could make no sense of it but it seemed likely that parido had only a murky idea at best of his plans with geertruid what about my brother miguel asked at last blurting out the words before he had fully realized his intentions your brother yes what do you know of his relationship with parido have you heard him speak the name of daniel lienzo joachim shook his head what a sad affair when a man cannot even trust his own brother i suppose it has ever been thus among your people only look at cain and abel cain and abel were not jews miguel said testily they were merely the sons of adam and as such your ancestors as much as mine ill be careful not to quote you scripture again but as for your brother i can tell you nothing i know he spends a great deal of time with parido but you know that yourself you want to know if he acts against your interests but i cant tell you and the pigs head paridos doing or yours joachims lips parted just a little both he said miguel paused for a moment to feel justified daniel had thought miguel the villain for bringing down such horrors on his house but the parnass was the villain all along how is it that parido was so foolish as to speak of all of this in front of you he may well have sent you to me with this information he may have joachim said id wonder the same thing if i were you but i dont see what he would have to gain by giving you this information once the sea lily docks it will be easy enough to pay a sailor to crack open a barrel and tell you what is inside you havent answered my first question why would he reveal all this to you he wouldnt joachim said at least he wouldnt intend to after all who would suspect a halfmad dutchman of understanding the language of portuguese jews miguel laughed in spite of himself in a city like amsterdam he said repeating what joachim once told him one must never assume that a man does not understand the language you speak its still good advice joachim agreed ill have to think very carefully about what you have told me it could all be a lie he told himself another of paridos tricks but what trick what trick would be worth revealing to miguel this web of deception he could bring nunes before the courts now if he chose no one would blame miguel for not trusting this matter to the maamad would parido have knowingly given joachim such powerful information miguel looked at joachim who now appeared for all the world his old selftwitchy and uneasy but no madman it must be true he told himself a sane man could fake madness but a madman could never trick the world into thinking him sensible money had brought joachim back to his senses you think then joachim said but i ask you to give me your word if you choose to act on what ive told you and these acts turn to profit will you give me ten percent of what you make if i find you have told me the truth and acted with honor ill do so gladly then i am content he stood he looked at miguel for a moment miguel opened his purse and handed him a few guilders dont spend it all at the taverns he said what i do with it is my concern joachim said defiantly he stopped halfway up the stairs and you may take it out of the ten percent if you like having concluded his business joachim bade miguel a good afternoon but miguel followed him up the stairs for no reason other than that he did not like the idea of joachim wandering around the house unescorted at the top of the stairs miguel heard the swish of skirts before he saw hannah as she hurried away the panic that burst in his chest dissipated almost immediately hannah spoke not a word of dutch she might listen all she liked but it would hardly tell her anything after miguel had seen joachim out however hannah awaited his return in the hallway that man she said softly he was the one who attacked us on the street he didnt attack you miguel said wearily half staring at the swell of her belly but yes its the same man what business can you have with such a devil she asked sadly he told her a devilish business i dont understand she spoke softly but she held herself with a new confidence do you think because you know my secret you may intrude upon my good sense miguel took a step forward just enough to suggest an intimacy oh no senhora i would never behave thus to you i know it appears unusual but the worldhe let out a sighthe world is a more complicated place than you realize dont talk to me so she said her voice growing a bit louder im not a child who must be told tales i know what the world is how this woman had changed his coffee had turned her dutch i dont mean to belittle you the world is more complicated than even i realized until recent events my enemies have become my allies my allies untrustworthy this strange and bitter man has oddly put himself in a position where he can aid me and he chooses to do so i must let him you must promise me never to let him in my home again i promise you senhora i did not ask him to come nor plan that things should end as they have and ill do everything in my power to protect you he said with a force that he had not intended even at the cost of my own life the boast of a hidalgo came easily to him but he saw at once that he had said too much for it was the boast a man makes to his lover not to his brothers wife miguel could not take it back in an instant he had committed himself to becoming her lover so that was what he would be senhora i have a gift for you a gift his sudden change in tone broke the spell yes ill return with it in a moment miguel hurried down to the cellar and found the book he had bought for her the portuguese listing of the commandments it would do her little good without instruction but he hoped she might like it all the same he hurried into the parlor where she stood looking fretful as though miguel might present her with a great diamond necklace she could neither refuse nor wear the gift he did hold out was almost as precious and almost as dangerous a book she took the octavo in her hand running her fingers along the rough leather binding it occurred to miguel that she might not even know to cut the pages do you mock me senhor you know i cant read miguel smiled maybe i shall tutor you i have no doubt you will make a fine student he saw it then in her eyes she was his for the asking he could lead her down to the cellar and there in the cramped cupboard bed he could take his brothers wife no it was a defilement to think of her as daniels wife she was her own woman and he would think of her as such what held him back propriety did not daniel deserve to be betrayed after the way he had taken miguels money he was ready to reach out for her to take her hand and lead her to the cellar but something happened first what is this annetjes voice fell hard startling them she stood at the doorway to the drawing room arms folded a wicked smile on her lips she glanced at miguel and then looked at hannah and rolled her eyes i think the senhora is bothering you annetje walked forward and placed a hand on hannahs shoulder and what have you here she took the book from hannahs hands you know you are too foolish for books dear senhora no doubt shes being tiresome senhor lienzo ill make certain it does not happen again return that to your mistress he said you forget yourself girl annetje shrugged and handed the volume back to hannah who slipped it in the pocket of her apron senhor i am sure you do not mean to raise your voice to me after allshe smiled slylyyou are not the master here and your brother may not like the tales he hears if someone should speak them you might think upon these things while i remove the senhora to where she will trouble you no more she tugged roughly on hannahs arm let me go hannah said in portuguese her voice loud almost a shout she pulled herself loose of the maids grip and then spun around to face her dont touch me please senhora let me just take you to your room before you shame yourself who are you to speak of shame she answered miguel could not begin to understand this display why did the maid think she could speak to hannah with such cruelty he hardly ever thought of her as speaking at all just some pretty thing fit only for the occasional romp now he saw there were intriguesplots and schemes he could not have imagined he opened his mouth prepared to speak once more but daniel appeared at the door what goes on here daniel looked at the two women too close for any casual business hannahs face had turned red by now and annetjes had hardened into a mask of rage they flashed cold stares at each other but upon hearing his voice they turned and shrank into themselves like guilty children caught at dangerous play what goes on here i say daniel repeated now to miguel is she touching my wife miguel tried to think of what lies might serve best hannah but nothing came to mind if he accused the maid she might betray her mistress but if he said nothing how could hannah explain this abuse servants dont behave so he said haplessly i know these dutch have no sense of propriety daniel shouted but i have seen too much i have indulged my wife with this impudent strumpet long enough and ill not listen to her pleas any longer the girl must go miguel strained to find some words to cool everyones tempers but annetje spoke first she took a step toward daniel and sneered at him full in the face you think i dont understand your portuguese palaver she asked him in dutch ill touch your wife when i please your wife she laughed you dont even know your wife who takes gifts of love from your brother and then hides them in her apron and her lust is not the least of her crimes your wife mighty senhor is a catholic as catholic as the pope and she goes as regularly as she can to church she gives confession and she drinks the blood of christ and eats his body she does things that would horrify your devilish jew soul and i wont stay in this house a moment longer theres more work to be had and with christian folk too so i take my leave of you annetje spun and swished her skirts as she had seen actresses do upon the stage she held her chin high as she walked pausing a moment at the threshold ill send a boy for my wages she said and paused waiting to see daniels response they stood there still and silent hannah clenched her body hardly daring to breathe until her lungs became hot and desperate and she sucked in air like a woman who had been under water miguel bit his lip daniel remained as still as a figure in a painting here was trepidation hot itching trepidation of the kind miguel had known only a few times in his life once in lisbon when he had been warned that the inquisition sought him for questioning then again in amsterdam when he knew his investments in sugar had ruined him he thought of all the steps that had led to this moment the sly glances the secret conversations the drinks of coffee he had held her hand he had spoken to her as a lover he had given her a present if only he could have known what there was between the girl and hannah but he could not erase the past there could be no duplicity now a man can live his life through trickery but there are moments there must always be moments when the trickery is exposed annetje basked in the silence each awkward second excited her as she dared daniel to speak but he only stared at her in utter astonishment you have nothing to say cuckold she spat at him you are a fool and i leave you to your own wickedness with that she forced her way past daniel and out of the room daniel stared at his wife cocking his head slightly he glanced at miguel who would not meet his gaze he removed his hat and scratched his head thoughtfully can anyone understand a word that slut speaks he asked carefully replacing the hat her dutch is the most garbled thing i know and it is as well for her for the look on her face was of such impudence im sure i should have struck her if id comprehended her rudeness miguel cast a look at hannah who stared at the floor trying he suspected not to weep with the force of relief she said she is leaving your service he ventured cautiously still not certain hannah had escaped she tires of working for jews she might prefer a dutch mistressa widow good riddance to her i hope daniel said to hannah she has not upset you too greatly there are other girls in the world and better ones too id venture youll not miss her ill not miss her perhaps she suggested you will let me select the servant next time later that day miguel received a message from geertruid expressing concern that they had not spoken in some time and requesting a meeting as soon as possible to find some reason for delay miguel wrote to his partner that he could not possibly think of meeting until after the sabbath his words were so jumbled as to hardly make sense even to their author and miguel moved to tear up his note then he thought better of it deciding he might gain something by being incoherent without rereading what he had written he sent the note from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda there are of course a hundred such homes in the jordaanhastily built things of three or four stories cramped rooms narrow windows too little light and too much smoke this one is owned as they all seem to be owned by a pinchfaced widow who sees nothing and judges all this particular pinchfaced widow had recently rented rooms to a young girl there were two roomsone more than the girl had ever paid for on her own but then she was now being paid better than she had ever been in the past she had new clothes and some treats tooapples and pears and dried dates she had been enjoying these dainties along with the scent of her civet perfume and her new linens and ribbons when the pinchfaced widow informed her that there was a mana merchant it seemedthere to see her the widow did not like that the girl said to send him up for she did not enjoy being a woman who allowed young women to receive men in their rooms but she could hardly prevent that sort of thing and since some folks will be christian and some will not there was not much to be done for it she sent the man up a knock on the door and the girl answered wearing a new blue gown cut just so most enticing i promise you showing off her shape to full advantage what man could resist this beauty in that dress she smiled at her visitor hello senhor she said have you missed me i doubt he smiled back and he had most likely not missed her i want a moment of your time annetje he stepped in and closed the door behind him but he kept his distance from her here was a man who knew the dangers of a blue dress what she asked no kiss for your old friend i have something to inquire of you of course you may ask me anything you wish i wish to know if while you were in my brothers employ you were paid by anyone to observe the doings of our household the girl let out a loud titter you want to know if i was a spy if you like yes why should i tell you she asked saucily as she swished her skirts around the room like a little girl at play perhaps she enjoyed teasing her visitor perhaps she wished him to see what she thought of as her finery her furniture her ribbons scattered about the room as though she had a hundred such things her ample fruit she could eat an apple or a pear anytime she liked she could eat another one there seemed to be no end to the supply she lived in these two roomstwo of themin the newest part of town while some folks lived in wet basements on a soggy island in the midst of a foul canal you should tell me he answered his voice hardening because i asked it of you and for no other reason but if you like i can pay you for your answers since they seem to require considerable effort if you pay me she observed then i might give any answer i think would please you so you will think your coin well spent i do like to please those who give me money she certainly spoke the truth there then tell me what i ask because i have always been kind to you in the past such kindness she laughed again such kindness as that may be found in the breeches of any man in this city but thats all one i suppose you want to know if anyone paid me to spy on you i will tell you that someone did it is no betrayal for me to say soat least i dont think it is for i have not been paid as i was promised and if i am not to have my money then at least i will have my revenge who was it that paid you why it was your widow friend she said the lovely madam damhuis she promised me ten guilders if i but kept an eye on you and that willful bitch the senhora have you been kind to her too the visitor would not be baited what did she pay you to do only to see how she was discussed in the house i was to discourage the senhora from speaking of her encounters with madam she said you were not to suspect anything but that you would notso long as i showed you my favors then she said you would be as stupid as a cow being led to its slaughter what are her ends he asked why did she want you to do these things annetje shrugged with an exaggerated flair of the shoulders that opened the neck of her gown deliciously i could not say senhor she never told me she only gave me a few guilders and promised me more but those promises have all been lies in my opinion the woman is inclined to lies you ought to be cautious annetje offered her visitor the bowl of dates would you like to eat one of my dainties the merchant declined he only thanked the girl and took his leave thus went the final conversation between miguel lienzo and his brothers former servant it is sad how badly these matters can end he and the girl knew a fond intimacy for many months but there was never any real tenderness there he wanted only her flesh and she his coin a poor foundation for any congress between man and woman and how does alferonda know all of this how can he write of the private words spoken in an obscure boardinghouse in the jordaan alferonda knows because he heard it allhe was in the next room lying on the girls rough mattress not so long ago i had been enjoying some of the dainties she had offered to miguel she had told her visitor exactly what i had instructed her to say in case he came calling madam damhuis of course had never paid the girl a stuiver nor had she ever promised to do so she had never spoken a word to the girl but once when she had stopped the senhora on the hoogstraat annetje had been in my employ at the time and it had been my design that senhora lienzo should not speak of the widow to miguel that she had done so in the end would prove immaterial miguel had been ignoring notes from isaiah nunes for weeks and had been doing so selfrighteously since he learned that nunes was in league with parido but then nuness notes began to talk of the maamad and miguel wondered if he ought not take these threats more seriously in all likelihood nunes only meant to add verisimilitude to his ruse but it was also possible that parido might want to see miguel brought before the board it would be difficult to prove the trickery miguel suspected and he could not begin to do so without revealing his connection to geertruid miguel had come to believe there was only one way to obtain the money he needed he therefore dashed off a quick note and three hours later found himself in the coffee tavern meeting with alonzo alferonda ill be direct with you miguel said i would like to borrow some money his companions eyes narrowed borrowing from alferonda is a dangerous business im prepared to take the risk alferonda laughed very bold of you how much did you have in mind miguel swallowed a gulp of turkish coffee fifteen hundred guilders i am a kind man with a generous heart but you must think me a fool with all the difficulties you face why would i give you such a sum because miguel said by doing so you will help me ruin solomon paridos plans alferonda ran a hand across his beard i dont know that there could have been another answer quite so effective miguel smiled then youll do it tell me what you have in mind miguel who had not bothered to formulate a plan fully began to talk but what came out was greatly to alferondas liking miguel sat in the three dirty dogs awaiting geertruid like all the dutch she thrived on punctuality but not this time perhaps she had found out that miguel knew of her deception miguel tried to think of the ways that might possibly happen it seemed unlikely that joachim and geertruid would have any contact and he felt fairly certain that alferonda could not have betrayed him had hendrick seen miguel observing him in the tavern that night what if he had and then he had held off telling geertruid for some reason of his own or perhaps geertruid had waited to see how miguel would respond to that knowledge when she showed up she appeared disordered and out of breath he had never seen her so shaken lowering herself down she explained what had happened a man had fallen and broken his leg in front of her on the rozengracht she said and she and a gentleman who happened to be there had helped to take him to a surgeon it was shocking stuff she said the man had screamed with agony the whole time she called at once for a beer it makes you think about the preciousness of life she said while awaiting her drink a man is going about his business and the next thing he falls and has a broken leg will he survive its repair but walk for the rest of his life with a cane will he have to have it off will it heal and be as it once was no one can say what god has in store that much is certain miguel agreed without much enthusiasm life is full of unexpected turns by jesus i am glad were doing this thing she squeezed his hand the serving girl put the beer down and geertruid drank down half the contents at once im glad well make our fortunes and live in luxury perhaps well die next day or next year no one knows but ill have my fortune first and well laugh while my husband looks on from hell then we must go ahead miguel began humorlessly we must send the letters at once we cant delay any longer the time must be set eleven in the morning three weeks from today three weeks from today the ship has not yet made port it must be three weeks from this day he insisted looking away she had betrayed him he knew it was true but his own act of betrayal tasted bitter in his mouth senhor have you decided to get forceful with me she reached out and began to run a finger lightly along miguels hand if youre going to thrust something upon me i should like to know what i shall be receiving you shall be receiving a great deal of money he told her if you do what i say i should always like to do what you say she told him but i must know why i have been assured the shipment will be here by that time i have reason to believe there are others who take an interest in coffee and if we wait too long they may make it more difficult for us to manipulate the prices as we planned geertruid considered this for a moment who are these people men of the exchange what does it matter who they are i only wonder why at this time they take an interest in something that hardly anyone has taken an interest in before why did you take an interest in it miguel asked things happen all at once ive seen it countless times men from all over the city from all over europe will suddenly decide this is the time to buy timber or cotton or tobacco maybe its the stars all i know is that this may be coffees moment and we may be but one party to have recognized it if we are to do what we planned then we had better act decisively geertruid remained quiet for a moment you say youve been given assurances about the shipment but those assurances cannot predict pirates or storms or any of a thousand things that can make a ship late what if the shipment is not yet in port when our agents begin miguel shook his head it wont matter i have been on the exchange too long to let it matter i know it as though it were my own body and i can make it do what i want just as i move my arms and legs geertruid smiled you speak with such confidence i only speak the truth our only enemy now is timidity i love to hear you talk soshe leaned forward and touched his beardbut you cant risk putting yourself in a position in which you must sell what you do not have you neednt worry about that ill not be caught unprepared what do you plan miguel smiled and leaned back its very simple if need be ill cover my own losses as the price drops and therefore simultaneously acquire the very goods i will promise to sell only ill buy when the price dips below the price at which i have promised to sell so i might profit on the sales while lowering the value it is something i would not have known how to do before but now i believe i can order it effectively this plan was nonsense miguel would never have attempted anything so foolish but he doubted geertruid had sufficient business sense to know it she didnt say anything so miguel pushed harder you asked me to join you because you needed someone who understood the madness of the exchange someone who could navigate its peculiarities i am doing the very thing you sought me out to do she let out a sigh i dont like taking this risk but youre right i did ask you to order these things and ill have to trust you but she added with a grin when we are rich ill expect you to obey me in all things and treat me as your mistress it will be my pleasure to do so miguel assured her i understand you must be cautious but there is no need for you to be so grim have you no laughter to spare until you are rich very little miguel said from now until all this is settled you will find me to be a man of business and very little else youve done your part now it is time for me to do mine very well geertruid said after a moment i admire and appreciate your dedication in the meantime ill have to seek out hendrick who has nothing to lose by being jolly well make merry on your behalf please do he said sadly he had once thought geertruid the jolliest woman in the world but he had just made her complicit in his plans to destroy her perhaps they should have gone to the coffee tavern in the plantage it would have been more appropriate and it would surely have made it easier for joachim to concentrate but theyd let him pick the tavern and here they were all threetwo of them marked by their beards as jewsin a tiny room full of drunken dutchmen who stared and pointed one even came over and examined miguels head by gingerly lifting his hat and then when he was done politely replacing it joachims months of hardship now compelled him to drink all the beer that someone else was willing to buy so only an hour after the meeting began he was already slurring his words and having some difficulty remaining on his splintered bench what surprised miguel was how much joachim did not irritate him now that he as joachim had phrased it was no longer mad he had demonstrated an endearing warmth miguel had never seen in him before he laughed at alferondas jokes and nodded approvingly at miguels suggestions he raised his tankard to toast the two of them and jews everywhere and did so without irony in his voice he treated miguel and alferonda like men who had pulled him aboard their vessels when he had believed himself left to drown now they sat together in planning all of them having had too much to drink it would not be long now only a few weeks and they were equal to the task it would tax them and torment them but it could be done i understand joachim said how it is we are to buy and sell what it is that no one wants to buy and sell what i do not understand is how we are to sell what we do not have if this nunes has sold your fruit to parido how can we affect the price through sales miguel had wanted to avoid speaking of this for it was the hardest thing he would have to do something he had vowed he would never do on the exchangea practice that no matter how desperate he became would always be the height of madness by a windhandel alferonda explained using the dutch word i was told they were dangerous joachim said that only a fool would attempt such a thing true on both counts miguel said that is why we will succeed windhandel the wind trade a colorful term for something dangerous and illegal it was when a man sold what he did not have the burgomasters had outlawed the practice since it added chaos to the exchange it was said that any man who engaged in a windhandel might just as readily throw his money into the amstel for these sales could easily be voided if the buyer provided proof the seller would then have worse than nothing for his pains but in their coffee trade they would have an advantagethe buyer would be guilty of too many tricks of his own and he would not dare to contest the sale later when they had concluded their business alferonda excused himself and miguel and joachim remained alone at the table here he was miguel thought drinking with a man he would gladly have strangled only a few weeks before joachim must have read the look on miguels face youre not scheming something are you of course we are miguel answered i mean against me miguel let out a laugh do you really think that all thisthese meetings these plansare a trick against you that we have so much invested in your destruction that we would play these games are you certain youve left your madness behind joachim shook his head i dont think these schemes are about me of course not but i wonder if i am to be sacrificed on the altar of your vengeance no miguel said softly we are not out to trick you we have thrown in our lot with yours and so have more to fear from your treachery than you do from ours i cannot even imagine how we might sacrifice you as you say i can think of a few ways joachim said but i will keep them to myself when miguel walked into the entrance hall he knew daniel could not be at home the house had turned shadowy in the dusk and the inviting scent of cinnamon filled the air hannah stood ready to greet him at the far end of the hall the single candle she held in her hand reflecting off the blackandwhite tiles of the floor it was not the way she was dressed for she wore her usual scarf and shapeless black gown revealing the now undeniable swell of the child growing inside her there was however something in the intensity of her face the way her dark eyes shone in the candlelight and her jaw jutted forward she stood unusually still with her chest pressed out as if to accentuate the heaviness of her breasts and in his drunkenness he felt dizzy with desire it seems as though it has been weeks since weve talked senhor she said i am attempting something on the exchange it takes much of my time it will make you rich yes he laughed i most fervently hope so she looked at the floor for what felt like minutes may i speak with you senhor with her arm holding the candle outward as though she were a spirit in a woodcut she led miguel into the drawing room and set the candle down in one of the sconces only one other candle was lit and the room shimmered with flickering light we must hire another girl soon she said as she sat you are clearly too busy to light candles miguel observed as he took a seat across from her she let out a burst of air a half laugh you make sport with me senhor yes i do senhora and why do you make sport with me because you and i are friends he said miguel could not see her face clearly but he detected something of a smile it was so hard to tell what did she want of him in this poorly lit room what if daniel were to walk through the door now and find them scrambling to light candles together brushing off their clothes as though they had been rolling together in sawdust he almost laughed aloud if he were to make a success of himself at this late stage in his life he had to stop planning for what could never happen he had outlived the time when he could gamble away guilders he did not have or invest in commodities because of an inexplicable urge i am a grown man he told himself and this is my brothers wife there is nothing more to it you wished to speak to me about something he said her voice cracked as she tried to talk i wish to speak to you about your brother what about my brother his eyes shifted momentarily to her belly a moment of hesitation he is out of the house she said when he was a boy he and his friends had a favorite rock from which they would leap into the waters of the tagus they fell five times the length of a man who could say how far it was now but in the thrill of childish excitement it seemed halfway to eternity miguel remembered the twisting and terrifying feeling of freedom like dying and soaring at once without moving he now felt the same terror and excitement his gut twisted his humors rushed to his brain senhora he said he rose planning to escape as quickly as he could but she must have misunderstood she stood as well and walked to him until she was only a few inches away he could smell the sweet perfume of her musk feel the heat of her breath her eyes locked upon him and with one hand she reached up and pulled the scarf from her head letting her thick hair fall around her shoulders and down her back miguel heard himself suck in his breath the urges of his body would betray him he had been so resolved only an instant before this beautiful eager woman could not he reminded himself be made any more pregnant than she was already her body emitted its own heat and closed in on him miguel knew he need only lift his hand and put it upon her arm or run it along her face or touch her hair and nothing else would matter he would be lost in the mindless revel of senses all his determination would be for nothing and why should he not give in he asked himself had his brother treated him so well that he should not pluck this illicit fruit of his hospitality adultery was surely a great sin but he understood that such sins were born of the need to maintain order in households it was not bedding another mans wife that was the sin it was getting her with child since that could not happen it would be no sin to take her here upon the floor of the drawing room and so he leaned in to kiss her to finally feel the press of her lips and in the instant he thought to pull her closer to him he felt something much darker he knew with perfect clarity what would happen if he kissed her would she be able to return to her husbands bed without revealing what had happened this poor abused girlshe would in a thousand silent ways betray him before a day had passed he took a step backwards senhora he whispered it cannot be she bit her lip and looked down at her hands which were twisting her scarf so hard as to almost destroy it what cannot be she asked let us pretend then miguel silently agreed i beg your pardon he told her as he took another step back i seem to have misunderstood something please forgive me he hurried out of the room and into the dark hall to feel his blundering way to the cellar there in the damp and the dark he sat mutely listening for some sign of her anguish or her relief but he heard nothing not even the creaking of floorboards for all he knew she remained motionless her hair exposed to the empty space and strangely miguel felt the heat of tears on his own face do i love her so much perhaps he did but he did not cry out of love he wept not for her sadness or even for his own but for the knowledge that he had been cruel that he had led her to believe what he had always known must be impossible he had acted out the fancies of his imagination upon her without thinking that for her to abandon those fancies might crush her he had been cruel to a sad woman who had done nothing worse than be kind to him he wondered if he had indeed played his hand so badly in all other spheres just before noon outside the exchange excitement was building upon the dam two weeks had passed since miguels conversation with geertruid today was reckoning day on the exchange and today miguels investments came due he stood in the crowd awaiting the opening of the great gates and scanned the faces about him hard and intense stares into the distance dutchman jew and foreigner alike all clenched their teeth and maintained a martial watchfulness any man who had spent enough time on the exchange could sense it like the smell of coming rain great schemes were ready to be unleashed that would affect everyone who traded every reckoning day was charged but today something more than the usual would happen everyone knew it as he had made himself ready that morning miguel felt a troubling peace his stomach had been in a twist for weeks but now he felt the calmness of resolve like a man walking to the gallows he had slept surprisingly soundly but still drank four large bowls of coffee he wanted to be wild with coffee he wanted coffee to rule his passions he could not have been more ready but he knew some things were beyond him five men knowingly or not were his creatures and he depended on them to act their parts it was all so fragile this enormous edifice could in an instant crumble into dust and so he prepared himself as best he could he cleansed himself before shabbat at the mikvah and dedicated himself to prayer on the holy day the next day he continued in prayer and he fasted from sunup to sunset he could not survive two ruins the world might blink at the first one forgive it as bad luck two ruins would crush him forever no substantial merchant would ever entrust such a failure with his daughter no man of business would ever offer miguel a partnership to fail today would mean he would have to abandon the life of a merchant with his teeth gritty from ground coffee berry miguel had stepped outside and breathed in the early morning air he felt more like a conquistador than a trader only a few wisps of clouds drifted across the sky and a light breeze came rolling in from the waters a superstitious dutchman might see clear skies as a good omen but miguel knew the skies were clear for parido too outside the dam miguel waited in the unusually silent crowd no arguments or bursts of laughter nowhere did the sound of early trading set off a ripple of exchanges when men spoke they spoke in whispers paridos calls like miguels puts were to come due at the close of the day that meant parido needed to keep the price high and the higher it went the more he would profit just as the lower it went the more miguel would earn if miguel did nothing parido would gain on his investment and miguel would lose as parido held the coffee shipment that was meant to be miguels he would hold on to his goods until after tomorrow he might then slowly sell what he had at the inflated price if you were parido alferonda had reasoned you would want to use your trading combination you could spread the rumor that his combination was planning to dump holdings which would bring down the price but you dont have that kind of power parido does why does he not simply spread the rumor that his combination will be buying thus causing the price to rise even higher the rumor game is a delicate one if a combination overuses it no one will believe rumors associated with that combination anymore and it has lost a valuable tool this business with the coffee is paridos not his combinations the other members would be unwilling to expend the capital of rumor on his behalf here not unless the promise of wealth were sufficiently compelling but there are other ways he can use his combination he can instruct his men not to respond to me precisely parido will assume that you will try to sell such coffee as you have acquired and make it seem as though you have more than you do thus causing a fall in the price alternatively you will sell what you dont have now he knows this is tricky because if you can set off a selling frenzy you can then buy cheap what others unload and if anyone challenges the sale you can produce what you have promised but he will surely have instructed his combination to spread the rumor that you will not have what you pretend to sell and no one will buy of you miguel smiled can it be as simple as that parido is a very powerful man alferonda said he has made his money not by being overly clever but by seeing to the simple things youve demonstrated in the past that you work alone you work without much strategy and you tend to follow your instincts rather than clear business plans i see you are insulted but you cannot deny it is true youve made mistakes miguel but those mistakes will serve you very well when you step forth onto the exchange this time parido will be expecting a very different opponent from the man he finds the clock upon the tower of the great town hall struck noon and the gates to the exchange opened in a burst of shouting that echoed across the dam miguel pushed his way in along with the hundreds of other traders and slowly made his way toward the east india corner of the courtyard ignoring the traders who called out to him with their goods a larger crowd than was usual milled around the east india traders many of the men were of paridos combination they wore the bright colors and feathered hats of the portuguese and they held themselves like imperious hidalgos they were there as a favor to their friend it would cost them nothing to monitor the trade in coffee to sell nothing themselves and to muscle out anyone who might respond to miguels efforts it was all as he and alferonda had speculated off to the side talking with some traders miguel recognized stood isaiah nunes he nodded at miguel miguel nodded back there would be time for accusations later but for now he put forth his best face what would nunes expect to see from miguel disappointment of course he knew about the puts still he had to make a certain show of determination in the open courtyard where the hamburg merchants did their business alferonda conferred with the few tudescos on the exchange these longbearded jews nodded their sage heads as the usurer explained something at great probably needless length miguel looked up and saw parido in front of him this day has a familiar feel to it does it not remind you of the day the price of sugar fell no miguel smiled back as a matter of fact this day feels utterly new surely you dont think you can orchestrate a downturn in coffee prices you were warned to keep away from the coffee trade but you would do things your own way that is how it must be ive anticipated your moves and ive taken steps to prevent their success the kindliest advice i can give you is to walk away accept your losses at the days end at least youll be spared a public humiliation i appreciate your advice but you might wish to keep in mind that you will be pressing your lips to my ass before the day ends you forget to whom you speak i am only trying to spare what remains of your reputation a lesser man than i would have held his tongue there is no lesser man than you senhor parido clucked his tongue do you really believe you can outmaneuver me i have my business well in hand miguel did not like the wavering of his own voice parido seemed too confident what if he knew the details of miguels plans what if he had taken steps to prevent alferondas clever scheme to circumvent paridos influence what if joachim had betrayed him how in hand do you truly have it parido asked i dont understand your question its quite simple do you believe so firmly that you can prevail today and bring down the price that you are willing to make a wager miguel locked his eyes upon his enemys name it parido was foolish to offer a wager miguel had already gambled everything the price of coffee now stands at seven tenths of a guilder per pound which means i have raised it to fortytwo guilders per barrel i only need keep it above thirtyeight guilders to make my money you need it to fall below thirtyseven to make any profit from your puts at thirtyseven or greater you make nothing and your brother answers for your bad investment miguel felt himself redden you thought no one knew of your reckless use of his name you thought you could keep secrets from me on this bourse and now you think you can outmaneuver me when i am determined not to be outmaneuvered i admire your optimism it meant nothing miguel told himself he might have learned of miguels trick from his broker it did not mean parido knew everything youre doing nothing but boasting senhor very well ill do more than boast if you can bring the price to thirty guilders a barrel or below ill allow you to buy ninety barrels from me at twenty guilders each miguel attempted to appear skeptical where would you hope to get ninety barrels of coffee can the warehouses of amsterdam have so much the warehouses of amsterdam contain surprises that men such as you cannot imagine your wager seems onesided what do you get if i cannot defeat you well youll be ruined so im not sure youll have anything to give me but your person so let us say this if you lose then you will confess to the maamad that you lied about your relationship with joachim waagenaar you will tell the parnassim that you are guilty of deceiving that council and you will take the punishment that so grave a deception deserves cherem it seemed like madness to agree to such a thing but if he lost he would have to leave amsterdam regardless the banishment would make no difference i agree let us draw up a paper to that effect though what it is that ive agreed to will have to be kept between us lest that paper later fall into the wrong hands but i would like a surety of some kind you see id hate to win my wager only to discover you guilty of a windhandelof not having the ninety barrels you promised what are you suggesting only this ill take your wager and well put it all to paper and if by some chance you cant supply the coffee at the price you mention you will instead pay me what those barrels are at this moment worth that would behe took a moment to calculatethirtyeight hundred guilders what say you it is an empty bet for i never sell what i do not have then you agree of course not why should i agree to a foolish wager that includes the possibility of my paying almost four thousand guilders miguel shrugged i wont accept otherwise i require the surety parido let out a sigh very well ill agree to your silly conditions he quickly drew up the contract insisting on writing out both copies himself miguel therefore had to waste more time reading it over making certain his rival had not inserted any trickery into the language but all appeared well and the contract was witnessed by one of paridos friends who stood close by each man now had his copy in his pocket the clock tower told him he had lost a quarter of an hour it was time to begin miguel took a step backwards and called out in latin coffee selling twenty barrels of coffee at forty guilders each the price hardly mattered as miguel had none of it himself this after all was a windhandel he had to make the price low enough to attract attention but not so low that his call would arouse suspicion i have coffee at forty he called again he then repeated the call in dutch and again in portuguese no one replied paridos men began to move in menacing miguel like a pack of dogs a minor trader from the vlooyenburg glanced over at miguel and appeared on the verge of taking the sale but parido locked eyes with him and the merchant turned away muttering it was clear that no portuguese jew would want to incur paridos anger by breaking the blockade casting his eyes about the exchange miguel saw daniel hovering on the perimeter of their little crowd he had dressed in his best trading suit todaynot bright enough to wear on shabbat but a handsome ensemble matching crimson doublet and hat with a blue shirt beneath black breeches and shiny red shoes with enormous silver buckles he looked at paridos men and at miguel and then down at the ground silence had descended over their little section of the exchange in the near distance he could hear the shouts of other transactions but no one among the east india traders said a word the battle had begun and it surely appeared to the spectators that miguel was already defeated parido smiled and whispered something in the ear of a member of his combination who answered with a hoarse laugh miguel called out his price again a few dutchmen looked on curiously but seeing the crowd of menacing jews kept their distance miguel had nothing to offer that was sweet enough to either entice the portuguese jews to defy parido or draw the christians to trouble themselves with what was so obviously a duel among aliens standing alone in the midst of a circle miguel looked like a lost child he called out once more again no reply parido met his gaze and smiled his lips moved silently youve lost then miguel heard the call in poor latin ill buy twenty at thirtynine alferonda had worked his contacts among the tudescos one of that nation a man whose usual trade was in the discounting of bank notes stood forth and repeated his call he wore black robes and his white beard swayed as he shouted out his bid twenty barrels at thirtynine sold miguel shouted he could not help but smile it was not the usual trader who hoped his buyers would keep lowering his price but his business today was to sell cheap ill buy twentyfive at thirtyeight and a half cried another tudesco whom miguel recognized as a dealer in unminted gold miguel pushed his way through the wall of paridos men to acknowledge him twentyfive barrels at thirtyeight and a half sold the blockade had loosened a selloff had begun and parido knew he could not stop miguel merely by keeping his men near thirty barrels of coffee to buy parido shouted in return at forty guilders the tudescos would be fools not to turn around and sell for an immediate profit they had never agreed to act as miguels combination only to break the blockade motivated by the promise that their assistance would yield its own profitable opportunities miguel could see that they considered selling which would stabilize the price for parido portuguese jews stood by and waited to see which way the prices went which faction had command the odds surely favored parido the only thing he could not counter would be a general selloff if too many men moved to sell he could not stem the tide alone and the men in his combination would not sacrifice their own money for him here was the pivotal moment for the coffee scheme and the whole of the exchange sensed it miguel looked up and unexpectedly locked eyes with his brother daniel stood at the far reaches of the circle of spectators his lips moving silently as he calculated the odds against a general selloff daniel tried to look away but miguel would not let him go he wanted to see that his brother understood he wanted to see it in his brothers eyes and daniel did understand he knew that if he chose at that moment to join sides with miguel to throw himself in with his brother to call out a sale of cheap coffee the scheme would succeed the momentum from daniels participation would tip the scales in miguels favor here was the time at last in which family might rise above petty interests daniel might say that yes parido was his friend and friendship should be honored but family was another matter and he could not stand by while his brother faced ruin permanent ruinnot while he had the power in his hands to prevent it they both knew it miguel could see that his brother knew it he had asked daniel once if he would choose his brother or his friend and daniel had not answered but he would answer now one way or another miguel could see from the look on his brothers face that daniel too recalled that conversation he could see the look of shame on daniels face as he turned away and allowed this coffee business to unfold without him a strange quiet fell within the walls certainly not what would have passed for quiet in any other part of the world but for the exchange the noise reduced to a mere din traders moved in close as though they watched a cockfight or a brawl they would get good sport miguel told himself when parido had moved to buy he had himself given the signal for miguels next move one the parnass could not have anticipated selling coffee fifty barrels at thirtysix joachim shouted parido stared in disbelief he had not seen joachim arrive upon the exchange or perhaps he had not noticed him having lost his peasants attire he was once more dressed like a man of means looking every bit the dutch trader in his black suit and hat no one who did not know him would have guessed that a month ago he had been less than a beggar now he was surrounded by a crowd of buyers whose eager calls he engaged with one at a time calm as any seasoned merchant upon any bourse in europe this move had been alferondas inspiration parido could easily assert his influence over the traders of the portuguese nation every man knew of his rivalry with miguel and few would willingly cross a vengeful man with a seat on the maamad alferonda knew he would be able to encourage a few foreign tudescos to begin the trading but there were not enough of them to sustain the selloff and most would be unwilling to invest heavily in so unknown a commodity or do too much to irritate parido but joachim could entice the dutch market into seeing that this conflict was a matter of business not some internal portuguese contest he could bring in the dutch traders willing to make a profit off this new product they might be sheepish about jumping into a fray where jew battled jew over a commodity hardly anyone had ever heard of but once they saw one of their own intrepid countrymen joining in they would fall in line lest they lose the chance to profit another dutchman called out to sell miguel had never seen him before he was only some unfortunate trader who had taken a chance on coffee and now found himself caught in the crossfire desperate to get rid of his goods before the price dipped even further he let his fifteen barrels go at thirtyfive miguel was now only two guilders per barrel away from the price he needed to survive five guilders from what he needed to defeat parido but even if he brought the price to thirty he would have to keep the price stable until two oclock the end of the trading day a new man shouted out in dutch but his accent sounded french then another this one danish thirtyfive thirtyfour miguel need only look on and monitor he had sold eighty barrels that he did not own it was no matter far more barrels had already changed hands than the warehouses of amsterdam could hope to house now miguel would have to wait to see how low the price went and then buy enough to protect himself if a buyer chose he might file an appeal so that he would not have to buy his coffee at the nowhigh prices of thirtyeight and thirtynine but that hardly mattered to miguel let them keep their money only the price of the barrels mattered now parido looked on his face blank he had stopped shouting orders for one man could not buy everything not without ruining himself he had artificially raised the price himself and he knew that if he bought back enough barrels at a price to bring coffee back to thirtynine he would surely lose a great deal of money even if he factored in the profit of his put the price began to stabilize so miguel bought at thirtyone and then sold at once for thirty the loss was nothing and it set off another frenzy of selling miguel smiled at parido who turned away in disgust but miguel would not let him walk away he pushed through the crowd he heard sales at twentynine and twentyeight he looked at the clock on the church tower half past one only thirty minutes remaining i believe the day is mine miguel called parido spun around not yet lienzo theres still time there may be time but i dont believe you have any more options parido shook his head you think your little tricks will save you relish this moment lienzo i think youll find you are not nearly so clever as you think no probably not but i have the distinct pleasure this day of being cleverer than you i wish to take possession of those barrels of coffee you promised me by this time tomorrow you havent the money to pay for them he spat if you look at your copy of our contract you will note it specifies the exchange must take place within seventytwo hours of the end of market today i frankly dont believe you will be able to raise the money indeed in seventytwo hours in the eyes of the maamad you may no longer be a jew so parido planned to use the council to avoid his debts the council would never stand for it you may believe what you wish but ill transfer the amount to your account by this time tomorrow i expect you to transfer ownership with a similar punctuality or you will have to honor the contract and pay me an additional thirtyeight hundred miguel stepped away and glanced toward the crowd of buyers and sellers the price appeared now to have stabilized at a remarkable twentysix with very little time left to trade if the price only stayed there he would earn a profit of almost seven hundred guilders from his puts alone another two thousand from the futures now too anxious to simply stand and observe he thought to take care of one last bit of business isaiah nunes had been speaking quietly with some acquaintances attempting to ignore the selling frenzy miguel smiled and asked nunes to walk with him a moment privately the two stepped away behind a pillar miguel allowed his face to brighten into his best merchant guise i would like you to transfer ownership of the coffee i contracted with you to deliver i would like ownership papers in my hands no later than tomorrow morning nunes straightened his posture as though making some effort to align himself perfectly with the earth and then took a step forward im sorry you find yourself in a difficult situation miguel but i cant help you i told you the shipment never arrived and your needs cannot undo what has been done and if i may be so bold you are hardly a man to demand prompt action in any regard getting you to pay what you owed me has been no easy task and i feel that youve abused my friendship unforgivably an odd comment from a man who sold my contracted goods to solomon parido nunes tried to show no expression i cannot understand you you are talking like a madman and ill not be insulted youre overplaying your part senhor you should appear confused not horrified nothing you say may horrify me he took a step forward i once looked upon you as a friend but i see you are only a cheat and ill discuss nothing further with you youll discuss it with me or you will discuss it in the courts miguel answered he saw at once that he had nuness attention you took the coffee i had contracted for and delivered it to solomon parido you then lied and told me my shipment had never been acquired i presume you then arranged for another shipment but i know the cargo that belongs to me by legal right came in on a ship called the sea lily i have witnesses who will testify to hearing parido discuss the matter if you refuse to comply my only question will be whether to bring you before a dutch court or the maamad or both and force you to provide not only the coffee but pay such damages that result of my not having the original shipment miguel showed nunes the contract he had made with parido if i lose money on this contract ill be able to sue you for the losses for if you had not deceived me i should surely have won and you may wager that once this matter goes to court your reputation as a trustworthy merchant will be utterly dashed nunes flushed if i withhold the coffee from parido he will make me an enemy what of my reputation then surely you cant expect me to care youll transfer ownership to me by morning or ill see you ruined if i give you what you ask youll say nothing youll not tell the world of this i ought not to keep quiet but ill do so out of memory of our friendship i never would have expected this from you nunes shook his head you must understand how difficult it is to resist parido when he wants something i dared not say no to him i have a family and i could not afford to put myself at risk by protecting you i understand his influence and power miguel said and i have resisted him just the same and he did not ask you to refrain from protecting me he asked you to lie to me and cheat me and you agreed i never thought you a particularly brave man isaiah but i was still shocked to learn the extent of your cowardice as he walked away he heard the clock tower strike two he asked a man standing near him how coffee had closed twentyfive and a half guilders per barrel miguel would look at once into renting a splendid house on the shores of the houtgracht he would contact his debtors to offer some small payment to the most anxious everything would be different now and there was his brother he turned around daniel stood no more than an arms length away daniel looked at his brother tried to lock eyes with him but miguel could not bring himself to say anything the time for reconciliation was over there could be no forgiveness daniel had bet his own future against his brothers and he had lost miguel moved away crowds of men swarmed around him word had begun to spread already every man upon the exchange understood he had had a great victory even if they did not know what he had won or whom he had defeated these traders knew they stood in the presence of a trader in his glory strangers whose names he barely knew clapped him on the shoulder or pumped his hand or promised they would call upon him soon to speak of a project whose value he could scarce believe and then through the thickness of the traders he saw a haggard dutchman in fine clothes grin widely at him joachim miguel turned away from a triumvirate of italian jews who wanted to speak to him about figs uttering some polite excuse and promising to call on them at a tavern whose name he forgot the moment the men spoke it he pushed on until he stood facing joachim who appeared both greater and smaller than he had in his impoverished madness his grin appeared not so much triumphant as sad miguel returned it with a smile of his own i told you i would make things right he said if you would but trust me if i had done no more than trust you joachim replied with equal cheer i would still be a poor man it is only because i hated you and hounded you that you have won this victory there is a great lesson to be learned here but i shall burn in hell if i know what it may be miguel let out a bark of a laugh and stepped forward to embrace this man who not so long ago he had wished dead with all his heart for all he knew he might wish him dead again and soon for the moment however he did not care what joachim had done or would do and he did not care who knew of their hatred and their friendship he cared only that he had righted his own wrongs and unmade his ruin in the process miguel would have hugged the devil himself the new girl spoke no portuguese but made herself content with a rough exchange of signs catryn had a dour face closer to plain than homely but unpleasant enough to suit her mistress it hardly mattered miguel was out of the house now and the prettiness or plainness of the maid meant nothing to anyone in the mornings daniel left the house almost before she was awake and hannah was left to her breakfast with the girl hovering over her catryn gestured toward the decanter of wine on the table she seemed to believe that a woman with child could never take too much wine and hannah had been disordered with drink every morning for a week before she had found the will to say no now she just shook her head when she drank so much the baby quieted down inside her and she liked to feel it kicking and squirming when it lay still even if just for a few minutes hannah feared the worst if the baby died what would daniel do what would he do to her she sent catryn to the market outside the dam to buy coffee and had the girl prepare it for her each afternoon one day daniel came home early and grew so enraged when he saw her drinking it that he struck her until she cried out for the wellbeing of their child now she only drank it during exchange hours when she knew daniel would not be there sometimes she saw miguel on the street dressed as he was now in his fine new suits walking in his familiar way with the great merchants of the vlooyenburg he looked content youthful in his triumph hannah didnt dare look too long if she went to his house if she told him she wanted to leave her husband and be with him what would he say he would tell her to be gone maybe if he had failed in his mighty scheme and had nothing more to lose maybe then he might have taken her but not now after catryn cleared away the breakfast things she and hannah went out to the markets the girl could not cook half so well as annetje and she knew less about picking meats and produce hannah had a better eye than the girl but she didnt speak her mind let her pick bad vegetables and turning beef what did it matter to her if their meals were bland or sour this was her life now pale carrots and rotten fish these things were her only pleasures she had her husband and she would have her daughter whom she prayed would be born healthy and fit those things would have to be enough they would have to be enough because there could be nothing else moving from his brothers house was sweet miguel had rented a fine home across the canal and though it was smaller than his brothers he thought it far more elegant and perfectly suited for his needs he hardly even knew what he would do with the space he had though he hoped soon enough to fill it with a wife and children the marriage brokers had already begun to pound on his door the day after his victory on the exchange his last in his brothers house he had climbed up from the cellar and walked through the kitchen and then up again to the main level where he saw daniel sitting in the front room pretending to look at letters daniel said nothing to him not a word of kindness miguel had told him that morning that he would be moving out and had thanked daniel for his hospitality daniel had merely nodded and advised miguel to be certain not to take anything that was not his there was still one order of business and miguel wanted it put to rest before he left he cleared his throat and waited while daniel slowly raised his head is there something he asked i wanted to talk to you about a matter of money he said it is an awkward thing and i would not have you think me overeager right now my affairs are quite healthy thank the holy one blessed be he but i am told that you owe me some money daniel rose to his feet i owe you what nonsense is that after i sheltered you for the past six months you would say that i owe you your shelter has been very generous daniel but such generosity is not worth two thousand guilders ricardo has explained everything to me i cannot believe you would fly in my face with this he shouted i lent you money when no one else would when your name was a byword for failure i took you in and gave you shelter when you had nowhere to turn and now you dare tell me i owe you i have not said when you must pay me i know your finances to be in disorder who told you such a lie now that you have a few coins jingling in your pocket you think yourself the finest man in amsterdam i must tell you brother it does not work thus because you are now solvent does not mean i must be ruined i had not thought it worked that way miguel said quietly and i will tell you something else that little scheme of yours on the exchange would never have worked had you not taken my name and done with it as you ought not to promising my money to back your ventures i suppose you thought yourself too clever to be discovered i thought it only fair miguel said considering you had the effrontery to demand that i pay you what you lent me when you knew yourself to be my debtor well i wont forgive you daniel said the money you claim i owe you was made by stomping upon senhor paridos plans plans in which i was also invested while you profited from whale oil i lostbut i never chastised you for your trickery and while you profited from your little scheme with coffee you have cost senhor parido a great deal of money can you only profit miguel by tricks and schemes that injure others how can you speak of tricks and schemes when all this time paridos interest in coffee was based on nothing but revenge that is no kind of way to do business i assure you it would have been far better had he looked to making money rather than to making me lose it daniel shook his head i had always thought you lax and undisciplined too free with drink and women but i had never before thought you a villain tell yourself what lies you like miguel said bitterly i wont take you before the maamad i leave it to your own sense of right and wrong to act as you see fit the letters had gone out to all the agents miguel had hired agents in london paris marseilles antwerp hamburg and half a dozen other exchanges he had not contacted those agents to which geertruid was responsible those secured in iberia with the aid of her lawyer geertruid handled those herself and she had no idea her own letters contained something very different from miguels on the day that miguel had indicated geertruids agents in lisbon madrid and oporto were to buy as much coffee as they could word of the amsterdam selloff would have trickled to the foreign exchanges already prices would have dipped after miguels maneuver and geertruids agents would be prepared to pounce on the low price geertruid arrived at the amsterdam exchange at midday she was not the only woman to set foot there but her sex was rare and she attracted some small attention as she strolled across the courtyard in her flowing red skirts imperious as a queen during the early stages of their planning miguel had suggested that she come to the exchange to watch the buying take place and witness the birth of their wealth miguel had never repeated the suggestion but geertruid had not forgotten it she beamed tilting her head just slightly in the way that drove miguel mad there was miguel her partner her friend her puppet she had sent him out to do her bidding and he had done it except she now saw he did something else entirely her partner was selling he stood amid a crowd of traders who called out their price miguel sold off his ninety barrels piecemealten to this merchant five to that since the recent upheaval coffee had come to be regarded as a risky venture and no one bought in any great quantity what are you doing she rushed over as soon as miguel had finished the transaction have you gone mad why arent you buying miguel smiled with a little manipulation and a carefully placed rumor here and there ive managed to raise the price of coffee to thirtyseven guilders to the barrel so im unloading the barrels i bought from nunes ill make a tidy profit which will enhance the wealth i acquired from my puts after the events of last closing day i bought some shortterm futures and i believe i should profit quite nicely from those as well a profit your puts and shortterm futures youve been gazing at the moon when the other markets learn that amsterdam has not gone down well lose money across europe oh im not worried the agents will buy nothing ive dismissed them geertruid stared at him she began to speak but choked on her words she tried again miguel what game are you playing please tell me what is happening what is happening miguel said calmly is that i have changed the scheme to my advantage and i have left you to muddle through as best you can geertruid opened her mouth but nothing came out so she turned away for a moment to master herself why would you do such a thing to me her eyes blinked and she stared into nothingness why would you do this miguel smiled because you deceived me and betrayed me you thought even now that i would never have learned that our chance meeting was no accident you have manipulated me since the day we met but now i have manipulated you you sought to use this coffee scheme to ruin me but i have found you out and made a handsome profit it is not the profit i dreamed of i grant you but it is certainly enough to restore my reputation resolve my debts and give me the freedom to trade as i like you on the other hand have committed yourself to your agents in iberia and i believe they will turn to you to repay them this time geertruid could not find her voice at all of course i shall return your capital though you sought my ruin ill not steal from you the money should go a little way toward repaying your agents for their purchases i am undone geertruid whispered she took hold of his arm as though he were a witness to her ruin and not its architect perhaps your master will rescue you surely it is his responsibility to do so i suspect the three thousand guilders you laid out were his to begin with of course this incident has not left parido untouched and he may not find himself as generous as he once was but that is no concern of mine geertruid still said nothing but only stared ahead in disbelief miguel who had more coffee to unload turned away maybe she had wanted it to happen when she thought back on it that was how it seemed she hadnt hidden the book particularly well setting it in the pocket of an apron with one corner sticking out or under a pile of scarves its sharp corner jabbing through the fabric she took it out often leafing through its uncut pages peeking at the images hidden in pages that were still attached she knew she ought to separate themit was her book and she might do as she pleasedbut she did not know how and she was afraid of damaging it the words meant nothing to her she could not tell one letter from another but the woodcuts were pretty and they suggested to her a world beyond what she knew delicately drawn fruit a fish a boat a little boy at play some of them were silly like the cow with the almost human face smiling out at her with maddening cheer she and the new girl catryn had been washing the floors before shabbat when daniel entered the hallway and trod along the clean floors with his muddy shoes his face was blank hardly even changing as he slipped and had to grab onto the doorjamb to keep from tumbling catryn muttered under her breath but didnt look up come with me daniel said to hannah she raised herself and followed him to the bedroom the book had been set out on the bed she had known it would happen she had been waiting for it even so her stomach wrenched so hard she feared for her child she took deep breaths and willed herself calm explain this daniel said jabbing a bony finger in the direction of the book hannah stared at it but said nothing do you not hear me wife i hear you she said then you will answer me by christ ive not often raised a hand to you but i will do so now if you continue to be obstinate has someone been teaching you to read she shook her head no then where did the book come from there was no point keeping it a secret daniel could no longer do him any harm she suspected that miguel would want her to tell him that he would get some pleasure from her doing so it came from senhor lienzo your brother she said he gave it to me daniel could not have turned any more red if he had held his breath miguel he said softly what business had he giving you things she shook her head i told him i wished i knew how to read and so he gave it to me daniel sucked in his breath he rubbed his jaw and then stuck his thumb and index finger into his mouth and began to root around after a moment he stopped did he give you anything else he asked bitterly she had not known she was going to say it she could not have willed herself to do it the courage would have eluded her and it was hardly a choice she felt entitled to make herself there could be nothing more selfish than to entangle another person in her lies and yet she did it the words slipped out this child she said both hands on her belly he gave me this child she felt so cold she could hardly keep her teeth from chattering she became dizzy her vision blurred what had she done what horrible step had she taken she nearly threw herself at daniels feet and told him she had spoken those words out of spite and that of course she had never defiled her marriage bed but though it would be the truth the words would sound like lies that was why she had spoken them once uttered they could never be retrieved her husband remained still with his arms hanging limply by his sides she had expected him to rush at her to beat her with his hands or with whatever he could grab she was prepared to protect her baby come what may he might have simply walked out of the room or he might have cursed her he did none of those things and hannah now had cause to regret her words not for what they might mean for her or even for miguel but for what they might mean for her husband she had imagined him enraged furious murderous but not broken and defeated i have nothing then he said softly everything has been lost i will have to sell the house and now i wont even have my son shes a daughter hannah said softly i dreamed it daniel seemed not to hear her ive lost everything he said again and to my brother ill not stay here where will you go she asked as though she were speaking to a grieving friend venice london perhaps you will go to miguel i dont know that he will have me why should he those few words spoken out of malice toward daniel had changed miguels life forever how could she have done something so cruel yet if she could take them back she wouldnt he will have you he has honor enough i will ask the maamad grant a divorce and i will be gone she thought to step forward and take his hand and offer some kind wordbut she would be doing it for herself only to lessen her guilt and she dared not break the spell ill leave now she told him that would be best as she walked through the vlooyenburg the terror slipped away drop by drop she had imagined miguel turning her away cursing her slamming his door in her face what would she do she would have no home and no money and a child to look after she might find a convent to take her in but she did not even know if there were convents in the united provinces she might have to go south perhaps to antwerp to find one how would she get there she had only a few coins to her name but she would not torment herself with these fears miguel would never turn her away at the very least now that he was a great merchant again he would give her something with which to support herself she too could go somewhere and start afresh perhaps pass herself off as a widow it would not be an ideal life but neither would it be a miserable one the world was all before her and if it was not for her to choose her place of rest she believed anything would be better than the place from which she had emerged miguel had not yet hired a servant for his new home so he answered the door himself he stared at her for a moment not certain what to do and then invited her in i told your brother that the child is yours hannah said as soon as she heard the door click shut he turned and looked at her his expression inscrutable will he give you a divorce she nodded miguel said nothing his jaw clenched and his eyes half closed as he indulged in a long a cruelly long inscrutable silence too many shutters in the house remained closed she thought and the hallways remained dark and murky the whiteness of the tiles appearing as a dull gray miguel now lived here but he had not made the place his own no paintings hung on the walls a dusty mirror leaned against the floor in the distance hannah could smell the burning of an oil lamp and she could see the faint dance of light from another room somewhere in the house a clock chimed if i take you as my wife he said at last will you agree to obey me in all things no she said she bit her lip to fight back both tears and a grin not even a little he asked very well i will obey you a little good a little is all i require he said and reached out for her with a belly full of slightly cured herring served with turnips and leeks miguel leaned back to survey the flyboat the moment was his all the men of the portuguese nation spoke of his wondrous though still largely incomprehensible manipulation of the coffee market a market so insignificant that most men had never given it more than a passing glance lienzo had shown himself a man of substance they said parido had set out to destroy him but lienzo had turned the villainy back on itself brilliant ingenious this man who had once seemed no more than a foolish gambler now showed himself to be a great man of commerce a half dozen traders of the highest order sat at miguels table drinking their fill of the good wine for which he had paid eager fellows had crowded around him the moment he walked through the door and miguel had found it difficult to force his way through to his new friends older senhors who had once looked at miguel with contempt now wished to do business would senhor lienzo be interested in considering a matter of ginger would senhor lienzo be interested in hearing of the opportunities arising on the london exchange senhor lienzo had a great deal of interest in these matters and he had an even greater interest in the fact that these men now sought his business but he thought men of commerce were best treated like dutch sluts if they were put off a bit now they would only be more anxious later let them wait miguel still had no firm ideas about what he wished to do with his newfound solvency he was not as wealthy as he had hoped to be by now but he had wealth enough and he would soon have a wife andsooner than expecteda child he could not help but laugh at the irony the maamad would expel from the community a righteous man who dared to cast a few coins to an unsanctioned beggar but miguel could steal his brothers wife so long as he did so legally she would have her divorce and then she would be his in the meantime he had rented for her some rooms in a neat little house in the vlooyenburg she had hired a girl of her own choosing she drank coffee she entertained friends she never knew she had women who flocked to her parlor now that she was the subject of so delicious and neatly resolved a scandal and she had been to visit miguel in his new house of course she had there was no reason to wait for the legal sanction of marriage miguel drank heavily with these new friends and retold the story of his triumph as though it had only just happened the look of surprise on paridos face when joachim began to sell the delight when the tudesco merchants sent the price falling the surprising interest of those strangers from the levant was that truly an east indian who had bought fifty barrels of coffee from the frenchman they might have continued this celebration for hours or at least for as long as miguel bought wine but solomon parido entered and silenced their conversation miguel felt a strange mixture of fear and delight he had expected parido to be there a man such as he so invested in his power could not hide from defeat he would show his face publicly demonstrate to the nation that his little losses were nothing to him parido leaned forward and spoke to some friends with particular warmth miguel expected the parnass to remain among these men turn his back on his enemy and make nothing of his presence but such was not paridos plan after speaking with his fellows he came over to miguels table those who had just moments ago been laughing at the stories of paridos failure now climbed over one another to show their respect for him but the parnass had no interest in their display a word he said to miguel he smiled at his companions and followed parido to a quiet corner all eyes were upon them and miguel had the uncomfortable feeling that now he was the subject of merriment parido stopped and leaned in toward him because i am a kind man he said quietly i gave you these weeks to revel in your glory i thought it cruel to crush you too soon who among the children of israel is as wise and good as you you may be flip but you and i both know that i have never done anything but in the service of the nation and nothing i did deserved the schemes you hatched against me and what of your poor brother he protected you and lent you money when you were friendless and you repay him by undoing his finances cuckolding him and stealing his wife miguel could not correct the worlds belief that he had cuckolded daniel not without betraying hannah so he let the world think what it liked you and my brother are of a piece you plot against me and seek my ruin but when your methods fail you blame me as though i had acted against you this surely is a madness worthy of the inquisition itself how can you look me in the face and say it was i who plotted against you did you not seek to ruin my whaleoil scheme for your own profit i sought to ruin nothing merely to profit from your own manipulations nothing more than any man does on the exchange each day you knew full well your interference would cost me money even while i interceded on your behalf with your brandy futures an intercession miguel pointed out that left me the poorer you dont seem to understand that i did not act against you i had bet on the price of brandy going down and my machinations in that field threatened to turn your futures into debt so i did what i could to rescue you i was as surprised as anyone when the price of brandy rose at the last minute unlike you who made a small profit i lost by my efforts i am certain you had nothing but the best of intentions in plotting against my coffee trade as well how can you speak to me thus it is you who trod upon my coffee tradeyou and your heretic friend miguel let out a laugh you may call yourself the injured person if you like but that will not change what is i have a great deal of power to effect changes you forget and when i bring this case before the council we will see how smug you look then and for what reason am i to stand before the maamad for making you look a fool or for refusing to be ruined by your scheme for conducting unseemly business with a gentile he announced you deployed that man joachim waagenaar intentionally to create a drop in the price of coffee i happen to know he is the very same dutchman you ruined by brokering for him and forcing upon him your foolish sugar scheme clearly he found it hard to get enough of you but i think you will find the maamad feels somewhat differently you have violated the law of amsterdam and so put your people at risk miguel studied paridos face he wanted to savor the moment as long as he could because it might be he knew the most satisfying of his life then knowing he could not wait too long he spoke when i am called before the maamad he began shall i mention that i only asked joachim to work with me after he came to me and confessed that you had attempted to force him into discovering the nature of my business arrangements you in other words deployed a gentile as a spy not even for maamad matters but in the hopes of ruining a fellow jew against whom you harbor resentment i wonder what the other parnassim will think of that information should i also mention that you conspired with nunes a merchant with whom i had placed an order and that you used your position as a parnass to force him into betraying me so you might prevail over me this should make for a very interesting session parido chewed upon his lower lip for a moment very well he said but miguel was not finished i might add that there is the matter of geertruid damhuis a dutchwoman you employed with the single purpose of ruining me how long was she your creature senhor the better part of a year i think geertruid damhuis parido repeated suddenly looking a bit more cheerful i heard something of this she was your partner in your schemes but then you betrayed her i merely did not allow her to ruin me what i have never fully understood however is why you needed joachim if you already had geertruid was she not telling you all was she hoping to turn this treachery into a little profit for herself and you could not live with the knowledge that you could not control your own creature parido let out a laugh you are correct about one thing i cannot bring you before the maamad you have won on that score i admit here between the two of us that i did ask that foul dutchman to find out information about you but you must know i had nothing to do with that whore you ruined as near as i can tell she was a perfectly honest slut who wanted nothing more than to aid you and you destroyed her you are a liar miguel said i dont think so there is one thing i do admire about you lienzo some men are cold in matters of business they harden their hearts against those they hurt but you are a man with a conscience and i know you will truly suffer for what you did to your honest partner miguel found geertruid in the three dirty dogs where she was so drunk that no one would sit with her one of the other patrons warned him to be careful she had already bit the cheek to the point of drawing blood of a man who had attempted to feel her bosoms but she had clearly drunk herself past the point of anger because when she saw miguel she made a sloppy effort to stand and then held out her arms as though ready to envelop her former partner its miguel lienzo she slurred the man who ruined me i had hoped to see you here and now you are here where i hoped to see you will you sit with me miguel sat himself down very carefully as though afraid the bench might break he looked across the table at geertruid who were you working for i must know i promise you ill take no action on the information i need to know for myself was it parido parido geertruid repeated i never worked for parido i would never even have heard of parido if it had not been for you she laughed and pointed at him i knew thats what you thought the moment you told me you had undone me i knew you thought i was paridos agent if i were paridos agent she explained i would have deserved to be crushed miguel swallowed hard he had hoped to hear something very different you tricked me into trusting you why because i wanted to be wealthy geertruid said slamming her hand upon the table and a respectable woman thats all i was not working for anyone i had no plan to destroy you i only wanted to go into business with a man of influence who would help me make my fortune and when you lost your money i stuck by you because i liked you i never meant to trick you all i am is a thief miguel im a thief but i am no villain a thief he repeated then you stole that money the three thousand guilders she shook her head and doing so let it drop so low that miguel feared she might bang it upon the table i borrowed that money from a moneylender a very nasty moneylender so nasty even the jews wont have him miguel closed his eyes alferonda he said yes he was the only man i could find who was willing to lend me what i needed he knew what i wanted it for and he knew who i was why did he not tell me so miguel demanded aloud he played the two of us against each other why would he do such a thing hes not a kind man she said sadly oh geertruid he took her hand why did you not tell me the truth how could you let me ruin you she let out a little laugh you know miguel sweet miguel i dont blame you at all what could you have done confronted me asked of my scheme you knew already i was a deceiver and you wished to make your money as best you could i cant blame you but i could not have told you the truth either for you would never have continued to trust me you feared that council of yours over a matter of merely doing business with a dutchwoman would you have convinced yourself that any good can come with doing business with a dutch outlaw particularly one such as me one such as you i must leave the city miguel i must leave tonight alferonda has been searching for me and he wont go easy with me there are tales of his wrath you know why should alferonda care can you not simply give him the money i transferred to your account i have repaid the three thousand i borrowed of you i owe him another eight hundred in interest eight hundred miguel blurted out does he know no shame he is a usurer she said sadly let me speak with him he is my friend and i am certain we can come to an understanding he neednt charge you so much interest as that we will reach a more reasonable fee and i will help you pay him she squeezed his hand poor sweet miguel you are too good to me i cant let you do that for you would be throwing away your money and nothing would be gained but your ruin alferonda may be your friend but he is not mine and he wont let his reputation suffer by a kindness and how good a friend is he deceiving you as he has done even if you could stay his hand there is the money i owe the agents in iberia they have my name not yours and they will come looking for geertruid damhuis in amsterdam if i stay it will be only a matter of time before i am undone i must leave tonight so i will give you no more than you deserve by telling you the truth at last there is more oh yes there is more through the fog of her drunkenness she managed a smile such as never failed to fell him you asked what i meant when i said a thief such as me ill now tell you she leaned in closer i am no ordinary thief you must understand i dont pick pockets or cut purses or break into shops youve wondered often about my journeys to the countryside and poor foolish man you have read all the tales and you have read them because i introduced you to them imp that i am miguel reminded himself to continue breathing what are you saying that you and hendrick he could not quite finish yes geertruid said quietly we are charming pieter and his goodwife mary as to which of us is which i cannot say she let out a laugh poor hendrick is more the fool than you im afraid but he always did as he was told and he let the world believe that he was behind pieters heroic robberies it hardly mattered i had come to believe that in this age of stories and adventures if we could make people believe in charming pieter as a hero no one would turn him in and the legend would only confound the efforts to catch him little did we know how well the plan would work i expected to hear stories of our adventures but i never expected to see these tales in print half the stories you read are false and the other half wild exaggerations but they have served us well where is hendrick now fled she sighed he is a silly man but not so silly as not to know what it means to be unable to pay a cruel usurer i have not seen him since the loss upon the exchange he was never at peace with my dealings with alferonda and my plans to make our fortune through trade he could not understand how it all worked and he thought it doomed i fear that any way this ended charming pieters adventures were destined to reach their conclusion how could i have done this to you miguel said he put his face in his hands it is my doing i put you at risk and that poor girl your brothers wifeplease tell her i am sorry to have had to frighten her she is to be my wife soon miguel said feeling somehow the need to be honest is she now well i cant say i understand the ways of the israelites but they are not mine to understand what is it that hannah saw she did not even know geertruid laughed she did not even know how very amusing she saw me speaking with alferonda and i was afraid that if you were to learn of it you would grow suspicious but she said pushing herself to her feet enough chatter senhor i must be on my way you are too drunk madam to leave town tonight let me take you home she laughed holding on to his arm for support oh miguel still trying to find your way to my bed i only want to see you safely shh she pressed a finger to his lips theres no need to tell stories not anymore i must go and it must be tonight and my being drunk shall only make things easier not harder yet she did not move do you remember senhor the night you tried to kiss me he thought about lying to pretend it had been no matter to him and he had not bothered to remember but he did not lie yes i remember i longed to kiss you back she said and more too i never let you not because i did not want to but because i knew you would be more pliable if i never gave you more than enough to whet your appetite a woman such as i am must know how to use her quim even if it means not using it let me take you home miguel said again no she said pushing herself off with unexpected sobriety i said i must go and so i must let us part quickly or well never part at all and so she left out the door and into the night without a lantern if ever a woman lived who could outwit the thieves and the night watch it was geertruid damhuis he remained still for a long time he simply stared into the distance until a pretty girl came over and asked him if he required anything wine he whispered a great deal of wine when he drank it when he had so much wine in him that he could no longer tell what was right and what was wrongthat was when he would go in search of alferonda from the factual and revealing memoirs of alonzo alferonda i had hardly thought that after miguel lienzos victory on the exchange all would be done with i had won parido had lost and the victory tasted sweet but there was still miguel i had trod upon him and he would not take it kindly i had thought to fool him when he came to see me to dazzle his eyes with tricks and illusions until he doubted that there even was such a man as alonzo alferonda let alone one who had used him ill but i had always liked miguel and i owed him a debt i had begun with no intention of hurting him or his friends but rather using him as an instrument that would facilitate what i wanted and at the same time allowing him to make a guilder or two there would have been no harm done surely if some lies were told if some coins were palmed and made to magically appear what wrong can there be in that all men love trickery and tricksters that is why halfstarving peasants surrender their hardgot wages when mountebanks and gypsies come through their towns all the world loves to be deceivedbut only when it consents to the deception i sat in my rooms one night reading the holy torahi speak the truth for the cherem had not diminished my love of learning one jotwhen there was a loud banging on the door below in a few moments my serving man old roland for despite the dutch fashions i like a manservant and will not allow a nation of cheese eaters to tell me whom to employ tapped upon the door to my closet and told me there was a very drunk hebrew of the portuguese kind come calling and when asked his business stated that it was to kill the man who lived here i carefully marked my place in the volume and closed it reverently by all means i said show the fellow in soon enough a besotted miguel lienzo stood before me teetering this way and that i asked roland to bring us some wine i doubted miguel wanted any more than he had already enjoyed but i could still hope this encounter might end with his falling asleep with the servant gone i offered my visitor a chair and told him i awaited his words he awkwardly lowered himself into the hard seat for in this room i only received visitors whom i did not wish to stay long why did you not tell me you lent money to geertruid damhuis he asked his words a thick mumble i lend to so many people i said i cannot be expected to keep track of every one this bit of obfuscation was not meant to trick him in fact im not sure what it was meant to accomplish i can say what it did do it angered him greatly damn you he shouted half rising from his chair if you play games i will kill you i began to believe him though he had no weapon in sight and i did not anticipate any great difficulty in eluding his drunken pursuit should things so degenerate nevertheless i held up my hand in a staying gesture and waited for him to settle back into his chair you are right i did not tell you because it suited me for you to think she was in league with parido you must know by now that i could not be more delighted that your scheme has burnt parido but the truth of it is i had more of a hand in this than you could have imagined miguel nodded as though recollecting something parido was invested in coffee before i decided to begin my venture wasnt he he was not the man who sought to undo my scheme i was the man who sought to undo his is that right yes i admitted parido entered the coffee trade a few months before you it was a bit of a trick keeping it from you but i had my man at the coffee tavern refuse to admit you if parido was there a simple precaution parido you understand had nothing so elaborate as your monopoly scheme in mind he only wanted to play in calls and puts and when you started buying up coffee as you did you threatened his investments the way you had done in whale oil miguel shook his head so you had geertruid lure me into the coffee trade for the single purpose of damaging parido and you then turned around and betrayed her i am flattered you think me so ingenious but my involvement was something less than that your madam damhuis discovered coffee on her own and enticed you into the trade because she thought you would make a good partner when i learned of your interest i admit i encouraged it because i knew it would be bad for parido and i fed you a hint here and there about how parido plotted against you but i did no more than that how is it that geertruid came to you for her loan i dont know if you are familiar with that womans story but you must know she is a thief and i am the man thieves come to when they need large sums i doubt she could have borrowed three thousand guilders from anyone else youll not see that money she has fled the city i shrugged having expected something of that sort well see i have agents in such places as she might go i have not given up hope on those guilders but if they are gone it is a price i am willing to pay for harming parido he has not only lost a great deal of money he looks like a fool before the community hell never again be elected to the maamad and his days of power are over is that not worth inconveniencing a thief like geertruid damhuis she is my friend he said sadly you could have told me what you knew you need only have told me all and i could have avoided all of this and what else would you have avoided had you known that paridos overtures of friendship were genuine that he had come to coffee first and that you threatened his investments would you have gone ahead would you still have sought to best him in that contest or would you have backed down i think we both know the truth miguel you are a schemer but not so much of a schemer as to do what needed to be done it did not need to be done he said softly it did i slammed my hand on the desk that wretch parido had me cast out of the community because he did not like me he used flimsy excuses to justify himself but he was no more than a petty despot who relished what little power he had to make himself feel great so what if he reached out to you the brother of a partner to make amends does that excuse the evil he has already done and the evil he would continue to perpetuate ive done our people a great service miguel by knocking him down and it hardly matters that geertruid who was my friend gets destroyed oh shes not destroyed miguel shes a thief and a trickstress i know the kind i am the kind and i can tell you she will always do well for herself she is a wily woman with yet an ample share of beauty this time next year shell be the wife of a burgher in antwerp or the mistress of an italian prince you neednt worry about her im the one who has lost three thousand guilders after all she might have repaid me some portion of it miguel merely shook his head youre angry about something else i suppose youve made some money youve extricated yourself from debt you have a tidy profit besides and you are the most popular merchant in the vlooyenburgat least for the moment but you are angry that you are not on your way to opulence as you had hoped he stared perhaps he was ashamed to admit that he was indeed angry not to have earned so much as he believed he might the two of you might have captured the coffee market in europe i said but i dont think so this plan of yours was too ambitious the east india company would never have allowed it i had every intention of rescuing you before you overreached yourself had i not done so you would have been destroyed again in a half years time instead you have done quite well you think because your scheme with geertruid damhuis failed that you can have nothing more to do with coffee nonsense you have made that commodity famous miguel and now the city looks to you there is still a great fortune to be made you wanted a trade that would put all your scheming to an end but instead you have one that presents only a beginning use it wisely and youll have your opulence in due time you had no right to trick me as you did i shrugged perhaps not but you are the better for it you have your money and i now hear you are to be married soon as well many congratulations to you and the beautiful bride you have said you wanted a wife and family and now you shall have those things because of me i may not have been your most honest friend but i have always been your best one miguel rose from his chair a man must make his own fortune not be played like a chess piece ill never forgive you he said given that he came to my home with the intention of killing me i considered never being forgiven a considerable victory someday youll forgive me i said and even thank me but he was already gonedown the stairs at a hurried pace that came just short of a tumble and off to find his own way to the door drunk as he was it took him a few minutes i heard some bottles break and a piece of furniture topple but that meant little to me once he was gone i had roland tell the girl annetje that she could come out of hiding she was much more beautiful now that she had me to take care of her i knew it was for the best that miguel not see her in my home for her radiant face gave unmistakable testimony that i was a superior lover and that was information from which his fragile feelings were best protected at this tender time miguel hardly knew the layout of his furniture and there were trunks of clothes and boxes of newly bought goods scattered about the rooms the knock came at his door early in the morning before the sun had only just burned off the dew and he sensed that his serving woman had already left for the morning milk and bread his head ached and the nagging sense of something terrible something he dare not recall haunted the outer reaches of his thoughts geertruid he had destroyed geertruid for nothingfor alferondas petty revenge against a man who had truly wanted to make things right and be miguels friend parido had been but a merchant looking to preserve his investments miguel had been the villain better to go back to sleep and think of it no more if only for a few hours the pounding at the door would not let him be he rolled out of his bedfor the first time since he moved in not relishing the comfort of a fullsized bed instead of one of those cupboard monstrositiesand quickly wrapped himself in a dressing coat and found a pair of wooden slippers the house was a maze of trunks and misplaced furniture and he tripped twice before reaching the back door in the kitchen at last he had made his way to the kitchen and opened the top portion of the door the pleasant odors of the early morningfish and beer and freshly baked breadburst in upon him so strongly his stomach turned forcibly and he had to close his eyes to keep from vomiting when he looked again there to greet him was the haggard face of hendrick he had lost his hat and his hair hung filthily around his face he had a cut just below his eye that had clotted nastily and blood smeared his shirt miguel somehow knew at once that the blood was not hendricks i havent the luxury of time he said so i wont make you ask me in what do you want he had begun his new life and he did not want to be seen having a conversation with one such as this and the distant memory of a conversation echoed on the fringes of his consciousness hadnt hendrick promised to kill miguel if he betrayed geertruid but it seemed hendrick had not come for murder ive come for my fifty guilders he said smoothing some dirt out of his mustache i dont understand you we had a contract you and i a deal you offered me the money and i took you up on it last night i found the fellow and i did the business joachim he had beaten up joachim but i never told you to carry on with that i merely asked you about it well its too late for quibbling back and forth arguing over this detail or that the deed is done and i need the money there you have it he let out a throaty half laugh that turned into a cough the fellow is beaten and id best leave town as quick as i can before the constables men catch up with me i wont give you a thing miguel said i never asked for this the violence that always lurked in hendrick now rose to the surface his face reddened and his eyes grew wide listen to me jew man youll give it to me or there will be more trouble than you reckoned on if they do catch up with me ill not hesitate to say you were the one to set me upon the task so you had better think about that and think about it quickly i know you dont want me to be seen here so lets just have this over with miguel knew it was well worth fifty guilders to make him disappear so he excused himself and found the money in metal presuming hendrick would not care for a banknote how badly did you hurt him he asked as he handed over the purse thats the thing hendrick said he patted at the cut on his face with his sleeve more than i intended i dont suppose he needed both eyes though did he one will do quite nicely miguel swallowed you took out an eye i didnt take it out hendrick corrected him it came out on its own these things happen from time to time and there isnt much point lamenting what cant be undone get out of here miguel said quietly he didnt know what was going on why i should just grab him and throw him down and kick him in his face he kept asking me why why whylike a little girl being fucked for the first time but i believe in honesty i told him to ask the jew man the jew man would tell him why since the jew man paid for it miguel closed his eyes and looked away after a momenttoo long a silence he thoughthe turned back to the wretch why would you do such a thing why did you tell him that because madame damhuis made me promise not to hurt you despite your treatment of her so i decided it was well enough i would not hurt you but i would have my own way with something and there it is get out of here miguel said again oh that ill have no trouble doing you can depend on it best to you jew man hendrick pretended to tip the hat he had lost and then took off in a happy skip along the canal side miguel stood at the door and watched him go and even after he had been long gone he stood by the door watching the space where he had disappeared later on he could not say how long he stood there in cheerless and nauseated silence he finally looked behind him and saw his servant woman cooking in the kitchen ignoring him out of fear and confusion pretending that men always stood by the open door in their bedclothes staring out into the morning later that day he looked up and saw himself doing business on the exchange and wondered how he had come to be there what trades he had made already and if in such a state he traded with more prudence than when his wits were about him how could he think of business his friend geertruid ruined and exiled forever joachim beaten and perhaps in danger of dying his brother ruined and humiliated he waited for the watch to come and question him about his role in the beating but they never came when he went in search of joachim a few days later to bring him gifts to make certain he had the best surgeon he found that he and his wife had left town scurrying away with their share of the coffee scheme money before miguel could as he surely now suspected find some way of taking it back he had left believing as always that these gestures of friendship were but a prelude to treachery the thought weighed him down a dourness that no triumph on the exchange could extinguish but in a few weeks time when hannah was free of daniel he took her for his wife and vowed he would be dour no more in the comfort of married life he found it easy to forget joachim and geertruid by turns and to once more take pleasure in his business he put a hand to his temple alferonda had surely been right about one thing it would be madness for him to let coffee go already buoyed by the fame of miguels duel against parido on the exchange the drinks fame had begun to spread already he saw jittery merchants animated by the wondrous fruit shouting out their business maniacally at taverns all over the city traders had begun to demand the brew in place of beer or wine miguel might make his fortune yet though hannah found after the baby was born she had no time to learn to read as she had planned she did not complain not even in her heart miguel knew she had wanted a girl but she loved the boy samuel all the same they discussed the problem of hiding from daniel that the boy was his but there was no way to undo what had been done and miguel loved the boy as though he were his own but later when they had their second son whom they named for his true father miguel found himself favoring this child at times it sat ill with him that he repeated the arbitrary preferences with which he found such fault in his own father but what could he do some things he had come to conclude were merely in a persons nature historical note if business and commerce in the dutch golden age conjure up any image for most people today it is that of the trade in paintings which were regarded mostly as aesthetically pleasing commodities rather than objects of art or of the tulipomania the crazed tulip market of the s which was so recently mirrored in our own dotcom bubble i was drawn to business in the period however because of its sheer innovation if it would be overstating the case to say that business as we know it came into being in the netherlands in the seventeenth century it would be fair to propose that modern business saw its origins in that time and place the dutch developed new methods of tradethe joint stock company commodities markets futures stocks and other forms of speculative tradingmostly because they had to coming out of a bitter and protracted war of independence against spain the dutch of the seventeenth century found themselves with very little of any particular value other than their business sense and with this commercial drive they transformed their nation into one of the most powerful in europe i was also drawn to the period because of the unusual tolerance of the dutch people having vanquished the catholic spanish they offered catholics an unusual amount of freedom in comparison with other protestant countries jews also found that many cities in the united provinces offered freedoms unimaginable in the rest of europe the spanish and portuguese jews who settled in amsterdam found their international connections prized by local businessmen i began this novel with the idea that i would write about an attempt to control a commodity just as it was emerging i briefly flirted with the idea of making the novel about chocolate in part because the seventeenthcentury documents about chocolate are much more colorful than those concerning coffee but coffee and business go so naturally that the switch was inevitable as i suggest in the novel coffee was only just catching on in europe in the middle years of the seventeenth century by the end of the century it would be well established as a vital part of public culture in nearly every major capital on the continent my efforts to recreate the world of the dutch the dutch jews and the coffee trade involved a great deal of
