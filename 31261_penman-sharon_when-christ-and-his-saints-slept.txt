sharon kay penman when christ and his saints slept prologue chartres cathedral france january stephen was never to forget his fifth birthday for that was the day he lost his father in actual fact that wasnt precisely so but childhood memories are not woven from facts alone and that was how he would remember it hed come with his parents and two elder brothers to this great church of the blessed mary to hear a bishop preach about the crusade he didnt know who the bishop was but his sermon was a long dull one and stephen had fidgeted and squirmed through most of it for he was safely out of his mothers reach she had no patience with childhood mischief no patience with mischief of any kind remember who you are was her favorite maternal rebuke and her older children had soon learned to disregard that warning at their peril but it puzzled stephen why would he forget he knew very well who he was stephen of blois son and namesake of the count of blois and the lady adela daughter of william the bastard king of england and duke of normandy stephen had never met his celebrated grandfather but he knew hed been a great man his mother often said so stephen knew about the crusade too for people talked about it all the time his father had taken the cross gone off to free the holy land from the infidel stephen was still in his cradle then and two when his father came back there was something shameful about his return stephen did not understand why though for he was convinced his father could do no wrong not the man who laughed so often and winked at minor misdeeds and had promised him a white pony for this longawaited fifth birthday stephen had already picked out a namesnowballso sure he was that his father would not forget that the pony would be waiting for them back at the castle stephen had hoped theyd be returning there once the mass was done but instead they lingered out in the cloisters with the bishop discussing the new army of crusaders that was making ready to join its christian brethren in the holy land ignored by the adults bored and restless stephen soon slipped back into the cathedral within all was shadowed and still with the candles quenched and the parishioners gone the church seemed unfamiliar to stephen like a vast dark cave sunblinded he tripped over a prayer cushion and sprawled onto the tiled floor but he was not daunted by a scraped knee scrambled up and groped his way down the nave toward the choir he was curious to get a better look at the sancta camisia draped over a reliquary upon the high altar up close though it was a disappointment just a faded chemise frayed and wrinkled hed expected something fancier mayhap cloth of gold or spangled silk for this shabby garment was among the most revered relics in christendom said to have been worn by the blessed lady mary as she gave birth to the holy christ child stephens eldest brother will had once dared to ask how it could have survived so many centuries and their mother had slapped him across the mouth for such blasphemy carefully wiping his hand on his tunic stephen was reaching out to touch the sancta camisia when the door opened suddenly spilling sunlight into the nave stephen ducked down behind the high altar willing these intruders to go away instead the footsteps came nearer when he peeped around the altar cloth he gasped in dismay it would be bad enough to be caught by a priest but this was far worse he feared his mothers wrath more than the anger of priests and bishops even more than gods for he was in heaven and mama was right here in chartres adela stopped before she reached the high altar but she was still so close that stephen could almost have touched her skirts the second set of footsteps was heavier and familiar some of stephens anxiety began to abate now that his father was here too he still hoped to escape detection though for discipline was his mothers province i cannot believe you hold my life so cheaply adela stephen knew his parents had been quarreling for days but his father did not sound angry now to stephen he sounded tired and even sad i am your wife stephen of course i value your life but i value your honour toomore than you do i fear that is not fair when the crusade was first preached i took the cross more to please you than god if truth be told and now you would have me go back are you that eager to be a widow i am not sending you back to die stephen but to redeem your honour you owe your sons that and you owe me that you must fulfill your crusaders vow if not youll live out all your days haunted by the shame of antioch christ jesus womanive told you again and again why i left the siege i was ailing and disheartened and sickened by all the needless killing how can you say that what greater glory could there be than to die for the liberation of jerusalem jerusalem has been liberated adela more than a year ago yes but you were not there to see it were you no you were back at chartres taking your ease whilst christians were being slain by enemies of the true faith there was silence after that lasting so long that the little boy risked a covert glance over the top of the high altar his parents were standing several feet away looking at each other youve shared my bed for nigh on twenty years adela you know every scar my body bears battle scars all of them you ought to have been the last one to doubt my courage instead you were amongst the first so be it then i will do what you demand of me i will take the cross again go back to that accursed land and make you proud the count said so tonelessly that his son shivered stephen did not hear his mothers response for hed thrust his fist into his mouth biting down on his thumb his vision blurred as he sought to blink back tears footsteps were receding a door clanging shut getting to his feet stephen left the shelter of the high altar only to find himself facetoface with his father the count of blois was clearly taken aback he caught his breath on an oath was starting to frown when stephen whispered do not go away papa ah lad and then stephen was swept up in his fathers arms being held in a close embrace as he dried his tears on the counts soft wool mantle why do you have to go papa hed once asked his father what the holy land was like and still remembered the terse reply a hellish place you do not want to go back he said so stay here please do not go away i have no choice his father rarely called stephen by his given name preferring lad or sprout or a playful imp he did now though saying stephen quietly sounding sad again id hoped to wait until you were olderwhen i was in the holy land i made a mistake it did not seem so at the time it was though the greatest mistake of my life wed been besieging antioch for nigh on eight months id been taken ill with fever had withdrawn to nearby alexandretta the day after i left our forces captured the city but then a large saracen army arrived and trapped them within antioch they seemed doomed for certes and iwell i chose to go home back to blois he paused ruffling stephens hair the same tawny shade as his own before resuming reluctantly but the crusaders besieged in antioch were saved by a miracle you see lad they found an ancient lance in one of antiochs churches supposedly revealed in a vision from god whether this was truly the holy lance that had pierced our lord christ on the cross or not what matters is that men believed it to be so they marched out of antioch to confront the saracen army and against all odds won a great victory so antioch was spared and ii was shamed before all of christendom what i saw as common sense seen by others as cowardice he paused again and then set the boy back on his feet i know you do not understand what i am telling you lad but yes i do stephen insisted although all he truly understood was that his father was going away and for a long time papapromise me he said promise me youll come back soon and he took comfort when his father readily promised him that he would for he was too young to be troubled by the softly added words god willing stephen convinced himself that his father would come back when his mothers new baby was born for he knew grown people made much ado about babies but his brother was born and christened henry and his father did not come that summer henry was stricken with croup stephen was fond of henry hed been delighted to have a brother younger than he was although he worried about henrys cough it also occurred to him that the babys illness would likely bring their father home but it was not to be henry got better their father did not return stephens faith did not falter though it would be christmas for certes it was not his sixth birthday then again he was disappointed and then at easter they got the letter stephen had been awaiting every day for the past thirteen months the letter that said his father was finally coming home july was hot and dry in that year of gods grace august brought no relief the sky over chartres was a glazed brittle blue and the roads leading into the city were clogged with pilgrims and choked with dust it was midmorning almost time for dinner stephen had gone down to the stables to see a recently whelped litter of greyhounds playing with the puppies raised his spirits somewhat but he was still perturbed by his mothers revelation that she meant to send him to england to live at the court of the king seeing his distress shed impatiently assured him that he would not be going for a while yet not until he was older but he must set his mind to it that his future lay in england his elder two brothers would inherit their fathers titles his little brother henry would be pledged to the church and he stephen would go to her brother henry the english king stephen did not want to go so far away to live with strangers he let a puppy lick his hand reminding himself that his father would be back soon surely by summers end and papa would not let him be sent away he felt better then and dropped to his knees in the straw beside the squirming balls of brindle and fawn fur he lost all track of time and was still in the stables when his mother came looking for him later that afternoon stephen jumped to his feet in alarm for hed forgotten all about dinner ii am sorry mama he stammered but she did not seem to hear his flustered apology even in that dimmed light he saw how pale she was her hands were clasped together so tightly that her rings were being driven into her flesh and her mouth was thinned and tautly set as if to keep secrets from escaping mama he said uneasily mama gods will is not always to be understood she said abruptly but it must be accepted so it is now stephen a letter has come from the holy land your lord father is dead stephen stared at her his eyes flickering from her face to the coral rosary entwined around her clutching fingers butbut papa was coming home he said he promised adela blinked rapidly looked away all of her sons had gotten their fathers fair coloring but only stephen had been blessedor cursedwith his obliging generous nature one utterly lacking in rancor or guile but lacking too in the steely selfdiscipline and singleminded tenacity that had enabled her father to conquer and then rule two turbulent domains england and normandy your fathers departure for home was delayed by bad weather she said and managed to steady both her voice and her resolve by sheer force of will for she must not show weakness now not before the child he was still at jaffa when king baldwin of jerusalem sought his aid in laying siege to ramleh but they were greatly outnumbered baldwin was one of the few to escape your fatherhe held fast and was slain stephens mouth had begun to quiver his eyes to fill with tears and adela reached out swiftly pulling him toward her no stephen she said you must not weep he died a noble proud death in the service of almighty god and a christian king do not grieve for him lad be thankful that he has atoned for his past sins and gained by his crusaders death the surety of salvation life everlasting in the kingdom of heaven but it was your fault papa did not want to go and you made him if not for you he would not be dead and gone away the words were struggling to break free burning stephens throat too hot to hold back but he must for those were words he dared not say aloud to stop himself he bit down on his tongue until he tasted blood then stood rigid and mute in his mothers embrace as she talked to him of honour and pride and christian duty after a time she grazed his cheek with one of her rare kisses and withdrew stephen retreated into the shadows into an empty stall flinging himself down into the matted trampled straw he wept for his father whod died at ramleh alone and far from home barfleur normandy november the ship strained at its moorings like a horse eager to run berold stopped so abruptly that he almost collided with a passing sailor for in all of his sixteen years hed never seen a sight so entrancing the esneque seemed huge to him at least eighty feet long with a towering mast and a square sail striped in vertical bands of yellow and scarlet the hull was as sleek as a swan and just as white and brightly painted shields hung over the gunwales protecting the oarsmen from flying spray above the mast flew several streaming pennants and a silver and red banner of st george the harbor resembled a floating forest so many masts were swaying and bobbing on the rising tide more than twenty ships were taking on cargo and passengers for the royal fleet of the english king henry first of that name since the conquest was making ready to sail but berold had eyes only for the white ship smitten are you lad startled berold spun around found himself looking into eyes narrowed and creased from searching out distant horizons and squinting up at the sun the sailors smile was toothless but friendly for hed recognized a kindred soul in this gangling youngster swaddled in a bedraggled sheepskin cloak not that i blame you for shes a ripe beauty for certes a seaworthy siren if ever i saw one berold was quick to return the sailors smile that she is the talk in the tavern was all of the white ship wait till i tell my brother that i saw the most celebrated ship in the english kings fleet did you hear how her master came to the king his father he said had taken the kings father to england when he sailed to claim a crown in gods year he begged for the honour of conveying the king as his father had done king henry had already engaged a ship but he was moved by the mans appeal and agreed to let his son lord william sail on the white ship when word got out all the other young lordlings clamored to sail on her too theredown on the quayyou can see them preening and strutting like so many peacocks the dark one is the earl of chester and yonder is the lord richard one of the kings bastards and the youth in the red mantle is said to be a kinsman of the german emperor the kings favorite nephew the lord stephen is supposed to sail on her too but i do not see him yethes one whod be late for his own wake doubtless snug in some wantons bed ive seen the lord stephen almost as near to me as you are now berold interrupted for he did not want the sailor to think he was an ignorant country churl ive dwelled in rouen for nigh on six months for my uncle has a butchers shop and is teaching me his trade twice did i see the king ride through the city streets with lord stephen at his side the people liked stephen well for he always had an eye for a pretty lass and he was openhanded with his almsgiving all the way from rouen eh you are the welltraveled one the sailor murmured and was amused to see that the boy took his goodnatured gibe as gospel truth indeed it was not a trek for the faint of heart berold agreed proudly i wore out two pairs of shoes on the road got lost in the fog and was nearly run down by a cart in bayeux but i had to get to barfleur for i must book passage to england i have aa quest to fulfill that caught the sailors interest butchers lads were not likely candidates for pilgrimages or perilous sea voyages a quest did you swear a holy oath then berold nodded solemnly my family has long been split asunder ever since my brother gerard quarreled with our father who cursed him for his willfulness and cast him out like cain for five winters we knew not whether he still lived but then a neighbors seafaring son came to us at michaelmas said hed seen gerard in an english town called london it was the answer to our heartfelt prayers for my father has been ailing since the summer suffering from a gnawing pain in his vitals and he yearns to make peace with his firstborn ere he dies i swore to my father and to the father of all that id seek out gerard fetch him home the sailor could not help admiring the boys pluck but he suspected that berolds mission was one doomed to failure i wish you well lad to tell you true though youre not likely to find passage this day the kings ships are already crowded with his lords his soldiers and servants theyll be taking aboard none but their own i know berold admitted but god directed me to a tavern where i met ivothats him over there the one with the eyepatch we got to talking and when he learned of my plight he offered to help he is cousin to a helmsman on one of the kings ships and his cousin will get me aboard if i make it worth his while that must be him coming now so id best be off with a cheerful wave he started across the street toward his newfound friends followed by the sailors hearty go with god lad are you mauger ivos cousin ignored berolds smile merely grunted as ivo made the introductions he was a bigboned man pockmarked and dour and berold was grateful that he had the amiable ivo to act as gobetween but ivo did not seem as affable as he had been in the tavern come on he said brusquely berold had to hasten to keep pace dodging passersby and mangy scavenging dogs a young prostitute plucked at his sleeve but he kept on going for she was dirty and very drunk although barfleur was exciting it was unsettling too for it seemed that all hed heard about the sinfulness of seaports was true the streets were crowded with quarrelsome swaggering youths the taverns were full and even to berolds innocent eye there was a surfeit of whores beggars peddlers and pickpockets he was indeed fortunate to have found ivo in this den of thieves and wantons they were heading away from the harbor berold took one last lingering look at the white ship then followed ivo into the shadows of a narrow garbagestrewn alley hed assumed they were taking a shortcut but the alley was a dead end in such close quarters the stench of urine was overwhelming and he started to back out saying politely ill wait whilst you piss but before he could retreat a huge hand slammed into the side of his head and he lurched forward falling to his knees his shocked cry was cut off as mauger slipped a thin noose around his neck and suddenly the most precious commodity in his world was air as berold choked and gasped and tore frantically at the thong ivo leaned over him in his upraised fist an object dark and flat it was the last thing berold saw he was never to know how long he had been unconscious at first he was aware only of pain his head was throbbing and when he tried to rise he doubled over vomiting up his dinner groaning he reached for a broken broom handle used it for support as he dragged himself upright only then did he think of the money he carried in a pouch around his neck the money meant to pay his passage to england to bring his brother home he groped for it with trembling fingers continued to fumble urgently within his tunic long after hed realized the pouch was gone the theft of his fathers money was for berold a catastrophe of such magnitude that he was utterly unable to deal with it what was he to do blessed lady how could this happen hed never be able to go home again never how could he face his family after failing so shamefully papa would not die at peace gerard would never be forgiven and it was his fault god curse him all his fault by the time he staggered back into the street he was so tearblinded that he never saw the horsesnot until he reeled out in front of them fortunately the lead rider was a skilled horseman he swerved with seconds to spare so close had berold come to disaster though that the stallions haunches brushed his shoulder sent him sprawling into the muddied street you besotted fool i ought to wring your wretched neck berold shrank back from this new assault made mute by his fear these men whod almost trampled him were lords their fine clothing and swords proclaimed them to be men of rank men who could strike down a butchers apprentice as they would a stray dog the angriest of them was already dismounting and berold shuddered bracing himself for a beatingor worse use the eyes god gave you adam the lads not drunk hes hurt the man called adam was glaring down contemptuously at the cowering boy a few more bruises would do him no harm my lord might teach him to look where he is going next time but hed unclenched his fists coming to a reluctant halt astounded by the reprieve berold scrambled hastily to his feet as his defender dismounted but he was as wobbly as a newborn colt and would have fallen had the man not grabbed his arm pulling him toward the shelter of a mounting block you seem bound and determined to get yourself run over lad sit catch your breath whilst i look at that bloody gash of yours ahnot so bad you must have a hard head were you set upon by thieves berold nodded miserably they took all my money and now my father will die he got no further to his shame he began to sob adam grimaced in disgust theyd already wasted time enough on this paltry knave it was truly fortunate that his lord showed such boldness on the battlefield lest men wonder at his womanlike softheartedness but now that the dolt had bestirred his lords curiosity theyd likely be stuck here till sunset listening to this fools tale of woe just as he feared the boys cryptic remark was bait his lord could not resist youd best tell me what happened he said and as adam fumed berold did so he was fast losing touch with reality why should one so highborn pay any heed to him that this was a great lord berold did not doubt he had never seen anyone so elegant shoulderlength flaxen hair that was so shiny and clean no lice would dare to nest in it a neatly trimmed beard and a smile that showed white healthy teeth not a one broken off or rotted a brightblue mantle that looked softer than any wool ever spun luxuriously lined with grey fox fur cowhide boots dyed to match laced all the way to the knee a hat adorned with a darkred jewel worn at his left hip as lightly as a feather a sword berold doubted he could even lift he could not begin to imagine what life must be like for this handsome young lord for there was no earthly bridge between their worlds and yet there was an odd sense of familiarity about his saviour as if their paths had crossed ere this even as berold explained haltingly about his father and lost brother and ivos foul treachery he found himself straining to remember when he did he was so stunned that he forgot all else blurting out in one great gasp you are the kings nephew you are the lord stephen stephen acknowledged his identity with a smile aware of the impatient muttering of his men but feeling a flicker of pity for this luckless butchers lad scared and grassgreen and far from home now he said what can we do about you berold the boy was looking up at him like a lost puppy eyes filled with silent pleading forlorn hope stephen studied him for a moment more and then shrugged why not tell me he said how would you like to sail to england on the white ship stephen had no liking for ships did not know any man of sense who did who would willingly seek out the triple perils of storms shipwrecks and sea monsters he was fascinated nonetheless by the sight that met his eyes the english kings fleet riding at anchor in barfleur harbor they were very like the ships that had carried his grandfather william the bastard on his invasion of england more than fifty years past but stephen neither knew nor cared about that like most people he lived for the moment had no interest in any history not his own but he enjoyed pageantry was amused by chaos and relished turmoilall of which he found in full measure on this thursday of st catherine in barfleur harbor up and down the beach small boats were being launched ferrying passengers out to the waiting ships only those fortunate enough to be traveling on the white ship or the english kings vessel were spared that wet rough ride and undignified hazardous boarding they had just to venture out onto the quay then cross a gangplank to the safety of their ship stephen was standing now on that same quay wanting to bid his uncle godspeed before they sailed so far hed looked in vain for the stout formidable figure of the king as he was in no hurry he was content to loiter there on the pier bantering with acquaintances and passersby but his nonchalance camouflaged a soldiers sharp eye and he alone noticed the small boy tottering toward the far end of the quay shoving aside the people in his path he darted forward snatching up the child just before he reached the wharfs edge the little boy let out a yowl of protest it subsided though as soon as he recognized stephen for ranulf was a sunnynatured child given to mischief but not tantrums stephen had concluded that ranulf must take after his mother for not even king henrys greatest admirers ever claimed he had an amiable temperament well look what i caught what sort of queer fish could this be ranulf was too young to comprehend the joke for he was barely past his second birthday nor did he fully understand his kinship to stephen he knew only that stephen was always kind to him that stephen was fun and he squealed happily now as his cousin swung him high up into the air more he urged more but stephen insisted upon lowering him back onto the quay for hed seen the women hastening toward them ranulf angharad reached them first with the whitefaced nurse just a step behind catching her son in a close embrace she held him until he started to squirm then turned upon stephen a torrent of gratitude laughing he held up his hand to stem the tide lady angharad you do me too much credit the lad was in no real danger even if he had taken a tumble into the water wed have fished him out quick enough he was not surprised though that his assurances counted for naught hed never known a more doting mother than his uncles young welsh mistress stephen treated all women with courtesy felt protective toward most of them but angharad in particular had always stirred his sense of chivalry he knew little of her past only that shed been brought back by his uncle from one of his campaigns in wales she couldnt have been much more than fifteen at the time and he sometimes wondered how shed felt about being claimed as a prize of war by an enemy more than thirty years her senior stephen had been quite young himself then and had only a few hazy memories of a timid country lass with nary a word to say for herself downswept lashes and sidelong glances and a shyness that served as her shield but in the six years that shed been at henrys court shed learned to speak french adopted norman fashions and borne henry two children a stillborn son and ranulf stephen knew that most people would envy angharad not pity her for her life held comforts undreamedof in wales the kings concubine would never go hungry never lack for warm clothes or a soft bed as tightfisted as henry was he looked after his own freely acknowledging all his bastardborn children he was said to have sired at least twenty offspring out of wedlock and had made brilliant marriages for many of them stephen did not doubt ranulf was fortunate indeed that his mother had been fair enough to catch a kings eye whether that was true or not for angharad too he had no way of knowing hoisting ranulf up onto his shoulders stephen escorted angharad and the nurse across the gangplank found for them a space under the canvas tent and wished them a safe and speedy journey returning to the quay he was hailed by a husky female voice stephen you fool my husband will be here any moment and when he finds you lusting after me like this hell slay us both stephen bit back a grin if ever there were a woman worth dying for it would be you my dearestdearestno do not tell me clemence norosamund that earned him a sharp poke in the ribs swine she laughed and he reached out gave her a hug for they were kin and could take such liberties without giving rise to gossip they were not really related though not by blood it was amabels husband robert who was stephens cousin while king henry provided well for his illegitimate children he preferred not to do so out of his own coffers for robert his firstborn son hed found amabel fitz hamon daughter of the lord of creully a rich heiress whod brought robert the lordship of glamorgan the vast honour of gloucester stephen had recently heard that the king meant to bestow upon robert too the earldom of gloucester his was not a jealous nature but he did begrudge robert so much good fortune no man so selfrighteous he thought deserved an earldom and amabel and a kings favor too so amabel said linking her arm in his what sort of trouble have you been up to i heard you ran down some poor soul in the street this afternoon stephen shook his head in mock regret never give credence to rumors love as it happens i was being a good samaritan and he related for her then his rescue of berold the hapless butchers lad when he was done she clapped her hands and called him st stephen but her brown eyes were alight with admiration a look stephen liked very much indeed not that he expected anything to come of it amabel was a flirt but she was also a devoted wife like all marriages hers had been an arranged union one that had proved to be surprisingly successful for they were an odd match she and robert theirs the attraction of utter opposites amabel as lively and playful and outgoing as robert was deliberate and staid and brooding theyd been wed for thirteen years were the parents of several sons and stephen well knew that for all her teasing and languid looks amabel would never stray from roberts bed he was content too to have it so for a dalliance with a married woman was no small sin he saw no reason though why he and amabel should not play the more innocent of lovers games and they were laughing together with obvious enjoyment when robert came upon them stephen knew that many a husband would have resented such familiarity he knew too that robert would notand liked him none the better for his lack of jealousy such petty emotions were beneath robert the pure he thought and then felt a twinge of remorse for he was not usually so uncharitable but there was no denying it robert had always been a bone in his throat although they were first cousins the two men were as unlike in appearance as they were in character stephen tall and fair robert several inches shorter far less outgoing with brown hair and eyes a quick cool smile he was the older of the two thirty years to stephens twentyfour but people often assumed the age gap was greater than that for roberts was the dignity of a man settled and sedate one long past the wayward urges and mad impulses of youth he was a man of honourstephen would concede thata man of courage loyal and steadfast but he was not a boon companion not one to visit the taverns and bawdyhouses with stephen liked to joke that not even god would dare to call him rob and would have been truly amazed had he known that in the intimacy of roberts marriage bed he was amabels sweet robin robert had impeccable manners he believed all men were deserving of courtesy he made no attempt though to feign warmth as he greeted stephen for he drew a clear distinction between civility and hypocrisy but stephen did not even notice hed forgotten all about robert as soon as he recognized the girl at roberts side to stephen matilda de boulogne was living proof that small packages could hold intriguing surprises for this little slip of a lass barely coming up to his chest so slight and fair and fragile she put him in mind of a delicate white violetone that could be bruised by rough handling or chilled by a cold breathbore in her veins the royal blood of kings her mother was a scots princess and the sister of king henrys dead queen her father was the count of boulogne two of her uncles successive kings of jerusalem she herself was a great heiress this conventbred innocent would bring to her husband not only the county and crown of boulogne but vast estates as well in the south of england she blushed prettily as stephen kissed her hand and as he gazed down into irisblue eyes he was not thinking only of those fertile fields and prosperous manors in kent and boulogne amabel had known for some time that matilda was smitten with stephen and she was not surprised in the least for few young girls were not susceptible to high spirits good looks and gallantry robert now saw it too although with none of his wifes benevolent approval he supposed it was only to be expected that a fifteenyearold virgin maiden would not have the wisdom to tell gilt from true gold but women worldly enough to know better made the same foolish mistake and it baffled him that it should be so it was not that he wished stephen ill he did not nor did he deny that stephen had courage good humor and a giving heart admirable qualities for certes but robert did not think stephen was reliable and for robert that was one of the most damning judgments he could pass upon another man well id best get back to the white ship reaching again for matildas hand stephen raised it to his mouth god keep you lady matilda till the morrow at southampton oh it was an involuntary cry and a revealing one you are not coming with us matildas disappointment was keen enough to embolden her id hoped she confided that you would make the journey on our ship i have ever hated the sea but i would not be so afraid if you were there to laugh at my fears to make me laugh too her lashes fluttered up just long enough to give stephen one look of intense heartfelt entreaty then swept down shadowing her cheeks like feathery golden fans amabel grinned coming from such an innocent that was not badly done at all robert glanced at his wife but refrained from commenting stephen was momentarily caught off balance not sure what to say he really did want to sail on the white ship had been laying wagers with friends that it would be the first ship into southampton harbor but he found himself staring at matildas long fair lashes was that shine behind them the glint of tears white ship i never heard of it he said and discovered then that any ship was well lost for the sake of her smile thomas fitz stephen the proud master of the white ship was not pleased to learn that stephen had defected to the kings vessel for the more lords of rank aboard the greater his prestige but he had no time to brood about stephens change of plans for the kings son had finally arrived the lord william was a prideful cocky youth of seventeen whod inherited his fathers stocky frame black hair and ironedged will he did not have henrys iceblooded control and vaunted patience though and soon grew restless abandoning the ship for the more convivial pleasures of the nearest quayside tavern but before he departed he won over the crew by breaking out three of the casks of cargo wine ordering them shared between passengers and sailors alike most of the cargo had already been loaded huge wine casks and heavy padlocked coffer chests said to contain the kings treasure they were now secured in the center of the ship covered with canvas a large tarpaulin tent was being set up near the bow so the highborn passengers could be shelteredsomewhatfrom the cold and flying spray when berold had first come aboard hed been awed by the spaciousness of the ship it was filling up fast though hed heard in the tavern that there were fifty oarsmen on the white ship but his counting skills were rudimentary at best and he could only guess at the number of passengers milling about at least two hundred he reckoned mayhap many more berold had been dismayed to learn that stephen would not be sailing with them with stephen aboard hed have felt safe would have feared neither storms nor prowling channel pirates not even the disdain of these highborn passengers with stephen not there to speak up for him what if one of the lords ordered him off the ship hed found for himself an outoftheway corner at the stern near the steering oar and drawing his knees up to his chin he pulled his cloak close tried to make himself as inconspicuous as possible he knew though that his very appearance marked him out as an intruder in their midst the drab grey of his homespun tunicneither bleached nor dyedcontrasted starkly with the vivid blues and scarlets and greens swirling around him and while he was grateful for the warmth of his sheepskin cloak he saw the scornful smiles it attracted for the wool was on the outside a style worn only by rustics the poor and baseborn but when his fears finally came to pass when a knight objected belligerently to the presence of this meagre whelp the lord richard fitz roy waved the man aside with a quip about one of lord stephens strays berold closed his eyes in thankfulness then blessed the lord stephen again for still casting a protective shadow sliding his hand under his cloak he squeezed the leather pouch hidden in his tunic his secret talisman stephens farewell generosity the coins clinked reassuringly as he touched them settling back against the gunwale he at last felt free to enjoy his astonishing good fortune sailing to england on the kings newest fastest ship amongst these great and powerful lords and their ladies what stories he would have to tell gerard he began to eavesdrop seeking to catch snatches of conversation for he wanted to identify as many as possible of his celebrated shipmates richard fitz roy looked to be in his early twenties he was said to be well loved by his father the king whod recently betrothed him to a norman heiress berold wondered if she was one of the women sailing with them wondered too if the lord williams young wife was aboard he was utterly fascinated by the female passengers for never had he been in such close proximity to ladies of rank he counted at least fifteen of these alluring beings all of them clean clad in rich vibrant colors and whenever one of them passed nearby there wafted to him on the damp salt air the fragrances of summer their gowns were concealed under long surcotes and wool mantles but they wore no hoods despite the november chill just delicate veils held in place by jeweled circlets their hair swinging down in long braids often adorned with ribbons one carried the smallest dog berold had ever seen and its ears too sported jaunty red ribbons berold was bewitched by each and every one of them these ladies of the white ship but above all by the lady mahault countess of perche and the lady lucia countess of chester they were both handsome young women mahault was slim and dark while lucias blonde plaits gleamed like braided sunlight against the emerald of her mantle reaching almost to her knees berold could not take his eyes off them once he learned who they were for mahault was one of king henrys natural daughters and lucia was his niece stephens sister all day the sun had shone fitfully with a pallid winter warmth as if to compensate for that it flamed out in a spectacular fusion of crimson and gold and purple the last traces of light were fading along the horizon when berold saw a lantern suddenly flare on the kings ship as the lamp was hoisted to the masthead a trumpet fanfare echoed across the dark waters of the bay the creaking of windlasses sounded raising anchors and the cry went up to unfurl the sails the royal fleet of henry i king of england and duke of normandy was getting under way but the white ship remained at its moorings for lord william and the earl of chester and a number of the young lords were still ashore sounds of loud laughter floated out from the tavern sounds so cheerful and beguiling that others were tempted to join the revelries few men faced a sea voyage without some trepidation and as the night sky darkened more and more of them discovered how easy it was to drown their qualms in a free flow of wine the crew having been given access to the royal wine casks were quite goodhumored about the delay only the ships master was vexed by their failure to sail with the tide but when he ventured ashore to complain he learned that a ship captains authority did not carry much clout with a youth who would one day rule all england and normandy by the time the white ship was finally ready to sail it was full dark and bitter cold the waiting had been hard on berold hed not even had the solace of wine as the other passengers did for hed not dared to join in the crews carousing and he was one of the few people on board who was still sober when the ships master gave the command to cast off a small crowd had gathered to watch their departure and was pleasantly scandalized when the young lords leaning precariously over the gunwales jeered and mocked the priests whod come to offer a blessing for they that go down to the sea in ships as the spectators gasped and the priests angrily denounced their impiety the anchor was raised the shrouds were tightened the sails were unfurled and the white ship slowly moved away from the quay out into the blackness of the harbor the night was clear the sky adrift in stars the moon was on the wane casting a wavering silvery gleam upon the cresting waves the ship rode low in the water and berold was unnerved to realize the freeboard was only three feet or so above the surface of the bay he was already feeling queasy and whispered a quick plea to st elmo who was said to pity those poor souls stricken with seasickness hed heard that depending upon the wind and tides a crossing from barfleur to southampton might take a day twelve hours lay ahead then the longest twelve hours of his life berold might have been comforted had he known that his anxiety was shared by most of the highborn passengers including the kings son william had crossed the channel more times than he could remember but his body always reacted as if each voyage were his first time on shipboard he had so many miserable memories of seasick suffering that he had only to look upon a ship to experience a queasy pang this was one reason why hed gotten so drunk in the hope that wine might settle his treacherous stomach keep him from making a fool of himself for at seventeen there are few greater fears than the dread of public humiliation that others too were often stricken with the same undignified malaise consoled him not at all for he was englands future king and must not give in to the weaknesses of lesser men his lord father never did and by god neither would he but as soon as they headed toward open water william bolted for the ships bow then clung to the gunwale as he vomited into the waves splashing over the prow greensick so soon will the voice was sympathetic but it also held a hint of amusement the smug indulgence of a good sailor william felt too wretched though for resentment and he let his brother help him up steer him toward the canvas tarpaulin where he flopped down on a blanket grabbed a handhold and held on for dear life when richard checked on him again a little later hed rolled over onto his back was snoring softly richardhow fares will the wine has done him in with luck hell sleep through the night poor lad richard reached out then as the ship pitched helped to steady his sister and cousin mahault could only marvel at his surefootedness hed had almost as much wine as will but he seemed none the worse for it why she wondered were men such fools lucia was less judgmental poor will she thought hell be shamed as well as dogsick come the morn aloud she said ill stay with him in case he awakens richard was more interested at that moment in his lost gamble for hed wagered a goodly sum that the white ship would beat the rest of the kings fleet to southampton as soon as he could catch thomas fitz stephens eye he beckoned the ships master over to find out if there was still a chance of victory the ships master shrugged we are in gods hands my lord they are well ahead of us but if we caught a good wind he shrugged again well not be able to make up much time till we are out into the channel and can rely on the sail ive told the oarsmen and my helmsman to keep close to barfleur point as long as we can so we can avoid the worst of the contrary currents offshore at least it is a cloudless night so well have the polestar to steer by i would hopejesus god both men were flung backwards as the ship suddenly shuddered stopped dead in the water there was a crunching sound and then the ship began to list sending screaming passengers careening into one another slamming into the casks and treasure chests into the struggling oarsmen thomas fitz stephen managed to regain his footing skidded across the slanting deck he already knew what had happened it had all come together for him with horrific clarity in the span of secondsthe tide dropping the reef that men called chaterase lurking just beneath the surface his tipsy oarsmen straining for speed an ashenfaced sailor lurched against him clutching at his arm we hit a rock and staved in the port side fitz stephen swung about shouting at the stunned helmsman up on the helm the ship shifted again provoking more screams he had to clamber over prostrate thrashing bodies to reach the port side fetch boat hooks mayhap we can push her off he thought hed been braced for the worst but he hadnt not for the sight of that gaping hole in the hull his ships death wound as his crew pushed against the rock with boat hooks and oars he stood frozen for a moment then he pulled himself together for there was a trust still to be honoured one last duty to perform grabbing one of his sailors he gave the man a terse urgent order then searched among the frightened passengers for the captain of williams guard get your lord over to the starboard side were going to launch the spare boat and it must be done quickwhilst the passengers still think themselves safer aboard ship the man gaped at him jesu is it as bad as that the ships master gave him a hard quailing stare youre less than two miles from barfleur close enough to make it safe to shore but go now you understand save the kings son william had never experienced a nightmare so vivid so intense so endless groggy dazed and disoriented he found himself scrabbling about in darkness entangled in suffocating folds of collapsed canvas then hands were reaching for him pulling him free his head spinning his stomach heaving he decided he must still be dreaming for now he was being roughly pushed and shoved his ears filled with screams and curses he stumbled and fell forward into a boat at least he thought it was a boat trying to recover his balance he cracked his head and slumped back groaning wanting only to wake up opening his eyes he gasped as a spray of stinging salt water doused him in the face he struggled to sit up and voices at once entreated him to keep still my lord lest you tip the boat and as he looked about him william sobered up in the time it took to draw icy sea air into his constricted lungs for he was adrift in a pitching open boat in the middle of a black surging sea what happened the white shipshe is sinking my lord that cannot be william twisted around to look causing the boat to rock from side to side christ jesus for it was indeed so the white ship was listing badly and he could hear the despairing wails of its doomed passengers mahault richard lucia all his friends his fathers steward weve got to help them cannot let them drown the men continued to row and to bail for water was sloshing about in the bottom of the boat theyll be in no danger my lord once they get off the rock this was but a safeguard for you are the kings only lawfully begotten son and your life is precious to the almighty william so wanted to believe him but it was then that he thought he heard a womans voice highpitched and shrill with fear will do not leave me to drown my sister we must go back for her my lord we dare not we cannot put your life at risk william was deaf to their pleading to all but mahaults cry of terror i am to be your king and i command you obey me or ill have the lot of you hanged i swear it they were appalled by the order but obedience had been bred and beaten into them from the cradle and even now they dared not defy a royal command as they strained at the oars william yelled mahault were coming for you youll have to jump into the water but well pick you up well send help back for the others as they drew closer to the stricken ship william half rose and had to be pulled down by one of the sailors before he swamped the boat peering through the darkness he sought in vain for his sister midst the panicked passengers clustered along the starboard side shouting until his throat was raw he began to tremble with cold and fear none of this seemed real surely god would not let the white ship sink mayhap the men were right and the ship in no danger but then the screaming intensified taking on a new frenzy and the sailor closest to william said in awe oh sweet jesus she is breaking up were too close shell drag us down with her desperately manning the oars the men struggled to draw away from the sinking ship it seemed to be splitting in half water gushing into its smashed hull washing people overboard the mast is coming down more screams the masthead lantern was swinging wildly then went out their boat was wallowing in the swells water breaking over the bow they heard splashing in the darkness the surface churning with flailing bodies one man managed to reach their boat pleading for help too weak to heave himself up over the side a sailor grabbed his arm sought to pull him in but then others were floundering toward them clutching at their oars clinging to the sides realizing their danger they tried to repel these drowning plucking hands to save themselves but it was too late their frail craft was being buffeted by the surging waves caught in the undertow of the dying ship and then it was going under and william was flung into the water opening his mouth to scream and swallowing salt water with no one to answer his choking cry for help for they were all drowning the passengers and crew of the white ship berolds lungs were bursting aching for air it was too late now for prayer hed been too petrified when thered still been time huddling in the stern whimpering each time the ship lurched paralyzed by fear and then the deck seemed to fall away water was flooding in and he was swept over the side sure that he would die unshriven lost to gods grace but he continued to fight instinctively for life kicking and clawing his way back to the surface all around him people were struggling splashing snatching at floating debris not far away a wine cask was bobbing and berold plunged toward it managed by sheer luck to catch one of its trailing ropes nearby he could hear a woman sobbing to the blessed lady for deliverance but the sea was pitching and rolling as the white ship went under and he could see nothing but waves rising against the sky the hugh cask was unwieldy try as he might he could not get a secure grip clinging to its rope he was waging a losing battle to stay afloat swells were breaking over his head and he sputtered and gasped for air between submersions and then the cask thudded into something solid there was a jarring thump and he mustered his dwindling strength grabbed for this new lifeline for a time he just concentrated upon holding on upon breathing gradually his numbed brain began to function again shredded canvas and crossed wooden beamsthe white ships yardarm and mast that realization gave him his first flicker of hope clenching his fists in the rigging ropes he slowly dragged himself up onto the spar he was not alone other men were straddling the mast clutching at the sail hanging on to the yardarm and these fortunate few were the only ones to survive the sinking of the white ship they clung to their precarious refuge and listened as their shipmates drowned it did not take long for the water was very cold soon the screaming stopped and an ominous silence settled over the bay berold saw one of the men securing himself with the rigging rope and he too groped for the halyard fumbled until hed knotted it around his waist no one talked they were saving their strength for staying alive but the boy took comfort in knowing they were there sharing his fate shivering he squeezed his eyes shut and began to pray never had berold been so cold but his heavy sheepskin cloak shielded him from the worst of the wind as wet and wretched as he was he was still better off than the other men and as the hours passed the cold began to claim victims one by one their grips loosened their wits started to wander and they slipped silently off the mast disappeared into the dark icy sea at last there were but two berold and the young man whod lashed himself to the yardarm berold watched him sag lower in the water and pleaded with him to hold on not to die he got no answer for the youth had no breath for talking when he did speak his teeth were chattering so violently that berold could hardly understand him i am geoffrey fitz gilbert de laigle tell my family tell them after that he said no more and berold began to cry silently and hopelessly for he was alone now on this tossing spar with a dead man and there would be none to know when death came for him too during the night fog swept in from the west patches of ghostly grey lying low along the horizon sometimes he slept or did he his thoughts were rambling confused he could not always remember where he was or why he was suffering so why could he not recall the patron saint for sailors for those in peril on the sea why was the almighty taking so long to bring him home when he heard the voices muffled and distorted in the fog he felt a weary wonderment that his ordeal was over that gods good angels were coming for him at last but they came not in winged chariots as the priests had taught instead they glided out of the fog in a small fishing craft its hull painted yellow and black its single sail as bright as blood berold tried to yell it emerged as a hoarse croak but theyd already seen him were dipping their oars into the sea and then they were alongside and one of the men had nimbly scrambled out onto the mast was cutting him loose and berold realized that for him salvation had come in the unlikely guise of three breton fishermen he had been spared to bear witness to tell the world that the white ship had gone down off barfleur point with the loss of the english kings son and all aboard save only a butchers lad from rouen it was two days before they dared to tell the english king henry was shattered by the loss of his children his dreams of a dynasty within two months hed taken a new wife the daughter of the duke of lower lorraine adeliza was just eighteen and beautiful but the marriage proved barren she could give him no son for the one he had lost men thought it gods inexplicable joke that henry should have sired twentythree children and of them all only two born in wedlockwilliam and his sister maude whod been sent off to germany as a child of eight wed to the emperor heinrich v when henrys lords debated the succession in the aftermath of the barfleur tragedy none thought of maude for there were worthy male candidates the kings two nephews sons of his sister adela theobald count of blois and his younger brother stephen count of mortain there was also robert fitz roy for as some pointed out henrys great father had been bastardborn too and still claimed a crown one man alone saw maude as henrys successor when five years after the sinking of the white ship maude was suddenly a young widow henry called her home maude he announced would be his heir this was a notion so alien to their worldthat a woman should rule in her own rightthat his barons and council fought him on it but age had not weakened his will and he would not be thwarted as he had forced maude to return from germany so did he force the lords of his realm to swear fealty to her when he died maude would be queen city of angers province of anjou france august barbe knew that her sister marthe was a whore when marthe had returned to the village three months ago for the funeral of their mother their stepfather had turned her away saying she had shamed them all with her evil ungodly life as young as barbe wasjust thirteenshe understood what a whore did that she sold her body to men for money she understood too that it was a grievous sin nonetheless she loved her wanton sister and detested her pious righteous stepfather she loathed his new wife too for hed married again with indecent haste claiming he needed a woman to mind his young sons there was no room in his new family circle for barbe the unwanted the child not his she found herself facing a dismal future treated as a servant likely to be married off to the first elderly widower willing to accept her youth in lieu of a marriage portion barbe wept softly at night nursing her bruises and muffling her sobs in her straw mattress praying for the courage to run away but it was not the almighty who came to her rescue it was her sinful sister when marthe came back for her barbe never hesitated stuffing her meagre belongings into a hemp sack she walked away from her home and village without a backward look it was only as their cart neared the city walls of angers that barbe began to have qualms about what shed done it was plain that her sister did not lack for money not if she could afford to hire a cart and driver but what lay ahead in angers what would life be like for her here a week had passed since then a week of continual surprises for barbe she had been vastly relieved to find that her sister did not live in a brothel indeed marthes residence was the most luxurious dwelling shed ever seen it had a kitchen and a hall with a bedchamber and a loft above and a garden view of the river barbe was astounded but she was too shy to probe and marthe offered no explanation only a sly smile and a jest about having an accommodating landlord marthe had a coffer chest full of clothes plump hens scratching about in her garden even a servant a widow who came in every day to cook and clean what she did not seem to have was a means of support where were the men come to buy what her sister was selling since barbe had been there nary a one had shown up who was paying for marthes fine house and food and jasmine perfume barbe got her answerand the greatest surprise of allat weeks end he rode up at twilight pounded on the door and when she pulled back the latch he brushed past her as if she did not exist shouting for her sister using marthes new name the one barbe could not get accustomed to mirabelle youll not believe what that bitch did mirabelle i swear to christ that id have throttled her if id stayed but by now he and mirabelle were on their way up the stairs and the closing door cut off the rest of his rage barbe stared openmouthed after them for as brief as her glimpse had been it was enough shed seen this handsome angry youth once before had watched in awe as he and several hunting companions stopped in her village for wine while word of his identity spread from house to house emptying the entire population out into the dusty street barbes knees had begun to tremble and she sat down abruptly on the closest stool overwhelmed by the realization that her sisters mystery lover was the count of anjou barbe slept fitfully that night in the loft and when she awoke the next morning her sister was already up gossiping in the kitchen with her neighbor the redhaired bawdy brigette barbe started down the stairs only to stop at sight of the bedchamber door invitingly ajar before she could think better of it she crept forward one of the shutters had been unlatched and half of the chamber was filled with hot hazy sunlight half still deep in night shadows the floor was littered with discarded clothing and several empty wine flagons and a scabbard was buried in the rushes almost at barbes feet the count of anjou was sprawled naked upon mirabelles bed his legs entangled in the sheets an arm flung across his eyes his skin was fair and seemed remarkably clean and smooth tanned wherever hed been exposed to the sun white where he had not his hair was shoulder length and curly the color of copper as was the hair between his legs he was cleanshaven in the fashion for youths and when he stirred sleepily his arm dropping away from his face barbe caught her breath for never had she seen any man so beautiful as this young drunken lord when a hand suddenly grasped barbes shoulder she cried out in fright spinning around so fast that she tripped over her own skirts mirabelle signaled for silence then pushed her toward the door her face flaming barbe scurried down the stairs she began to stammer an apology once they reached the hall not wanting a witness to her sisters scolding but mirabelle waved her on into the kitchen where brigette was drinking cider left over from the lammas day celebration youll not believe where i found the little lass brigetteby the bed lusting after my young lordling barbes face went even redder i was not she gasped sounding so horrified that both women burst out laughing some of barbes discomfort began to fade as she realized her sister was not angry with her i ought not to have gone into the bedchamber she admitted butbut i could not help myself is he really your lover martmirabelle for how long and who was he so angry with notnot his wife surely oh so you know about the wife do you mirabelle asked but she did not sound annoyed and barbe nodded shyly oh yes for that was all we talked about last year that lord geoffrey was to wed the king of englands daughter we heard that they had a splendid wedding that she was a beautiful bride isis that not so yes she is a handsome wench is the lady maude but id not say she made so fair a bride not when she went to the altar like one going to the gallows barbe was astonished why ever would she not want to wed the lord geoffrey i do not understand for he is so handsome she sighed and then blushed again when the women laughed geoffrey could not understand it either but it seems the lady felt she was marrying beneath her she had been the wife of the holy roman emperor after all and geoffrey was merely the son of a count and then he was just a lad only fourteen and she was a woman grown and worldlywise of twentyfive it may be too that she did not want to make a marriage so sure to displease her future subjects who loathed the angevins her objections were for naught though the english king was set upon the marriage for he saw it as a means of thwarting william clitos claim to the crown who is he he was another of the english kings nephews his elder brother roberts son when clito allied himself with the french king maudes father feared that count fulk of our anjou would join forces with them against england are you following this so far barbe nodded wideeyed how do you know all this she asked admiringly and mirabelle pointed ceilingward to the bedchamber above their heads men talk in bed too she said dryly soto win over count fulk the english king proposed a marriage between the lady maude and the counts eldest son geoffrey the count agreed but the norman barons liked it little and the lady maude not at all she balked refused to make the marriage barbe was amazed shed never heard of a womans daring to defy male authority could she do that well she surely tried but the king was no man to cross and he had his way in the end she yielded and plans went forward for the wedding maudes father did make one concession in her favor brigette interjected and mirabelle nodded i was just getting to that you see barbe the king of jerusalem faced the same predicament as the english king no son to succeed him his eldest daughter was to be queen and was in need of a husband and so it was arranged for count fulk to take her to wife as king of jerusalem he could well afford to cede anjou to geoffrey so the lady maude would at least be marrying a count and indeed it all came to pass as the english king would have it geoffrey and maude were wed last year two months before his fifteenth birthday in a magnificent ceremony at le mans count fulk later departed for the holy land and his new destiny the english king returned contentedly to his own domains and the war began war with thatthat william clito no william clitos claim came to an abrupt and unexpected end thanks to a mortal spear thrust he was wounded whilst putting down a rebellion in flanders and died soon afterward little more than a month after geoffrey and maudes wedding geoffrey called that ironic a word i know not but i suspect it is just a fancy way of saying his marriage need not have been no when i talked of war i meant the one between geoffrey and maude it began on their wedding night and i see no truce in sight indeed their fighting has gotten worse in past weeks in truth ive never seen geoffrey as wroth as he was last night it was no easy task calming him down took every drop of wine in the house barbe felt an odd sense of disappointment for shed always assumed that the highborn led blessed and blissful lives why do they not get along she asked and mirabelle shrugged geoffrey has complaints beyond counting to hear him tell it maude has no virtues only vices he says she is arrogant and sharptongued and quicktempered utterly lacking in womanly softness or warmth but if i were seeking to understand why he hates her so id look no further than their marriage bed keep this in mind child if you remember nothing else i teach you there is no insult that wounds a man more than one aimed at his manhood ii do not understand i mean that geoffreys wife finds no pleasure in his bed and lets him know it mirabelle said bluntly and barbe blushed anew wellwhy does he not shun her bed then she suggested timidly if he has you mirabelle why does he need maude alas it is not so simple barbe geoffrey does need maudeto give him an heir and then too he is just sixteen if he were older her coldness would not matter so much to him but he has never had an unwilling bedmate not until now why would he with a face like a wayward angel and all anjou his for the taking women have been chasing after him since he was fourteen or thereabouts and more often than not hed let them catch him it was a great blow to his pride to discover that his beautiful wife does not want him he is hurting and angry and baffled and each time she rejects him it gets worse so he punishes her in bed the one place where he is in control that only makes her scorn him all the more of course her scorn then goads him into maltreating her again whichwell just think of a dog chasing his tail if you want to understand this accursed marriage of theirs they mustbarbe lass are you weeping barbe ducked her head trying to hide the tears welling in her eyes it is just so sad she said that they are so unhappy save your pity for those who truly need it for mothers with hungry babes to feed for that onelegged beggar we saw in the marketplace for lepers or women with no men to protect them geoffrey and maude may be miserable but misery is much easier to bear in a castle child amen brigette said fervently and she and mirabelle laughed barbe was quiet after that startled by her sisters unsentimental assessment of her royal lovers plight do you think maude will truly rule england and normandy one day she asked for she found it incomprehensible that a woman could wield power like a man how would she know what to do oh she is clever enough to match wits with most men even geoffrey admits as much she knows how to read and write she is fluent in french and german and geoffrey says she understands a little latin if you ask me though i think she is one of gods great fools that lad up there in my bed is not a bad sort but there is no forgiveness in him none at all once he decides that maude owes him a debt she will be paying it off for the rest of their marriage she mirabelle where are you get a basin up here fast for im going to be sick the voice was young imperious and urgent mirabelle grinned and got to her feet coming my love gathering up a basin a pitcher of water and several towels she started for the stairs pausing to wink and say softly time to earn the rent brigette raised her cup and barbe leaned over politely poured more cider brigettewhat will happen to them the lord geoffrey and the lady maude who knows after a moment though brigette grinned if youre one for gambling lucas the fleming is taking wagers that theyll kill each other ere the year is out open the shutters minna i would know the worst maude said tautly the older woman hesitated then did as she was bade summer sunlight flooded the room warming and indolent and unsparingly bright maude drew a deep breath then raised the mirror it had been a gift from her first husband the german emperor heinrich the work of a master craftsman carved ivory and polished brass sheeted in thin glass the metallic reflection was distorted somewhat blurred but not enough to hide her swollen split lip and the mottled darkening bruises on her cheek maude closed her eyes for a moment then sank down in the window seat what am i to do minna the abbot will be here from st aubins within the hour and hell have only to look at me to know they all will anyone with eyes to see minnas and maudes lives had first intersected at utrecht where the young widow had been chosen to attend the even younger empress after maude was widowed in her turn minna had forsaken her german homeland and accompanied her mistress back to england theyd been together now for more than ten years but never had minna heard maude sound like this so utterly despairing mayhap we can cover the bruises with powder madame there would not be enough powder in christendom for that rising from the window seat maude began to pace damn him she cried suddenly damn him to hellfire everlasting minna wondered which one she meant husband or father my lady my fear for you bids me be bold bids me speak my mind you cannot go on like this something must be done what would you have me do minna cut his throat whilst he sleeps maudes mouth twisted ive thought about it you may be sure my ladyplease hear me out youll not like what i am about to say but i cannot keep silent not when i see him hurting you like this so far he has not lost all control he may have been angry enough to strike you but he stopped at that what happens when he does not madame slaps lead to beatings sooner or later you cannot let it reach that point for there will be no going back then you must save yourself whilst there is still time how maude asked but if the question itself was dispassionate the tone was not so defensive that minna knew it was hopeless that maude would not heed her my lady your husband the emperor was not an easy man to live with either he was prey to dark moods and melancholy and sudden fits of temper and yetyet you were able to make your marriage tolerable you learned to deal with his demons to defer to him when need be lady maude can you not do the same with lord geoffrey it might well mean your life but maude was already shaking her head no minna she said i cannot do what you ask of me it is true that i deferred to heinrich i do not dispute that but i was only eight years old when i first met him and he was a man of stature and significance crowned by our holy father the pope it did not diminish me to acknowledge his authority and whilst it is true that he was a solitary secretive man aloof even inintimate moments he never begrudged me his respect he treated me as his empress and there was dignity in our marriage she paused and her hand strayed to her face her fingers brushing against her throbbing discolored cheek how can you compare them heinrich and geoffrey she all but spat the second name heinrich was king of the germans the holy roman emperor but geoffreyhe is a callow willful boy a selfish boastful whelp who thinks a wife is just one more possession another mare to ride at his pleasure you cannot imagine how demeaning it is minna to be subject to a striplings whims to have no rights at all not even over my own body you know how i fought against this marriage but it has been even worse than id feared more than fourteen months of pain and humiliation and misery i cannot compel geoffrey to show me the respect a wife deserves i cannot even deny him my bed but i will not let him strip away the last shreds of my dignity i will not beg or grovel before him i will never give him that satisfaction my lady i would never ask that of you but there must be some ground between defiance and submission can you not try to find it pride is admirable for certes but it can also be dangerous and if you you do not understand minna not at all pride is the only defense i have maude said and turned away so abruptly that minna realized she was struggling to hold back tears she was not a woman who wept easily or often and knowing that minna said no more maude had moved to the window picking up the mirror again she stared at her reflection for a long moment and then she said help me braid my hair minna the abbot will soon be here my lady you do not have to do this i can tell him you are ailing no maude was very pale and that ugly blotch of a bruise stood out like a brand but her dark eyes glittered with a glazed feverish intensity i will not cower up here in my chamber i am no coward and i will not hide away like one i cannot stop people from gossiping behind my back but i can damned well dare them to do it to my face it was dusk by the time geoffrey returned to his formidable stone fortress above the river maine he felt wretched his head pounding his stomach still queasy for he was not accustomed to drinking so much dismounting in the stable he surprised the grooms by insisting upon unsaddling his mount himself he lingered in the stable for almost an hour rubbing his stallion down feeding and watering it as the grooms looked on in bafflement but he finally ran out of chores and with a leaden step he crossed the bailey entered the great hall to his relief maude was not there he was acutely conscious though of the stares the speculative glances the eyes averted whenever he turned around they knew all of them so did the townspeople most likely every last one of his vassals did too had they begun to wonder how he could govern anjou a man unable to rule his own wife stalking from the hall he rapidly mounted the stairs to maudes bedchamber they were ready for him having heard the jangling of his spurs on the narrow stone steps he wasted no time on preliminary skirmishing saying curtly minna leave us vexed but not surprised when she looked to maude for confirmation of his command but he knew how to pay her back and as soon as shed reluctantly withdrawn he slammed the bolt into place knowing shed be hovering on the other side of the door listening leaning back against the door he said alone at last more for the eavesdropping minnas benefit than for maudes his wife had yet to say a word she knew more ways to unsettle a man than any woman hed ever met silence being only one of them she was standing in the shadows behind the table but he was sure shed not stay there for long however much she might fear him he knew shed fear showing it even more as he expected she soon circled around the table but he drew a sharp breath as she moved into the lamps light jesu her face was swollen up like a melon he had not realized hed hit her that hard not that he was sorry she deserved it by god she did he found though that he did not like to look at her bruises for they were uncomfortable reminders of his own failure he had his share of the notorious angevin temper his father had always claimed it was lucifers legacy passed down from the devils daughter said to have beguiled a longdead count of anjou into taking her to wife but geoffrey had never given that accursed anger free rein not as his father had for it was very important to himbeing in control at all times that was why hed suffered through so few drunken dawns like todays why hed learned at such an early age that words could be crafted into weapons giving him power over others yet not over maude never over her no matter how often he vowed not to let her goad him again into a heedless fools rage it always came to that someone he did not even know shouting and raving at her like a madman losing more than his temper maude watched warily as he moved about the chamber slanting toward her an occasional sideways glance that gave away nothing of his thoughts he guarded his secrets well in that he was a worthy opponent for she rarely knew what he was thinking what was he doing here not to offer an apology for certes what did he want of her to share her bed god nonot after last nights ugliness surely he could not expect her tonot so soon but of course he would if that was what he wanted had he not proved that often enough we need to talk maude geoffrey said abruptly things must change between us this constant quarreling must stop i am boneweary of entering this bedchamber and having it become a battlefield i assure you it gives me no joy either geoffrey then you ought to be willing to do your part are you maude hesitated searching his face intently was he sincere about making a new beginning or was this some sort of trap what do you want of me it is very simple i want you to start acting like a wife she should have known better you mean obey you in all particulars he ignored her sarcasm why not you alone would think to question that for the rest of christendom recognizes it as a natural right that a wife owes her husband obedience and does the husband owe nothing is that all marriage is to you a lifelong debt incurred by the woman she saw the muscles tighten along his jawline but he surprised her then by saying coolly so tell me what i owe i cannot very well satisfy a debt unless i know what it is i want you to treat me with courtesy if i balk at obeying you it is because you shame me in front of others in truth you speak more kindly to your dogs than you do to me it would not unman you to ask instead of order and youd get better results geoffrey could feel heat rising resentfully in his face i was willing to treat you well you were the one who no not again this time he would not be provokedby corpus he would not fair enough he said brusquely i show you courtesy and you show me respect anything else you truly need to ask look at my face that was as much your doing as mine what are you sayingthat i wanted to be hit i am saying it would not have happened if not for your shrews temper and poison tongue you do not want it to happen again that is fine with me just do not give me cause as easy as that maude clenched her fists in the folds of her skirt her breathing had quickened but she couldnt seem to get enough air into her lungs and she felt as if she were going to suffocate on her chokedback rage she said nothing but gave geoffrey a look of utter loathing a look that was not lost upon him we are agreed then he said that we stop entertaining all of anjou with our feuding from now on we do our squabbling behind closed doors is that understood yes i understand all your talk of change was just thattalk you do not want to make peace between us you do not even want a truce merely a public pretense a public pretense is the best i can hope fordear wife if you were to tell me otherwise id know you lied you can no more sheathe your claws than a wildcat can and as for your bed thawing outwell well see the second coming first maude flushed if my bed is cold the blame is yours the devil it is if you treated your yellowhaired harlot the way you do me youd have to pay her a lot more money than you do now you never ask you just take you force yourself upon me whenever you choose and you do not care if i am ailing or tired it is not unreasonable to want to say no sometimes but then youd never hear me would you geoffrey was incredulous christ jesus woman you make it sound as if i rape you you do she said flatly and his disbelief exploded into outrage have you gone mad when he strode toward her she took an involuntary backward step for although she was tall for a woman he still towered above her i have every right to lay with you for you are my wife need i remind you of that as if i could forget his eyes were of a changeable color blue or grey depending upon his mood or the light they were dark now like slate hed made no move to touch her but as soon as she could retreat without seeming to she put some space between them i would to god i knew what ails you woman mayhap youre not just badtempered and perverse mayhap youre truly crazy i do not know how else to explain half of what you say unless you are mocking me is that it maude no she protested why is it honesty when a man speaks his mind and madness when a woman does he shook his head in disgust god help the english if ever you do become queen but until then you are going to do what i say i am not offering you a choice maude i can compel your obedience if need be and we both know that maude swallowed i am not afraid of you geoffrey then you are truly a fool he said coldly for youve given me no reason to think fondly of you youve proven yourself to be a disagreeable companion an indifferent bedmate and a barren wifehave i left any of your failings out maude gasped that is not so i bore the emperor a son dead he shot back what good does it do a man to have a stillborn heir my son lived she began but she got no further to her horror her voice was no longer steady not long enough how old were you when you started to share the imperial bedthirteen fourteen so you had nigh on ten years to conceive another child and you could not do it your husband needed a healthy living heir and you failed him so why should i think you could do any better for me god will give me a son she said huskily a son who will be king my only regret is that the child must be yours for i would rather lay with any man but you even a lepers touch could not be more loathsome than yours it was then that he lunged at her but as fast as he was she was even faster and his hand just brushed her sleeve she spun around and he thought she meant to dart behind the table instead she snatched something from an open casket and whirled back to face him you will not hit me again she warned i swear by the rood that you will not he took a quick step toward her and then froze shocked into immobility not by her defiance but by the sight of that jeweled dagger glinting in her fist his eyes narrowed flicking from the knife to her white face back to the dagger again she was holding it too high too far out from her body shed not had his training with weapons nor did she have his greater reach measuring the risk he decided he could probably get the blade away from her without too much trouble he made no attempt to do so though her breathing was uneven and shallow he could see how rapidly her breasts rose and fell perspiration had begun to trickle down her neck into her cleavage and a pulse was throbbing in her throat shed never looked so desirable or so desperate but it was as if he were watching her from a distance even his anger had suddenly iced over and he knew then what he would do i have had enough he said the throne of england is not worth this the throne of heaven itself would not be worth it our marriage is over and he turned away strode toward the door maude was stunned what are you saying sliding the bolt free he looked back over his shoulder i no longer want you as my wife tell your women to start packing for id have you gone by first light before she could respond the door closed quietly and that was somehow more ominous than if hed slammed it shut reaction set in and she began to tremble the dagger slid from her fingers dropped into the floor rushes my lady what happened you look white as chalk he did not hurt you no minna the other woman shoved a brimming wine cup into her hand and maude drank gratefully entwining her fingers around the stem to steady her grip he sayssays the marriage is over minna was dumbfounded he cannot mean that madamecan he no maude said as emphatically as she could of course he does not mean it there is too much at stakethe succession of anjou england and normandy the scandal would be beyond belief all of my fathers plans would be set at naught she paused turning then to meet minnas troubled gaze my father she said softly would never forgive me maude spent the evenings remaining hours seeking to convince herself that geoffrey could not possibly have been serious but she still slept badly and awakened at dawn so tense and edgy that she decided she had but one course of action to confront geoffrey straightaway her husbands squire could not hide his surprise for shed never before made an earlymorning appearance in geoffreys bedchamber geoffrey was already up and dressed his high boots and darkgreen tunic indicated he had a days hunting in mind he gave maude a cool mocking glance into the lions den how brave of you darling now it was maudes turn to say we need to talk will you send raimund away forcing herself to add please through gritted teeth he shrugged dismissing his squire with a casual gesture have you come then to bid me farewell maude stared at him you cannot do this geoffrey you could not be so irresponsible so reckless you think not go to the window then your escort is waiting below ready to see you safe into normandy or hell or wherever else you care to go for gods sake geoffrey this is madness youve not thought this through the church will not annul our marriage we have no grounds youll not be able to wed again neither one of us will what will you do for an heir moving to the table he poured himself a breakfast beverage of watereddown wine if it comes to that i suppose i can wait for you to die dear heart the only benefit of having such an older wife is that youre not likely to outlive me are you this is nothing to joke about what of your father hell be enraged if you commit this folly and well you know it i expect so he acknowledged airily but jerusalem is a long long way from angers itll be months ere he even hears my father is not in jerusalem she snapped what of his rage that is your problem dear heart not mine he said and smiled at her it was like looking at a stranger he even sounded different there was malice in his tone but no anger maude was at a loss not knowing how to deal with this new geoffrey defeated by this odd mixture of boyish flippancy and adult resolve so be it she said at last ill not beg a pity he said for that would have been one memory of our marriage i might have cherished the smile he gave her was lighthearted quite genuine moving past her to the door he said well im off to the hunt it would be sporting of you to wish me luck i wish you godspeed and a safe journey but maudedo be gone by the time i get back tonight he didnt bother to close the door she could hear him whistling as he started down the stairs maude stood very still listening to the sounds of his receding footsteps in the stairwell the fading echoes of his jaunty tune god in heaven what now in early september maude arrived at her fathers royal manor at quevilly in the parish of saintsever on the outskirts of rouen the king was no longer in normandy though having returned to england in july writing to her father was one of the most difficult tasks maude had ever faced it left her pride in tatters lacerated and raw but she had no choice her father had to know how geoffrey had abused her how miserable hed made her if he understood that he might not blame her for the breakup of her marriage after dispatching a letter to her father at windsor maude then had a confidential candid and disheartening discussion with hugh damiens the new archbishop of rouen he confirmed what she already knew that the church recognized but three grounds for dissolving a marriagea previous plight troth a blood kinship within the seventh degree or a spiritual kinship such as godparent and godchildand that geoffrey and maude could satisfy none of them which meant maude later confided bitterly to minna that she was chained to geoffrey as surely as if hed cast her into an angevin dungeon and clapped her in irons as wretched as their life together had been all she could hope for was that he might relent and take her back if he did not her fathers dynastic dreams would be destroyed and so would her own dreams of queenship for henry would not keep her as his heir if she could not give him a grandson shed always liked rouen but now she hated it heads turned and whispers began each time she ventured into the citys streets she found it intensely humiliating knowing that she was the object of so much gossip much of it salacious her broken marriage the butt of alehouse jokes and crude tavern humor but worst of all was the suspense the silence from england as the weeks passed she wrote again and after that all she could do was wait for her fathers response it came at last on a rainchilled october eve maude and minna were seated before the solar hearth playing a game of chess maude glanced up as the door opened expecting a servant and found herself gazing at her eldest brother and his wife robert thank god maude was not demonstrative by nature but now she flung herself into roberts arms and even embraced amabel although the two women had nothing in common except robert why did you not let me know you were coming how the sight of you gladdens me youyou do know about geoffrey yes he said that is why i am here there was a brief delay while robert and amabel exchanged pleasantries with minna and wine was served but as soon as they were alone robert took a sealed parchment from a pouch at his belt and silently held it out to her he watched sadly as maude read their fathers letter saw the color fade from her face only to flood back as she continued to read and then ebb away again raising wide stricken eyes to his she said papa blames me robert he says it is all my fault i know this is so unjust did he not get my letters did he read them when he nodded reluctantly she reached out and caught his arm then he knows how geoffrey maltreated me what did he say to that i do not remember lass he said no longer meeting her eyes robert tell me still he said nothing it was amabel who finally told maude what her husband would not he said maude that youd likely brought it upon yourself maude stared at her sisterinlaw then swung back toward her brother he truly said that he was in a rage maude when men are angry they are careless ofttimes say what they do not mean no maude said not papa he never says what he does not mean she was badly shaken and it showed how can he be so uncaring how can he take geoffreys side over mine maude he is not doing that no it certainly sounds that way to me but i am not the one who murdered our marriage it is geoffreys dagger buried in the body for it was geoffrey who cast me out what would papa have me do beg him to take me back this was not my fault robert why could you not make papa see that ah maude he glanced at her then looked away and it was then that maude saw the truth my god she whispered you too you think i am to blame maude it is not a matter of blame i am not defending geoffrey in truth i am not but i would to god it had never happened that you he broke off but not in time go on maude challenged finish the thought robert what ought i to have done suffered in silence let him beat me black and blue without complaint you know better than that he said quietly this serves for naught we can talk in the morning when you are not so distraught but for now i think it is best that we bid you goodnight stepping forward he kissed her upon the cheek and then paused as if waiting for her to speak she did not and he turned toward the door amabel followed maude moved to the hearth she was suddenly so cold that shed actually begun to shiver when the door opened she did not turn assuming it was minna but it was amabel there is something i would say to you maude you must not blame robert this was not a mission of his choosing his father commanded him to come he would never willingly hurt you and you ought to know that by now all i know is that i was the one wronged i am here because geoffrey banished me from anjou so how is it that i am at fault suppose you tell me amabel youve never been at a loss for words indeed i do speak my mind and i will now woman to woman i do agree that you have been wronged if your marriage was a ship geoffrey was the one who ran it upon the rocks but you ought to have seen this coming a ship does not sink with no warning why were you not aware that it was taking on water in all honesty i do not understand how you botched this so badly you are a beautiful woman maude why you could not bedazzle or bewitch a lad of fifteen how dare you pass judgment on me does robert ever hit you does he boast openly of his bedmates take pleasure in your pain unless you can answer those questions with a yes you cannot know what my marriage was like and you have no right to criticize me there is truth in what you say amabel admitted but there is truth in what i said too and for your sake i hope you can see that in time sooner or later geoffrey will take you back surely you know that your father is not about to let a headstrong cub thwart his will or undo his carefully crafted plans for the succession geoffrey will come to his senses the king will see to that and when he does i hope youll remember what i said this night go away amabel maude said and although her sisterinlaw looked aggrieved she did maude still clutched her fathers letter crumpled within her fist she smoothed it out now but did not reread it instead she thrust it into the hearth a scorching smell filled the room as the parchment caught fire began to smolder she watched it burn not moving until it was engulfed in flames chartres castle france february to know scriptures is to know gods will the bishop of winchester declared with utter certainty and scriptures say permit not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve how much more clearly can it be put than that a female king is not only a contradiction in terms it is an abomination unto the lord and it must not come to pass in appearance the bishop was unprepossessing but he had a rich resonant voice and had justly gained himself a reputation for stirring oratory his latest effort was wasted though upon this particular audience to the rest of christendom henry of blois was a respected prince of the church one of englands youngest bishops clever and cultivated and a likely candidate to wear one day the mitre of canterburys archbishop for he was known to stand high in the favor of his uncle the english king but to theobald count of blois and champagne and stephen count of boulogne and mortain he was still their younger brother and his impressive adult successes would always be competing with memories of the child hed once been awkward and precocious and obstinate a lonely little figure chasing after them down the byways of their boyhood never quite catching up no one hearing henry could doubt the sincerity of his convictions but theobald had no great interest in the succession to the english throne for some years now he had quite competently ruled the prosperous domains hed inherited first from his father and then from his uncleblois chartres sancerre chateaudun meaux and champagneand he was pragmatic enough to be satisfied with what god had given him stephen too was content with his lot in life his marriage to matilda de boulogne had brought him both wealth and happiness unlike theobald though he could not afford to be indifferent to english politics for he held vast english estates but he was not comfortable with henrys harangues about their cousin maude they stirred up too many doubts too much unease when a servant entered the solar with word of a guests unexpected arrival theobald was quick to make his escape hastening down to the great hall to welcome their cousin the earl of gloucester stephen developed a sudden unlikely desire to greet robert too but henry would have none of it insisting that he remain and stephen sank down in his chair again trapped by his reluctance to be rude henry was not troubled by theobalds defection for his argument had been aimed at stephen seeing that he was about to resume his homily upon maudes unholy queenship stephen sought to head him off with humor what i cannot understand he said is how you can be so convinced that women are such inept frail hapless creatures what of our lady mother until theobald came of age she governed blois for him did she not and for all that she humbly signs her letters these days as adela the nun of marcigny we both know she has that poor prioress utterly cowed rules the nunnery as surely as ever she did blois moreover id wager that once she gets to heaven shell not be there a week ere she has the almighty himself on a tight rein henry was not amused do not blaspheme stephen our mother is unlike other women and well you know that but even she would not dare to claim a kingdom as maude does stephen doubted that exceedingly saw no point in saying so though during his boyhood adela had often remarked how like your father you are and hed known even then that shed not meant it as a compliment but there was no question as to which of their parents henry took after he thought for nothing less than an act of god could deflect him from his purpose he was already drawing breath to continue his sermon and stephen had no liking for sermons what of our oaths he interrupted i swore to accept maude as queen when our uncle dies so did you henry so did we all or has that somehow slipped your mind how could you have refused henry demanded had his answer in stephens silence none of us could for our uncle is not a man to be defied need i remind you that an oath given under duress is not binding in the eyes of holy church theyd had this discussion before more times than stephen could count do you remember that embroidered wallhanging in our mothers bedchamber the one that depicted her fathers conquest of england it faced the bed so it would be the first thing she saw every morn the last thing at night ive wondered at times if our father was ever tempted to set it afire his brother was frowning for gods sake stephen why are we speaking of a wallhanging in our mothers bedchamber how is that relevant i just hope she bequeathes it to you henry for no one could cherish it more can we call a halt to the invasion plansat least for tonight in truth i do not feel comfortable with this conversation im fond of maude and i you are the bishop sounded astonished why is it truly so surprising maude has candor and courage andstephen grinnedit does not hurt that she is so easy on the eyes moreover i cannot help pitying her plight shackled for life to a husband she loathes so her marriage is less than perfect henry said impatiently all marriages have rough patches less than perfect try hellish she is miserable with the man and who can blame her first geoffrey shames her before all of christendom by packing her off to her father as if she were defective goods then he changes his mind two years later and decides that mayhap he can put up with her after allno great surprise there for how many wives bring along a crown as their marriage portion so he writes to her father who calls a council to discuss geoffreys demand and they all agree that she must go back to anjou but one voice seems to have been missing from this great debate maudes does it not strike you as odd henry that our uncle would make her queen and yet give her no say whatsoever in the matter of her own marriage the only thing odd to the bishop was his brothers peculiar way of thinking stephen always seemed to be wandering off the road onto paths he alone could see henry was fond of stephen but he did not understand him at all constantly baffled and frustrated by what he saw as stephens overly sentimental and impractical approach to life theobald would have been his first choice but theobald had so far shown even less enthusiasm than stephen oh hed likely take the crown if it were dropped into his lap but the bishop had long ago learned that a man must fight for what he wanted in this life his uncle could not be allowed to carry out this mad gamble of his for a gamble it was one that put both england and normandy at risk that might even imperil the church itself and he was not going to let that happen by the rood he was not he would see stephen crowned in spite of himself if need be and as his reward for saving england from maudes disastrous queenship he would claim the churchs most influential see that of canterbury a crown for stephen an archbishops mitre for himself a fair trade for thwarting an old mans unforgivable folly of course maude ought to have gone back to geoffrey he said marveling that he must waste time in pointing out the obvious a wife must obey her husband and that is but another reason why maude must never be allowed to claim the english throne who amongst us would want to be ruled by geoffrey of anjou to henrys intense annoyance stephen laughed i know maude better than that our lady mother agrees with me henry said and stephens laughter stopped abruptly i have visited her at the nunnery in marcigny and she sees matters as i do by claiming the crown you would be serving god and the english people whilst bringing glory to your familys name a crown she said will do honour to our fathers memory rid it of a lingering blotch the shame he suffered at antioch i should think stephen said that he expiated any and all sins by dying as he did at ramleh there was a surprising edge to stephens voice for it was a longstanding family joke that his anger was like a bear denned up for the winter all but impossible to bestir hed gotten to his feet and the bishop said hastily those were our mothers words not mine for all her virtues she is overly prideful and ill not deny it i respect your doubts for this is not an undertaking to be entered into lightly take the time you need to consider what ive said but i would ask you one question and i want you to answer me honestly without jesting or evasions can you truly tell me stephen that you believe maude could rule england and normandy as well as a man couldas you could stephen did not want to answer but his brother was implacable appeared willing to wait as long as necessary no he said at last i do not nor do i henry said not firing the most formidable weapon in his arsenal until stephen reached the door do you think often of the white ship stephen stopped his hand on the door latch our sister drowned in that wreck of course i think of it you almost drowned too stephen few men come as close to death as you did that november nightand walk away have you never wondered why you were spared was it truly happenchance or did the almighty spare you for a purpose of his own what purpose henry to save england from maude would it not have been simpler then just to let the white ship miss that rock if will had not drowned maude would still be in germany our uncle would have a son to succeed him and you and i would not be having this conversation that was not the response bishop henry had been hoping for but he still felt confident that he had planted a seed in fertile soil for what man did not ponder his own place in the mysterious workings of the almighty he let stephen go content to wait going down into the great hall stephen found theobald sharing a hospitable wine flagon with their cousin he and robert greeted each other with a marked and mutual lack of enthusiasm but he had a much warmer welcome for roberts young squire ranulf had passed several years in stephens household serving as a page for that was the approved method of educating youths of good birth that past november hed turned fourteen and robert had then assumed responsibility for the next stage of his schooling in which he would learn about horses and weapons and the art of war stephen was quite fond of the boy an affection ranulf returned in full measure and their reunion was highly pleasing to them both but night had fallen some time ago and matilda had long since gone up to bed stephen soon excused himself and did likewise matilda was already asleep but when stephen drew her into his arms she snuggled drowsily into his embrace he kissed the corner of her mouth then the pulse in her throat and her lashes quivered ive been told he murmured that there is a goodhearted lady here who never turns a needy stranger away from her door what are my chances of getting what i need id say just fair to middling but he felt matilda smiling against his neck and when he caught hold of her blonde braid she took it back then tickled his nose with the tip my cousin robert arrived after you went abovestairs he bent over licking the soft hollow of her elbow he is on his way to visit maude at le mans her father wants to know how she is faring for robert says she has been ailing that her pregnancy has not been an easy one matilda was wide awake by now you and henry were in the solar for a long time once or twice i thought about coming to your rescue but i could not think of an excuse hed find credible next time love claim the castle is on fire stephen suggested and she laughed softly entwining her fingers in his chest hair and tugging gently there were few secrets between them for theirs was that most fortunate of unions a marriage of state that was also a genuine love match but hed yet to tell her of past crown conversations with henry and he did not tell her of this latest one either although he could not have explainedeven to his own satisfactionwhy he kept silent matilda was still smiling her lips invitingly parted and he lowered his mouth to hers the kiss was a long one no longer playful but he surprised her then by saying i think we ought to ride along with robert he says maudes time is almost nigh and i doubt she is getting much comfort from geoffrey matilda doubted it too and was sorry that maudes marriage was so unhappy but she still did not want to go to le mans she and maude were first cousins for their mothers had been sisters their uncle david was the current king of scotland they were linked as well by matildas marriage to stephen but there was no friendship between them they were too unlike for that moreover matilda was eager to return to boulogne where their young sons awaited them if you truly want to go stephen but you would rather not he said not fooled by her dutiful denial i do think i ought to go love he hesitated unable to explain why he felt this urgent need to offer maude support but you are not obliged to go with me you could await me here at chartres oror you could ride south to marcigny and pass a few days with my mother matilda could not hide her dismay she was thoroughly intimidated by her formidable motherinlaw if that is truly your wish she began gamely but then the deferential wife gave way to the suspicious one and she raised up to look sharply into his face that she cried was a cruel joke and she yanked his pillow away hit him with it stephen was laughing too hard to offer an effective defense and matilda soon pummeled him into submission flushed and triumphant she rolled over into his arms again i will go with you to visit maude if it means that much to you i will go wherever you desire my lord husband she said and heaved a mock martyrs sigh before adding except to the nunnery at marcigny stephen laughed again then reached up and drew the bedhangings snug around their bed shutting out the world maude was delighted to have company in these last weeks of her pregnancy she was always glad to see robert whod done his best to mend her rift with their father she was quite fond of ranulf and stephen was not just her cousin he was one of the few men with whom she could let down her guard she was even pleased for once to see matilda for matilda had borne stephen two children knew what to expect in the birthing chamber maude believed in being well prepared for any eventuality but her own memories of childbirth were clouded as much by grief as by the passage of time all she remembered with clarity was the pain afterward once shed been told that her sons life had been measured in but a few feeble breaths a fading heartbeat minna was no help for her marriage had been barren and when maude had asked other women all too often they had assumed an indulgent tone that she found infuriating the battleseasoned soldier spinning war stories to awe the raw recruit while maude had never liked her shy softspoken cousin she felt confident that condescension was not one of matildas character flaws robert had brought maude a letter from their father the warmest letter shed gotten in some time he was not a man to forgive easily but it seemed that he was willing to let bygones be bygones now that maude was back with geoffrey where she belonged and about to give birth to his grandchild maude was very resentful of his judgmental attitude the letter pleased her though in spite of herself after supper she played chess with robert persuaded stephen to teach her a popular dice game and had a quiet talk with matilda who was able to reassure her that the pains shed been having in recent days were quite normal and no cause for concern it was one of the most pleasant evenings maude had passed in months and she even unbent enough to let her young brother ranulf feel her babys kicking there was only one shadow cast over their gathering geoffreys conspicuous absence the irony of it did not escape herthat for once she found herself listening intently for the sound of his footsteps wanting to hear them but as little as she enjoyed geoffreys company still less did she enjoy being a figure of pity shed already been held up to ridicule and censure as a repudiated wife and she could not bear to be seen now as a neglected wife too pregnant and pathetic left at home alone while her husband took his pleasure in other beds with other women she slept poorly that night unable to find a comfortable position and awoke the next morning feeling as if shed never been to bed her ankles were swollen her head aching her legs cramping and by the time minna had helped her to dress shed begun to get random sharp pains in her lower back according to dame rohese her midwife she was not due for another fortnight but on this cold lenten sunday in early march a fortnight seemed longer to maude than a twelvemonth the church said childbirth was the curse of eve but she couldnt help wondering why men were spared their fair share of the burden granted it was eve whod first let herself be tempted by the serpent but adam had tasted that wretched apple too had he not minna was accustomed to her mistresss acerbic morning musings and she continued calmly to braid maudes long dark hair pointing out that the babe might well be born on palm sundayan auspicious beginning indeed for a future king maude went to geoffreys bedchamber as soon as she was dressed and was angered and disconcerted to discover that his bed had not been slept in if he did not return from his nocturnal hunting within the next few hours his continued absence would become known to all in the castle for there could be no other explanation for his failure to appear at dinner her guests were soon up and stirring too polite to ask about geoffreys whereabouts but the dinner hour was rapidly drawing nigh it was already past ten snatching up her mantle maude left the hall mayhap if she consulted with the cooks about the menu it would take her mind off her missing husband and it was then as she crossed the bailey toward the kitchen that she saw geoffrey ride in through the gatehouse for one whod been out all night he looked remarkably debonair and dapper at the time of their wedding hed been a goodlooking boy now in his twentieth year hed matured into a man to turn female heads and claim female hearts able to seduce with a smile and the ageold allure of fire and ice the sudden glint of flames in the depths of a cool bluegrey gaze only one woman was indifferent to his swagger and sly wayward charmthe wife who was now staring at him with intense impotent fury geoffrey acknowledged her presence with a cheerful wave on his way to the stables feeling awkward and ungainly trapped in a strangers heavy bloated body maude trudged after him he was already dismounting handing over his stallion to a groom by the time she reached the stable doorway where were you last night geoffrey although she kept her voice lowpitched it throbbed with angry accusation geoffrey gave her a surprised look a faintly mocking smile i think she said her name was annettewhy i find it hard to believe you were lying awake all night dear heart craving my caresses my brothers and cousins are here she said through clenched teeth and ill not have you shaming me before them even as she spoke she knew she was going about this the wrong way for geoffrey balked at the merest prick of the spurs but she could not bring herself to beg for the respect that ought to have been hers by right although geoffrey was scowling the taunt she was expecting died on his lips that imperious tone was all too familiar to him but this was not his enemy the empress the reluctant wife whod wanted neither his title nor his embraces prideful and stubborn and damnably desirable this was a tired tense woman with a swollen belly and slumped shoulders much too pale great with his child fair enough he said grudgingly you need not fret maude ill give you no reason to complain whilst your kin are here maude was momentarily at a loss wondering if she was supposed to thank him she settled upon a sardonic echo of his own terse fair enough and rejected his offer to escort her into the hall almost at once she regretted it for their confrontation had sapped the last of her dwindling energy and the kitchen now seemed miles away she opened her mouth to call geoffrey back but pride prevailed over exhaustion she just needed to catch her breath she decided shed only taken a few steps though before she was jolted by a sharp pain and for a frightening moment the earth lurched beneath her feet she gasped but she did not fall for geoffrey had suddenly materialized at her side his arm around her shoulders holding her upright until her world stopped spinning maudes dizziness soon passed but when her vision cleared she gasped again this time in astonishment stephen do you think you can walk now or would you rather wait a while stephen asked and when she nodded he guided her into the stables toward a nearby bale of hay maude sank down on it thankfully but as their eyes met she flushed for by now shed solved the mystery of his providential appearance to have reached her so fast he must have come from the stables and that meant he had overheard her conversation with geoffrey ii would rather you say nothing of this she said and although the words seemed to refer to her dizzy spell she was asking more than that and they both knew it id gone out to the stables to check upon my roans foreleg he gashed it on the road yesterday but i cannot imagine that being of interest to anyone else no not likely maude agreed and some of the color began to fade from her face this was not the first time shed had reason to be grateful for his gallantry and as she beckoned him to sit beside her on the bale she found herself remembering those unhappy months after her marriage foundered it had not been an easy time for all knew her father was furious with her and theirs was a society in which cues were taken from the king what scant sympathy shed gotten had been surreptitiously offeredadeliza her fathers young queenor left unsaidbrien fitz count his foster son it was true that her little brother ranulf had spoken up for her asking with an elevenyearolds forthrightness if geoffrey told her to go why are people not blaming him but only one man had dared to make a public defense only stephen had pointed outas ranulf hadthat shed not been the one to end the marriage shed been heartened by his loyalty and comforted by his private comment that geoffrey was a fool to let you go a harmless bit of flatterystephen was always one for flirtingbut her bruised and lacerated pride had needed such balm shed not forgotten his kindness meant to reward it well once she was englands queen stephen was worried by her pallor shall i summon minna he asked not at all surprised when she stubbornly shook her head maudedo you want me to talk to geoffrey you ought not to be under stress now not with your time so near thank you stephen but no actually geoffrey and i have been getting along better of late he was truly pleased when i got with child has his heart set upon a son of course but then so do i she said and smiled they were quiet after that but it was a companionable quiet maude slid her hand under her mantle pressing it against her abdomen once shed become pregnant shed envisioned her womb as a placid pool with her baby swimming in its depths like a tiny tadpole he was almost ready now to break the surface to come up for air stepheni would ask you a question but i want the truth not what you think i need to hear stephen stiffened for he was afraid he knew what she was about to ask if he thought shed make a good queen go on he said warily all the while wondering what he would say this is likely to sound foolish but do you think ill be a good mother his relief was considerable he had not wanted to lie to her that is an odd question he acknowledged not one to occur to most of us people have babies if it is gods will and no one frets much over how they are raised but yes i think you will be a very good mother ive heard it said that no earthly creature is as fearless as a mother lioness defending her cubs unto the death i take it there is a compliment in there somewhere maude said and laughed i barely remember my own mother of course i was so young when they sent me to germanyjust eightand she was dead by the time i set foot again on english soil butbut i never felt her presence stephen there was always a distance and it had naught to do with miles i do not want that for my children i want to matter more to them to give them all that i can and make of them all they can be to teach them to strive for excellence to obey gods commandments andfor my eldest sonto be a good king there is one more lesson i hope you teach them maudethat it is not sinful to fail stephen said and she stared at him in surprise surely he could not be speaking of himself maude knew her aunt was a demanding woman but she thought any parent would be proud of a son like stephen he showed courage on the battlefield courtesy in the hall he had earned a kings favor made an advantageous marriage and sired sons of his own moreoverand it was this talent that maude secretly envied for she knew it was one she lacked herselfhe had a knack for putting others at ease had more friends and fewer enemies than any man she knew if aunt adela is truly disappointed in you she said then she must be beyond satisfying what more could she ask for in a son one with more flint in his soul he said with a wry smile my lady mother bless her sets standards that the holy christ child could not have met you know nothing then of her feud with my eldest brother maude shook her head i thought she and theobald were on good terms they are but theobald is not the firstborn i meant my brother will he and my mother were always at cross purposes they fought through most of his boyhood i do not know the whole of it for i was too young but ive been told will swore a public oath that he would kill the bishop of chartres he was just a lad talking crazed most likely drunk at the time but my mother never forgave him she and the bishop acted to deny will his birthright vesting my fathers titles in theobald the second son i am not surprised that you knew none of this for you were but a babe and it was skillfully and discreetly done there was no scandal will did not fight her and lives quietly upon the lands of his wife at sully seemingly contentbut not the count of blois maude was silent for a time i could not disinherit my son she said it would be like cutting out my own flesh is it wise to be so set upon a son it could be a girl after all i want no daughters she said not ever stephen was puzzled by her vehemence matilda recently confided that she may be with child again and if so we both hope for a lass this time why would you want to deny yourself the pleasure a daughter would bring because maude said daughters are but pawns utterly powerless she broke off so abruptly that stephen knew shed had another pang is it common to have these pains the midwife assured me that they come and go in the days before the birthing begins but the ones ive had today have been different in my back and i maudes mouth contorted and then an alarmed expression crossed her face jesu she cried my water has broken stephen jumped to his feet wed best get you inside straightaway noyou go in and tell them maude was looking everywhere but at stephens face ii will follow in a moment or so maude that makes no sense he stared at her in utter bafflement and had his answer then in her crimson cheeks averted eyes and sodden skirts god save the lass she was embarrassed sweet cousin listen you must come with me you cannot have your baby in a stable this is le mans not bethlehem as he hoped that won him a flicker of a smile and she held out her hands let him help her to her feet take me in stephen she said i doubt youd make a good midwife geoffrey and stephen were dicing to pass the time robert had found a whetstone and was occupying himself productively in sharpening his sword and ranulf roamed the hall like a lost soul edgy and impatient generally making a nuisance of himself how much longer will it be he asked yet again it has been hours already that is only to be expected lad robert said calmly it has even been known to take days days ranulf and geoffrey echoed in unison sounding equally appalled you are indeed a comfort cousin stephen said dryly matilda will let us know if the birthing goes wrong it is foolhardy to borrow trouble needlessly you are right geoffrey agreed reaching again for the dice who wants to wager on the sport abovestairs what say you stephen ill put up a garnet ring that maude births a son stephen shook his head in a goodnatured refusal a man would be a fool to wager against maude she says itll be a lad and that is enough for me soon after matilda came downstairs bearing the same message as on earlier trips that all was going well the babe seemed in a hurry too so it would not be much longer this time she did not go back upstairs instead sat down wearily in one of the recessed window seats stephen soon joined her are you not going up again tilda no she said i think not seeing his surprise she said quietly in truth love i doubt that maude wants me there a woman is never so helpless so vulnerable as when she gives birth her will counts for naught it is her body that has the mastery of her it is a frightening feeling stephen knowing you must deliver your babe or die it strips a woman down to her soul and my cousin maude finds that a harsher penance than the pain she wants few witnesses to her travail and most assuredly i am not one of them you read people like monks read books stephen said admiringly and agreed readily when she suggested they go to the castle chapel to pray for maude and her child once there though he found himself assailed by conflicting urges maudes claim to the crown would be strengthened if she gave birth to a son for englands sake it might well be best if she birthed a lass but as he approached the altar he seemed to hear again maudes voice i want no daughters and after a brief struggle with his conscience he knelt and offered up a prayer for maude that she should be blessed with a son when the pains got too bad minna and the midwife urged her to scream but maude would not do it instead she stifled her cries by biting down on the corner of a towel it made no sense to her that she could be shivering and sweating at the same time the midwife insisted however that nothing was amiss shed been worried she confessed about lady maudes water breaking so soon for that might well have prolonged the birthing but the pains were coming sharp and strong and the mouth of her womb was opening as it ought it would not be much longer maude tilted her head so minna could spoon honey into her mouth fighting back her queasiness you said she panted said it would take about twelve hours most often that is so my lady the midwife said and then grinned but this babe of yours is not willing to wait when minna briefly opened the shutters maude caught a glimpse of the darkening sky night was coming on the women did what they could to ease her suffering gave her feverfew in wine fed her more honey to keep her strength up brought a chamber pot when she had need of it blotted away her sweat cleaned up her bloody discharge prepared a yarrow poultice in case she began to bleed heavily and prayed to st margaret and the blessed virgin for mother and child in the distance a church bell was pealing was it a passing bell tolling the death of a parishioner a bell to welcome into the world a new christian soul or was it the sound of compline being rung maude had lost all track of time and then the midwife gave a triumphant cry i see the head hastily pouring thyme oil into the palms of her hands she knelt in the floor rushes at maudes feet gently massaging the babys crown maude braced herself upon the birthing stool groaning the contractions no longer came in waves she was caught up in a flood tide unable to catch her breath or reach the shore a voice was warning her not to bear down anymore hands were gripping hers and she clung tightly scoring minnas flesh with her nails her eyes were squeezed shut when she opened them again she saw her child wet head and shoulders already free squirming between her thighs into the midwifes waiting hands almost there my lady almost maude shuddered and jerked then sagged back on the birthing stool glory to god the jubilant midwife held up the baby red and wrinkled and still bound to maudes body by a pulsing bloodfilled cord a son she laughed my lady you have a son it was over the afterbirth had been expelled maude had been cleaned up and put to bed the women had bathed her son swaddled him in soft linen and called in the wet nurse to suckle him maude struggled not to fall asleep for theyd warned her it was dangerous so soon after the birth but she must have dozed for when she opened her eyes again geoffrey was standing by the bed he was smiling and after a moments hesitation leaned over and kissed her on the cheek you have given me a fine robust son he said you ought to be proud i am she said where is he i want to see him minna emerged from the shadows beaming and laid a swaddled bundle in maudes arms lord geoffrey is right my lady he is a fine little lad the baby was bigger than maude had expected and seemed to be a sound sleeper his skin was not as red now or as puckered maude touched his cheek with her finger and it was like stroking silk she was intrigued to see how much hair he had even by candlelight it held unmistakably coppery glints he looks like you she said and geoffrey peered intently into his sons small face you think so he asked sounding pleased maude the priest says he ought to be christened as soon as possible i think wed best have it done on the morrow maude nodded she was finding it harder and harder to stay awake but she was not yet ready to relinquish her son even for a few hours i suppose you still want to name him fulk after your father she said drowsily geoffrey looked at her then at the baby wellno he said and maudes lashes fluttered upward in surprise i know weve been quarreling over names but ive changed my mind you can name him maude i think youve earned the right maude did too thank you she said and smiled sleepily at her husband and son the baby chose that moment to open his eyes and startled them both by letting out a loud piercing wail they looked so nonplussed that the midwife and wet nurse started to laugh and it was then that minna opened the door and ushered robert ranulf stephen and matilda into the bedchamber maude was not a woman to find humor in chaos but for once she did not care about decorum or dignity cradling her screaming little son she said happily come closer so you can hear over his shrieks i want to present henry englands future king london england april it had been a day of chill winds and random rain showers a day that had offered but one wan glimpse of the sun and not even a hint of coming spring an oppressive damp early dusk had settled over the city and by the time sybil neared the river she was cursing herself for having mislaid her lantern for the night sky was starless and the narrow twisting streets were deep in shadow ahead lay the bridge as she approached it church bells began to toll off to the west st martin le grand was chiming the curfew sybil swore under her breath quickening her step for the city gates would now be closing fortunately the guards were young and she won their sympathy with a pretty smile a lie about seeking a leech for her fevered child she was the last one allowed through the gate out onto the bridge the wind was gusting the river surging against the wooden pilings and sybil was thankful when she reached the far shore turning west along the priory wall of st mary overy she headed toward the bankside londoners took pride in their citys ancient past stretching back a thousand years to londinium capital of roman britain southwarks history was more obscure but sybil suspected that it too had existed then luring roman soldiers across the river to drink gamble and sin long before normanfrench adventurers followed william the bastard into his newly conquered kingdom southwark was notorious a haven for fugitives and felons and those seeking whores ale or trouble southwark be it roman saxon or norman was no safe place for a woman alone even in broad daylight and now with the curfew bells still echoing across the river and every alleyway black as pitch every door bolted against thieves and drunken knaves sybil hastened along the bankside keeping to the center of the street for she knew the shadows hid watching eyes had it been daylight the bankside would have been teeming with raucous ribald lifewith peddlers beggars sailors from the quays pickpockets on the prowl prostitutes too old or ailing for the bawdyhouses foraging dogs hissing geese even a stray pig or two now the street was deserted mired in mud and strewn with rotting garbage detecting movement from the corner of her eye sybil whirled as a scrawny grey cat scuttled under a broken wagon wheel fiend take me she said ruefully if my nerves are not on the raw this night how is it that youre so stouthearted emma whilst im so skittish she got no answer but did not expect one for her daughters cheerful babble had yet to translate into recognizable words shifting the baby to her other hip she swerved to avoid a deep muddy rut in the road and it was then that the men stepped from the shadows barring her way what is your hurry sweeting the smile may have been meant to be ingratiating but it emerged as a leer and as he lurched toward her sybil caught the reek of cheap wine she had already marked out the other man as the more dangerous of the two and when he grabbed for her she sidestepped spun out of his grasp and backed up against the closest wall he smirked nowhere to run now wench he gloated and lunged only to halt abruptly blinking at sight of the slender blade that had suddenly materialized from under her cloak i do not give away free samples she spat put your stinking hands on me again and youll bleed like a stuck pig bitch he snarled but he kept his eyes on her knife kept his distance his partner was peering at sybil in blearyeyed confusion which slowly gave way to sheepish recognition sybil a pox on us wat shes one of the doxies from the cock the leer came back sorry lass we just meant to have a bit of fun you still can she said coldly as long as you pay for it thinking all the while not in this life or the next for they stank of sweat and grease and spilled wine and her gorge rose at the thought of their dirty hands and foul breath in her bed she knew better than to trust to the honour of thieves and kept her knife out and at the ready as she circled around them her heart was thudding and her face flushed but she moved at a deliberate pace seeking to appear unafraid for defiance had often proved to be as effective a weapon as her dagger in fending off rape they shouted after her making lewd offers and then obscene threats all of which she ignored but she did not sheathe her knife not until she saw ahead the whitewashed wooden houses of the southwark stews shed heard it said that the brothels were whitewashed so theyd be easily visible to wouldbe customers on the other side of the river and it was true that they stood out even on a moonless night like this one there were more than a dozen of these bankside bordellos unlike the protruding alestakes that hung over alehouses and taverns the brothel names were painted right on the buildings a crudely drawn crane or bell or crown passing the first three by sybil headed for the sign of the cock slipping in a side door the kitchen was a contraband chamber for bawdyhouses were prohibited from serving food or drinks but like most of the laws intended to regulate southwarks sin industry this one was sporadically enforced and tonight the cook was stirring a savory beefmarrow broth in a large cauldron dragging her makeshift cradle toward the hearth sybil put her daughter to bed after tucking in the blankets she lingered fishing out a freshly plucked goose feather for emma to suck upon loath as always to leave her child but then berta strode in youre late my girljesu not again this is no fitting place for a babe sybil how often do you have to hear it sybil was unimpressed by the bawds tirade they both knew that she was the cocks star attraction a neighbors lass usually looks after emma whilst im at work but she was stricken with toothache what would you have me do bertaleave a babe of seven months to fend for herself berta continued to grumble but without any real heat sybil knew there were stewholders who ran roughshod over their whores but neither berta nor her taciturn morose husband godfrey had a talent for tyranny sybil accorded them a casual sort of deference because it was politic to do so but she never doubted that in any clash of wills the stronger one would prevailhers giving emma one last quick kiss she shed her cloak and sauntered into the common room she did not like what she found there a surfeit of working women a dearth of paying customers it was she saw going to be a long night there were a few foreign sailors a drunken dockworker a nervous youth whom she dismissed as a serious prospect lads that young had the itch but rarely the money to scratch it the sailors were already snared sitting at a table with loveday sharing ale and bawdy laughter apparently not handicapped by their lack of a common language for they knew only norwegian and loveday like most of the southwark harlots was of saxon birth which meant that englishnot norman frenchwas her native tongue as sybil entered loveday gave her a wave between them they had the pick of the cocks clientele but their rivalry was a friendly one for they were rarely in direct competition they appealed to very different male needs loveday was a bigboned goodnatured country girl crude and bluntspoken with thick masses of untidy curly hair dyed yellow or gold or red as the whim took her she always looked somewhat disheveled breasts spilling out of her lowcut bodice so wellrouged that she seemed sunburned perfumed and powdered but none too clean there were many men though drawn by her brazen earthiness reassured by her easygoing approachability and for the others there was sybil tall and slender with small wrists and feet high breasts and unblemished skin so prideful and poised that a man could easily indulge in fantasy could pretend he was bedding a lady sybil poured herself some wine sat down at one of the trestle tables she felt no surprise when eve soon drifted over shed vowed not to take the younger girl under her wing she had enough on her plate as it was but eve a timid frail fourteenyearold newcomer to the stews needed no more encouragement than a lost scared puppy would and as she took a seat with a shy smile sybil grudgingly admitted to herself that she was stuck with yet another stray she was frowning over an ugly greenish bruise that was only partially hidden by the sleeve of eves gown when avelina pulled up a stool helped herself to sybils wine and announced glumly that she had missed her flux again time was never a friend to women in their precarious profession and tonight it was the enemy loveday went off with her sailors sybil suggested some herbstansy and pennyroyalthat avelina might try the drunkard in the corner spilled an entire flagon of ale and took it out on the little kitchen maid who fled in tears avelina was cheered by the arrival of a portly goldsmith one of her regulars but he was intercepted by jacquetta the fleming whod been blessed with blue eyes and long blonde hair but no scruples she had no qualms about stealing another girls customer as she proved now coaxing the goldsmith abovestairs before avelina could muster up an effective protest sybil ordered another wine flagon and they set about drinking in earnest for there seemed no better way to pass the hours but it was then that the door banged and their watchdog barked and the young lords swaggered in she could tell they were gentry sybil explained to eve by their swords and fine wool cloaks and bold manner did eve not see how berta and godfrey were fawning over them knightsno too young she amended most likely squires to some lord for that was how the norman highborn educated their sons sending them off to serve in great households first as pages and then as squires eve was fascinated sybil never failed to impress her by how much she knew of the ways of the world but her admiring glance went unnoticed sybil was coolly assessing these new arrivals as alert as a cat on the scent of prey for she well knew there was both danger and opportunity in any encounter with the highborn they would have money these young lordlings and theyd need no urging would be quick to spill their seed not like some of her customers who required tiresome coaxing to prime the pump she was fastidious by nature much preferred to couple with a body that was young and firm and reasonably clean and these cocky lads were more to her taste than aging merchants or unwashed sailors but if the rewards were greater so too were the risks what did a southwark whores wishes matter to a barons son who would object if he chose to maltreat a lowborn harlot who would even care they were coming her way now and sybil sat up straighter giving her bodice a discreet tug avelina and eve looked hopeful but the youths had eyes only for sybil and the two girls reluctantly withdrew leaving her in possession of the battlefield up close they were younger than sybil first thought seventeen or so she reckoned and as unlike as chalk and cheese a redhaired frecklefaced giant a swarthy handsome lad with glittering black eyes and a wiry youth of middle height whose most striking feature was his uncommon coloringdeepbrown eyes and sunstreaked fair hair he seemed at first glance overshadowed by his comrades lacking the redheads impressive stature or the others smoldering saracen intensity but sybil had noted that when they conferred with berta hed done all the talking and he was the one she favored with a provocative slightly wary smile we are seeking he said a lass who speaks french the stewmaster assures us that our hunt is over is it indeed i do speak french she said as ive just proved if you and your friends would like to join me mayhap we could discuss what else you are seeking this night he studied her for a moment more then he grinned and sybil thought god has been too good to you lad for with a smile like yours you do not need money too it transformed his face as if by some erotic alchemy a smile to cajole and disarm and bewitch and break heartsand shed wager that he knew it i am ranulf he said and my companions here are gilbert and ancel gesturing carelessly toward the redhead and the saracen in turn i believe the bawd said you are called sybil sybil nodded you sound as if that surprises you it was not what i was expecting ancel gave a snort of laughter why be so tactful what ranulf seems loath to say straight out is that your sisters in sin usually prefer to call themselves petronilla or mirabelle or rosamund fancy whore names sybilnow that sounds plain as dirt drab as homespun have you no more imagination than that sybils smile was so sultry that ancel saw only the promise not the mockery in a world full of cassandras and clarices a simple plain sybil is sure to be remarked uponand remembered ranulf was watching her approvingly dark eyes agleam with amusement i think he said that you are exactly what we are looking for sybil plain and simple ere you say that my lord ranulfyou are a lord i suspecti think we ought first to reach an understanding it would be my pleasure to entertain you and your friends but one at a time crowds are fine for fairs and markets not for beds and i bruise easily so i find it best to say this beforehand no games that involve whips or ropes or bleeding other than that i am amenable to suggestionsand can offer up a few of my own they seemed taken aback by her candor and she decided they were even younger than shed realizedsixteen at mostfor their lust was still a simple uncomplicated urge not yet shadowed by darker deviant needs ancel guffawed too loudly and gilbert actually blushed ranulfs mouth curved you are the one who does not yet understand mistress sybil we do not want you to play the whore we want you to play a nun although sybil was only nineteen she was sure shed long ago lost the ability to be surprised ranulf had just proved her wrong i am likely to regret saying this she said at last but tell me more ranulf relaxed flashing another of those beguiling grins it is quite simple truly we have a grudge to settle and with your help we can we are all squires in the household of robert fitz roy the earl of gloucester and ancel would have interrupted then but ranulf shook his head impatiently nay no false names ancel either we trust the lass or we do not and if not why are we still sitting here there is a knave in earl roberts service who is badly in need of a lesson his name is baldric fitz gerald and ill not lie to you he has powerful kin for he is a cousin to the earl of leicester and leicesters twin brother count waleran when baldric was a squire like us he well nigh drove us mad with his boasting and conniving now that he has been knighted he has become even more insufferable with earl robert he pretends to be a man of honour but he amuses himself by playing cruel tricks upon those who cannot defend themselveskitchen maids and stable lads and the pages in earl roberts service he calls me judas gilbert chimed in indignantly because of my red hair and when ancel got green sick the first time he had too much wine baldric made up a song about it sang it for a hall full of highborn guests he put a burr under ranulfs saddle whilst we were at the kings christmas court in rouen and brayed like a jackass when the stallion pitched ranulf into a mud wallow i know ranulf we cannot prove it but id wager any sum you name that he was the culprit ranulf shrugged clearly not pleased to have that particular memory dredged up again lets keep to what we can prove for certes i know he was molesting that little kitchen maid back in caen for i came upon her weeping afterward we know too that he caused the other servants to shun that stable groom with the red blotch on his face claiming it was the devils sign the way satan marked out his own the lad finally ran off and no one knows what became of him sybil was not sure how much of this she should believe she knew the king was still in normandy but earl robert could be back in london these norman lords made frequent trips to check upon their english estates from what ive heard of earl robert she said he is a decent sort and truly believes that a lord owes protection to the weak and powerless to christs poor why not just go to him tell him of this baldrics true nature they looked at her blankly as if shed suddenly begun to speak an unknown tongue there was much about the male mind that she found incomprehensible and nothing more so than the credo that menespecially young menmust settle their grievances on their own that it was somehow dishonourable to appeal to higher authority for help whatever was i thinking of well then tell me what part i am to play in this scheme of yours baldric is a hypocrite and a cheat and i think it time he showed his true colors to the rest of the world not just to his prey ranulf was smiling faintly but his voice held a sudden hard edge what i want he said is to see him publicly shamed his sins stripped naked for all to look upon i am beginning to understand sybil said looking at ranulf with new respect you make a bad enemy love few sins are as serious as seducing a nun the best part of this plan he said is that baldric will be the instrument of his own ruin he does not have to take the baitbut he will you need only lure him into a compromising position well provide the witnesses youll not even have to let him tumble you that is a pleasure the whoreson does not deserve he laughed then and sybil could not help herself she laughed too well he prompted what say you the cry was muffled quickly cut off but it had carried enough pain to swivel all heads toward the sound sybil saw at once what had happened bertadamn her grasping soulhad sent eve over to entice the drunkard abovestairs and eve had botched it for the girl was scared witless of drunks had yet to learn how to handle a man deep in his cups now she cringed back in her seat whimpering as her assailant turned upon her the full blast of his alcoholic rage sybil half rose only to sink back again they had a hireling to deal with drunks a huge clumsy bear of a man not too bright yet big enough to intimidate all but the most belligerent of troublemakers he was out sick though and godfrey as she well knew was not about to put himself at risk to protect a whore fighting back her anger she reminded herself that there was nothing she could do but then the drunk struck eve across the mouth and she jumped to her feet shouting for him to stop she did not expect the drunk to heed her nor did he but ranulf did as she watched in amazement he crossed the chamber in three quick strides grabbed the man before he could aim another blow and told him curtly to go home sleep it off it may have been his tone the echoes of rank and privilege it may have been the sword at his hip but he somehow penetrated the mans winesodden haze seeing that godfrey hurried over to offer some belated support and sybil sighed with relief sure now that the worst was over ancel and gilbert had kept their seats during the fracas now ancel gave a comical grimace winking at sybil i swear that lad could find turmoil in a cemetery usually he sucks us into it too and his heroic impulses have gotten me more bruises and black eyes than i care to count not that its entirely his fault the two men whove loomed largest in his life are earl robert and count stephen of boulogne good men both but robert is an earthly saint and stephenwell hes quite mad never happier than when hes rescuing damsels in distress or chasing after dragons to slay no wonder ranulfs grasp of the real world is so tenuous you might do well sybil murmured to follow in ranulfs footsteps you see women find heroic impulses very alluring indeedeven irresistible ancels smile flickered for a fleeting moment he wondered if she could be making fun of him but almost at once he dismissed the suspicion as preposterous women were invariably charmed by him the older ones mothered him and the younger ones flirted with him why should this bankside harlot be any different women already find me irresistible he joked sowhat say you sybil my sweet shall we pick a nuns name for you how about sister mary magdalene sybil saw no humor in the jest it was too obvious too heavyhanded but ancel and gilbert thought it was hilarious she waited patiently until they were done laughing and then said blandly alas i shall have to decline the honour they were dumbfounded by her refusal began to bombard her with perplexed queries and protests it is not that i am not tempted she admitted when they finally gave her a chance to respond for i am but the danger is too great what if this scheme went awry how could ranulf protect me from baldrics wrath if he is kin to an earl she stopped then for both boys were grinning widely they exchanged knowing looks and nudges before ancel said with just a trace of smugness ranulfs protection would shield you from the malice of a hundred baldrics he is much more than a squire to earl robert they are brothers sybils mouth dropped open and she twisted around to stare at ranulf who was making a gallant attempt to comfort the sobbing eve ranulf is one of the old kings bastards ancel nodded proudly king henry has sired so many he needs a tally stick to keep count of them all ranulf is the youngest but one born to a welsh lass the king fancied none would deny the king is a hard man but none would deny too that he tends to his own ranulf grew up at his court has wanted for nothing his mother died when he was just a lad and after count stephen wed the lady matilda ranulf was sent into his household as a page then when he turned fourteen earl robert took on his training as a squire the king is right fond of him would be willing to find him an heiress when hes of an age to wed but ranulf and my sister have been mad for each other as far back as i can remember and ranulf appears content to settle for whatever marriage portion my father can provide no one could ever fault his courage but his judgment leaves much to be desired especially in my choice of friends ranulf jeered reclaiming his seat and sybil saw that this barbed banter was their normal form of discourse are you done blabbing all my family secrets ancel if so id like to get back to the matter at hand this is what we had in mind sybil well lure baldric to some secluded spot mayhap out by holywell near the nunnery where you will be waiting you entreat his aidwell think of a plausible story for youand then you need only give him a few lingering looks the privacy and your beauty and his own vile nature will do the rest just in time well happen by with a few witnesses possibly a priest or two of course well have to wait till the weather warms up for not even baldric would be keen for futtering out in the mud and rain how wouldwhat you see a weakness in our plan sybil shook her head nay you have thought of everythingor almost everything ah of course ranulf smiled at her as if they were old and intimate friends while spilling coins out onto the table this seems a fair sum to me sybils eyes widened for hed casually offered three times what she might expect to earn for a nights work and in that moment she no longer doubted sure that ranulf had spoken only the truth for who but a kings son would be so lavish with his money this is most fair she agreed returning ranulfs smile that was not what i meant though i fear we have a problem that wants solving i cannot hope to convince baldric unless i well and truly look the part but wherever are we going to find a nuns wimple and habit ranulf and his friends left the city through bishopsgate headed north along the ermine way it was usually a welltraveled road the chief route to york but most wayfarers had already sought a nights lodging for dusk was encroaching from the west just moments before the sky had been veined with copperygold streaks it was now smudging with smokecolored shadows they passed few houses as most people felt safer dwelling within the city walls before the light had faded the countryside had been pleasant to look upon the fields and meadows green and lush in the first flowering of spring but the boys turned a blind eye to the pastoral beauty around them and welcomed the suns demise for theirs was an undertaking that needed darkness they rode in silence for the most part not reining in until they saw the priory walls looming up through the deepening twilight it was cloaked in quiet stretching from the road back toward the river walbrookthe augustinian nunnery of st john the baptist at holywell gilbert stared morosely at those mossgreen walls i cannot believe we are actually going to do this he muttered not for the first time that evening and the other two glared at him it is not too late to reconsider he insisted stealing from a nunnery is we are not thieves ranulf snapped we are merely going to borrow a nuns habit for a few days we will return it undamaged and with a goodly sum to aid in their almsgiving what harm in that but what if something goes wrong if what could go wrong ancel demanded our plan is too simple to miscarry it is not as if were tying to sneak into the dorter and snatch a habit from a sleeping nun we know the priory has spare habits on hand we need only find where they are kept most likely in the undercroft below the dorter where the chambress stores her linens and beddings the nuns will be asleep they go to bed as soon as compline is rung now i ask you gilbert what have we to fear from a convent full of sleeping nuns gilbert grinned reluctantly at that and ranulf leaned over punching him playfully on the arm what a comfort you are to us gib if i looked at life the dour way you do id not dare get out of bed in the morn why is it that you always expect the worst to happen most likely because the two of you keep concocting lunatic schemes like this but gilbert raised no more objections and once it was fully dark he hitched their horses in a nearby grove of trees settled down to keep a wary watch as his friends disappeared into the shadows surrounding the priory it proved to be as easy as ancel had predicted they had no difficulty in scaling the wall and detected no signs of life as they crept stealthily toward the church it was deserted and they moved swiftly through the nave out into the silent cloisters ancel was to be the lookout and took up position in one of the sheltered carrels as ranulf started along the east walkway he had no warning suddenly the dorters door swung open he froze as a woman appeared in the doorway what was she doing out here and then she gave a low whistle and ranulf swore softly a dog sweet lady mary she had a dog the church forbade pets but the prohibition was more ignored than obeyed and cats and small dogs were common occupants of english convents why had he not remembered that it was too late now for the nuns dog was shooting through the air swerving toward him in midstride barking shrilly ranulf kept his head spun around and ran for the slype the narrow passage that offered the cloisters only escape the dog was at his heels nipping at his boots and the nun had begun to scream he caught a blurred movement off to his left and spared a second or so to hope it was ancel retreating back into the church shutters were banging the dorter windows flung open but he was almost therejust another few feet and hed be on his way to safety it was then though that ranulf learned one of lifes uglier lessons that when luck starts to sour anything that can possibly go wrong does as he darted past the chapter house the door flew open and he collided with the priory chaplain who should have been abed in his own lodgings at such an hour the impact sent them both sprawling before ranulf could get his breath back the nuns lapdog landed on his chest sinking needlesharp teeth into his forearm but he was still sure he could get away for he was younger and far more fit than the priest kicking at the dog he rolled over and lurched to his feet just as the priorys porter came plunging through the slype cudgel raised to strike ranulfs shoulders slumped and he sagged back against the chapter house door he was well and truly caught by god might as well accept it with good grace he looked about at the chaos hed unleashed upon the cloistered quiet of this small peaceful priory looked at the snarling little dog and shrieking mistress the fearful faces peering down from the dorter windows the bewildered priest still scrabbling about on his hands and knees in the grass the hulking porter flushed and pantingand he suddenly started to laugh for this was lunacy beyond even gilberts dire expectations he saw at once that his laughter had shocked them and he struggled to contain his imprudent mirth to sound sober and serious and above all sincere that this was merely a vast and outlandish misunderstanding but then the porter shouted you misbegotten whoreson thief ill teach you to steal from god and swung his cudgel toward ranulfs head tower royal was one of londons most impressive dwellings as well it should be for it had been a kings gift presented to stephen at the time of his marriage to the lady matilda de boulogne the neighboring residents of watling street and cheapside were accustomed to noise and torchlight spilling over the manor walls stephen was a lavish host and whenever he was in london tower royal served as a magnet drawing to its hospitable hearth norman lords and their ladies officials of the court influential churchmen even some of the citys more prosperous merchants and ward aldermen for if stephen liked a mans company he was indifferent to whether that man was saxon or norman citizen or baron his goodnatured indiscriminate affability had subjected him at times to gossip and the disapproval of his peers but it had won him the hearts of londoners there was no man in the city more popular than he on this mild april evening he had entertained his younger brother henry bishop of winchester after a meal of roast duck and stewed eels henrys favorite foods they settled down to a game of chess and stephens wife politely excused herself from their company so they might talk of politics without constraint the bishop like so many of his fellow clerics felt that women were not meant to have a voice in matters of state matilda who had less malice in her nature than any of her sisters in christendom nonetheless found herself wondering occasionally how her brotherinlaw would cope once he must answer to a queenand an imperious one at that for those who knew henrys daughter knew too that maude would be no docile biddable pawn when god called her father to heavens throne maude would never be content merely to reign she would rule too on that her allies and enemies could all agree after leaving the hall matilda made a quick detour into the nursery where she did a loving inventory of the three small sailors adrift in a featherbed boat baldwin eustace and william their nights voyage was a peaceful one they were all sound asleep so too was the little girl in the corner cradle her baby her namesake blowing kisses to her brood matilda quietly withdrew back in her own chamber she dismissed her maid then sat down amidst the cushions in the window seat and began to unbraid her hair it floated about her like a veil of woven gold threads matilda was very proud of her hair and tended it with such diligence that her chaplain had chided her for vanity matilda had accepted the rebuke meekly enough as was her way but continued to brush and burnish her hiplength blonde tresses for she knew that scriptures said if a woman hath long hair it is a glory to her and that secret stubbornness was also her way the step was well known to her but she felt surprise nonetheless when she looked up for shed not expected her husband until the hearth had burned low stephen is the chess game done so soon i let henry win stephen said cheerfully ignoring the fact that he was a mediocre player at best and his brother a very good one i then begged off from a rematch explaining that i wanted to get abovestairs in time to watch my wife undress for bed matildas eyes widened oh stephen you did notand he a priest hed not like to hear you call him that my love for brother henry is one for holding fast to the least of his honours a bishop he is and would aim higher still have you not noticed how solicitous he is of our ailing archbishop mayhap thats why the archbishop always looks so uneasy around henry almost as if he were hearing vulture wings hovering overhead matilda clicked her tongue against her teeth ah stephen do be serious just this once you did not really say that to henry did you stephen laughed and dropped down beside her in the window seat marveling that after ten years of marriage and four children she still could not tell when he was teasing her mayhap i did mayhap not matilda gazed calmly into his eyes and then turned her head aside so hed not see her smile better i not know she said and sighed as he drew back her hair kissing the curve of her throat it gladdens me that you still find pleasure in looking upon my body even if id rather you not boast about it to men of the church indeed i do find pleasure in looking and in touching and caressing and stroking and fondlingwhat did i leave out he asked and when he laughed this time she did too hed lifted her onto his lap and shed gone soft and languid in his arms by the time a repeated rapping sounded on the door were not here stephen said loudly as matilda sought to muffle her giggles against his shoulder when the knocking persisted he got reluctantly to his feet ill get rid of them right quick he assured her and she watched as he strode across the chamber and opened the door after a brief exchange he turned with an apologetic smile it is my cousin ranulf and he says it is urgent ill have to see him tilda but not for long that i promise returning to the window seat he began to speculate what ranulf might want at such an hour he is a good lad but nary a day goes by without him getting into devilment of some sort most of which he manages to keep from my uncle the king did i ever tell you about the time he he got no further for the servant was back but the two youths being ushered into the bedchamber were strangers to stephen who in blazes are you the taller of the two came forward knelt and said hastily forgive us my lord for lying to you but we knew no other way to gain admittance my name is gilbert fitz john and this is ancel de bernay we are squires to the earl of gloucester and ranulfs friends he needs your help my lord stephen for he has been arrested stephen was surprised but not shocked for youthful sins were both expected and indulged provided that the sinners were highborn like ranulf what has he done an alehouse brawl the boys exchanged glances gilbert hesitated then blurted out nay it is far more serious than that ranulf was caught breaking into the priory of st john at holywell i very much fear hell be charged with attempted theft or even rape but it is not true i swear it he meant only to borrow a nuns habit there was a silence after that stephen and matilda shared the same expression one of utter astonishment but then the corner of stephens mouth quirked turning back to his wife he said i am sorry my love but i cannot keep my promise this is one story i have got to hear ranulf would not have believed it had he ever been told he could be afraid of the dark but hed never experienced darkness like this lacking the faintest glimmer of light as black as the pits of hell he was not alone an occasional rustling in the straw warned him of that mice he guessed or rats he stamped his feet to discourage any undue familiarity slumping back against the wall his manacles were rubbing his wrists raw and his head was throbbing but a headache was of minor moment when he considered what might have happened if hed not ducked in time hed have suffered much more than a grazed bloody scalp the porters cudgel would have split his skull like a ripe gourd he did not know whether it was a hopeful sign or not that hed been taken to the tower and not the gaol of london it might just be a matter of convenience the tower built by his royal grandsire was closer to the priory than the city gaol off to the west by the river fleet he was quite familiar with the tower for its upper two floors contained his fathers london residence and the chapel of st john but hed never expected to find himself confined in a small underground cell near the storage chamber hed never ever expected to be manhandled and shoved and treated like a felon his experience in the past few hours had taught himif the porters cudgel had not already done sothat his predicament held no humor whatsoever theft was a serious offense and stealing from god was a crime he could hang for he might also be charged with attempted rape for people would be quick to suspect the worst of a man caught at night in a nunnery ranulf tried to recall what hed heard about rape laws all he knew for certes was that it was a much more serious crime if a man forced himself upon a virgin and nuns were all virginssave an occasional widowbrides of christ ranulf knew of course that he held the key to his prison he need only speak up reveal his identity they were not likely to believe his story and who could blame them yet it would matter little whether they believed him or not it would be enough that he was king henrys son if he admitted who he was hed be freed but if he did his brother would have to know and ranulf could not bear that robert find out robert would never understand hed not even be angry just baffled and disappointed ranulf would not willingly disappoint robert for the very surety of his soul but as the hours crept by he found his common sensewhich argued for disclosureat war with his inbred optimism his illogical yet intense faith that all would somehow still end well he had time though to make up his mind for he did not think they would summon the towers castellan until the morrow he knew the man with an effort even prodded his memory into disgorging the nameaschuill what he did not know was whether aschuill would remember him well hed find out come morning one way or another leaning his head on his drawnup knees he made a halfhearted attempt to sleep but he was too tense too bruised too busy berating himself for not having heeded gilberts warning at least gib and ancel had gotten away surely theyd know better than to confess to robert pray god they did ifhe jerked his head up scarcely breathing as he strained to hear sounds in the stairwell the clanking of spurs against stone growing closer now and then there was a jangling of keys and the door was swinging open letting in a sudden spill of lantern light bright enough to blind ranulf blinked unable to see beyond its glare and struggled to his feet as he did a familiar voice said ive known men who put their lives at peril for gold or for lust and occasionally even for love but you lad are the very first to risk the gallows for a womans wool garmentand with the woman not even in it ranulf burst out laughing i do not think he confessed that ive ever been so happy to see anyone in all my born days it is just me lad stephen said wryly not the blessed angel gabriel he gestured then for the guard to unlock his young cousins irons and it took no more than thatthe most casual of commandsfor ranulf to gain his freedom although it was long past curfew the alehouse owner did not mind being roused from sleep the chance to do a favor for the count of boulogne was an opportunity not to be missed for the count would remember should he ever need a favor in return and if the city watch did appear he knew the count would send them away well content with a few coins and a bit of friendly banter so he hastily ordered his sleepy servant to pour ale and wine for the counts men while he himself brought a flagon to the counts table returning a few moments later with cold chicken from his own larder ranulf fell upon the chicken with gusto continuing his adventures between huge bites stephen interrupted only twice once to gibe that a full day in gaol would have brought ranulf to the very brink of starvation and once to ask how gilbert and ancel had gotten back to the city for the gates had been barred hours ago when ranulf explained that theyd bribed a guard at aldgate to let them in once they had the nuns habit stephen shook his head and predicted they would end up on the gallows unless they repented but his sermons impact was lessened somewhat by the laughter lurking beneath the rebuke ranulfs hunger was contagious and stephen soon helped himself to a drumstick your trouble lad is that you have too much imagination anyone else with a score to settle would have been content to slip a purgative into baldrics wine or glue into his boots and no those are not suggestions nowmay i assume that i need fear no more deranged plots to enliven baldrics days ranulf nodded summoning up a discomfited smile it will take a lifetime to repay you for tonight cousin stephen thank the lord christ that you happened to be in london saintly soul that i am i can never resist a chance to do good but i am curious why you did not ask robert for aid robert is the last man in christendom whom id want to know can you not imagine his shame at being told his brother had been arrested in a nunnery hed find no humor in it no sense at all and would likely end up blaming himself for my failings i suppose it is lucky for you then that i lack roberts moral superiority and incorruptible honour ranulf looked at the older man in dismay if i have offended you i am indeed sorry you and robert are both men of honour men i would follow to the very borders of hell if need be i meant only that you areless judgmental than robert that you find it easier to forgive daft sins like mine after a moment stephen shrugged doubtless that comes from my own misspent youth but ranulf was left with an uneasy impression that his cousins flare of jealousy had been no joke you and robertyou have been my family he said softly and somewhat awkwardly for he was no more accustomed than most males to sharing sentiment i am not faulting my lord father when i say that for he has been good to me butbut ive always felt as if i were confined to his outer bailey not allowed up into the keep itself stephen nodded my uncle is not an easy man to know but then he is a king lad and kings cannot be judged like other men ranulf leaned closer for wine and the nights harrowing events had loosened his tongue and he suddenly saw a chance to ask stephen what hed never dared to ask another living soul especially robert i know a king is bound to attract gossip like bees to honey the stories they tell of my fatherhow do i know which are true stephen and which are wicked lies stephen studied the boy have you any particular stories in mind ranulf ranulf almost lost his nerve then he squirmed in his seat reached for his wine only to set it down untasted is it true that he blinded his own granddaughters stephen did not respond at once seemed to be weighing his words and ranulf had never seen him do that before yes he said slowly he did it happened the year before the white ship sank ill see if i can try to make sense of it for you your father had wed his daughter juliane to a man named eustace de pacy and promised pacy that he could have the castle of ivry but henry was loath to lose it and he kept putting pacy off with promises to keep the peace it was agreed that pacy and ivrys castellan should exchange their children as hostages for each mans good faith unfortunately pacys good faith was not worth spit and he blinded the castellans son henry was so outraged by this treachery that he allowed the castellan to maim pacy and julianes two young daughters they were blinded and the tips of their noses cut off ranulf said nothing shocked into silence for hed not expected that tale to be validated as true stephen watched him then said quietly it was not that your father lacked pity lad they were but little lasses and his own blood kin but he felt men must be able to rely upon the kings sworn word he told me once that a kings greatest mistake would be to make a threat and then not carry it out ranulf nodded struggling to understand needing to give his father the benefit of any doubt but he could not help asking could you have done that stephen stephen drained his wine cup reached for the flagon and poured again no he said no lad i could not ranulfs appetite was gone and he pushed aside the rest of the chicken whatwhat of the stories of how he became king are they true too i do not know what youve heard stephen said adding with a forced smile and i am not sure i want to know when would he learn to look ere he leapt but the lad had a need to talk and it seemed harmless enough to indulge him so why were they of a sudden hinting at regicide ill tell you what i know stephen said reluctantly your father and others were hunting in the new forest with his brother the king william rufus was shot by mischancetook an arrow in the chestand died there in the woods he had no sons which meant that his crown would be claimed by one of his brothers robert was the firstborn but he was on his way back from the holy land and your fatherwell he was luckier for he was within riding distance of winchester where the royal treasury was kept he headed for winchester at a gallop and by sunset he was calling himself englands king as you know robert eventually challenged him and ended his days confined to the great keep of cardiff castle in south wales more than that i cannot say no man can ranulf looked intently into stephens face and then away stephen had deliberately drawn no conclusions offered no opinion of his own about henrys hunt for a crown for the words by mischance seemed dictated more by prudence than by conviction did stephen believe as many men did that william rufuss death had been too convenient to be a mere hunting accident but it was a question ranulf could not bring himself to ask nor in fairness expect stephen to answer is it true he asked instead that he abandoned william rufuss body in the woods rode off and left him ill not lie to you lad he did it does not sound very brotherly ill admit but do not make more of it than that all we can say is that it proves what we already knowthat men lust after crowns even more than they lust after women ranulf joined gratefully in stephens laughter relieved to return to safer ground for hed ventured further than hed intended better to backtrack for both their sakes do all men lust after crowns stephen do you ranulf my lad if you searched the length and breadth of england you might eventually find a man with no interest whatsoever in being its kingand if you did you could be sure he lied ranulf grinned youll probably think me truly demented then if i confess that id not want to be a king i would not want to be powerless mind you i want to be respected to have lands of my own and friends i can rely upon and annora de bernay as my wife but id rather serve the crown stephen than wear one i only wish it could have been yours stephen looked startled so did ranulf hed not meant to say that for it was a betrayal of maude and he loved his sister maude would not forgive me for this he said and i truly wish i had no qualms about her queenship mayhap if she were not wed to that angevin hellspawnbut she is even if it was not a marriage of her choosing she has the right to the english throne though a blood right and i will hold to my sworn oath accept her as englands queen and normandys duchess when that time comes but i will always harbor a secret reluctant regret that it could not have been you cousin stephen stephen was gazing into the bottom of his cup as if it held answers instead of wine all is in gods hands he said gravely we do what we must lad and hope that our inner voices speak true that we are indeed acting in the furtherance of the almightys will no man can do more than that i suppose not ranulf agreed somewhat hazily puzzled by the serious turn the conversation had suddenly taken stephen saw that and reached over clinking his wine cup to ranulfs let us drink then he said to the sanctity of nunneries bad luck to rogues and good fortune to a spirited southwark harlot named sybil ranulf laughed aye and may sybil and the good nuns and you my lord count of boulogne all prosper under the reign of queen maude he said atoning for his earlier disloyalty to his sister and raised his cup but stephen set his own cup down for he could not in good conscience drink to the queenship of his cousin a brave and honourable woman but a woman withal bernay normandy november the bernay family took its surname from the town that had sprung up around a benedictine abbey the bulk of raymond de bernays lands lay across the channel in england though for raymonds father had profited handsomely when normandys duke claimed by conquest the english crown but it had been many months since raymond had visited his english estates king henry had been dwelling in normandy for the past two years seemed in no hurry to return to his island kingdom and raymond thought it prudent to follow his liege lords example when the dogs began to bark raymonds daughter darted out the door into the bailey heedless of the snow and cold ranulf was just swinging down from his saddle when annora flung herself into his arms fool he laughed where is your mantle do you want to freeze are you saying you cannot keep me warm she laughed back at him and he took the dare kissing her with enough passion to keep the cold at bay at least until edith hastened outside and chased them both into the manor grumbling about such unseemly behavior annora had no memories of her mother whod died while she was still in her cradle but she could not remember a time when edith had not been part of her life nurse confidante mainstay she was quite unfazed though by ediths sermon she well knew the older woman would forgive her any sin under gods sky ranulf was equally unperturbed by ediths scolding for all that she freely sprinkled her conversation with rascal and young rogue hers was a bark that lacked bite edith was utterly delighted that her darling lass was to wed the kings son at least this was what she told annora for shed never admit that she found ranulfs ready grin and good humor as appealing as his royal bloodlines jesu forfend that annora ever suspect the shameful truth that she was a secret romantic with a weakness even now for a likely lad the bernays cook also had a fondness for ranulf and sent out a heaping platter of hot cheesefilled wafers as ranulf divided his attention between edith and the wafers annora fidgeted when her patience never in plentiful supply ran out she got to her feet so abruptly that she spilled ranulfs cider insisting that he accompany her outside to see the stable cats newborn kittens as excuses go it was pitifully thin only nuns and an occasional eccentric viewed cats as pets but edith waved them on indulgently for annoras elder brother fulk was due back that night and hed be far more vigilant about safeguarding his sisters virtue let her lamb and the lad have some sweet stolen moments together even if they could not be trusted to be prudentand in her heart she knew that discretion was an utterly alien concept to annoraat the very worst theyd just have to hasten the date for the wedding but she had no problems with that for her lamb was fifteen now old enough to be a bride a wife and mother ranulf and annora reached the stables in record time once they were safely within its sheltering shadows ranulf headed for the nearest bale of hay and drew annora down onto his lap pulling off her veil he reached under her mantle then began to kiss her upturned face by their societys rigid standards annora was no beauty for she bore no resemblance whatsoever to the tall willowy goldenhaired maidens so admired by their minstrels and poets fair maidens demure and docile and unfailingly deferential to male authority no bards would be singing annoras praises she was short and dark and stubborn and so volatile that her brothers called her hellcat so did ranulf but on his lips it became an endearment he wished now that he could have unbraided her hair when loose it put him in mind of a hot summer night so black and sultrysoft was it but that was out of the question he could not let her emerge from the stables looking like a wanton hair unbound and clothes askew what would be the measure of his love if he cared naught for her honour it had not been easy putting limitations upon their lovemaking but he meant for annora to come to their marriage bed a virgin even if his forbearance half killed him and at times he feared it might it was not that he believed theyd be sinning for he did not theyd been plighttrothed since the summer since annoras fifteenth birthday and a plight troth was almost as binding as a church ceremony it was not his sense of sin that had so far kept annora chaste it was his sense of honour annoras father trusted him allowed him to see her often and alone and ranulf could not bring himself to betray raymonds trust by seducing raymonds daughter however much he wanted tohowever much annora wanted him to thankfully their waiting was almost done her father was talking of a spring wedding ranulf was the one to end their embrace annora never made it easy for him i suppose he muttered that all this selfcontrol will stand me in good stead should i ever decide to become a monk a monk i thought you were aiming for sainthood annora gibed and then gave a squeal when he yanked her braid how long can you stay just till weeks end my father had a sudden urge to go hunting so monday off he went to his lodge at lyonslaforet with robert a handful of earls and a bishop or two when i reminded robert that bernay was only a days ride away he gave me leave to pay your respects to your betrothed ranulf quoted switching to a passable imitation of his brothers gravely deliberate tones i promised though to be waiting when they return to rouen on friday but well not be apart for long im sure your father plans to attend the kings christmas court does he not annora nodded of course who would miss it ahbut maude would it seems we heard she quarreled with your father that she then dared to leave rouen without his permission can that be true ranulf yes he said reluctantly but it was not a quarrel of maudes making my father had promised to yield some castles to her husband and geoffrey became convinced he was not acting in good faith so he seized them which vexed my father sorely theyve been squabbling about it all summer whilst maude sought to make peace betwixt them to no avail at last she wearied of all the strife and returned to geoffrey in anjou she ought not to have gone without bidding my father farewell but i can understand her anger annora my father forced her to marry geoffrey and for him now to berate her for geoffreys sins is unjust to say the least annoras mouth curved down sometimes i think youll be defending that woman with your dying breath why youre so fond of her ill never understand for no one else can abide her foul tempers and arrogance youre not being fair annora people are too quick to find fault with maude judge her too harshly it is true that she has ever been one for speaking her mind and mayhap such forthrightness is unseemly in a woman but i rather like it myself there is no pretense to maude she says what she thinks and means what she says as for her temper ill not deny she is quick to anger but if that be a sin it is one she shares with most of mankind and she is very loyal to those she loves do you remember me telling you about that remarkable dog i saw in paris last year it looked verily like a wolf but with a jaunty bushy tail curling over its back it belonged to a norwegian merchant and he said such dogs were common in his homeland known as dyrehunds that they were bold hunters able to track elk moose wolves even bears i do not care if they can chase down unicorns what do dyrehunds have to do with maude if youll curb your impatience youll find out i was much taken with the dog but the man would not sell it i happened to mention it to maude and she sent for the man secretly arranged for him to bring back two breeding pairs of dyrehunds on his next trip to oslo and surprised me with them on my birthday handsome beasts i cannot wait for you to see them but how many people would have done what maude did for me she has a giving heart and that should count for more than a sharp tongue annora was not convinced im glad she got you the norse dogs you fancied but the world is still filled with people who love that lady not at the mere thought of her queenship my father turns the color of moldy cheese i know how common such qualms are ranulf conceded weve never had a queen who ruled in her own right and the novelty of that scares a lot of people if only maude were not wed to geoffrey of anjou he may lack for scruples but not for enemies and every one of them is now maudes enemy too for they fear that hed share her throne as he does her bed poor maude she cannot win for when men are not berating her for her unwomanly willfulness they are accusing her of being geoffreys pawn how can she be both a virago and a puppet poor maude indeed she was born a kings daughter wed first to the holy roman emperor and then the count of anjou shes borne geoffrey two healthy sons shell one day be queen of england and duchess of normandy and the lord god saw fit to make her a beauty in the bargain there has probably never been a woman so blessed since eve woke up in eden ranulf grinned id say you were more blessed than maude after all youre going to marry me he said and stifled her riposte with a kiss what you say about maude is true enough annora but truth as my cousin stephen is fond of pointing out has as many layers as an onion peel away a few of them and you get a different truth a view of maudes life not quite so blessed she was sent to germany at age eight wed to a man nigh on twenty years her senior a man of black moods and brooding temper notorious for having betrayed his own father she somehow made a success of the marriage though and won the hearts of her husbands subjects too when she was widowed they wanted her to stay in germany so did she for shed learned by then to look upon germany as her home but my father insisted that she return to england and when she did he named her as his heir oh no to be burdened with a crownthat poor lass ranulf tweaked her braid again but the crown had a baited hook in it for he then forced her to wed geoffrey of anjou when she objected he confined her within his queens chambers under guard kept her there until she yielded i never knew that the king made maude a prisoner when ranulf nodded annora felt a twinge of grudging pity for maude her own upbringing had been one of indulgence and coddling as the youngest and the only girl in a family of sons ill admit that maudes marriage does sound like a match made in hell but they did in time make their peace did they not more like an armed truce it helped when maude gave birth to a son two years ago and then a second lad a year later both maude and geoffrey dote on the boys especially young henry their firstborn but for all that theyve iced over their differences a bystander could still get frostbite if he lingered too long in their company do you see what i am saying annora do you remember last summer when maude nearly died in childbirth she was stricken with childbed fever and for nigh on a week she suffered the torments of the damned i was there at rouen i saw her agony we were sure she was dying so was she and she told us she wanted to be buried at the abbey of bec but my fatherhe said no that he would have her buried in rouen even on her deathbed annora she was given no say annora reached up put her fingers to his lips i yield youve convinced me that some of maudes blessings have been bittersweet but i still think she brought much of her trouble on herself if shed not been so haughty if shed been more tactful more womanly ranulf laughed rudely like you sweetheart id back your claws against maudes any day annora pretended to pout i suppose youd prefer a meek little lamb like the lady matildaoh her hand flew to her mouth as if to catch her heedless words the gesture was affected but her remorse was real i ought not to have said that she said contritely my heart goes out to matilda ranulf truly it does i can think of no greater grief than the loss of a child ranulf nodded somberly and for a moment they both were silent thinking of the sudden death that summer of stephen and matildas son theirs was an age in which too many cemeteries held pitifully small graves one of every three children never even reached the age of five but baldwin had been their firstborn a lively clever nineyearold whose death had left a huge ragged hole in their lives their grieving was painful to look upon ranulf said sadly they buried him in london at holy trinity priory theyre in boulogne now ive seen them just once since their return theyll probably come to rouen though for my fathers christmas court indeed i do hope so mayhap it would cheer them somewhat being at the revelries he said with the wellintentioned misguided optimism of youth and sought to banish deaths spectre then by focusing all his attention upon the girl on his lap annora cooperated so enthusiastically that the shadow of stephen and matildas small son soon receded unable to compete with the lure of smooth female flesh soft curves and the fragrance of jasmine after a time they broke apart by mutual consent breathing deeply and smiled at each other ranulf had begun to stroke her cheek and annora gave a contented sigh as exciting as it was when the fire burned hot between them she also took pleasure in quiet moments like this for ranulf could be gentle too they talked idly of the upcoming christmas revelries and then annora related the latest paris scandal ranulf was not surprised that she should be so well informed about the bedroving of the french nobility annora adored gossip the way a child craved sweets but he was momentarily at a loss when she insisted now you owe me some good gossip in returnand it has to make me blush or it does not count ranulf pondered for a moment wellqueen adelizas confessor is said to be smitten with one of her ladiesinwaiting following the lass about like a lovesick swain ah ranulf ranulfyoull have to do better than that the church can preach chastity for its priests from now till judgment day and that will not change the fact that half the clerics in christendom have wives or hearthmates jesu what of the bishop of salisbury the old kings justiciar hes openly kept a concubine for thirty years even got their bastard son appointed chancellor no my lad youd best look farther afield for scandal catching wayward priests is like spearing fish in a barrel there is no sport in it ranulf laughed softly pulling her back into his arms well just have to make our own scandal then he said and began to kiss her again but the dogs were barking out in the bailey and they reluctantly drew apart hurriedly adjusting their clothing i suppose that will be fulk ranulf said glumly for there would be no dalliance with annora as long as her elder brother was on hand but the brother who now burst into the stable wasnt fulk it was ancel who should have been at lyonslaforet with robert and the royal hunting party ancel what are you doing here your brother sent me to fetch you straightaway it is your lord father ranulfhe was taken ill soon after we arrived at the hunting lodge how ill ancelhow ill ranulf repeated tensely for it had not escaped him that ancel had yet to meet his eyes that is for the doctors to say not me ancel said evasively but lord robert saidhe said for you to make all haste he said not to tarry ranulf sucked in his breath for he understood then what ancel was so loath to tell him they thought his father was dying when ranulf had assured robert that bernay was just a days ride from rouen hed stretched the truth somewhat it was thirty miles more or less and indeed a hardriding traveler could cover the distance in one daya summers day travel on rutted and icy winter roads was a far riskier and slower venture ranulf knew though that he was racing death and he and ancel spurred their horses without regard for their safety making their way by glimmering lantern light as darkness fell when they halted it was only to rest their lathered mounts but their reckless breakneck dash through the frozen december countryside still took them all night and most of the following day they reached the hunting lodge at dusk only to learn that ranulfs father had died at dawn having completed his prayer for his fathers soul ranulf got stiffly to his feet and stood staring down at his fathers body henry seemed at peace ranulf had been assured that hed died in gods grace shriven of his sins by the bishop of rouen ranulf fervently hoped it was so but his treacherous memory refused to cooperate conjuring up shadows of his fathers blinded maimed granddaughters the ghost of a king slain mysteriously in the new forest a brothers body abandoned in the woods whilst henry raced for winchester to claim a crown even if his father had sincerely repented all his earthly misdeeds a lengthy stay in purgatory seemed a foregone conclusion it was odd he could have been looking upon a stranger why was he so calm so queerly detached he felt exhausted numbed regretful that hed not been able to bid his father a final farewell but his sorrowing was muted his eyes were dry the door opened quietly behind him robert looked tired and tense but composed ranulf glanced at his elder brother then back at the dead man thinking of adeliza his fathers queen would she weep for henry would any eyes it was a disturbing thought that a man could wield great power as gods anointed on earth he could rule an empire and yet leave none to mourn him when he died people will say they grieve for him he said softly but they will be lying hell be forgotten even ere he is buried for mens thoughts are already turning to tomorrow to maude it sounds mad to say this robert for i knew he would die one day and i knew too that hed not change his mind about the succession so why does it come as such a surprise that he should die or that maude should be queen ranulf considered both i think robert was quiet for a time in that lad id wager youre not alone he said and ranulf turned gave him a startled searching look half fearful of what he might find if even robert was so troubled by their sisters coming queenship it did not bode well for maude for england men might not mourn his father but thered be many whod dread his death dread the unsettled times that lay ahead ive been praying for papa robert but mayhap we ought to be praying too for maude he said sounding so uneasy and so earnest that robert reached out let his hand rest briefly on the boys arm a gesture that ranulf found both surprising and bracing for robert was as reticent as maude about open displays of affection i think lad robert agreed that it would not be amiss to pray for maude and whilst you are at it pray too for england angers the ancient capital of anjou was bisected by the river maine but the heart of the city beat upon the east bank for there was to be found the abbey of st aubin the great cathedral and the hilltop castle where generations of angevin counts had dwelled and died it was toward the castle that ranulf rode bringing his sister roberts letter bringing the news of their fathers death maude already knew ranulf saw that as soon as he was ushered into the great hall she wore the somber shades of mourning and her demeanor was solemn as befitting one newly bereaved but her eyes were as dry as ranulfs own she welcomed him with the aloof dignity that public decorum demanded her pleasure at seeing him revealed only in the slight curve of her mouth the alacrity with which she suggested that they withdraw to her private chamber once they reached her bedchamber maude sent a servant for wine and then turned to ranulf taking his hands in hers i am so glad that youve come she said were you with papa when he died no ranulf said regretfully but robert was and he handed her their brothers letter because he did not know what robert had written he told maude then what he had learned about their fathers death he was stricken on monday eve the th of november after eating a heaping plateful of stewed lamprey eels and died early the following sunday maude had begun to read roberts letter but at that she slanted a sudden glance in his direction lamprey eels she said shaking her head the doctors warned him time and time again that he ought not to eat them of course he paid them no heed neither of them took notice of the opening door assuming it was a servant with the wine well if it is not the little brother the voice was lowpitched and would have been very pleasing to the ear if not for the suggestion of smugness echoes of the mockery that insinuated itself into geoffreys every utterance ranulf doubted that he could even pray to the almighty without sounding disrespectful the sight of you gladdens me too geoffrey he said sourly for hed long ago learned the futility of squandering courtesy upon maudes husband geoffrey seemed amused by ranulfs sarcasm it vexed ranulf enormously that his sisters husband never took him seriously enough to quarrel with he watched sullenly now as geoffrey sauntered over grazed maudes cheek with a careless kiss while glancing covertly at the letter she held open in her hand maude casually shifted the letter did you want anything in particular geoffrey why i was looking for you dear heart he said blandly i was told your brother had arrived alas i was not told that it was the wrong brother what do you mean by that i should think my meaning would be obvious robert ought to have come himself rather than send this green lad you are after all more than his right beloved sister now youre to be his queen it infuriated ranulf to hear himself dismissed as a green lad for the age difference was not that great he was seventeen to geoffreys twentytwo even more did he resent the slur upon robert and he said hotly robert still had duties to perform for our father he had to escort the body back to rouen and then go to falaise for my father had instructed him to withdraw sixty thousand pounds from the royal treasury to pay the wages of his servants and soldiers and give alms to the poor that they might pray for his soul geoffreys mouth quirked if he thought to bribe his way past heavens gate i daresay he found that even sixty thousand pounds would not buy him prayers enough hed have been better off spending the money to earn himself some goodwill amongst the devils minions ranulf gasped but maude put a restraining hand upon his arm you would know more about pleasing the devil than most men the counts of anjou trace their descent from lucifers daughter do they not geoffrey was not offended her name is melusine seeing their blank looks he added helpfully the devils daughter who wed one of my ancestorsher name was melusine i have the utmost trust in robert maude said very coolly and geoffreys smile became a smirk you trust the sainted robert you trust cousin stephen you trust young ranulf here and god knows how many others in that flock of bastard brothers of yours dear heart it pains me to say this but youre as free with your trust as a whore is with her favors and you run the same risk that the whore does for men hold cheaply what comes to them too easily the same can be said for your advice geoffrey i might value it more if you offered it less geoffreys eyes narrowed and ranulf shifted uncomfortably all his sympathies were with maude it still was no fun though to be caught in their crossfire but at that moment a servant entered with the wine dispelling some of the tension geoffrey and ranulf drank in a less than convivial silence as maude conferred with the servant once the man had withdrawn she smiled at ranulf since you missed dinner ive instructed the cooks to prepare an uncommonly lavish supper this eve in your honour i told them to serve baked pike stuffed with chestnuts for that is a favorite of yours no ranulf nodded pleased that she should have remembered but geoffreys brows shot upward shall you be up to it you must not be alarmed ranulf if your sister bolts the hall in the midst of the meal other women suffer from morning sickness when they are breeding but maude is as ever a law unto herself and her queasiness comes at night ranulf swung around to stare at his sister you are with child maude nodded and geoffrey moved to her side striking the playful pose of a proud fathertobe he might even be sincere ranulf allowed grudgingly for to give the devil his due geoffrey did seem fond of his sons as he looked at them now ranulf could not help admiring the picture they presented for whatever else might be said of them they made a very handsome couple handsome was a word often applied to geoffrey for not only was he taller than most men hed been blessed too with an athletes build and a cats grace his hair color was a bronzed reddishgold his eyes a compelling shade of bluegrey fringed with thick tawny lashes eyes agleam with sardonic humor boundless confidence and a sharp calculating intelligence yet not a hint of warmth as for maude ranulf had to acknowledge that her youth was gone for she was thirtythree past a womans prime but her age had not yet impaired her ability to turn male heads like annora shed been cursed with unfashionable coloring she had inherited her fathers dark hair and eyes but she was more fortunate than annora in that her skin was fair and flawless and her features so finely sculptured that none could deny her beauty no man looking upon the high curve of her cheekbones or the red fullness of her mouth was likely to care that her eyes were brown indeed a handsome couple but did they think so did they find each other as desirable as others found them for a moment ranulf tried to imagine what it would be like making love to a woman he loathed it was not an appealing prospect and he decided that hed not have traded places with geoffrey or maude for all the crowns in christendom how lucky he was to have annora tosuddenly becoming aware of the silence he saw that they were staring at him and he flushed in embarrassment looking hastily away lest they somehow read his mind well are you not going to offer your congratulations geoffrey was shaking his head as if lamenting ranulfs bad manners but ranulf had an uncomfortable suspicion that his brotherinlaw knew what hed been thinking he stammered an apology belatedly wished them well and was greatly relieved when geoffrey headed for the door as soon as they were alone ranulf smiled at his sister eager to make amends i am right glad about the babe he lied when is the birth not for months yet not till the summer her smile did not linger and ranulf found himself wondering if she feared the coming birth he did for certes remembering that harrowing week in rouen that was not something he could ask her though a faint frown had settled across her brow the brown eyes were opaque inwardlooking but then she said briskly the timing could not have been worse could it the english are already skittish about being ruled by one who wears skirts somehow i suspect the sight of a swelling belly beneath those skirts is not likely to reassure as always ranulf was impressed by her candor well he said they shall have to get used to it and i may as well confess that im looking forward to watching as certain highflying lords get their wings clipped so was maude anyone in particular the earl of chester amongst others hes made no secret of his reluctance to take orders from a woman think how gladdened hell be to grovel before one great with child chester is not a man to grovel lad not even to god but he will pay me the debt he owes his sovereign one of obeisance and fealty and homage they all will ranulf felt a surge of admiration strong enough to let him forget his own past qualms about her queenship how many women could face such a formidable challenge with so much fortitude for that matter most men would have been daunted too by the demands that were about to be made upon his sister your coronation will be but the beginning your greatest trials will be still to come maudedoes it not scare you at all knowing the troubles that lie ahead scare me she echoed sounding genuinely surprised ah no ranulf i do not fear i know it will not be easy i know there will be men whod be content that i merely reign not rule but i will ruleby god i will the crown of england is a burden and a blessing and my birthright to me it means she paused and ranulf waited curious to hear how she would complete the sentence power duty opportunity but then she smiled a smile he would long remember for it was the smile of a hopeful eager young girl not a woman widowed and disenchanted and wretchedly wed it means she said freedom supper that evening was as sumptuous as maude had promised her cooks had to confine their menu to fish for the season of advent was upon them but they did themselves proud with ranulfs pike gingered carp white trout in mustard sauce almond rice roasted apples marzipan and cinnamon wafers all washed down with ample servings of spiced red wine hippocras and malmsey afterward maude told ranulf of her plans she meant to depart on the morrow for normandy the vicomte guigan algason had sent word that he wanted to do homage to her for his holdings in argentan domfront and exmes she would be pleased she added to have ranulf at her side upon her entry into argentan ranulf assured her that he would be honored to witness algasons submission to his new duchess and then asked as tactfully as he could if geoffrey would be accompanying them to his vast relief maude said that geoffrey had agreedfor the presentto remain in angers ranulf could not say so of course but he thought that was a shrewd tactical move the norman barons would be much more likely to acknowledge maudes suzerainty if she was not encumbered by the unwelcome presence of her detested angevin husband thank the lord christ that geoffrey was choosing to be so accommodating to get maudes reign off to the best possible beginning but how long was his cooperation likely to last and how could they stop him when he decided to take his rightful place at her side as husband consortor even god forbid king i have been trying to decide which of my lords i can rely upon and which of them will seek to take advantage of me if i let them hear me out ranulf and see if you agree with my conclusions ranulf nodded enormously flattered that maude should see him as a worthy confidant im no soothsayer but id wager i can name the chief prop of your throne he predicted unable to resist this small jab at geoffrey robert robert maude echoed robert first and foremost and then my uncle david i am indeed blessed that my lady mother was sister to the scots king there are others too who will do whatever they can to make my throne secure my cousin stephen of course stephens elder brother theobald has rarely set foot in england his interests are firmly rooted in his own domains and the youngest brother the bishophe is too ambitious to be truly trustworthy as for our brothers rainald is quite able can be of great help as long as he reins in that runaway temper of his and then there is brien fitz count you remember brien do you not ranulf ranulf thought he did the lord of wallingford castle maude nodded he is a good friend of stephens and like stephen he is a man of honour he was utterly loyal to my father treated almost as a foster son and i trust he will be just as loyal to me geoffrey had drifted over in time to catch maudes declaration of faith in brien fitz count there is that word again trust passing strange how often it crops up in your conversation dear heart maudes mouth thinned but a ceasefire however precarious was to be preferred to outright marital warfare that was a lesson shed learned the hard way then she said to please you geoffrey we shall now speak of those i do not trust the earl of chester his halfbrother william de roumare that selfseeking constable of the tower geoffrey de mandeville waleran and robert beaumont ah yes the beaumont twins double trouble but geoffreys humor was wasted on ranulf and maude was turning away to hear a servants murmur a messenger has just arrived she said from england from brien fitz count did i not tell you that brien would be amongst the first to declare his allegiance to his queen left alone with geoffrey on the dais ranulf concentrated upon his wine cup trying to ignore his brotherinlaws amused gaze but geoffrey was impossible to ignore sotell me ranulf have you forsworn eating lamprey pie ever again it is one of my favorite dishes i confess but it would have been in bad taste i suppose to have served it tonightso soon after your fathers unfortunate eel encounter ranulf gritted his teeth until his jaw ached geoffrey was entertained by his silent struggle for control but he knew it was a losing battle knew how easy it would be to fire the lads temperalmost too easy for it was already smoldering he was getting ready to fan the flames when ranulf stiffened half rose in his seat maude geoffrey turned puzzled and then forgot about badgering the boy at sight of his wife maude had spun back toward the dais all the color gone from her face a parchment crumpled in her hand christ jesus woman what ails you geoffrey came down the dais steps in two strides for in seven turbulent years of marriage hed never seen maude look as she did now vulnerable ranulf was even faster reached her first maude what is it what did brien tell you maude looked blindly at him her eyes wide dark and dazed stephen she stopped swallowed he has claimed the english throne she said with the unnatural calm the dulled disbelief of one still in shock there was a moment of stunned silence then geoffrey spat out an extremely obscene oath and ranulf cried no that cannot be it must be a mistake for stephen would never do that maude never maudes hand clenched into a fist shredding briens letter with fingers that shook but he did she said tautly god rot him ranulfhe did she drew a ragged betrayed breath stephen has stolen my crown tower royal london england december the storm raged in from the west assailing london with stinging rain and sleet christmas festivities were muted in consequence for the city was soon swamped in mud buffeted by frigid wet winds all people of common sense were keeping close to their own hearths and the streets were deserted as a small band of armed horsemen splashed up cheapside the woman they escorted was muffled in a dark travelstained mantle and hood attracting no attention from the few passersby they encountered they would have been startled indeed had they known they were looking upon englands new queen matildas arrival at tower royal caused quite a stir she was supposed to be in boulogne even in crisis though she clung to her good manners for making a scene was her concept of a cardinal sin shedding her wet muddied mantle she dealt patiently with the flustered servants saw to the needs of her weary rainsoaked escort and then she squared her small shoulders bracing herself for whatever lay ahead for whatever stephen might tell her of his mad perilous quest for a crown she found her husband in the great hall surrounded by boisterous jubilant joking men she very much doubted that they were celebrating the birth of the holy christ child and she drew a sharp shallow breath one of relief mingled with unease and a twinge of regret so stephen had won she was suddenly sure of that for she knew these menhighborn lords all not ones to link themselves to a losing cause waleran and robert beaumont sprawled by the hearth like two huge lazy mastiffs goodnatured until they caught the scent of blood the everelegant geoffrey de mandeville sitting aloof in the shadows hugh bigod boastful and winebesotted simon de senlis a man whod let a family betrayal sour his outlook and his life he was the stepson of the scots king and david had claimedwith the connivance of his wife simons motherthe english earldom that should have been his that of huntingdon by throwing in with stephen so soon he no doubt hoped to recoup some of his lost lands at davids expense and conspicuously close by stephens side the bishop of winchester his brother as always the sight of them together made her think of changelings of babies switched at birth so unlike were they her stephen tawnyhaired and longlegged utterly at ease in his own body looking at least a decade shy of his thirtynine years years hed somehow shrugged off onto henry who was paunchy and stoopshouldered pale hair already starting to recede henry who lacked stephens grace and easy charm but whose wits were as sharp as any to be found in christendom henry whose ambitions soared higher than hawks far above his brothers earthbound dreams the kingmaker it was geoffrey de mandeville who noticed matilda first he was not a man to miss much i thought he said that you left your lady wife behind in boulogne i did stephen said i could not put matildas safety at risk so we agreed she would wait until i knew if my claim would prevail why but as he glanced toward mandeville he saw his wife standing in the doorway matilda astonishment kept him in his seat for a moment or so and then he was on his feet crossing the hall in several strides to sweep matilda into his arms i could wait no longer she confessed i had to come stephen had to find out for myself what was happening stephens smile was more expressive than any words could have been revealing not only his triumph and pride but his sense of wonder too that it had been so easy but he was denied the privilege of telling her himself for his brother was quicker saying with a smile your womanly fears were for naught matilda my dear you are now looking upon gods anointed stephen was crowned at westminster three days ago matilda gasped so fast as that she blurted out and then blushed when the men laughed feeling like a fool speed was essential after all in a race for a disputed throne with your permission my lord husband she said softly taking refuge in a familiar role id best change these wet clothes the men watched approvingly as she departed the hall for matilda was their societys embodiment of female perfection a great heiress who was also pretty fertile sweettempered and submissive but the bishop had no high regard for wives perfect or not and his eyes an odd smoky shade neither blue nor grey narrowed upon matildas slim fragile figure as she disappeared into the shadows of the stairwell amazing he said slowly truly amazing most men would have balked at a winter channel crossing i am astounded stephen that the lass dared to take such a risk and yes dismayed too for such foolhardiness does not bode well for the future i think you ought to take her to taskgently of coursefor acting on her own like that trust me that is not a habit youd want her to cultivate women can be headstrong foolish creatures especially if they lack a firm male hand on the reins he raised a few eyebrows a man would have used that supercilious tone with the old king but once stephen now showed himself to be more tolerant than his royal uncle he seemed more amused than offended by the lecture what astounds me brother henry is how a man so learned can have such glaring gaps in his education you speak at least three languages fluently and yet you can understand women in none of them nowim sure you gentlemen can amuse yourselves quite well without me as much as i enjoy your company he said grinning i much prefer the company of the lady awaiting me abovestairs waleran beaumont waited until stephen was out of hearing range then leaned confidentially toward the bishop is it wise my lord bishop to apply the spurs so soon a clever rider lets the horse get accustomed to his weight in the saddle first ill not deny that i shall be offering my advice freely to my brother the king and indeed i trust mine will be a voice he heeds as i speak for the holy church and of course you would not want any rivals for the royal ear least of all one who shares the kings bed i daresay you gave her nary a thought until now but suddenly the timid little wife does not seem quite so timid or so trifling does she but then what would a priest know of pillow talk and if you do by all thats holy youd best not own up to it waleran guffawed at his own jest so did his brother and the bishop blistered a glance between the two of them he had long harbored contempt for waleran and robert beaumont privately dubbing them the norsemen for they were as fairhaired and brash and bold as the viking raiders of ancient lore men of loud laughter coarse humor and earthy pleasures but his disdain had led him astray he saw that now saw how it had distorted his judgment waleran beaumont was brazen and selfseeking but he was not stupidfar from it he would bear watching he and his churl of a brother stephen must be guarded lest he fall prey to beaumont snares i am sure the queen would never think to meddle in matters of state i would that i could say as much for you my lord walerans good humor was no pose his temper was not easily kindled he found it hard therefore to understand men like the bishop prickly and readily provoked as puffed up he thought as any barnyard cock a pity the bishop was so greedy for there were spoils enough for all but if this conniving priest thought hed cheat the beaumonts out of their fair share hed soon regret it stephen wasthankfullya different sort of man altogether not one to forget his friends meddling he said cheerfully is much like whoring one of those sins too sweet to forswear waleran and his brother both laughed at that the bishop did not i will not permit you to take advantage of the kings goodwill his trusting nature henry warned his voice cutting enough to pierce the beaumont complacency waleran scowled but before he could retort in kind geoffrey de mandeville began to laugh just out of idle curiosity my lord bishop how do you mean to do that he queried turning upon them glittering dark eyes full of mockery we might as well be candid our choice was between maude who listens to no one and stephen who will listen to anyone as to which flaw be worse only time will reveal but i can tell you now which one is like to be the most profitable he said and laughed again he laughed alone though the other men were all glaring at him a suspicious tense silence settled over the hall as stephens first christmas as king drew to an uneasy end matilda had not permitted any of her ladiesinwaiting to accompany her as she had not known what might await her in england with no one to help her undress she had difficulty unfastening the wet lacings of her gown finally freeing herself from its sodden folds she dragged a chair close to the fire began to unbraid her hair with fingers that shook she was exhausted for it had taken almost three days to cover the seventy mudrutted miles from dover but she couldnt go to bed yet not until stephen came to her when he did she gave him no chance to speak first are you angry with me for not waiting in boulogne angry my darling i am delighted taking her hands in his he smiled down at her with so much pride that she felt tears prick against her eyelids i only wish sweetheart that youd gotten here three days ago in time to be crowned with me but no matter youll have your own coronation tilda as splendid as i can make it that i promise what of easter would that please you shed just been offered a crown but her dreams had never been of thrones stephen why did you not tell me tilda there was no time i had to sail with the tide for england even a single days delay could have tipped the scales against me she shook her head unwillingly remembering that dreadful scene in their bedchamber at boulogne remembering her disbelief her scared sense that the world had suddenly gone spinning out of control listening as stephen hurriedly explained that his uncle the king was dead and he was departing for england within the hour that he meant to claim maudes crown for himself i am not talking of thatthat day why did you keep your intent from me you obviously laid your plans long before the old kings death yet you said nary a word to meme your wife why stephen why we decided it was best that you not know beforehand he saw her face change and said hastily of course i trusted you matilda but i knew how youd worry and i wanted to spare you that if i could she could not help thinking that hed kept silent too lest she try to talk him out of it we decided she echoed i assume you are not using the royal we so who then your brother the bishop stephen stared at her for that was as close as shed ever come to sarcasm yes he acknowledged henry felt from the first that our uncle ought to have named me as his heir i do not say this to disparage maude for im sure she would have done her best but no woman could rule as a man must my uncle was mad to insist upon maude scriptures tell wives to submit themselves unto their husbands tell women to keep silent in the churches so how could it ever be gods will that a woman should wield royal power the words were stephens but she knew whose voice she was really hearing and so you and henry were ready when the king died he nodded three weeks from my uncles death to my coronation that is all it took just three weeks surely that says much matilda about the mood of the realm no one wanted maude to rule sweetheart you know they did not there was no great rush into anjou after my uncle died was there a number of lords at once sought out my brother theobald though and i think it is safe to assume they had more in mind than telling him of the kings death the sainted robert was with them by the way when they got word that they were too late that i had been recognized as king some of them i heard had even urged robert to claim the crown himself he left unsaid that robert had turned the offer down matilda bit her lip waiting until she was sure she too would leave it unsaid andand did it all go as planned when i landed at dover i was told there had been trouble at the castle indeed there was they refused me entry and so did the garrison at canterbury not so surprising i suppose since theyre roberts castles but still not the most auspicious beginning to my quest stephens smile was rueful thank god for the londoners if not for their heartfelt support the warmth of their welcome my hopes might well have withered right on the vine from london i rode to winchester where henry was waiting with my uncles justiciar they recognized the validity of my claim and handed over the royal treasury that left but one hurdle to overcome the qualms of the archbishop of canterbury for he too had sworn that oath to maude so you reminded him that the church does not enforce oaths sworn under duress it was easy enough to hazard such a guess for what other argument could he have made you pointed out that none of you gave those oaths freely that the old king would brook no refusal and obviously you convinced him stephen surprised her then by shaking his head no he said slowly not at first his reluctance was painfully apparent but she was prepared to wait as long as necessary their eyes met briefly before his slid away faint patches of color suddenly stood out across his cheekbones it was hugh bigod who persuaded him he said at last he told the archbishop that hed been with the king at lyonslaforet that the king named me over maude as he lay dying matilda was shocked was it true the color was more noticeable in his face now why should it not be true all know how hed quarreled with maude ere he died he gave her one quick sharp glance frowned at what he found and then admitted tautly i do not know did not ask oh stephen matilda could not hide her dismay for perjury was a far greater sin than a disavowed oath what have you done shed not meant to speak the words aloud but there was no calling them back he flinched and then stepped forward grasping her by the shoulders and compelling her to look up at him what have i done i have spared england a disastrous reign one that was likely to end in bloodshed can you truly imagine men like chester and the beaumonts submitting to a womans whims obeying a womans commands theyd have defied her with impunity for what could she dotake the field against them can you tell me in all honesty matilda that you wanted to see maude as englands queen no she whispered you know i did not it was an unfinished sentence but he did not seem to notice his grip eased on her shoulders and some of the tension left his face i will be a good king tilda he said that i do swear to you upon the life of our son our son who will be king after me tell me you believe that she nodded mutely with no hesitation for as much as she cherished honour she cherished stephen more and she understood now his need his own inner doubts about what hed done such doubts could not be left to fester like proud flesh they must be cut away that much she comprehended of power and the conscience of kings sliding her arms up his back she rested her cheek against his chest i love you she said not knowing what else to say but it was what he needed to hear and his arms tightened around her she almost told him then of her own news that she was with child again she would be conjuring up a ghost if she did thoughbaldwin their firstborn who would never know his father had been crowned as englands king she clung to stephen thinking of her dead son and the baby now growing within her body a secret she chose to keep to herself for a while longer to keep safe stephen was stroking her hair smoothing it back from her face i bear maude no ill will he said i understand her disappointment and her anger and blame her not for the fault lay with my uncle who ought to have known better it is my hope tilda that maude will come to accept my kingship and when she does i shall make her most welcome at my court shall do all in my power to mend the rift between us matilda tried to imagine maudes humbling herself to stephentried and failed do you truly think maude will ever accept your kingship love she asked dubiously and stephen gave her a quizzical smile what other choice he asked does she have normandys lower capital was swathed in a wet february fog it clogged the narrow muddied streets obscured the skyline of soaring church steeples and muffled the normal noonday sounds so that caen seemed like a city asleep as if night had somehow come hours before its time from his vantage point in an upperstory window of the castle keep ranulf should have had a sweeping view of the town and its twin rivers but when he jerked back the shutters all he got was a surge of cold air a glimpse of grey robert glanced over at his wife and then got slowly to his feet id hoped i could make you understand lad but ranulf spun away from the window understand not in this lifetime how can you do it robert how can you recognize stephen as king how can i not all have accepted him ranulf even maudes uncle the scots king has come to terms with stephen if i alone continue to hold out my defiance will cost me more than i can afford to lose unless i agree to do homage he will declare all my lands forfeit let him at least youd still have your honour that was too much for amabel honour is a right tasty dish too especially when served with mustard is that what youd have us feed our children ranulf robert shook his head almost imperceptibly and amabel subsided albeit with poor grace think you that i want to yield to stephen he demanded and for the first time his voice held echoes of anger i am doing what i must i am indeed sorry that maude has been cheated of her birthright but it is my sons birthright i must try to save now how will it help maude if i forfeit the earldom of gloucester ranulf had no ready answer and he swung back to the window looking out blindly at the fogshrouded sky and what do we tell maude that it is all over that stephen has won i cannot do that to her robert and by god i will not i said i had agreed to submit to stephen i did not say he had won ranulf turned around to stare at his brother what do you mean i told stephen that i would come to his easter court and swear homage to him as englands king i specified though that my oath would be binding only as long as he kept his promises kept faith with me our father would never have agreed to such terms not even with a dagger pricked at his throat but stephen did i still do not understand so you swear to stephen what then we wait robert said succinctly what happens after that will be up to stephen if he keeps faith with me so shall i keep faith with him but i do not believe he will lad he will begin to make mistakes and then to make enemies and when he first feels his throne quaking under him he will look around for a scapegoat for someone to blame for all his troubles as likely as not he will look to me but by then hell no longer be the dragonslayer men will have come to see his halo for what it truly isa stolen crown and they may well conclude that stephen was not the lesser of evils after all ranulf was not reassured by this prediction of coming strife he was too young yet to feel comfortable with ethical ambiguities and roberts pragmatic realism seemed somewhat cynical to him and not altogether admirable although he could not have expressed his need in the wake of stephens shocking betrayal ranulf yearned for moral certainties for a world with no shadings of grey no dubious choices no compromises robert easily read his inner agitation for ranulfs was not a face for secrets thinking that innocence could be just as dangerous as a broken battlelance or cracked shield he urged sail back to england with me lad make your peace with stephen if god wills it maudes chance shall come no ranulf said hoarsely ill never recognize him as kingnever such a dramatic declaration cried out for an equally dramatic departure and ranulf now provided one striding purposefully from the chamber without looking back robert made no attempt to stop him but he winced as the door slammed shut and sat down wearily in the window seat amabels irritation ebbed and she crossed quickly to her husbands side putting a sympathetic hand upon his knee how simple the world seems at seventeen it is easy enough for ranulf to pledge maude his undying loyalty for what does he have to lose i would that were so amabel but the sad truth is that the lad has a great deal to lose he may have no lands to forfeit but his loyalty to maude may well cost him what he values mostthat lass of his raymond de bernay is liegeman to simon de senlis one of stephens most fervent supporters unless ranulf comes to his senses and does homage to stephen soon bernay will disavow the plight troth for certes i trust that you pointed this out to ranulf of course i did but he does not believe me ranulf has been cursed with a dangerous defect in his vision he can see only what he wants to see he remains convinced that a happy ending is not only possible it is a certainty so sure is he that virtue and justice must prevail he can no more conceive of losing annora than he can of stephen triumphing over maude amabel shivered suddenly close the shutters love ere we catch our deaths that dangerous defect of ranulfsyou know who else shares it stephen he said promptly and she gave a satisfied nod indeed ive never known anyone who thrives on hope as stephen does he never doubts that every storm must have a rainbow and if he falls into a stream he fully expects to rise up with a fish in his cap robert slid the shutter latch into place closing out the cold but casting the window seat into shadow well i would wager that the next time our new king stumbles into a stream hell find himself in water over his head the pity of it he added grimly is that hell not drown alone but will drag some good men down with him i just hope ranulf will not be one of them raymond de bernay was a man of uncommon patience and his fondness for ranulf was genuine but he was not willing to wait indefinitely and on a cool overcast day in early june ranulf at last ran out of time i have been more than fair with you lad ive given you every chance to repent your folly and make your peace with the king i will ask you but once more will you come to england swear homage to stephen no ranulf said softly i cannot raymond had expected no other answer so be it then striding to the solar door he beckoned to his son ancel you are to watch over your sister whilst she and ranulf say their farewells he said and although his voice held no anger it held no hope of reprieve either ancel had not seen ranulf in several months for his father had taken him from roberts household as soon as roberts loyalty came into question placing him with a lord whose allegiance was not suspect simon de senlis ancel looked acutely uncomfortable while he had no objections to being cast as the defender of his sisters virtue that was not a role hed ever wanted to play with ranulf he mustered up a sheepish smile a shrug and was relieved when ranulf smiled back you need not be so discomfited ancel for this came as no surprise i knew how your father would react just as i know what a hard task lies ahead of me trying to persuade annora to be patient and the door was thrown open with such force that the closest candle flame flared and then waned annoras eyes were swollen and darkly circled her pallor so pronounced that she looked ill wakeful nights and teardrenched days bewilderment and betrayalit all showed so nakedly upon her face that ranulfs utter assurance faltered for a moment much like that quavering candle but annoras eyes were dry for shed vowed that she was done with weeping she stopped just out of reach and said bitterly so you are still set upon this madness i have no choice annora i cannot do homage to a man who stole my sisters crown and then perjured himself to keep oh you did have a choice you chose maude over me ranulf frowned that is not true you know better annora for we have talked about this and ive told you my reasons why i must support maudes claim over stephens i do not want to hear any more not another word you knew that if you balked at swearing homage to stephen youd lose me you knew that but still you clung to that haughty vengeful bitch still you annora stop it you are not being fair to me or to maude yes i am loyal to my sister but you are the one i love the one i mean to wed we may have to wait awhile but we will be wed that i promise you he vowed with all the conviction at his command when he reached for her though annora recoiled abruptly do not touch me she warned not ever again you had your chance made your choice and i will never forgive you for itnever she was perilously close to tears and she whirled stumbling from the chamber before ranulf could see them fall ancel hastily grabbed for the fire tongs busied himself in scattering stonecold ashes about the hearth but he soon felt foolish gave up the pretense and turned reluctantly to face his friend it was not as bad as hed feared ranulf looked unhappy and angry but not desolate or defeated not in need of the sort of comfort ancel did not know how to give with a temper like hers your father must save a fortune on firewood it was a wan attempt at humor but ancel chuckled long and loud so grateful was he that ranulf was jesting not raving or ranting or jesu forfend expecting him to stanch the bleeding ranulf was fumbling in his tunic ive a letter for annora he said and i want you to give it to her once her anger cools if we live that long ancel gibed but he reached for the letter and even tried to look as if he truly believed that it was not too late they were on the road by dawn the sun quickly burned away the morning mist and the sky took on that glazed blue unique to early autumn a color so clear and vivid that it did not seem quite real in the distance the trees appeared to be dusted with gold as the green shades of summer slowly yielded to octobers amber and copper and russet the villages they passed through were shuttered and still ghost villages bereft of life for when an army was on the march people of common sense fled or cowered behind bolted doors and prayed guirribecs the warning had raced ahead outrunning horses spurred on by pure panic guirribecs a norman term of contempt for the ancient enemies of anjou now ravaging their lands burning their churches plundering their towns guirribecs they spat watching from hiding as this new army rode past marveling that these men did not stop to torch or loot they did not understand their reprieve but they thanked god for it never suspecting that they should also be thanking the woman who would be their duchess riding at his sisters side ranulf caught an occasional glimpse of a creaking shutter an astonished face staring after them in wonder an army lived on the land whenever it could and those who had the bad luck to be in its path were bound to suffer but maude was too shrewd to turn her army loose upon the very people she meant to rule ranulf wished that geoffrey had shown the same restraint this was geoffreys second foray into normandy and each time his men had pillaged and raped and robbed on such a grand scale that for every castle won hed lost maude hearts beyond counting so far geoffreys campaign had yielded mixed results hed won some impressive victories but hed also suffered a few sharp setbacks hed taken carrouges after a threeday siege only to be repulsed at montreuil but hed then captured moutiershubert and as michaelmas had approached hed made ready to besiege a grand prize indeed the prosperous city of lisieux maude felt confident that he would prevail however often shed damned him to hell everlasting over the past eight years shed never denied his abilities as a battle commander each time ranulf glanced over at his sister he felt a throb of pride for it was not so long ago that maude had given birth to her third son and the delivery had not been an easy one but shed responded to geoffreys summons with alacrity gathered two thousand men under her command and set such a punishing pace that by dusk on this first day of october they expected to be within sight of the city walls of lisieux catching ranulfs eye maude smiled it gladdens me that youll be there to witness the fall of lisieux she said and ranulf knew she was thinking of the brother who would not be there robert whod been in england since april at stephens court nor was he alone for their brother rainald had also come to terms with stephen but it was roberts defection that haunted maude one more act of betrayal a sudden flurry off to the side of the road drew their attention the thickets rustled and ranulfs two dyrehunds went streaking off into the underbrush they must have flushed a rabbit ranulf said but he made no attempt to call them back knowing theyd catch up again once their hunt was over maude decided then that this was a good time to rest their horses and gave the order to halt have you had any word about that lass of yoursanna was it annoraand no i have not if she were still at bernay i know she would have been able to get a letter to me by now but her father returned to england in july and he took annora with him maude had met annora on several occasions and had been quick to conclude that the girl was quite ordinary not at all the sort of wife she would have chosen for ranulf but now none of that mattered if ranulf wanted annora she would move heaven and earth to see that he got her she would not forget those who had stood by her when it truly countedor those who had not you and your lass will be well rewarded for your patience she promised ill give you a wedding so lavish that the festivities will last for days between the two of us annora and i could not scrape up enough patience to fill a thimble ranulf said ruefully fortunately well not have to wait much longer once you take normandy away from stephen hell find hes seized control of a sinking ship even the rats will start swimming for shore he predicted with a grin maude gave him an amused look the rats must be jumping overboard in droves after what happened at exeter she said and they both laughed for theyd not expected stephen to begin blundering so soon until exeter hed been making all the right moves placating the pope and buying peace with the scots king but then baldwin de redvers had seized exeter castle stephen had promptly assaulted the stronghold and after a threemonth siege victory was his for the taking it was then that hed tarnished his triumph with an act of mercy so misguided that men were still marveling at it hed heeded the pleas of baldwin de redverss fellow barons allowed the castle garrison to go free they were in rebellion against him maude said baffled that stephen had failed to grasp so basic a tenet of kingship those men should have been hanged or at the least maimed so their fate might serve as a lesson for other wouldbe rebels instead he sets them free forgiveness is well and good for saints and holy men and christian martyrs but that is not an indulgence any king can afford this was stephens first test of strength and he failed miserably for men now know they need not fear the kings wrath stephen never could resist a gallant gesture ranulf jeered summoning up scorn to keep from remembering those times when stephens gallantry had served as his own lifeline hed never realized how dangerous memories could be not until he had a lifetime of them to deny for if the man himself had proved false it must follow that the memories too were falsedid it not these were not thoughts he cared to dwell upon and he hastily groped for a more innocuous topic tell me about geoffreys new ally ive never met him what sort of man is he there was no need to be more specific maude knew at once whom he meant wellwilliam is not one to be overlooked for hes a vast mountain of a man with hungers to match his size even his titles are weighty duke of aquitaine and count of poitou he has a booming laugh an eye for a pretty face a temper hotter than brimstone and even more enemies than geoffrey have i left anything out not that i can think of ohhave you ever seen his daughter ranulf thought the question sounded quite casual and offhand but maude was not taken in does annora know youre lusting after eleanor of aquitaine she teased and he flushed then laughed no lad i have not seen the girl so i cannot tell you if she is truly as dazzling as men claim since she is such a great heiress it does not seen fair that she should have been favored with great beauty too does it the same could be said for you ranulf pointed out and although she merely shrugged he knew hed pleased her geoffreys compliments were always barbed enough to draw blood ill admit i am curious about the lady eleanor would like to judge this beauty of hers for myself it puzzles me though that her father did not marry again after he lost his wife and son surely he must have qualms about entrusting aquitaine to a mere slip of a lass he caught himself too late but maude was not affronted you need offer no apologies ranulf for saying what so many think nor have i ever claimed that all members of my sex are capable of wielding power i can only speak for myself and i have no doubts whatsoever that i can rule as well as any man and better than most for certes better than my usurping cousin damn his sly thieving soul to hell and youll soon be able to prove it too that imaude look over there through the trees smoke maude was shortsighted but she soon saw it too a distant dark cloud smudging the purity of that limpid azure sky they both said it at once in dismayed comprehension lisieux maudes scout reined in a lathered horse swung from the saddle to give her his bad news stephen had entrusted the defense of normandy to waleran beaumont and waleran had garrisoned lisieux with battlewise breton soldiers when it had begun to look as if the capture of the city was inevitable the breton commander gave the order to fire the town choosing to destroy lisieux rather than surrender it maude turned aside struggling to mask her disappointment ranulf was disappointed too but he was also shocked by the ruthlessness of the breton commanders act he said nothing though for he was still a month shy of his eighteenth birthday and he knew he had much to learn about how wars were waged the scout was not done thwarted at lisieux he said count geoffrey and the duke of aquitaine had then fallen back on the town of le sap it was being stoutly defended by walter de clare and a battle was raging even now in the streets the days last light was fading along the horizon but the sky was lit by a hundred fires the church of st peter was the heart of le sap now flames were shooting from every window as maude and ranulf watched the rafters gave way and the roof collapsed with a hellish roar embers and sparks and burning brands rained down upon the spectators spooking several horses and unseating their riders as the wind shifted ranulf found himself choking on dense swirling smoke he could hear screaming and hoped it was not coming from the church for it was utterly engulfed in surging windlashed flames the air was hot enough to sear his skin and when his stallion panicked he was tempted to let it bolt for in that moment his desire to put le saps death throes far behind was almost overwhelming instead he calmed the fearful animal then reined in beside his sister maude had clapped her veil over her nose and mouth well le sap is ours what is left of it it looks like the castle has fallen too but lady maude striding toward them out of the murky smoke and cinders was an armorclad giant his coif pulled back to reveal a tousled head of curly damp hair his face streaked with soot his hauberk liberally splattered with blood thank god youre here for youve got to talk some sense into that lunatic you married maudes smile was sour as if she could you give me too much credit will where is geoffreyat the castle no he is still being treated by the doctor doctor geoffrey has been hurt maude slid from the saddle before the duke of aquitaine could offer his assistance is it serious no mores the pity he snapped and ranulf barely stifled an involuntary laugh but the duke whose tactlessness was legendary seemed unaware how inappropriate a remark that was to make to a mans wife even a less than doting one it happened about noon he said whilst we were besieging the castle one of their crossbowmen got off a lucky shot and hit geoffrey in the foot ill not deny it is a nasty wound for he broke a few bones and those fool doctors did almost as much damage as the bowman when they cut out the bolt so there has to be a goodly amount of pain but christ on the cross maude a man cannot give in to it geoffrey has never been wounded before will not even so much as a scratch in fact he rarely gets sick at allmayhap a fever or cough but no more than that since weve been wed it is not surprising then that hed be such a poor patient for hes had no practice at it no maude you do not understandnot yet he says the campaign is over says he is going home to anjou on the morrow the doctor was standing in front of geoffreys command tent at sight of maude he looked like a man reprieved from the gallows madame how glad i am to see you if you could talk to the count mayhap you could but maude brushed past the man as if he didnt exist with ranulf and the duke of aquitaine hard on her heels geoffrey had been trying to drown his pain in wine but hed succeeded only in making himself queasy too his face was grey and beaded with cold sweat he looked so haggard that even ranulf felt a flicker of pity maude hastened toward the bed snatching up a candle along the way geoffrey blinking in the sudden flare of light geoffrey focused hazily upon the white tense face so close to his get me a doctor he said huskily that dolt out there could not heal a blister without holy help from above geoffrey you cannot give up the campaign if you retreat now youll lose all youve gained so far and your suffering will have been for naught and my suffering just breaks your heart he muttered gesturing toward his wine flagon after maude had helped him to drink he struggled upright with difficulty he acknowledged neither ranulf nor the unhappy doctor hovering nervously in the entrance but he targeted the duke of aquitaine with a bloodshot accusing glare did you bother to tell her about my wound first will or did you plunge right in bemoaning all your lost plunder your chance to spill some blood the duke glared back calling geoffrey an obscene name that was wasted upon ranulf for he spoke no langue doc the native tongue of the dukes domains maude ignored the acrimonious exchange keeping her eyes riveted upon her husbands face geoffrey this is not a decision to be made in haste im sure youll see it differently on the morrow and how would you know that maude have you ever been wounded in battle no but i damned near died bearing your son maude somehow managed to bite the words back what would it serve to squabble over who had suffered more geoffrey i am not making light of your pain but with so much at stake you must not lose heart if you do well lose normandy normandy will wait for me to heal at home and so will youdear heart he added investing the endearment with such lethal sarcasm that maudes temper took fire heal at home she echoed scathingly for gods sake geoffrey you were not gutshot since when is a foot wound fatal geoffreys hand jerked spilling his wine onto the bed covers you meddlesome bitch look what youve done i curse the day my father yoked me to a spiteful provoking scold like you and god help me but you get worse with age if i say we go back to anjou we go and ill hear no more on it not unless you want me to leave you behind to fend for yourself now fetch me more wine and then find me another doctor a competent one this time maude went hot with humiliation and impotent fury her face flaming she drew back into the tents shadows until she could trust herself hed said worse to her done worse too but not in public she would never forgive him for shaming her like this before ranulf and the duke and it took every shred of her selfcontrol to keep silent but she must think of her sons think of her henry who would one day rule england after her she would not let geoffrey steal her sons as stephen had stolen her crown damn his poisoned tongue and that bowmans wretched aim and roberts defection damn all the men who treated their dogs better than their women bracing herself she turned around then her head high only to find that ranulf and the duke had gone leaving her alone with her husband ranulf was sitting upon an overturned bucket within view of geoffreys tent hed wangled a joint of roast beef from one of the camp cooks although hed ended up sharing most of it with his dogs for the past hour hed been trying to convince himself that hed done the right thing the only thing he could do he knew maudes pride hoped hed been able to salvage some of it it had been hard though saying nothing whilst that misbegotten hellspawn humbled his sister as if she were a serving wench and yet what could he say even the duke had held his peace and he wanting only to throttle geoffrey there in his bed but they could not meddle between a man and his wife however much they wanted to the female dyrehund seemed to sense his mood nudging his knee fondly but keeping an eye peeled on that beef bone here girl catch he said and watched as she disappeared into the darkness before her mate could claim the bone when maude emerged from the tent he jumped hastily to his feet she paused then came toward him they walked in silence for a time whenever they passed a soldier carrying a torch ranulf studied her face not even sure what he was searching for he wanted to ask if she was all right it seemed safer though to pretend nothing had happened but there was something they could not ignore geoffreys threat do you think he meant it he asked and maude nodded he meant it she said tersely we depart on the morrow for anjou ranulf had been half expecting to hear that but it still had the power to shock our father must have been mad to make you wed that man maude shrugged he could read nothing in her profile and he reached out uneasily touched her arm maudeyou are not giving up she turned to face him then giving him a glimpse of narrowed dark eyes cheekbones burning with feverish heat give up no ranulf she said sounding desperate and determined and bitter beyond words i will never give up not until my dying breath and not even then falaise normandy june after fifteen months as englands king stephen felt secure enough upon his throne to turn his efforts toward normandy determined to bring the duchy more firmly under his control he crossed the channel in march at first he met with heartening success the french king recognized his claim to normandy but in may geoffrey led an army across the river sarthe stephen was besieging mezidon by then punishing a recalcitrant baron he wasted no time though in dispatching a large armed force to block geoffreys invasion having ravaged the countryside around exmes geoffrey then pressed northward leaving behind a trail of charred ruins skeletal smokeblackened silhouettes rising up like ghostly tombstones to mark his armys passing hed advanced within ten miles of roberts stronghold at caen when he encountered stephens army at argences a battle seemed imminent one that might settle the disputed succession once and for all but stephens army was an uneasy mix of norman barons and flemish mercenaries and they were as wary of one another as they were of geoffreys angevins stephen had entrusted command to william de ypres a flemish adventurer with a chequered past an abundance of courage and a skeptical streak far wider than the stream separating the two hostile armies ypress suspicions were aimed at robert for he was convinced that maudes brother was a trojan horse in the norman camp awaiting an opportune moment to switch sides he made no secret of these suspicions and robert withdrew angrily to his castle at caen amid a flurry of mutual embittered accusations roberts departure demoralized his fellow barons and normanflemish hostility soon reached such a pitch that ypres abandoned his campaign riding off in a rage to join stephen at the siege of mezidon geoffrey decided it would not be prudent to force robert to make a choice just yet and he withdrew as far as argentan stephen soon followed though by june hed summoned his army to lisieux and was preparing to launch an assault upon argentan once more it looked as if englands crown would be won or lost upon the thrust of a blade bought with blood the tavern was hard to find tucked away at the end of an alley in one of the more disreputable neighborhoods of falaise by the time he finally spotted the protruding alepole gilbert fitz john had gotten his boots thoroughly muddied almost had his money pouch stolen by a nimblefingered thief and had been forced to fend off so many beggars and harlots that he doubted hed reach the rutting stag with either his purse or his honour intact brushing aside the most persistent of the beggars he plunged through the open doorway and found himself in a crowded common room that stank of sweat and unwashed bodies and cheap wine the chamber was meagrely lit by a few reeking tallow candles and gilbert backed into a corner until his eyes adjusted to the gloom all the while trying to appear inconspicuous no mean feat for a youth with flaming red hair who towered head and shoulders above the other tavern customers do you know what you look like a man whos strayed into hell by mistake and is politely pretending not to notice the flames brimstone and burning flesh at sound of that familiar voice gilbert sighed with relief then said grumpily given a choice i think id take hell over the rutting stag leave it to you to pick a hovel like this ranulf grinned say what you will of this sty it is not a place where i am likely to be recognized you hope gilbert said with fervor you have not changed a whit have you ranulf god save us both as reckless as ever with stephens army barely a stones throw away and falaise aswarm with his spies ranulf shrugged if i am crazed for setting up this meeting what does that make you for agreeing to it a fool for certes but im here now and we may as well make the best of it you can at least buy me a drink ere some of stephens flemish hirelings drag us off to gaol ranulf laughed wait till you taste the wine they sell here it puts swill to shame once theyd shoved their way to a corner table ranulf leaned forward resting his elbows upon the warped greasy wood and studied his friend it had been more than fifteen months since theyd seen each other for gilbert had continued to serve as one of roberts squires following his lord to stephens english court im right glad you came gib damn me if else but ive even missed youa little of course i came gilbert muttered sounding both pleased and embarrassed and so will ancel hed never miss a chance to risk his neck he knew what ranulf was about to ask and tried to head it off saying hastily i did not see much of ancel these months past for lord robert came to the kings court only when summoned robert did not even sail for normandy with stephens fleet preferring to cross the channel in his own ship youll not be struck by a lightning bolt if you say her name aloud ranulf said and gilbert ducked his head staring down at the table as if he were intent upon memorizing every crack splinter and stain annora de bernay seeno thunderbolts i am not loath to talk about annora i just hope ancel had the mother wit to seek her out ere he left england if he has forgotten to bring her letters ill be tempted to prod his memory with a poleax keep this betwixt us but i never thought our separation would last this long gib it would ease my mind greatly if i could reassure annora that our waiting is almost done there is no chance of that though not unless i learn to walk on water ranulf paused waiting for a response that didnt come and gave an exaggerated comic sigh friends are supposed to laugh at each others jokes no matter how lame gilbert managed a dutiful unconvincing chuckle so you think then that stephen is riding close to the cliff these days any closer and hed better hope his horse sprouts wings robert could earn his living as a soothsayer if needs must for he predicted it with deadaim accuracythat stephen would begin to make mistakes and then to make enemies he infuriated the marcher lords when he balked at putting down that rising in wales last year then that flemish brigand of his william de ypres caused a breach with robert the one man stephen should be trying to win over and rumor has it that he has fallen out with his brother for its been six months since the archbishop of canterbury died and henrys patience is wearing thin i can understand why stephen is wary of nominating him but if he does not henry will never forgive him no gib stephens crown has lost a lot of its luster once he loses normandy too his hold upon england will crack beyond mending gilbert did not agree that the loss of normandy was a foregone conclusion not with stephens army just twenty miles away poised to launch an assault upon argentan but he kept his doubts to himself instead asked ranulf if maude was still at argentan with geoffrey ranulf shook his head maude is often at argentan she believes that her presence in normandy helps to strengthen her claim to the duchy leaving unsaid the obvious that maudes unhappy marriage was another reason why shed prefer argentan to her husbands domains but when geoffrey invaded normandy last month he forced maude to withdraw with their sons to domfront supposedly it was done for their safetys sake but i think geoffrey just wanted maude out of the way hes not one for letting a minor detailthat maude is the rightful heiressinterfere with his ambitions remember gib how we used to worry that geoffrey might insist upon sharing maudes throne well that fear was for naught in truth geoffrey would not care if england sank into the sea without a trace it is normandy he covets and you may be sure a large hand clamped down on ranulfs shoulder startled he spun around to confront a burly stranger one with heavily muscled arms a massive chest and a face twisted askew by several puckered scars i know who you are the man cried and ranulf jerked free fumbling for his sword hilt but his blade never cleared the scabbard for his assailant was already backing away i meant no harm your friend said it was just a joke ranulf snatched up his wine gulping it down in two swallows gilbert drained his own cup just as fast as they watched ancel tossed a coin to his baffled accomplice before sauntering toward them well he demanded have you no greeting for me and then pretended to stagger backward arm upraised to ward off the wave of scalding invective coming his way when ranulf and gilbert had exhausted their supply of obscenities if not their indignation ancel straddled a bench and began to laugh i am sorry to say this ranulf but being around maude has not been good for you youre becoming as grim and humorless as she is now our poor gib never had a sense of humor to lose but i did expect better of you when i called you a misbegotten witless whelp without the brains god gave a fleai was being too kind ancel laughed even harder at that then waved an arm expansively about the tavern a great place you picked for our reunion ranulf whatthe lepers would not let you use their lazar house catching a serving maids eye he pantomimed a drink order if i pay for the next round of the local poison can we agree to a truce so tell me why are you not barricaded with geoffrey behind argentans walls poor maudeher luck has soured for certes what irked her more being penned up with her loving husband or missing the wedding in bordeaux ranulf knew at once what he meant for there were only two topics of conversation that summer the war and the wedding the duke of aquitaine had gone off on pilgrimage after his abortive campaign with geoffrey and hed died that past april in spain lingering long enough to arrange a marriage between his fifteenyearold daughter eleanor and louis the son of the french king it was his deathbed hope that he was thus safeguarding aquitaine for eleanor giving her a husband powerful enough to protect her inheritance the wedding was to take place in july and had the circumstances been different ranulf would have enjoyed attending the revelries watching eleanor the fair take her first step onto the road that led to the throne of france but he was not amused by ancels jest for he resented its implications that maude was a vain frivolous female one whod give equal weight to a crown and a wedding fete hed become very protective of his sister in these past eighteen months had long since forgotten that hed once harbored the same doubts about feminine resolve or womanly valor and he said impatiently there is not a soul to be found in all of christendom who could distract maude from what truly mattersclaiming the throne stephen stole and if you think id rather talk about eleanor of aquitaine than annora youre either drunk or demented or both ive gone a year with no word from your sister and that was long enough to last a lifetime so lets strike a deal here and now you hand over annoras letters and ill not inspect her seal to see if you read them on the sly ranulf grinned and reached across the table for annoras letters but ancel had turned was glaring accusingly at gilbert you did not tell him me it was not my place to tell him gilbert protested she is your sister not mine ranulf frowned tell me what annora is not ailing no ancel said reluctantly she is well enough but youd best put her out of your mind ranulf for she is married ranulf stared at him then laughed how gullible do you think i am ancel next youll be telling me she has decided to become a nun ranulf i am not jesting she is married i swear it ranulf half rose from the bench grabbed ancels wrist that is a lie noit is not she was wed last michaelmas to gervase fitz clement ancel tried unsuccessfully to break ranulfs grip i know you do not want to hear this but it was for the best it was a good match for he is a kinsman of my fathers liege lord simon de senlis and holds manors in shropshire and leicestershire and yorkshire why are you lying like this i know your father know how he dotes upon annora hed never force her to wed against her will no matter how many manors the man had for christs sake lower your voices gilbert urged for we are starting to attract attention annora was not forced she wanted the marriage ancel was suddenly free he rubbed his wrist drew a deep breath and repeated she wanted it ranulf and that is gods truth as soon as he moved ranulf was assailed by pain squeezing his eyes shut he lay very still waiting for it to pass it didnt though and he forced himself to sit up fighting back a wave of nausea he had no idea where he was it seemed to be a tiny cubicle up under the eaves of a roof a dingy sparsely furnished room that reeked of perfume and held only a straw mattress a chamber pot and several coffer chests that doubled as seats the lone window was shuttered and the air fetid and stale oppressively hot his clothes were scattered about in the floor rushes and by gritting his teeth he managed to ignore his throbbing head long enough to collect his crumpled tunic linen shirt and braies he had to hunt for his chausses finally finding the striped hose entangled in the sheets but a search of the entire room did not turn up his money pouch he was slowly pulling on his boots when the door opened and a woman entered awake at last are you i was beginning to think id have to charge you rent sweeting the light was so dim that ranulf could tell only that she was young and plump what time is it he mumbled and then no do not open the window but he was too late pulling the shutters back she blinded him with a sudden surge of bright afternoon sunlight groping his way down a narrow stairway ranulf emerged into an inns common chamber a few men were seated in the shadows and one of them now beckoned as he moved closer he recognized ancel jesus god you look like somebody pried off the lid of your coffin sit down ere you fall down over here at the table i do not suppose you want anything to eat yet ranulf was not able to suppress a shudder and ancel grinned no i thought not im not surprised youre so greensick for you damned near drank falaise dry ohere i forget here is your money pouch we thought id better hold on to it since you were in no shape to fend off a mewling kitten much less any of the cutthroat knaves prowling about this hellhole he watched as ranulf slumped onto a stool then slid a clay goblet across the table have a few swallows of ale ranulf peered into the cup thirst warring with queasiness so you paid the wench abovestairs then i owe her no money i even chaffered her price down and a good deal i got for you too she was worth it i trust ahbut you do not remember do you i suppose you do not remember the doxy at the crane on tuesday either a pity for that one looked hotter than hades ranulf took a tentative sip of the ale where is gib hed begun to fret so about letting lord robert down that i finally sent him back to caen youll have to help me concoct a plausible excuse for my absence or lord simon will have my hide ranulf blinked tuesday you said what day is this thursday ancel laughed at ranulfs startled look indeed you have not drawn a sober breath for nigh on three days is that a record you think ranulf glanced at ancel then away three days lost and he could remember none of itjesu i suppose i ought to thank you and gib for making sure i did not do anything crazylike breaking into another nunnery he said with a grimace of a smile anceltell me what happened when we got to england annora was hurting and angry and of a mind to listen when my father proposed the match with gervase fitz clement i know what youre thinking that she did it to spite you and mayhap that is so for annora always did have a hellcats temper but the marriage was the right choice even if she did make it for the wrong reasons gervase is a man of breeding and wealth and influence as i told you on monday eve he is kin to my lord simon de senlis that i remember ranulf snapped what of it hell be able to take good care of annora ranulf shell want for nothing and he seems right fond of her seems pleased to have such a lively young wife his first wife died two years ago leaving him with three childrenand they took to annora straightaway sometimes a second wife loses out when there are children from an earlier marriage but gervase has enough to provide well for his heir and for any sons annora gives him ranulf set the goblet down with a thud sloshing ale onto the table annora naked in another mans bed bearing his children the image was so vivid that he gasped tears burned his eyes and his throat closed up as he struggled with emotion just as raw and ravaging as physical pain when he finally won his battle for control he looked up shaken to find ancel watching him with helpless pity ranulf i am truly sorry but it was for the best and youll come to see that in time you and annora are too much alike your marriage bed would have become a battlefield ere the year was out ranulf slammed his fist onto the table a foolish move that triggered so much pain he feared his head would split wide open damn you shut your mouth ancel took no offense in fact he even looked contrite an awkward silence fell between them until ranulf forced himself to ask isis she happy ancel hesitated when i saw her at christmas three months after her wedding she seemed content im sorry if that is not what you want to hear ranulf said nothing for at that moment he truly did not know what hed wanted to hear ancel went to fetch more ale was bringing it back to the table when the door was flung open with a resounding crash ranulf winced turning away from the blaze of light but ancel stopped abruptly gilbert why are you not in caen gilbert strode toward them youve got to get back to lisieux ancel and right fast for your lord is sure to be in a tearing rage all hell broke loose in lisieux on tuesday eve stephens army fought a bloody battle in the city streets but not with geoffreys angevinsit was normans against flemings and theyre still counting the dead youre not serious surely no ancel im jesting i rode all the way from caen just for the fun of it im telling you the truth and have the saddle sores to prove it a squabble started between several norman and flemish soldiers over a wine cask and it soon became a brawl and then a battle a lot of men died and some of the norman lords were so wroth they abandoned the campaign and rode offwithout even seeking stephens permission can you imagine anyone defying the old king like that only if they had a death wish ranulf said with his first real smile in three days gilbert reached over helped himself to ancels ale it sounds he said as if your sisters luck has finally taken a turn for the better i am ranulf fitz roy and i am here to see my brother the earl of gloucester that was all it took to gain ranulf entry into caen castle as he followed a guard across the inner bailey toward the keep he tried to shake off his fatigue to decide what he would say to robert that was no easy task for he was not even sure why he was here it had not been planned hed told ancel and gilbert he was joining maude in domfront but after theyd departed hed passed several more utterly aimless days in falaise and when hed finally mounted his horse hed found himself heading north instead of south hed covered almost all of the twenty miles to caen before hed even admitted that was his destination but hed realized that he needed more comfort than he could get from wine and whores now as he climbed the stairs to roberts solar it occurred to him that whenever hed been hurting in the past hed turned to stephen to stanch the bleeding and he laughed bitterly earning a curious look from the guard any qualms hed harbored about his welcome were vanquished at once dispelled by the warmth in roberts surprised smile amabel too seemed genuinely glad to see him and hed not been sure that would be so for he knew amabel was less forgiving than robert but after one glimpse of his haggard face and bloodshot eyes she sent a servant down to the kitchen with an order for ranulfs favorite foods and steered him firmly toward a cushioned settle amabels charm was undeniable when she chose to exert it and uniquely her own by turns flirtatious and maternal with a tart tongue leavened by easy earthy laughter a free spirit securely anchored to reality she lavished that charm now upon ranulf full force scolding him playfully for sins of omission teasing him about losing his razor for his wineblurred week in falaise had given him the beginnings of a blond beard in their society youths were cleanshaven men were not to robert and amabel the sight then of ranulfs newgrown stubble was significant in a symbolic sort of way proof of passage across that most unsettled of borders the one dividing boyhood and manhood youre not drinking your wine ranulf is it not to your liking ranulfs smile was wry in truth amabel id sooner quaff blood i had a very wet week and im still drying out robert nodded sympathetically we feared youd take it hard lad ranulf could not hide his surprise you know then of course we do how is maude bearing up maude what does maude have to do with annoras marriage annora amabel drew a quick comprehending breath your lass wed another man ah ranulf i am indeed sorry by now ranulf was thoroughly confused and increasingly uneasy if you did not know about annora what then did you mean why should maude be distraught with stephens soldiers spilling their own blood she has every reason to rejoice unlessunless it was not true no robert assured him it is true enough the feuding between normans and flemings flared into violence and the earl of surreys son and other norman lords then withdrew from lisieux in a rage well then as i said maude has reason to rejoice for the end is now in sight when geoffrey marches on lisieux how can stephen hope to hold him off stephen saw that too lad whatever his failings as a king he is a seasoned battle commander he realized that his campaign was in shambles and his throne at risk and so he made geoffrey an offertwo thousand marks in return for a twoyear truce ranulf was stunned you cannot be saying that geoffrey agreed yes robert said quietly he did ranulf had spared neither his horse nor himself and they were both exhausted by the time the city walls of domfront rose up against the sky high above the river varenne the closer he came to domfront the more ranulf dreaded what lay ahead how could maude not be shattered by this latest and cruelest of all her betrayals to have the english crown at last within her reach only to be snatched away again this time by the perfidy of her own husband he could not blame her if she had no more heart for this unequal unending struggle but if she admitted defeat hed foughtand lost annoraall for nothing maude was alone in her solar standing by an open window the morning light was warm and scented by the gardens below but it was not kind accentuating maudes pallor her holloweyed fatigue at sight of ranulf though her sudden smile belied the strain and sleepless nights and thwarted hopes youre back ranulf stopped short you did not doubt it of course i did not ranulf she protested sounding so surprised and so sincere that he felt a flicker of comfort at least hed been able to do that much for her to gain her trust they looked at each other in silence for a moment and then ranulf said abruptly if there is any justice under gods sky that doubledealing judas will rot in hell right alongside stephen maude gave him another smile but this one never reached her eyes give geoffrey his due lad judas sold his soul for thirty pieces of silver but geoffrey turned a much better profit he extorted two thousand marks from stephen what did he say to you maude what justification could he possibly offer that the price was right too tempting to refuse ah but he did throw me a few crumbs of comfort he assured me you see that making a truce and honouring it are not necessarily spokes on the same wheel ranulf swore under his breath so what now we wait on his whim wait until he gets bored enough or restless enough to resume the war yes maude said very dryly that sums it up rather well and you believe him i have to ranulf she said i have to ranulf felt a rush of relief realizing in that moment just how much hed feared hearing her say it was done that hed sacrificed his happiness with annora for an elusive unattainable dream you astound me he said huskily no matter how often these whoresons shove you into the fire you always rise from the ashes again just like that mythical bird thethe phoenix this time i singed my wings well and good and lost a few tail feathers too she conceded but theyll grow back they both turned then toward the open window for the sound of mama floated up clear as a bell on the mild summer air below them a groom led a dappled grey pony and sitting proudly in the saddle was a beaming little boy as soon as they appeared at the window he waved mama look im riding smoky watch me uncle ranulf were watching henry maude called back youre doing very well i know henry agreed with such a cocky grin that ranulf and maude both laughed in coloring henry was very much his fathers son and the sun haloed his reddishgold hair windblown and copperbright as young as he was he knew his own mind and they were not surprised to hear him arguing with the groom insisting he could handle the reins himself he was not one for whining though he was usually a cheerful highspirited child whose most common sins were cheekiness and an insatiable curiosity sins easy enough to forgive his younger brother geoffrey was quick to throw tantrums when he was thwarted but that was not henrys way and he sought to persuade the groom now with a precocious mix of childish logic and coaxing charm i thought youd told henry he could not have a horse of his own until he turned five what changed your mind maude geoffrey very helpfully told henry that hed learned to ride when he was four ill not deny my heart was in my mouth the first time i saw him lifted into the saddle but i do henry no favor by coddling him i must ever bear that in mind the hardest lesson a mother has to learn her dark eyes were following her firstborn as he explored the confines of the garden when i was pregnant with henry she said i remember being urged to eat these vast meals whenever i balked there was always some meddlesome but wellmeaning soul to remind me that i was eating for two well now i am fighting for two ranulf it was not just my birthright stephen stole it was henrys too soi cannot give up i will not fail my son as so many have failed me that summer was exceedingly hot and by september the crops were shriveling in the fields rivers running shallow and sluggish and the roads so cracked and pitted that travelers found themselves choking on clouds of thick red dust the great hall in rouens castle was stifling windows unshuttered in the vain hope of drawing in a breeze attracting only flies and swarms of gnats but most of the people present were indifferent to the heat and the insects for their attention was riveted upon the confrontation taking place between the english king and the most powerfuland therefore most dangerousof his barons stephens face was flushed with anger my lord earl of gloucester you have kept away from my court all summer agreeing to come only after the archbishop of rouen pledged to vouch for your safety your suspicions are as outrageous as they are insulting youd best explain yourself if indeed you can if you want answers my lord king robert said coldly seek them from him and he turned drawing all eyes toward the window seat where william de ypres was sitting the fleming was not a big man some inches shorter than stephen but he was well muscled sturdy and robust a formidable foe on or off the battlefield his long hair was streaked with silver but the color was so fair that the grey was not at once noticeable much more conspicuous was a crescentshaped scar that angled from his left eyebrow up into his hairline his enemies called it the devils brand he and robert had more in common than either man cared to admit they were the same age fortyseven and both labored under the same disadvantage for both were born out of wedlock robert had fared better though than william de ypres the fleming was a bastard son of a count of ypres grandson of a count of flanders and when his cousin was assassinated hed pushed his own claim to flanders he might even have prevailed if not for the widespread suspicion that hed been privy to his cousins murder hed been forced to flee his homeland and for the past four years hed been a trusted member of stephens household but if stephen trusted him few others did and sentiment in the hall was very much with robert as ypres got to his feet without haste approached the dais with a calculated swagger ask of me what you will he challenged and robert swung back toward stephen pointing an accusing finger at the fleming whilst we were at argences in june waiting to do battle with count geoffrey of anjou this manyour manplotted to ambush me fortunately i was warned beforehand and was able to safeguard myself against his treachery but a man would be a fool to rely upon such luck a second timewould he not my liege the hall was utterly still not a man or woman there failed to hear what robert left unspoken the implication that if the deed was ypress the desire was stephens stephen knew what they were thinking a muscle twitched in his cheek as he looked from robert to ypres will what say you to this accusation ypres was not at all flustered to find himself in the storms center in fact he looked as if he relished it and was it not convenient my lord gloucester to have an excuse to hole up in caen safely above the fray it would have been awkward after all if youd actually had to fight are you questioning my courage indeed not my lord i am questioning your loyalty robert was white with fury dare you deny that you plotted to ambush me no ypres said and there was a stir in the audience matilda stepped unobtrusively from the shadows lightly touched stephens arm her husband did not appear to notice keeping his eyes locked upon the two men the other barons had begun to murmur among themselves ypres silenced them with a gesture ere you start building a gallows i have more to say i did plot against the countess of anjous brother but i was not seeking his death i aimed to flush him out into the open it was my hope that he would betray himself and to judge by the unseemly haste with which he abandoned our campaign id say he did that is sheer drivel few in the hall had ever seen robert so angry for his rage was usually iced over had your scheme gone as planned youd have been able to bury your guilt in my grave but you got unluckyi survived if you hope to escape punishment though youll have to do better than this you expect us to take your word that you never meant murder christs blood youve left a trail of lies from flanders to boulogne that a blind man could follow what vexes you the most my lord earl that i took steps to smoke you out or that i reminded men of a fact you would rather we forgotyour blood kinship to a woman who is our kings sworn enemy enough stephen got to his feet striding toward the edge of the dais youve both had your say hurling insults and accusations at each other serves for naught my lord of gloucester i can understand your anger whatever my lord de ypress intent he had not the right to put your loyalty to a test it was an unfortunate incident but it is over now and best forgotten as i am responsible for what is done in my name i offer you my apology to robert that was too little too late i accept your apology he said with perfunctory courtesy but what of ypres what penalty does he pay that is for me to decide but you need not fear for it will never happen again on that you have my oath roberts mouth thinned i have your oath the words themselves were innocuous but with a rising inflection they became a sardonic commentary upon the kings credibility yes by god my oaththe oath of a crowned anointed king stephen stalked down the dais steps and matilda held her breath for a longsmoldering fire seemed about to burst into a hellish conflagration her relief knew no bounds when robert chose not to strike that fatal flint and she sat down hastily in the closest seat so disquieted she did not even notice it was stephens throne stephens triumph was so fleeting though that he had no chance to savor it as enraged as he was by roberts oblique defiance he would not have let it fester for if the voice was roberts the hostility was maudes and was thus easy to shrug off but when he turned toward their audience he was jolted by what he saw on so many faces the same skepticism the same doubt that his word was good and standing there in the great hall of rouens royal castle he suddenly realized a very unpalatable truth that most men might recognize him as englands king but they no longer saw him as a man of honour matilda could not sleep unless she was sure that her children slept too and cupping her candle she bent over the bed they were sprawled in an ungainly tangle legs and arms protruding at odd angles as flaxenhaired as their father eustace had claimed both pillows and william had fallen asleep sucking his thumb again smiling she gently tucked the blankets about them for she had at last banished baldwins ghost from the nursery no longer saw his curly blond head on the pillow beside his brothers not a day passed when she did not think of him her firstborn taken too soon shed had two years though to come to terms with his loss but her little girls grave was too newly dug for they had buried her in ground frozen and snowencrusted last winters grief too recent and raw for healing matilda straightened up slowly backed quietly away from the bed where her sons slept while whispering soft as a breath as she did every night blessed mary ever virgin keep my lads safe spare them hurt or harm amen her daughter stirred as soon as she approached the bed mumbling a sleepy mama matilda sat beside her lifting the child onto her lap when mary began to nuzzle her breast she opened her gown and let the little girl suckle she had not nursed her older children for women of rank were expected to hire wet nurses but she had insisted upon nursing mary despite stephens objections prompted by feelings she could not fully explain a need that was somehow related to her grieving for baldwin whatever her reasons she had cause to be thankful for her obstinacy for the intimacy of that physical bonding with her baby when god suddenly took her other daughter her namesake just days away from her second birthday mary had been a godsend solace for her empty aching arms balm for her buffeted and bleeding faith she knew hers was a common grief knew how often children died in their first fragile years of life she knew too that it was not for her to question the mysterious workings of the almighty but god had reclaimed two of her children what if he wanted the others too and so she had decided to give him one to give him mary stephen had resisted at first for daughters were a kings political capital many an alliance had been forged in the heat of the marriage bed their little tilda had been buried with a betrothal ring having been plighttrothed to waleran beaumont a few months before her death but his wifes entreaties had soon won stephen over hed reluctantly agreed that mary would be pledged as a nun and matilda mourning her dead daughter was comforted for surely mary would find contentment in the cloistered peace of the convent as a bride of christ her salvation would be assured her happiness more certain than as a bartered bride for a waleran beaumont or a geoffrey of anjou once shed rocked mary back to sleep matilda headed for the stairwell that led up to her own bedchamber the room was shuttered and still and she wondered why it had not been made ready for her raising her candle she moved toward the table then recoiled at a sudden movement in the shadows stephen you scared me so why are you sitting here in the dark he shrugged saying nothing matilda subjected him to a candlelit scrutiny and then retraced her steps to the door where she discreetly dismissed the servant just entering with an oil lamp shed not expected this that he should still be brooding about his clash with robert of gloucester hed always been one for living utterly in the present with little patience for sifting through yesterdays mistakes even less interest in borrowing tomorrows troubles crossing to his chair she tried to massage away the tension coiled in the muscles of his neck and shoulders have you decided what you shall do about william de ypres stephen nothing he said wearily how can i in good conscience punish him for reading my mind he was wrong to act upon his suspicions but they were mine too anytime now i expect to find brother robert perched on the foot of my bed watching to see if i stop breathing in the night he is worse than a vulture though tilda at least they do not begin their deathwatch until their prey is down and floundering robertdamn his eyesbegan his vigil as soon as he set foot in my realm matilda sighed softly he will like it not if you refuse to chastise ypres even if i did lesson ypres robert would still find fault with it nothing i do would satisfy himshort of abdicating my throne in favor of his wretched sister matildas fingers had stopped moving lay still against the nape of his neck it worried her in no small measure his failure to make peace with robert she blamed them both robert for being so stiffnecked and selfrighteous stephen for being so defensive and suspicious so unwilling to bid for roberts allegiance had the power only been hers shed have lavished robert with royal favor shed have done whatever she could to give him compelling reasons for wanting stephens kingship to succeed but try though she might shed not been able to mute the echoes of their lifelong rivalry and could only watch with foreboding as the rift between them widened if robert of gloucester repudiated stephens authority and openly declared himself for his sister would his defection cause a few earth tremorsor an earthquake shed rarely heard stephen sound so disheartened i was proud of you today she said proud of the way you took responsibility for ypress plotting that was a forthright and courageous act love he shrugged again and then surprised her by saying the old king would not have apologized mayhap he would not she agreed somewhat hesitantly for she was not sure where he was going with this but it was right stephen and honourable and what else matters you are such an innocent he said and rose abruptly to his feet i tried to do what was right and honourable at the siege of exeter you remember tilda baldwin de redverss wife came out to plead for mercy hair streaming down her back feet bare like one doing penance face wet with tears a man would have had a heart of flint if he were not moved by her pleas and then redverss fellow barons added their voices arguing for clemency so i agreed to pardon redvers i freed the garrison and i was glad to do it even after redvers then turned to piracy and fled the country finding refuge with maude i was not sorry i spared them i thought id done the right thing and that was enough but not for my barons theyve been laughing at me ever since mocking me for showing mercy for showing weaknessand this from the very same men whod argued on redverss behalf even if that is so matilda said you followed your conscience what more can a man do than that stephen i do not know he admitted that is just the trouble matilda i do not know she was on her feet now too reaching out to him ive never heard you talk like this what has happened i had a rightful claim to the english throne it was no usurpation for i was the old kings favorite nephew grandson of the great william the bastard of normandy none wanted a woman on the throne you know they did not and i was urged to it by men who rejoiced that id be sparing themand englanduntold misery my oath to maude meant nothing writ on water they said but in breaking that oath i became less in their eyes where is the fairness in that ah stephen matilda got no further not knowing what to say i looked out across that hall today and i realized that i could trust none of them none of them matilda surely that is not so what of your brother and the beaumont twins ah yes my faithful brother how faithful do you think hell be if i do not set that archbishops mitre upon his head and the beaumonts will stay loyalas long as they benefit from that loyalty but do not fool yourself matildatheyd go over to maude without a qualm if she could come up with a big enough bribe even william de ypres is suspect for when a mans loyalty is for sale to the highest bidder there is always a risk of being outbid he turned at her touch looked down bleakly into her face no one i can trust tilda he repeated and then pulled her to him holding her against his chest so close she could hear the thudding of his heart only you he said softly only you caen normandy april spring in caen was cold and damp and disappointing for april had so far shown itself to be winters accomplice amabel a restless sleeper soon kicked the coverlets off but when she rolled over drowsily seeking roberts warmth she found only the chill of an empty bed sitting up she peered into the lurking night shadows then groped for her bedrobe lent is over robert how much longer do you mean to deny yourself sleep it is not penance amabel if im wakeful it is not by choice but you need not keep vigil with me go back to bed indeed not if you broke a leg id fetch a doctor to set it if you were suffering from a fever id treat it with sage and vervain so why should i do any less now youve a conscience in need of mending and ive a needle and thread at the ready shall i start stitching she could always coax a smile from him however brief are you so sure youd know where to stitch who would know your wounds better than i this particular wound was inflicted the day you knelt before stephen and pledged him your fealty id hoped it would heal in time but it has begun to fester youd best cut it out robert ere its poison starts to spread he could not hide his surprise you urged me from the first to make peace with stephen are you saying now that you were wrong nobut you were for listening to me amabel this is too serious a matter for jesting if i were to renounce my allegiance to stephen you could accept that youd not fear the consequences of course id fear themnot being a fool but what i fear more is stephens fear for he does fear you your power your castles your vassals and your kinship to maude and all the while william de ypres hovers close at hand awaiting his chance how long ere that flemish viper talks stephen into moving against you one failed ambush is enough by god if war is sure to come then you may as well follow your heartand the oath you swore to your father on maudes behalf you are a constant source of wonderment amabel i know you like maude not you never wanted to see her as englands queen never what of it neither did you holding up her hand before he could protest admit it robert your fondness for maude notwithstanding you had grave doubts about a womans wielding a mans power especially a woman wed to geoffrey of anjou but maude has a son a son with the bloodright to normandy and england and id wager that is what robs you of sleep at night robert was silent for several moments marveling at how well she knew him how easily shed seen into the most private corners of his soul you are right he conceded i did have qualms about maudes queenship i let her down and i regret that but it is young henry who has been haunting my peace i tried to do what was best for us for england and i failed i failed miserably stephen has not the makings of a king however wellmeaning he may be nor can i trust him and if what more is there to say then why let stephen choose the time and place for your reckoning you choose roberthere and now roberts relief rendered him speechless it had taken him months to reach that same conclusion and with great reluctance for he was that paradox a man of courage whose nature was inherently cautious and conservative and rebellion was as rash and reckless an action as he could envision it was also inevitable but even after hed finally acknowledged that hed not known how to break the news to his wife loath to cause her pain i thank god for your change of heart he said but ill confess that i did not expect it i well remember how you argued with me insisting that i must recognize stephen as king and i was rightthen youd have stood alone without allies but time has favored maude not stephen the scots king has led another army across the border is burning and pillaging northumbria even as we speak stephens disgruntled brother grows weary of waiting for that archbishops mitre and who can count all the lords whove come to resent the royal favors lavished upon the beaumonts and their kin it would have been sheer folly to urge a mutiny when the ship was still in the harbor sails just catching the wind but now that same ship is taking on water those splendid new sails are in tatters reefs lie aheadand how much more likely it is that the crew shall be willing to heave stephen overboard even after three decades of marriage robert could be taken aback by his wifes iceblooded practicality so at odds with the conventional wisdom that women were sentimental creatures goodhearted and guileless and charmingly giddy as much as hed come to value amabels commonsense shrewdness it troubled him occasionally that honour weighed so lightly on her ethical scales but not now now he was grateful for the stark singlemindedness of her vision and he said it means much to me that you understand what i must do i always understand my love amabel said fondly i just do not always approve now i think wed best end this midnight council no man ever died of conscience pangs the same cannot be said though for men who court chills in drafty cold fireless chambers and taking his arm she drew him back to the warmth of their marriage bed on a windy cool day in june geoffrey and maude rode into the norman city of caen the procession was a colorful one for they both appreciated the value of pageantry those bread and circuses offered by royalty since time immemorial they made a striking couple mounted on matching white palfreys dressed in rich shades of red silk maudes goldthreaded veil a gossamer swirl of sunlight geoffreys scabbard aglitter with studded gemstones the citizens were impressed by their splendor but they were not won over however handsome geoffrey was he was still angevin of the devils brood and no norman could rejoice in his triumph they were a practical people though and now that their liege lord had seen fit to welcome the angevin and his haughty wife they turned out in large numbers to watch if not to cheer as the procession wound its way through the narrow thronged streets the attention of the crowd shifted from their wouldbe duchess and her hated husband focusing instead upon the tawnyhaired darkeyed youth riding at maudes side ranulfs spirits were soaring higher than caens circling raucous gulls and his laughing exuberance was so contagious that only the most dour soul could resist smiling at his antics he was flirting shamelessly with every pretty girl he passed fishing out coins for street urchins and beggars saluting priests and widows and teasing the small boys who were trying to keep pace as they neared the castle a young woman leaned from an upper window throwing down a longstemmed rose ranulf caught it deftly casting about him for a favor to give in return several streets back hed amused the crowd by plucking a flowering sprig from an overhanging tree and presenting it to a giggling redhead now though he saw no gardens to raid but then his gaze fell upon a nearby street vendor moments later he triggered a burst of laughter by tossing a spiced wafer to the girl at the windowlaughter that spread as he then distributed wafers with comic gallantry to all female spectators within reach of those watching maude alone was not entertained although she was normanfrench and scots by blood her formative years had been spent in germany and she still clung to those lessons shed learned at the august and regal court of her first husband the holy roman emperor by the time shed come home to england it was an alien land and shed yearned for the ceremonial elegance and protective protocol of her husbands world a world shed made her own only to have it taken from her by death and her fathers implacable will even now she was disconcerted by informality finding it too closely akin to familiarity and ranulfs free and easy manner jarred her sense of decorum it was not seemly that he should jest with these norman peddlers and craftsmen and their women for he was a kings son she said nothing though for this was neither the time nor the place for a reprimand geoffrey would overhear and laugh rudely nor did she want to spoil the moment for ranulf he was entitled to play the fool as long as he did not make a habit of it ahead lay the castle the gates were open wide the walls lined with curious faces and as they rode across the drawbridge into the bailey they found robert and amabel waiting within ready to bid them welcome they were smiling and maude smiled back reining in her palfrey and holding out her hand so robert could help her dismount but her pleasure was not as pure and uncomplicated as ranulfs for as much as she rejoiced in roberts return to the true faith and as much as she wanted to forget his betrayal she had never learned how to forgive it had rained for days a cold pelting rain that defied the calendar and frustrated londoners for theyd yearned for junes warmth during a long bleak winter and now june was here but more like march in disguise although a fire had been lit in the royal bedchamber it had yet to chase away the damp on nights like this matilda missed her cozy chamber at tower royal the palace at westminster might be a more fitting residence for englands king but matilda preferred the manor house that had been her home for most of her marriage when will papa be back eustace was straddling a bench by the fire kicking rushes into the hearth he sounded quite ingenuous as if his only concern were with stephens whereabouts but matilda knew better for she knew her son of all her children eustace was the most stubborn the one most determined to get his own way it was bedtime he was resisting for hed decided that since he was eight now he should not have to go to sleep at the same time as his younger brother william occasionally hed hide but his usual tactic was delay the strategy he was employing tonight and hed been bombarding his mother with earnest queries about how long dragons live and whether elephants truly fear mice and why it never snows in summer his sudden interest in his fathers itinerary didnt fool matilda in the least but she was a woman of infinite patience and she said indulgently passing strange for i was sure id told you all about your fathers capture of hereford castle it had been seized by a wicked man named talbot an accomplice of maudes but stephen hastened west with an army and took the castle after a fourweek siege as his last letter said he was about to return to london we may expect him any day now sothe sooner you go off to bed the sooner the morrow will arriveand possibly your papa too it was not that easy of course eustace made use of all the weapons in his arsenal pleading whining sulking even tears stephen would have capitulated early on but matilda was made of sterner stuff than her softspoken demeanor would indicate and she prevailed stephen arrived much sooner than matilda expected that very night as she was making ready for bed she hastily dismissed her ladies for she shied away from public displays of affection waiting until the door closed to welcome her husband home his mantle was dripping and underneath his tunic was wet too she was not surprised for he was as indifferent to weather as he was to late hours often riding by torchlight or in a drenching downpour he was she knew one of the few battle commanders willing to undertake a winter campaign what did surprise her though was his subdued offhand greeting by now hed shed his mantle and she helped him struggle free of his soggy woolen tunic his shirt seemed dry and she steered him toward the hearth then poured a cupful of hippocras before beginning her gentle interrogation you seem oddly glum for a man whos captured a castle and put his enemies to flight what is amiss stephen you know me too well sweet lord save me if ever i have a serious secret to keep from you she was not taken in either by his ready smile or by his rueful jest and waited he drank paused to pull off his boots and drank again my victory lasted about as long as one of our eustaces promises not to hit his brother the garrison surrendered when the town caught fire i suppose they feared it would spread to the castle i let them go free for they were but following geoffrey talbots orders he shot her a challenging look was reassured by her obvious approval id not have been so merciful to that hellspawn talbot he was not willing to take his chances with his men though and fled as the siege began but as soon as i rode away from hereford he skulked back and torched the houses on the south side of the river the coward she said indignantly but you must not brood about such a craven sinner stephen hell answer for his treachery if not before your throne at westminster before the throne of the almighty come judgment day talbot is the least of my problems tilda ive got the scots king ravaging the north and geoffrey of anjou leading an army into normandy againand on the road to london i encountered a herald from the earl of gloucester robert fitz roy had renounced his homage claiming that id broken faith by sanctioning william de ypress treachery and that i was no true king having usurped the throne from the rightful heiress his sister oh no matilda stared at him in such pained dismay that he reached out swiftly drew her into his arms she clung tightly fearfully for what shed most dreaded had come to pass behind her closed eyelids an image formed robert of gloucester so controlled so competent and so dangerous shed never doubted that if there was one man in christendom capable of wresting the crown from stephen it was robert why had stephen not done more to keep robert content too late though for recriminations too late soit is to be war yes he said and i shall need your help tilda just tell me what you would have me do besiege dover castle me she gasped you are jesting of course no sweetheart i am quite serious id intended to march north and force the scots king to take the field against me but roberts treachery poses a greater threat ive good men in yorkshire men whom i can trust to repel the scots whilst i strike at the heart of roberts domainsbristol castle it will not be easy to capture god knows but it is much too dangerous to remain a rebel stronghold not when it can menace the whole of the west country yet i dare not overlook dover castle either dover would be roberts natural choice for a landing if i can deny maude a safe port mayhap i can strand them in normandy and then stephen i understand that i do but i cannot matilda you can and you must you are the countess of boulogne in your own right can summon vassals not only from boulogne but the honour of kent too your fleet can blockade dovers harbor starve the castle into submission if need be and patrol the channel making it too risky for maude and robert to attempt an invasion you have the power lass and now i need you to use it on my behalf matilda shook her head mutely daunted by the magnitude of what he was asking and he stepped back looking down intently into her face you are their liege lady you have the right adding coaxingly it is not as if youd be making command decisions sweet youd have battle captains to direct the siege no one would expect you to pitch a tent under the castle walls or to launch the mangonels with your own hand but she would be expected to give commands to deal with unruly vassals to enter into a mans world and make all believe she belonged there stephen i do not think i can do this it is not a womans place tell that to maude his smile was wry but his hands had tightened upon her shoulders you must agree my love you must do this for me you are the only one who can stephen quickly realized that his siege of bristol castle was going to take months and with no certainty of success roberts chief castle was virtually impregnable ensconced behind two fastflowing rivers the avon and the frome encircled by a deep ditch protected not only by its own bailey walls but by those of the town too patience had never been one of stephens virtues and he soon grew restless then discouraged and was not long in deciding that bristols downfall could wait abandoning the siege he went looking for easier targets and found them at castle cary and harptree held by roberts vassals but as july ebbed away in a haze of heat trouble flared in the border town of shrewsbury shrewsburys castle had been given by the old king to his young queen adeliza twelve years earlier as castellan shed appointed the sheriff of shropshire william fitz alana man of influence in the marcheslord of blancminster but he was also a man with marital ties to the enemy camp his wife christina was niece to robert and amabel fitz roy as soon as robert renounced his allegiance to stephen fitz alan did too declaring that he held shrewsbury castle for his liege lady and rightful queen the empress maude by the first week of august he found himself disputing that point with his king shrewsbury had been blessed with natural defenses the town lay within a horseshoe curve of the river severn surrounded on three sides by water shrewsbury could be approached by land only from the northsite of the castle for the past four weeks a royal army had been encamped before the rebel fortress but so far stephens assaults had been driven off and fitz alan remained defiant scorning all demands for surrender the sky was barren of clouds a bleached bluewhite that shimmered with heat for august had been a month of drought and dust stephens stallion had broken out in a sweat and was pawing the trampled grass warhorses were bred as much for their fiery tempers as for their strength and those nearest to stephen prudently retreated stephen himself did not notice his destriers restiveness for his attention was utterly focused upon the castle it looked deserted for most of its inhabitants were barricaded within the great keep and the men posted along the bailey walls were hunkered down out of sight rising up occasionally to heave a lance or shoot a bow then hastily ducking behind the stockade as stephens archers returned the fire large rocks scattered about the bailey churnedup earth smashed horse troughs and collapsed wooden shedsall testified to the damage done by stephens siege machines as he watched one of his mangonels went into action again a creaking windlass slowly hauled the beam back the men loaded a pile of heavy stones and then released the triggering cord causing the beam to snap upright slamming into the crossbar and catapulting a rock shower over the castle walls they could hear the thudding as the stones hit and then a chokedoff scream that was a familiar sound though and they paid it no heed by now stephens companions were watching him as intently as he was studying the castle the earl of leicester was the first to lose patience for the beaumonts had as scanty a supply of that particular commodity as stephen did what say you my liege are we going to make another try with the scaling ladders or not noweve lost enough men that way stephen tightened the reins swinging his mount in a circle meet me in my command tentall of you they did although it took a good quarter hour to gather them together stephen sat crosslegged on his bed watching them jockey for position in the tents confining quarters robert beaumont was comfortably seated on a coffer chest swapping bawdy jokes with miles fitz walter but his blue eyes were keeping stephen under an unobtrusive surveillance stephen had come to realize that the nonchalant affability of the beaumonts masked a shrewd sense of their own worth and their own wants hed come too to rely upon that shrewdness even if he sometimes fretted that their loyalties were not rooted deep he did believe theyd keep faith though for no family had benefited as much from his kingship as theirs had done geoffrey de mandeville had profited too so had simon de senlis for stephen had restored to him part of his lost patrimony granting him the earldom of northampton to compensate for the earldom claimed by his stepfather the scots king stephens gaze rested upon them both for a moment before moving on to maudes men for that was how he thought of miles fitz walter and brien fitz count miles was not one to escape notice for he had a redheads temper a soldiers taste for blunt speaking and a steelyeyed stare that was in itself a formidable weapon he looked like a man whod spent most of his life outdoors with flyaway reddishbrown hair that always appeared windblown and skin deeply freckled by the sun taut as leather bowlegged and barrelchested he was a skilled huntsman and an aggressive able battle commander he cast a lengthy shadow over the marches sheriff of gloucestershire and staffordshire and it was often said of him that he ruled the whole welsh border from the river severn to the sea hed been devoted to the old king his allegiance to stephen had yet to be tested but if he made an uncertain friend hed make a more dangerous enemy and so stephen was trying hard to convince himself that selfinterest would keep miles loyal if what first impressed about miles was the coiled power the sheer physical impact of his presence the initial impression of brien fitz count was of polished impeccable courtesy a disarming smile and distance the most superficial assessment revealed miles to be just what he wasa man most at home in the saddle sword in hand brien attractive urbane and unusually well educated was obviously a courtier and thus easily dismissed by those scanning the horizon for political rivals that was too simple though for there was nothing at all simple about brien fitz count a man who kept his own counsel a cynic who was still saddened whenever his jaundiced view of mankind was confirmed a man of deliberation and caution who was reckless in the extreme upon the battlefield a man of noble blood and ignoble birth tolerant of all failures but his own stephen trusted brien even less than he did miles for brien was that rarity a man who seemed willing to admit women into that select circle of those who wielded royal authority stephen had long suspected that brien would defect to maude within hours of her landing on english soil and oddly that hurt for he had a genuine liking for this illegitimate honourable son of a breton count sensing that they shared an uncommon willingness to forgive human folly a great pity he thought that brien should be so eager to entangle himself in maudes web they were all here by now all but one stephen was not surprised that it should be the earl of chester whod keep them waiting nor did he doubt it was deliberate randolph de gernons counted it a day wasted if he did not ruffle a few feathers and if the feathers were royal so much the better he was a man with vast estates numerous vassals and equally numerous enemies for he was as badtempered as a badger as proud as lucifer and he collected grudges as if he thought they were coins of the realm but even if hed possessed the serene temperament of a saint hed have been the object of stephens suspicions for his young wife was robert fitz roys daughter not only maudes namesake but her favorite niece so far though chester had remained aloof from the political turmoil afflicting england and normandy and if he had any interest in making maude queen of england he alone knew it chester seemed to sense just how far he could push his provocations and he made his entrance mere moments before stephens irritation flared into active anger swarthy and stocky with deepset dark eyes half hidden under lowering brows lanky inkblack hair that reached below his shoulders and a harsh gravelly voice that could rattle shutters when he was in full cry chester looked at first glance more like a brigand than a baron of the realm and since he so often acted as if his only true peer were god he got no warm welcome now from the other lords unfazed by the chill he elbowed his way toward stephen i assume this summons means well be launching another attack and high time too stephen ignored the gibe we have no choice but to attack again for it could take months to starve them out and theyve made it offensively clear that theyll not surrender gods bones why should they surrender they know full well that their defiance will cost them nothing no more than it did the garrisons at exeter and hereford stephen glowered at the outspoken earl and of course he said sarcastically men would be so much quicker to surrender if they expected to be hanged satisfied with his riposte he glanced back at the other men we have much to do and little time to spare for i want the assault to begin at noon there were surprised murmurs for none saw the need for such haste why today miles asked curiously why not wait till the morrow because stephen said we cannot be sure that on the morrow the wind will still be blowing from the north and he watched smiling faintly as he saw them absorb understand and approve the final assault upon shrewsbury castle began after a priest called upon the almighty to grant them victory the castle defenders warned by the sudden activity in the royal encampment had taken up position along the bailey walls watching warily as the battering ram was brought up they were puzzled though by what the king did next for he dispatched a small armed force toward the castle crouching behind large shields they advanced upon the castle moat a deep dry ditch it had been filled in weeks ago by stephens soldiers heaped with dirt and brushwood and rocks when the castle garrison realized that the men below them were throwing more brushwood and straw into the ditch they understood and arrows and stones began to rain down from the battlements but they were too late torches were already searing through the air aimed at the sundried straw and within moments the moat was filled with fire the garrison tried frantically to contain the flames pouring water onto the timbered walls in a vain attempt to keep the blaze from spreading but in fighting the fire they exposed themselves to another sort of fire coming from stephens archers and crossbowmen what drove them off the walls though was the smoke men were soon coughing and choking for the wind was blowing dense black clouds over the walls they retreated reeling about blindly in the sudden dark smothering the bailey and by then the kings battering ram was smashing into the smoldering wooden gates the siege of shrewsbury castle had lasted more than four weeks the final assault lasted less than four hours once stephens men had control of the bailey they set fire to the door of the keep forced their way into fitz alans refuge the fighting was brief and bloody and over by vespers as the peaceful pealing of church bells echoed through the town the fearful citizens bolted their doors shuttered their windows and prayed that shrewsbury would be spared the fallen castles fate but stephens triumph was flawed and his initial elation was soon curdled by disappointment for a thorough search of the castle revealed a frustrating factthat william fitz alan had somehow managed to escape the trap he was not among the prisoners taken nor among the bodies being collected for burial an interrogation of the survivors revealed nothing of substance for fitz alans men were loyal and stephen loath to resort to torture fitz alans wife was gone too but stephen had expected that for rumors had circulated for weeks that all the women had been spirited out of the castle before the siege began fitz alans flight was far more recent possibly only hours old and stephen gave orders for a housetohouse search of shrewsbury although without any expectation of success his men had barricaded both of shrewsburys bridges but he knew fitz alan could have gotten a small boat crossed the river by night and so there was no surprise when the towns search proved futile if fitz alan had slipped through the royal nets his uncle was not so lucky arnulf de hesdin had remained behind and that night he was escorted into the great hall to confront his king the hall still bore the visible scars of the days assault broken tables and stools had been piled in a corner forming a forlorn pyramid of splintered wood there had been no time to sweep up the bloodied floor rushes and the smell of smoke still hung heavily upon the air arnulf de hesdin had not emerged unscathed either from the siege his thinning hair was matted and snarled his eyes smokereddened a rivulet of dried blood smudging his cheek caking in his beard but he stode into the hall as if his chains were badges of honour and faced stephen defiantly without a trace of fear or repentance i am here my lord king do with me what you will he said flinging down his submission as if it were a gauntlet one might think you were the anointed king stephen snapped instead of a miserable wretch of a rebel that craven fitz alans scapegoat arnulf flushed angrily my nephew is no coward we insisted he get away whilst he could for hed be of no use to the empress maude in one of your prisons stephen had reddened too how dare you speak so to me your king you come before me in chains boast of your loyalty to that unworthy woman and you expect me to dowhat commend you for your candor no by god noive had enough stephen paused for breath his chest heaving his rage was surging to the surface like a river spilling its banks for his resentment had been rising for months and there in shrewsbury castles great hall it at last reached flood tide breaking loose in a torrent of infuriated frustrated accusation and reproach i swore to rule by law and gods holy word to do justice to every man be he beggar or bishop i sought no bloodshed forgave betrayals with a good heart and held out my hand to enemies and rebels and malcontents alike for scriptures would have us forgive their inequity and remember their sin no more and my reward was to be mocked to be made the butt of jokes to see my mercy scorned as weakness again he paused the hall was utterly silent all were listening attentively for once let them listen let them learn but scriptures speak of more than forgiveness he said hoarsely for his throat had become tight and raw they say too that rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and the wages of sin is death this man arnulf de hesdin was taken in rebellion against his lawful king he deserves to hangand hang he will stephen swallowed with an effort arnulf de hesdins mouth was ajar his color draining away there was open surprise on the faces of his barons and sudden wariness on the faces of the other prisoners but not outright fear not yet they owed him a mortal debt every man jack of them did they think him too softhearted to demand payment hed show them otherwise he knew full well what his uncle the old king would have done and he said harshly hang the garrison too hang them all the following day dawned in a burst of latesummer sunlight by midmorning the great hall was stifling stephens bitter satisfaction had ebbed away during the night he awoke in an oddly morose mood not sure why his triumph should have soured while he slept he picked indifferently at the food on his breakfast trencher and refused curtly when he was asked if he wished to watch arnulf de hesdin die the doomed men had been given a nights grace to make their peace with god but once the sky lightened the executions began there were too many for a gallowsninetyfour of them more than stephen had realizedand so his flemish mercenaries were dragging them up onto the castle battlements bodies were soon dangling above the moat like grotesque decorations a sight to strike terror into the hearts of the cowed townspeople but death was much quicker this way if less dignified most of the men died of broken necks rather than the slow strangulation of a gallows execution stephens chosen hangmen went about their task with matteroffact efficiency but the sheer numbers of the condemned slowed them down and as the morning wore on stephen grimly concluded that the hangings were likely to take all day stephens fraying temper was subjected to still more strain by the unexpected noontime arrival of his brother the bishop of winchester attended by his usual deferential entourage the bishop swept into the great hall like an ill wind made stephen a perfunctory obeisance subject to sovereign and then demanded brother to brother to know what was going on that should be obvious stephen said tersely we are hanging the castle garrison the bishop nodded approvingly gods will be done he said sententiously and then lowered his voice revealing he did have a modicum of tact im glad to hear that youre finally showing some sense in truth stephen if youd heeded my advice all along youd not be racing about the country like a crazed fire fighter dousing one blaze only to have another flare up as soon as you move on the bishop glanced about the hall then frowning for it was filled with men he little liked or trusted one of those highflying beaumont hawks waleran nothe other one leicester for waleran was in normandy trying to chase geoffrey back into anjou the taciturn earl of northampton a man likely to welcome salvation with a scowl that hellspawn mandeville looking much too comfortable at stephens side maudes spies miles fitz walter and that breton counts bastard get the earl of chester holding court across the hall as if he and stephen were competing kings not men hed want as an audience not men hed want within a hundred miles of his brother but stephen was a sheep stubbornly set upon running with wolves i need to speak with you stephenin private stephen could guess what was in store for him another of his brothers lectures about his manifold failings as a king interspersed with indignant rebukes for taking so unforgivably long to name him archbishop of canterbury not that stephen could actually bestow the archbishops mitre as that was for an ecclesiastical synod to do but the kings candidate would clearly have the advantage and henry was determined to obtain stephens official endorsement an endorsement stephen was equally determined to withhold for both he and matilda were convinced that his brother could not be trusted with so much power yet he was reluctant to be the one to slay henrys dream and so hed been temporizing for months now hoping that if the problem could be ignored long enough it might somehow go away of course it did not the bishop only grew more insistent more aggrieved and stephen knew a confrontation was inevitable but not today god willing not today i would that i could spare the time he said but ive promised to grant an audience to the townspeople and the monks from the abbey the citizens of shrewsbury had dreaded the castles fall not because they were so devoted to maudes cause or even to their lord william fitz alan most of them cared little about who ruled in faraway westminster as long as they were left in peace instead theyd found themselves caught up in a rebellion not of their making spoils of war for stephens muchfeared flemings as it was customary to reward a victorious army with plunder and looting they were luckier than they knew though for william de ypres was in normandy with waleran beaumont had he been at the siege the towns fate might have been far different hed have insisted that shrewsbury be turned over to his flemish mercenaries for their sport but stephen had chosen to rein them in much to their disappointment there had been enough killing he said brusquely and although theyd continued to grumble among themselves theyd not dared to disobey him those bodies already stinking in the sun were a convincing argument indeed that this king was not to be trifled with after all the townspeople had selected their provost and a handful of their most prominent citizens to plead their case with the king stephen was not interested in their carefully rehearsed pledges of heartfelt support only half listening to their predictable disavowals of entanglement in fitz alans treachery but when they were done he agreed to spare shrewsbury his royal wrath provided that they kept faith from now on the delegation willingly promised loyalty to the grave so great was their relief at their reprieve and they then made haste to withdraw lest stephen change his mind stephen was not as accommodating to the abbot of the benedictine monastery of st peter and st paul for hed been stung by the monks attempt to remain neutral as if he and maude were claimants on equal footing as if he were not a consecrated king and a good son of the church nor was abbot herbert a particularly effective advocate for he was a wellmeaning man of limited vision and not even ten years at the abbeys helm had done much to expand his horizons stephen had already decided to levy punitive fines upon the townspeople and the monks he was wondering whether or not the abbey might also benefit from a change of command when a courier was ushered into the hall crying out that he was the bearer of news the king must hear straightaway the messenger was disheveled and dusty his tunic sweatstained his fatigue as deeply etched in his face as the dirt of the road he looked triumphant though and as he knelt before stephen he broke into a wide cocky grin i come from his grace the archbishop of york my liege he would have you know that a great battle was fought against the scots army on monday last at cowton moor near northallerton god was with us my lord king for your enemies were utterly routed the field was strewn with their bodies and the scots king fled like a hare so did his son but stephen was no longer listening the details could wait rising to his feet he gave a jubilant shout silencing the hall did you all hear he demanded we have defeated the scots king slaughtered his army and sent him slinking back across the border where he belongs stephen was immediately surrounded by men eager to offer their congratulations and share in his joy some were motivated by a desire to curry favor with the king otherssuch as robert beaumonthad a vested interest in stephens survival the earl of northampton rejoiced in davids defeat fully as much as stephen he was actually smiling the earl of chester had a rivalry of his own with the scots king for he and david had competing claims to the honour of carlisle and many of the men were simply grateful that an alien scots invasion had been thwarted only two exchanged a covert glance of quickly masked dismaymiles fitz walter and brien fitz countfor maude had gone down to defeat with david at cowton moor and they both knew it wine was soon flowing in abundance toasts were drunk to the aged archbishop of york and then to robert de ferrers and william daumale stephens battle commanders the heroes of the day jokes were made at the scots kings expense and maude came in for her share too the scots were damned as a savage barbaric people highly partisan accounts of scots atrocities were related for which they blamed maude fully as much as david she was after all the mans niece they reminded themselves and only brien and miles remembered that david was matildas uncle too but in the midst of these revelries stephen suddenly grew quiet setting down his wine cup he gazed across the hall toward the unshuttered windows and then said pensively i was wondering if it might not be a christian act to spare those prisoners whove not yet been hanged what better way to thank the almighty for our victory they stared at him momentarily startled into silence all but the abbot whod been waiting patiently for the king to resume their interrupted audience there were worldly men of god and then there were those like abbot herbert beaming at stephen he said warmly bless you my liege that would be a deed well done in a pigs eye robert beaumont sputtered half choking on his wine and miles reached over thumping him solicitously on the back you disappoint me rob where is your sense of charity i think the king is right that it would indeed please the almighty to pardon those poor wretches for certes it would please the lady maude the bishop said acidly as you know right well my lord by now the hall was in turmoil each man attempting to voice his opinion to make himself heard above the din only two held their peace geoffrey de mandeville and brien fitz count the former looked faintly amused by the uproar the latter pained it was not that brien did not want to see the condemned prisoners reprieved for he did in briens eyes they were not rebels and they did not deserve to die for keeping faith with their queen for maude was the rightful sovereign not stephen and god forgive him but he ought never to have disavowed his oath for in saving his lands hed sacrificed his honour but still brien kept silent unable to encourage stephens folly as miles was doing with such zest if stephen had determined at the outset to spare the shrewsbury garrison as he had spared the garrisons at exeter and hereford hed have done himself no good for certes however much mercy might be admired in saints brien mused it made men most uneasy when encountered in kings but to condemn the prisoners and then relent that would be sheer madness he might stand aside and watch as stephen cut his own throat he could not bring himself to offer stephen a dagger stephen was under siege being assailed from all sides by insistent voices his head had begun to ache why did a crown complicate matters so as count of mortain and boulogne hed done what he pleased and an easier life it had been too he glared at his brother the bishop how dare henry speak to him like this as if he were a green stripling without a grain of sense well hed best learn to content himself with winchester for by all thats holy hed never get his grasping hands upon canterbury if only tilda were here but she was at dover and his only allies a weakling abbot and that crafty tame fox of maudes if miles was urging clemency it must be wrong so why then did it feel right enough he said angrily flinging up his hand for silence you chatter at me like a flock of hungry magpies and for naught i never said i intended for certes to pardon those men it was idle talk no more than that they subsided relieved eventually conversation resumed men drifted away from the dais talk turned again to the humiliation of the scots king the likely whereabouts of william fitz alan the need to appoint a new sheriff in his place and out upon the castle battlements men continued to die a ghostlike swirling fog had wafted in from the channel shrouding the chalky cliffs usually visible for miles the night air was damp uncommonly cold for september and a seasalted wind chilled victors and vanquished alike as the gates of dover castle slowly swung open to admit the queen of england the sight that met matildas eyes was an eerie one a circle of flickering flames yellow beacons of light stabbing through the fog as she drew nearer she realized that she was looking upon the flaring torches of her own guards for theyd insisted upon entering the castle first intent upon making sure that there would be no surprises no eleventhhour change of heart by the castellan her nervousness eased somewhat as she rode toward their beckoning glow wondering if sailors felt this way upon catching the reassuring glimmer of dovers light tower blessed lady mary how lucky she had been and how well served it had been her vassals duty to respond of course once shed called upon them but shed gotten from these men of kent and boulogne more than grudging service rank seemed not to matter for shed found champions in equal numbers among her knights serjeants and menatarms she still did not understand how shed managed to touch their calloused soldiers hearts could only be grateful for it she was grateful too for the man riding at her side she was convinced that the arrival of robert de ferrers fresh from his triumph over the scots had marked a turning point in the siege how good of stephen to send her such a stalwart knight hed be well rewarded she and stephen would see to that there he is my lady walkelin maminot who held the castle for robert fitz roy and waits now to deliver it into your hands reining in his stallion robert de ferrers swung to the ground then reached up to help matilda dismount approaching her was one of the largest men shed ever seen towering over her like a massive oak to look up into his face she had to tilt her head back so far that her veil started to slip she grabbed for it awkwardly more uneasy than she cared to admit i yield to you my lady the giant had a surprisingly gentle voice his face was grave but unafraid for hed been assured there would be no bloody reprisals taken against his men as at shrewsbury drawing his sword from its sheath he held it out to her hilt first and as she timidly took it he sank to his knees before her madame dover castle is yours i accept it in the name of my lord husband the king matilda said as loudly as she could she well knew that her whispery littlegirls voice did not carry far and it was important that all should hear turning she handed the sword to robert de ferrers glad to be rid of it and then motioned walkelin maminot to raise at that her men raised a cheer for the siege of dover castle was over my lady may i escort you back to the priory guesthouse she nodded and took ferrerss arm letting him lead her toward her mare sir robert thank you if not for you dover castle would not have surrendered you may be sure i will not forget he shrugged off her praise with a smile i talked some sense into walkelin no more than that it would have been foolhardy for him not to listen in truth what with him wed to my daughter this is an evil war matilda sighed i know that is a womans belief and not one youd be likely to share but this war is more accursed than most sir robert for it is tearing families asunder god willing it shall soon be over now the loss of dover castle is a grievous blow to maudes hopes but you give me too much credit and yourself too little my lady it was your fleet that blockaded dovers harbor was it not those were your captains directing the siege your men vowing to hold fast through the winter if need be they were fighting for you my lady you came often to the camp you fetched a priest for the dying you comforted the wounded believe me madame this victory was yours too matilda almost argued with him so strong was the force of habit but then she smiled a smile of sudden realization and startled reassessment yes she said proudly it truly was nottingham england april high white clouds dappled a sapphirecolored sky and a brisk wind rippled the tall marsh grass giving an occasional glimpse of sunsilvered water as days go this one was well nigh perfect stephen thought with the best yet to come the creature perched upon his fist was equally expectant its hooded gaze turning instinctively toward the sky talons digging into the leather of his gauntlet the greyhounds and their handlers were in position by now downriver it was time and stephen signaled for his men to flush their prey as they moved in the reeds parted there was a flash of grey and a large crane flew upward powerful beating wings taking it into the air over their heads stephen removed the hood without haste and by the time he cast the gerfalcon off the crane was well on its way toward the river trent the gerfalcon rose higher and higher into the sky white and sleek and silent as if racing the clouds rather than the crane but then with sudden and terrible speed it was diving a deadly streak of light swooping down upon its quarry they collided in midair the gerfalcon striking with such force that the larger bird could not break free and they plummeted together to earth in a flurry of bloodied feathers stephen gave an exultant shout echoed by the other men for hawking was a universally shared passion even though the best birds were reserved for those of high birth the dogs had been set loose and were racing toward the struggling crane greyhounds were favored for heron hunting as there was always a danger that a falcon might be injured by so large a bird cranes and herons were not its natural prey stephen waited tensely his view blocked by the high marsh grass but then one of the dog handlers rose up gesturing triumphantly and stephen turned back to his companions saying with a relieved grin all is well come lets not keep her waiting for her reward as he started to dismount though his attention was drawn by approaching riders already within recognition range the brothers beaumont waleran and robert and their younger brother hugh newly named as earl of bedford were you in time to see the kill that was diana as fine a greenland falcon as youll find on english shores did you see her stoop faster than any arrow ever launched they had indeed witnessed the gerfalcons strike and were not stinting in their praise waleran was unusually well read for a noblemanmany of his rank scorned reading as a clerks skilland he was knowledgeable enough to appreciate the aptness of the gerfalcons name but he was curious as to how stephen had learned of a pagan goddess of the hunt well aware that the king neither knew nor cared about the religious beliefs of ancient rome when stephen explained that the gerfalcon had been a gift from his brother the bishop of winchester waleran laughed aloud pleased to have solved the puzzle with such ease mind her well he said jovially for youll be getting no more hawks from that one not with his hopes as dead as dianas crane stephen did not join in the laughter for his breach with his brother was no joking matter but neither did he chide waleran for his plain speaking as hed only said what they all knewthat the bishop had been nursing a mortal grudge since december when a church synod had elected theobald abbot of bec as the new archbishop of canterbury dismounting the beaumonts followed stephen and william de ypres toward the river by now it was all over the crane had been killed the gerfalcon retrieved and the greyhounds rewarded the cranes heart had been cut out saved for stephen and he was feeding it to diana when geoffrey de mandeville rode up he at once urged stephen to fly the gerfalcon again complaining that his own falcons were already in moult stephen had intended to return to the castle still visible in the distance for it had been built upon a towering rock of red sandstone high above the meadows of the rivers leen and trent it was filling rapidly with highborn guests summoned to attend his easter court and he knew he ought to be getting back but when the beaumonts added their voices to mandevilles he let himself be persuaded and they were soon heading downriver in search of fresh prey as they rode along stephen boasted of the coming festivities virtually every peer of the realm would be at nottingham to witness his ratification of the treaty matilda had negotiated at durham with the scots kings envoys she was due to arrive any day now and bringing with her young harry davids son and heir the lad was to be treated as an honoured guest stephen said but with a sly smile for they all knew he was also a valuable hostage a pledge of his fathers good faith and when waleran wondered aloud how matilda had ever coaxed the scots kings consent stephen laughed my little bird he said proudly has begun to try her wings to fly farther and farther from the nest it was her own suggestion that she be the one to meet with the scots maude was not davids only niece she said and it was time she reminded him of that i ask you waleran who could have guessed how much fulfillment shed get from besieging a castle women are truly the most mysterious of the almightys creations and beyond the puny powers of mortal men to comprehend he laughed again a soaring sound of pure pleasure the laughter of a man utterly content with his wife his hawks and his world on this mild thursday in holy week the beaumonts did not share stephens admiration for matildas newfound fortitude they feared few rivals at the kings court but they well knew the queen could pose a formidable threat should she begin meddling in matters of statecraft what did it avail them to have the kings ear whilst in the hall or on the hunt as long as matilda held sway in the royal marriage bed the last word would always be hers they were too canny to criticize her directly though contenting themselves now with expressing qualms about the scots treaty was there not a risk that men might think the king had been overly generous in its terms stephen was not troubled by their doubts i know men will like it not he conceded the talk in alehouses and taverns would scorch my ears off and ill not deny that i paid a high price for peace with the scots but i had no choice not if i was to avoid fighting two wars at once how could i hope to drive maude and robert fitz roy into the sea if all the while i had to keep watching my back we know what happens to grain when it is caught between two millstones it is pounded into grist so if i must buy davids millstone i will and not begrudge the cost for that frees me to repel maudes invasion if and when it ever comes why do you say that my liege robert beaumont asked think you that maude will lose heart now that her appeal to the pope has come to naught he sounded so dubious that stephen had to chuckle no rob i do not however much id like to if ive learned nothing else in these past three years it is that maudes stubbornness runs wider and deeper than the river thames one of gods own angels could appear before her in a blaze of light tell her that it was the almightys will that she abandon this doomed quest of hers and shed not listen but she is still stranded in normandy and that is not likely to change in the foreseeable future i control all the ports now save only bristol and robert would never let her attempt a bristol crossing for it would be much too dangerous to sail all the way around cornwall so let her plot and scheme and lust after my crown to her hearts content just as long as she does it from a distance the beaumonts exchanged speculative glances in which they silently agreed that stephen was deluding himself if he truly believed maude was safely stranded in normandy but they agreed too that there was no reason to dispute his delusions not today waleran guided his stallion closer to stephens handsome roan saying quietly indeed i hope you are right my liege for we have enemies enough in our midst scheming not from a distance like maude but ofttimes in your very presence you mean the earl of chester i suppose ill not deny that hell be enraged once he learns the terms of the scots treaty nor will i deny that hell neer forgive me for granting the honour of carlisle to davids son we did not trust him anyway though so naught has been lost hes one for blustering and ranting to get his way but outright rebellioni think not you know i like chester not my lord king but we face a more dangerous foe than he one protected by powerful armor indeedthe trappings of holy church stephen reined in his mount turning to stare at the younger man my brother ill grant you that ive never seen him so wroth he blames you too since the new archbishop comes from bec which has benefited handsomely from beaumont largesse but even if he truly believes were guilty of a sinister conspiracy to deprive him of his just due i do not think hed betray me i was not speaking of your brother the bishop of winchester it is the bishop of salisbury whom i fear why stephen was not surprised though for hed long harbored his own suspicions of his uncles justiciar no subject of the king should wield the power that salisbury does he has more kinsmen at westminster than a dog has fleas just consider how far and wide he has cast his nets his nephew nigel is your treasurer and bishop of ely another nephew alexander is bishop of lincoln his bastard son is your chancellor and god alone knows how many more cousins and lackeys are underfoot eager to do his bidding the chancery is his and so is the exchequer he holds your government in the palm of his hand and if that were not troubling enough he controls as well some of the best fortified castles in the realm sherborne devizes malmesbury newark sleaford and salisbury jesu pity us my liege if those strongholds were to fall into maudes hands you have reason to fear that they would indeed i do my informants tell me that salisbury and his nephews have begun to stock the larders of those castles to garrison them with breton and flemish mercenaries they never venture out these days without a large armed bodyguard if they are innocent why are they preparing for war you truly believe they are conspiring with maude stephen asked and waleran nodded solemnly have you any proof of their treachery nonot yet but if we wait till we have the evidence in hand it may be too late by now william de ypres and geoffrey de mandeville had reined in their horses too and were listening intently when waleran admitted that evidence was lacking stephens disappointment was so obvious that geoffrey de mandeville saw his opportunity proofs can always befound he said significantly that was a miscalculation no stephen said sharply ill have no forgeries foisted upon me geoffrey de mandeville was a proud man for a moment his courtiers mask slipped and he came closedangerously closeto reminding stephen that his kingship was based upon a lie hugh bigods convenient claim that hed heard the old kings deathbed repudiation of maude he caught himself just in time and by then waleran beaumont had control of the conversation again no one said anything of forgeries my liege there is another way i understand that bishop roger has refused to attend your easter courta suspicious refusal in truth summon him again to your court and this time make it a royal command stephen frowned for he was still irked with geoffrey de mandeville and vexed too by his failure to follow walerans thinking and if i did what then bishop roger and his nephews will comereluctantly but theyll come we can also be sure that theyll arrive with an armed escort all know how hottempered the flemings are how quick to brawl especially once wine starts to flow if trouble breaks out at your court youd have every right to demand that the bishops yield their castles to the crown for it is a serious offense to breach the kings peace stephen was silent for several moments yes he said at last i would have the right just as you say but what if the bishops men cause no trouble you may be sure my lord king waleran said blandly that there will be trouble during the first week of july normandy was battered with galeforce winds and drenching rains and it seemed drearily appropriate to maude that the storm should have swept in from the south from geoffreys anjou by friday the squall had blown over but summer had not yet reclaimed its lost territory and all evening the servants had been stoking a fire in the open hearth the scene in argentan castles great hall was one of familiar and reassuring domestic tranquillitydeceptively so for strain and disappointment and splintered hopes were not always visible to the casual eye the women were stitching patterns later to be pieced together into a vast and intricate wallhanging an ambitious undertaking that amabel meant to rival the famous tapestry of bayeux depicting william the bastards english invasion maude alone had declined to contribute to amabels creation she was a very proficient needlewoman easily amabels equal for she was that most driven of beings a perfectionist compelled to excel even at pastimes that gave her no pleasure but she cared little for female companionship and even less for traditional female pursuits preferring instead to challenge robert to a game of chess robert was a skilled player his game flawed only by an excess of caution but because he made his moves with the protracted deliberation that men usually reserved for lifeordeath decisions maude had ample opportunities to observe the other inhabitants of the hall their brother rainald was dozing in the closest window seat maude envied him that ability to catnap at will he never seemed to let their troubles diminish the zest he took in satisfying hungers of the flesh be they for food ale women or sleep he was as rash as robert was circumspect headstrong and easily angered but he did not lack for courage and he could be boisterous exuberant good company hed been quick to follow roberts lead and maude had found it easier to welcome him back into the fold for shed never expected as much from him as she had from robert robert was still contemplating the chessboard and she turned to check upon her son henry should have been abed with his brothers and the command was forming on her lips but the scene that met her eyes was so engaging that she smiled instead that spring ranulf had bred his dyrehunds resulting in a litter of five furry little whirlwinds now that they had reached their eighth week ranulf had promised henry his pick and the boy was rolling about in the floor rushes fending off pink tongues and cold noses and nipping milk teeth ranulf was sprawled beside him as if he and henry were both of an age keeping an eye upon cinder the wary mother as maude watched henry lost the battle and the puppies swarmed over him like a pack of pocketsized wolves making him shriek with laughter i can see where this is going maude said ruefully what do you wager that henry will want them all robert looked up blankly still intent upon the game and it was then that the castle dogs began to bark ranulfs dyrehunds joined in and a servant hastened into the hall to announce the arrival of maudes husband the temperature in the hall had dropped dramatically by the time geoffrey strode through the doorway he paused just long enough to register the sudden chill in the air and then faced them with the cocksure beguiling smile his wife had long ago learned to hate maude got slowly to her feet robert was already rising but henry was quicker papa abandoning the puppies he raced across the hall and flung himself joyfully at his father geoffrey pretended to stagger backward an old game between them and then swung the little boy up into the air high enough to make henry squeal with delight maudes mouth tightened shed tried to convince herself that geoffreys fondness was feigned just another of his stratagemsmore subtle than mostin their marital warfare but his playful patience was too convincing even geoffrey was not that good an actor no as baffling and out of character as it seemed to her geoffrey was a genuinely attentive father a very real rival for the affections of their sonsand of all the wrongs hed done her that was the greatest wrong of all setting his son back on the ground geoffrey started across the hall and maude had no choice but to meet him halfway their union had been rockier than usual in recent months for shed been bitterly disappointed by his normandy campaign when waleran beaumont and william de ypres had thwarted his siege of falaise that was all the proof maude had needed to confirm her direst suspicions geoffrey wanted normandy that she did not doubt but not enough to bleed for it and in that aggrieved state of mind shed brought their sons to angers for his easter court only to discover one of his concubines in residence his adultery came as no surprise she knew hed sired at least three children out of wedlock for he was conscientious about claiming them as his own but she had neither expected nor desired fidelity let him seek his pleasures in any bed but hersas long as he was discreet about it at easter he had not been discreet and her rage and lacerated pride had fueled one of the most heated quarrels of their marriage yet now that he was here at argentan once again she found herself compelled to patch up their tattered flag of truce for pride demanded that they make a public pretense of marital harmony even before her brothers who knew better are you hungry geoffrey she asked for a wife was expected to care about her husbands comforts i can rouse the cooks if so and id best send servants to make a chamber ready for you if only youd sent us word of your coming ive no need of my own bed dear heart not when i can share yours smiling he pulled her into his arms bringing his mouth down upon hers in a wet probing kiss and maude knew then that his anger had not abated in the weeks since easter that it still burned at full flame keeping his arm around his rigid unresponsive wife geoffrey offered jaunty greetings to her brothers roberts reply was civil if unenthusiastic ranulf and rainald didnt even manage that much but their grudging attempts at courtesy seemed to amuse geoffrey enormously releasing maude he turned then toward the other women engaging in a round of gallant handkissing amabel accepted his attentions with aplomb but several of the women blushed and giggled one in particular the youngest and prettiest of her ladies seemed much too receptive for amabels liking casting geoffrey a longlashed sideways glance that did not speak well for her discretion or her common sense amabel thought promising herself a long and frank talk with dame agnes at the first opportunity she could not blame the lass for looking though geoffrey of anjou was a sight to fill any womans eyes of course he was also false and perverse and had he been her husband shed have been sorely tempted to flavor his wine with hemlock but she knew too with just a trace of smugness that shed have handled him much better than maude papa henry was jerking impatiently at geoffreys sleeve come see my puppies geoffrey obliged was soon teasing his son about this pack of meagre mangy whelps maude ordered wine then sat down again at the chessboard reaching for a chessman a display of composure that might have been more convincing had the rook not been roberts lets leave this till the morrow he said quietly and when geoffrey sauntered back he spoke out before maudes silence could become conspicuous sotell us geoffrey what news are you bringing from anjou i do have news geoffrey said but from england not anjou claiming a wine cup he settled himself in a highbacked chair turning a vibrant smile upon dame agnes when she demurely offered a cushion did you hear about stephens heroic feat at ludlow whilst he was besieging the castle the garrison swung a large grappling hook over the wall and caught a very big fish indeednone other than the scots kings son theyd begun to reel him in when stephen galloped up grabbed the hook and pulled their fish free that is already known to us rainald said so brusquely that it bordered upon rudeness geoffrey ignored the interruption what with stephens saving the lad from capture mayhap that treaty of matildas will last after all your little cousin has had quite a remarkable year dear heart first taking dover castle and then coaxing david over to stephens side id not be surprised if she deserves credit too for the popes finding in stephens favor maude took the bait hook and all that is not so she snapped the pope did not decide my appeal on the merits as for matildas meddling it matters little for she can do us no harm calling a wren a merlin does not make her a hawk geoffrey it merely raises doubts about the soundness of your judgment geoffreys smile held steady but his eyes reflected the light like shards of blue ice now who could blame me maude for admiring such a loyal loving little wife so few men are lucky enough to wed a matilda after all maude fought back a barbed rejoinder with an effort obvious to them all her brothers were struggling with their own indignation ranulf and rainald glaring as balefully as hawks robert showing his displeasure with more subtle signals but easily read by his wife amabel would have been hard put to say which one vexed her more geoffrey or maude they were worse than children she fumed for marriage was a serious matter a sacrament did these fools think contentment was ladled out onto their trenchers just for the asking but no they could not make their peace like sensible souls and shed say so be it if not for the fact that they kept miring robert down too in this matrimonial swamp of theirs one more exchange of insults and that hothead rainald would be lunging for geoffreys throat with ranulf not far behind and her robert having to mop up the blood as always well she said abruptly unless you have other news to share geoffrey i think it time we bid one another a good night of a sudden i am weary beyond words ah but i do have more news geoffrey said news sure to startle he paused then deliberately to ask dame agnes if she might pour him another cupful of wine there was a great scandal when stephens council met last month at oxford it began with a brawl at the dinner table ended with stephens chancellor and the bishops of salisbury lincoln and ely in disgrace arrested as enemies of the crown geoffrey got the response he was aiming for exclamations of shock giving way almost at once to a barrage of sharp questions but he was in no hurry to relinquish center stage and he drew out his account in provocative provoking detail telling them how the bishops had been summoned to attend stephens council how the earl of richmonds men had gotten into a squabble with retainers of bishop roger of salisbury how swords were drawn a melee breaking out that left one knight dead and several sorely wounded stephen had blamed the bishops demanded that they surrender their castles as pledges of their good faith geoffrey reported drawling out the phrase with ironic relish if it was the castles stephen wanted why were they then arrested the bishop of ely was loath to pledge his faith and fled oxford taking refuge behind the walls of devizes castle when stephen followed with an army bishop nigel still refused to yield even when stephen threatened to hang his cousin rogerso much for family fondness but the old bishops concubine could not abide the sight of her son with a hempen rope about his neck and she prevailed upon the garrison to surrender lucky that some women are so tenderhearted is it not stephen must have gone mad robert marveled for the church will never forgive him for this they insist upon the sole right to punish their own that seems to have occurred to stephen too geoffrey agreed for he is claiming that he acted against these men in their capacity as ministers of the crown not as shepherds of the churchs flock i rather doubt whether that particular hawk will fly but to give credit where due its a devilishly clever argument too clever by half maude said caustically all of it stephen could no more hatch a scheme like this than he could hatch an egg id wager the whole concoction was brewed up elsewhere and then spoonfed to stephen with enough sweetness added to conceal any sour aftertaste you do know thine enemy dear heart geoffrey conceded the verdict amongst the english echoes yoursthat stephen is not guileful enough to spring a trap like this on his own stephen may have fostered this crafty offspring but it was most likely sired by a beaumont geoffreys guess hit its target deadon and there were knowing nods of agreement their resentment of geoffrey was muted for the moment and they began feverish speculation as to how they could turn the oxford events to maudes benefit for they were all sure that stephen had blundered badly it was ranulf who unwittingly fanned the flames again for the hostility between maude and geoffrey never fully died out and there were always a few smoldering embers waiting to catch fire the spark this time was a seemingly innocuous question when ranulf wondered did all of this happen and geoffreys casual response midsummers day drew murmurs of surprise even maude was looking at geoffrey with reluctant respect the th and you had word in less than a fortnight i was not aware geoffrey that you had such reliable english sources of information unfortunately i do not he said favoring her with one of his most disarming smiles but you do dear heart and i had the good luck to encounter his messenger at the city gates the man was hesitant at first to yield up his prize but as you can seepulling a letter from his tunici persuaded him to see reason maude drew a breath sharp enough to hurt you took my letter who was it from who was it from he echoed now why cannot i remember the name was it bertram nobarnabas mayhap brien you did not have the right of course i did maude i had a husbands right if i did not read it how could i be sure it was not a love letter damn you geoffrey maude was white with fury her hands knotted against her skirt clenched into fists to stop herself from snatching at the letter for she knew hed just jerk it away and she would not give him that much satisfaction shed not let him strip her of her dignity too for the same reason she dared not demand the letter hed only refuse and what could she do then for god rot him but he did have the right and not even her brothers would deny it her brothers did indeed believe that a man had the right to read his wifes mail for sheand all she ownedwas his but that was theoretical a belief easy to argue in the abstract in the raw reality of argentans hall ranulf found that he could not stomach it and he took a threatening step toward his sisters husband give her the letternow it was a reckless foolhardy thing to do and maude loved him for it but geoffrey reacted as shed known he would smiling coldly and saying i think not rainald was on his feet now too for if there was going to be bloodshed he meant to make sure it was geoffreys rather than ranulfs robert was already in motion though reaching out and grasping ranulfs arm think lad what you may be starting he cautioned it is easy enough to stop he needs only to turn over her letter ranulf retorted and robert found himself staring at his youngest brother in dismay suddenly seeing not a malleable youth but a man grown a man who was not going to back down rapidly reassessing robert decided to gamble upon a show of unity youve read the letter geoffrey he pointed out so you have no reason to hold on to it why not give it to maude geoffrey was no longer smiling because he said i choose not to maude alone was not surprised by his refusal ranulf pulled free of roberts grip not yet sure what he was going to do but determined to get maudes letter one way or another amabel had jumped to her feet hissing at maude stop this whilst you still can and as if coming to her senses maude did stretch out her arm seeking to catch ranulfs sleeve but the one who stopped it was the one theyd all forgotten maude and geoffreys sixyearold son henry had been playing with the puppies oblivious at first to the angry adult voices his was a household in which raised voices were the norm but his mothers choked cry of damn you geoffrey jerked his head up set his heart to pounding he did not understand what was wrong but the fury in the room was frightening hed often heard his parents quarrel and hated their quarrels sometimes even hated them too for the way their quarreling made him feelas if he was lost surrounded by strangers with no familiar landmarks to guide him home this time their fighting was worse than usual for his uncle ranulf and his uncle robert were caught up in it too all of them against his father it was not fair and he wanted to go to his father to let papa know he was not alone but he could not for then hed be hurting mama when he could endure the conflicting urges no longer he snatched up the fire tongs and began to jab furiously at the logs burning in the hearth the flames shot upward and embers and sparks were soon flying about beginning to smolder in the floor rushes the heat was hot on his face and his eyes were stinging but he kept on thrusting into the fire again and again not even hearing his name not at first henry henry stop it his mothers voice sounded scared to him muffled and scratchy but he shook his head continued to prod the flames sending up another shower of cinders his eyes were blurring and he blinked hard when he looked up again they were clustered around the hearth mama and papa and uncle ranulf and uncle robert and aunt amabel and they were all talking at once urging him away from the fire instead he moved even closer glaring at them biting down on his lower lip as it started to quiver jabbing with the fire tongs he dislodged a burning brand and his mother cried out as it whizzed by his cheek thudding into the floor rushes in a sizzle of sparks they were demanding that he get away from the hearth but they made no move to grab him and he knew why they were afraid hed struggle and get burned he was already closer than he wanted to be for his skin felt scorched and he could smell something burningthe floor rushes but aunt amabel had seen it too was pouring wine into the smoking reeds that was clever his father was telling him to put down the fire tongs and he wanted to he truly did but all he could do was shake his head again mutely gulping back tears and then uncle ranulf was kneeling so their eyes were level telling him about the puppies lad youre scaring them they fear fire look at them see for yourself henry glanced over at the puppies cowering down by their mother whimpering and then let the fire tongs clatter to the floor a moment later he was caught up in his mothers arms he wasnt sure if she was going to hit him or hug him and she may not have been sure either but then she embraced him tightly until he had to squirm to breathe he knew he was going to be severely punished for hed done something dangerous and then defied them not sins adults were likely to forgive but once hed nerved himself to look up into their faces henry realized with a jolt of bewildered relief that there would be no punishment after all his father was mussing his hair saying he was well roasted by now ready for carving he smiled at that for papa liked him to laugh at his jokes but it did not seem funny to him none of it not even when aunt amabel doused the fire with wine a silence had fallen and he shifted uneasily fearful that they might start fighting again he saw then that they were watching his father for hed turned away to retrieve a letter dropped into the floor rushes no one moved all eyes followed geoffrey on his way back to the hearth where he held out the letter to his son here lad he said give this to your mother the hall was still and shadowed like an empty stage henry had gotten a parental escort up to bed for geoffrey had surprised the men and earned himself a bit of credit with amabel by promising his son a bedtime tale about a ravening pack of killer dyrehunds amabel had dismissed her wideeyed spellbound ladies knowing full well theyd soon set the entire castle abuzz with embellished accounts of all theyd witnessed this night now she sat with robert and his brothers around the hearth finishing up the wine in a morose silence i hope you realize that you only made a bad situation worse ranulf robert was frowning but it did not have the desired effect ranulf remained noticeably unrepentant im sorry about the part i played in scaring the little lad but for the rest no why should i be sorry for speaking up for my sister we ought to have done it sooner robert for as long as we keep silent hell keep on maltreating her you mean well ranulf but youve much still to learn no man is going to take it well if you seek to meddle in his marriage what do you gain by angering geoffrey hell just turn that anger onto maude and there is little you can do about it for you can act as her champion in the great hall but not in the bedchamber ranulf nearly spilled his wine if he hurts her i swear to christ that i what robert asked impatiently what could you do kill him not so fast rainald protested why does ranulf get to do it what about me at the very least we ought to dice for the chance this is no joking matter rainald rainald gave a mock sigh there is nothing under gods sky that cannot be joked about robert how is it that you reached such a respectable age without learning that look we all agree that geoffrey had the right to read maudes letter but did he also have the right to taunt her with it i agree with the lad she deserves better than she gets from him and i for one am heartily sick of it what would you have me say rainald i do not deny that maude is miserable in her marriage but antagonizing geoffrey does her no service bluntly put we need him until we can find a safe english port normandy is the battlefield for our war and we cannot hope to win it without geoffreys support so the next time you two get the urge to make maude a widow bear in mind that your gallantry might cost her a crown that silenced both ranulf and rainald at least for the moment and amabel seized the opportunity to bolster roberts argument youll not like what i have to say id have you hear me out nonetheless i am not defending geoffrey but maude is not blameless either she puts me in mind of a woman who salts a well and then complains when the water is not fit to drink a few smiles and some honeyed words might work wonders in that marriage ranulf was already shaking his head in sharp disagreement what i most admire about maude is her lack of pretense her ship never flies under false colors she is honest even if it hurts her and that is a rare trait indeed amabel was not won over a blade that cannot bend will eventually break my lad all i am saying is that women have no easy time of it in this world and a woman who scorns to use the only weapons at her command makes her life more difficult than it needs be now it was roberts turn to shake his head i doubt that smiles or flattery could redeem maudes marriage amabel geoffrey does not strike me as a man who could be coaxed against his will no more than i could amabels grin stopped him in midsentence and he seemed so genuinely perplexed that ranulf and rainald could not help laughing laughter that was cut off abruptly by geoffrey and maudes return to the hall they all tensed but soon saw the crisis was over geoffrey and maudes anger had burned itself out they looked tired and subdued and to amabels critical eye somewhat ashamed of themselves shed have liked to believe that the lesson would take but she thought it more likely that theyd just blame each other all the more shed never known two people so unwilling or unable to learn from their mistakes aloud she asked about henry wanting to know if he slept for now maude said but ill look in upon him later robertavoiding geoffreys eye she held out brien fitz counts letterid like you to read this geoffrey crossed to the table where he poured the last of the wine into two cups giving one to maude robert passed on the letter to his brothers and they read it together the tension was back in the hall feeding upon silent echoes all that must be left unsaid robert was studying his sister troubled by her pallor there was a brittle edge to her beauty shadows lying like bruises under her eyes and in the corners of her mouth and it occurred to him that shadows lay deep too in the corners of her lifea thought that startled him for it seemed much too fanciful to have been his he could not banish her shadows but there was something he could offer a need he could fill he could give her hope and he said forcefully im much heartened by briens letter it is indeed as scriptures say i was wounded in the house of my friends of course the beaumonts cannot take all the blame for stephens folly he chose to heed them of his own free will he has made more than his share of mistakes since seizing your throne maude but this breach with the church might well be the fatal one well be able to sow dissension with ease and god willing well reap enough support to harvest a crown that was bold talk for robert a man who measured his words with such scrupulous care that he could put a lawyer to shame and maude gave him a grateful smile tonight of all nights that was what she needed to hear ranulf and rainald were chiming in with eager assurances of their own but geoffreys voice cut through their confidence with knifelike clarity are you not putting the cart before the horse maudes fingers tightened around the stem of her wine cup what do you mean by that geoffrey she asked warily and he shrugged you may well be right about the seriousness of stephens blunder but even if he has set chaos loose upon his land how does it benefit you unless you find a way to cross the channel stephens government can be unraveling like a ball of yarn and it will avail you naught they were all glowering at him but for once geoffreys tone was free of mockery as hard as it was to give him the benefit of any doubt it did seem as if hed not meant to be malicious this time he was right of course too for nothing could be done until they broke stephens stranglehold upon the english ports they could not in fairness fault him merely for speaking the truth however unpalatable or illtimed and so they held their peace and as always maude thought wearily geoffrey got the last word on a sunlit friday four weeks later ranulf led his horse from the stables he was about to swing up into the saddle when his eye was drawn to a blaze of vivid red color maude might scorn embroidery and needlework but she did enjoy gardening and her roses were in spectacular scarlet bloom detouring across the bailey ranulf hitched his stallion and set about helping himself to some of his sisters damask roses he picked only a few though before the screaming started two small boys were rolling about in the dirt near the stable door by the time ranulf reached them henry looked to be the winner straddling geoffrey while his brother kicked and screeched grabbing his tunic ranulf yanked henry to his feet and then caught geoffrey before he could flee enough what is this squabbling about he stole my sword henry panted and then broke it i did not geoffrey was just as breathless and just as indignant it was mine the disputed sword lay a few feet away its wooden blade snapped off near the hilt one glance was all ranulf needed to give his verdict that was not your sword geoffrey he said with such conclusive certainty that his nephew stared up at him openmouthed and wideeyed howhow did you know ranulf concealed a smile because he said gravely i made that sword myself and gave it to your brother on his birthday last march so you owe henry an apology go on tell him you are sorry geoffrey mumbled a sorry that did not sound very convincing but it seemed to satisfy henry and ranulf sent them off to play again with a promise to make wooden swords for them both henry came running back a moment later though uncle ranulfwill you make my sword bigger well ranulf pretended to ponder the request but henry caught the glint in his eye and they grinned at each other the boy spun around then to chase after geoffrey and ranulf laughing softly to himself headed back to retrieve his horse and his roses he did not need to go far gilbert fitz john was coming toward him leading the stallion and carrying the flowers sodid you get the lads to make their peace at least until supper gilbert laughed playfully jerking the flowers out of ranulfs reach what is your hurry and why the roses ahyoure going courting again the goldsmiths daughter who else lora sent me word that her father left this morning to deliver a chalice to the monks at st martins since hell not be back to argentan till late i thought i ought to stop by keep her from getting lonely how goodhearted of you will that be after you visit with the widows and orphans ranulf laughed jabbed gilbert in the ribs and snatched back his flowers but as he reached for the reins gilbert put a restraining hand upon his arm ranulf wait ive a letter that youll want to seefrom ancel theyd not heard from ancel in almost two years not since his return to england and as soon as gilbert produced the letter ranulf grabbed for it eagerly gilbert was explaining that ancel had found a man going on pilgrimage to the spanish shrine of santiago de compostela and hed persuaded the man to stop at argentan i promised him a seat at supper in the great hall and a bed for the night but what he really wants is to talk with you ranulf that was how ancel coaxed him into taking the letter offering him a chance to meet a kings soneven one born on the wrong side of the blanket but gilberts banter was wasted for ranulf was no longer listening after rapidly scanning the letter and not finding what he sought he turned aside swearing softly ranulf gilbert followed puzzled what is amiss and then he understood annora good god ranulf is that wound still sore no ranulf said curtly it is not but i still have a fondness for her wish her well why should that surprise you i simply wanted to know if she is content and if ancel ever used the brains god gave him hed have understood that but no nary a word about her what did you want him to tell you that her husband dotes on her and she goes about her days singing or that she has grown thin and wan and weeps in secret ranulf whirled eyes narrowed to glittering slits i said i wanted only to know if she was well if she were ailing ancel would have told you but her happiness is no longer your concern she is a married woman and by now its likely she has a babe in the cradle and another on the way i know full well that annora is another mans wife do not need to have you throw it in my face gilbert was not perturbed by ranulfs anger for he knew his friends rages were fastburning and soon over sooner forgotten what troubled him was the reason for ranulfs flare of temper hed truly believed that ranulfs feelings for annora werelike annora herselfpart of his past i am sorry about the sermon ranulf i guess ive been spending too much time with my cousin the priest indeed you have ranulf agreed coolly although the corners of his mouth were quirking but what i cannot understand gib is why im still here with you when i could be in master jehans house with lora and gilbert grinned stepped back and waved him on ranulf had gotten no farther than the gatehouse when he heard his name being shouted behind him he reined in then sent his stallion cantering back toward gilbert what now lady maude and lord robertthey want you to come back straightaway gilbert was gasping for breath hed sprinted all the way across the inner and outer baileys so he could catch ranulf in time a courier came for her soon after that pilgrim brought ancels letter i heard men say he bore a message from your fathers queen her newsit must be very good or truly terrible ranulf if lady maude is so intent upon finding you maude had never found many friends among her own sex but the lady adeliza was the exception she and maude had taken to each other from the moment of maudes forced return from germany not so surprising perhaps for they shared much in common adeliza was german by birth maude by choice they were the same age a young queen in a land not her own a young widow no longer at home in england and both childless although that would change maude bearing geoffrey the sons shed not borne for the emperor and adelizawhose barren marriage had altered so many lives especially maudesnow in her second year with a new husband and said to be great with child but if their circumstances had radically changed over the years the bond between the two women had held fast and ranulf ever the optimist had no trouble convincing himself that adelizas news was good gesturing for gilbert to mount behind him ranulf headed back toward the inner bailey maude and robert were too impatient to wait for him within the castle keep and were on the outer stairs as soon as ranulfs horse came into view maude lifted her skirts and ran lightly down to him calling out his name ranulf flung himself from the saddle no one he said is ever in such a tearing hurry to share bad news so we must have reason for rejoicing indeed we do adeliza has offered us a safe landing in the south of england ranulf gasped at arundel shed truly do that for you jesu maude arundel castle is almost as formidable as bristol stephen thinks he has locked us out of england but now we have the key no more waiting ranulfthe time has finally come to reclaim my stolen crown a sudden highpitched yell floated across the bailey a sound rarely heard off the hunting field rainald was standing in the doorway of the keep cupping his hands to shout get in here ranulf so we can start to celebrate in earnest ranulf was too busy hugging his sister to pay rainald any heed by the time maude broke free laughing and breathless robert had reached them with amabel close behind rainald ducked back into the keep reemerged brandishing a wine flagon if youre all so set upon holding the festivities out in the bailey at least i can provide fuel for the fire after that it got very chaotic for a time ranulf was kissed by maude and amabel shared smiles with robert had wine spilled on him by rainald and was knocked to the ground by his dyrehunds whod bolted from the great hall at their first opportunity midst much laughter ranulf was helped to his feet and dusted off it occurred to him that he ought to send lora a message not wanting her to worry when he failed to appear and he glanced about for gilbert but then maude drove all thoughts of the goldsmiths daughter from his head for she was saying with a fond smile we have so much to do and not enough time but this i vow to you ranulfere we sail for england i will see to it that you are knighted maudethank you ranulf stammered at a rare loss for words and they all laughed again maude happened then to notice roberts squire standing a few feet away still holding the reins of ranulfs horse you too gilbert ill have geoffrey knight you both she promised impulsively and gilberts fair skin flushed as red as his hair he was even more thrilled than ranulf for ranulf had never doubted that knighthood would eventually be his but for gilbert a younger son with no prospects of inheriting his familys manor it had been far more problematic how can i ever thank you he blurted out and then found a way when he added my lady queen for maude would remember that shed been recognized for the first time as englands sovereign on an august afternoon in the inner bailey of argentan castle eventually they headed indoors at rainalds prodding for hed run out of wine robert and amabel had begun to argue lowvoiced but intently after shed announced her intention to sail with him back to england ranulf and gilbert were eager to tell their fellow squires of the honour soon to be bestowed upon them and maude had plans to make letters to write a triumph to savor but as she turned to follow the others she felt a sudden tug upon her skirt and found herself looking down into the anxious face of her eldest son henry had been drawn from the stables by the commotion out in the bailey hed kept silent careful not to attract attention to himself and hed listened but now he could wait no longer for answers and he yanked again on his mothers skirt mama are you going to england to thisthis arundel yes henry i am she said and he grinned for he loved to travel and he was especially eager to make his first sea voyage when will we go mama soon maude knelt heedless of her skirts and put her hands on his shoulders i am sorry lad but you cannot come it would be too dangerous as much as i would love to have you with me i cannot put your safety at risk henrys breath stopped disappointment warring with disbelief his father was often gone as much as he missed papa hed learned to accept it that papa came and went as unpredictably as the stable cat hed befriended when mama had first brought him to live at argentan fathers and cats were like that not reliable like dogs or mothers for mama had always been there and when she did go away it was never for long he knew better though than to beg he could wheedle his way with his father most of the time with his mother some of the timebut never when she used this tone of voice very serious and yet patient too how he imagined god would talk if ever he talked to mortal men he bit his lip stared down at the ground and then raised his eyes to meet hers if it is too dangerous for me he said what about you mama how will you be safe maude had so often prided herself on his precocity gloried in her firstborns quickness his obvious intelligence but not now now shed have welcomed childish incomprehension anything but those direct grey eyes fixed unwaveringly upon her face yesthere will be some danger but your uncles will be with me and theyll keep me safe henry wanted to ask why they could not keep him safe too but she was still using her god voice and he didnt dare how long will you be gone mama that was the question maude had been dreading she could not bring herself to lie to him though for she believed strongly that her children deserved the truth but never had the truth been so sure to hurt i wish i could tell you that id soon be able to send for you henry god knows i would have it so but i can make you no promises for i do not know how long it will take to win my war i just do not know for henry it was like the time his brother geoffrey jabbed him with a broom handlea sharp pain in the pit of his stomach slowly easing to a dull ache and even after the pain went away he still felt so hollow that it hurt his mothers hands had tightened on his shoulders ah henry do not look like that your father will take good care of you and youll have your brothers for company and your tutor and your new puppy maude forced a smile and when we are together again ill be wearing upon my head a gilded crown a crown that will one day be yours lad you must remember that whenever you feel sad remember that shining golden crown henry said nothing his eyes had darkened and a few freckles stood out across the bridge of his nose maude got slowly to her feet brushed dirt from her skirts her name was echoing again on the wind first rainald and then ranulf had appeared in the doorway of the great hall urging her not to tarry now it was robert admonishing her to make haste reminding her of all that must be done and done yesterday if we hope to sail ere winter weather sets in well talk later henry i promise she said and bent down kissing him quickly on the cheek she glanced back once just before reaching the hall henry had not moved shoulders hunched forward so pale that her liprouge marked his skin like a brand he was such a forlorn little figure that maude dared not let herself look back again sussex england september stephen had been blessed with more than his share of good fortune hed been given health and high birth and a handsome face and hed made the most of his advantages his life like his marriage had been a remarkably happy one it baffled him therefore that his luck could have soured so suddenly that his kingship should be sore beset by turmoil and treachery he wanted only to be a good king but his eden was full of snakes he could no longer trust he whod once trusted as easily as he breathed the approval he cravedand had always gottennow eluded him he knew that hed been judged and found wanting and the unfairness of that judgment was a constant goad the road to the crown had been so easy to travel how had it ever become so mudmired and twisting it was almost as if the almighty were no longer pleased with his servant stephen he sensed the danger in such doubts shared them with no others not even his wife or his confessor he could not let himself believe that hed lost gods favor if he was being tested he would prove himself worthy but why were his victories so fleeting walerans scheme to cripple the bishop of salisburys power had gone as planned yet hed had little time to savor their success in august hed been summoned to winchester compelled to defend himself before a church council convened by his vengeful brother his advocates had been able to blunt the thrust of the bishops charges and no verdict had been returned to the bishops obvious surprise but he had a surprise of his own for stephen since march hed been in possession of a papal bull one naming him as englands new papal legate and so another triumph had turned to ashes in stephens mouth for his frayed relationship with the church would continue to unravel henry would see to that but he did the best he could sought to reassure the church that he did indeed respect church prerogatives he even managed to cobble together a patchwork peace with his brother at least on the surface before he could catch his breath though the next crisis was upon him baldwin de redvers had fled to normandy after the fall of exeter castle in september he came back landed without warning at wareham and seized corfe castle stephen reacted with his usual verve hastening to lay siege to corfe and while baldwin de redvers lured him west maude and robert made ready to sail for the southeast coast of england they left barfleur at dusk for a night crossing allowed the helmsman to steer by the polestar and then to approach englands shores by daylight this helmsmans task was a challenging one once land was in sight he had to hug the coast and sail into the sunrise aiming for a stretch of beach marked only by memory to his passengers it seemed truly miraculous when he steered their ships into a sheltered sussex cove as unerringly as if he were coming home there were no quays for disembarking but their ships were flatbottomed vessels builtlike their viking prototypesfor beaching after waiting so long maude was of no mind to wait any longer but roberts innate caution won out over her eagerness and he had no intention of venturing ashore until he was assured of his sisters safety at his command their small fleet anchored in the cove a dinghy was lowered into the water and its crew began to row toward the beach it was a harvest sky a cloudless crystalline blue but the wind held a wintry tang and a thiefs touch robbing them of the warmth they had the right to expect from a september sun it carried off maudes veil as she leaned over the gunwale but she did not appear to notice her eyes never straying from the english shoreline ranulf was not surprised when minna soon emerged from their canvas tent another veil in hand she was ashen for shed been seasick for much of the voyage but she resolutely lurched toward the prow of the ship determined to see her lady well coiffed or die in the attempt ranulf thought they made an odd pair the elegant empress and the stout german widow he could not see why maude had chosen the stolid taciturn minna as a companion and if there was a fondness between them it was unspoken not overt but minna had been there when maude buried her first husband when she was compelled to wed geoffrey of anjou when she nearly died in childbed and god willing she would be there when the archbishop of canterbury placed stephens stolen crown upon maudes head amabels ladies had followed minna from the tent and much to ranulfs amusement began to express their dismay at the lack of quays or wharves he laughed outright when amabel lost patience with agness whining and threatened to let her swim ashore but when the women turned to glare at him he prudently withdrew joining maude and robert at the ships prow am i the only one he wondered aloud who cannot sail from barfleur without thinking of the white ship i expect we all do maude said and then what is taking so long they ought to have been back by now arundel is three or four miles distant from the sea robert pointed out calmly theyll be here soon maude continued to fret infecting ranulf and rainald with her sense of urgency but robert was right it was not long before one of their scouts rode into view well mounted upon a horse from arundels stables reining in at the waters edge he cupped his hands and his triumphant shout came echoing across the waves like a clarion call to battle all is well my lady come ashore and claim your crown robert sent the women ashore in the dinghy for they could not be expected to hike up their skirts and splash through the shallows like men they were preparing to beach their ships so the horses could be unloaded when their escort arrived from arundel castle william daubigny was in the lead and adeliza rode proudly at his side mounted on a snowwhite mule the fair maid of brabant was now in her late thirties although she looked years younger a german lorelei who instinctively knew what maude had never learnedthat charm could be a formidable female weapon her new husband shared her easygoing nature and carefree approach to life and it was obvious even in those first few moments that adelizas second marriage was far happier than her first william daubigny shared her coloring too they were both flaxenhaired and blueeyed vibrant with health and energy they would maude thought have handsome children and then as adeliza slid from the saddle maude stared for her friends mantle had fallen open revealing a slim waist encircled by a braided belt of scarlet silk adeliza saw her surprise and laughed stretching out her hands in welcome yes i have a waistline againand a robust son asleep in the solar so you see maude not only can we offer you a safe haven at arundel but a new subject too arundel castle was situated on a high narrow ridge overlooking the river arun it was strategically significant commanding the approach between the south downs and the sea and a small town had grown up in its protective shadow on the east and south it was defended by the steep angle of its slopes on the north and west by deep ditches appraising its formidable defenses with a soldiers eye robert was comforted by what he found arundel would be a secure haven just as adeliza had promised he could leave his sister and wife here and not fear for their safety they had assembled in the lower bailey to bid him godspeed his men were already mounted theyd sailed with one hundred forty knights but he was taking only twelve with him leaving the rest to defend arundel having thanked adeliza and her husband he kissed maudes hand and sought to coax a smile from ranulf who was noticeably disgruntled at being left behind and then robert turned walked toward his silent wife they had said their private farewells earlier that afternoon this public leavetaking was restrained circumspect but he knew her too well he could read her fear in the taut set of her shoulders the uneasy fluttering of her lashes ah amabel he said softly you need not look so bereft ill get to bristol safe and sound will rally our men and be back ere you have time to miss me she managed a bright hollow smile for she would not send him away with recriminations echoing in his ears would not have him regret agreeing to bring her with him go with god robert she said bravely she held on to her smile until robert and his men rode through the gateway arundel did not have a tower keep its motte was encircled by a stone wall with lodgings built within the enclosure it was toward that shell keep that amabel fled rushing breathlessly up onto the battlements where she kept a lonely vigil watching until her husband was out of sight maude was usually an early riser but during her week at arundel shed been sleeping late for shed been staying up late with adeliza they had four years to catch up on soon after daybreak on saturday though she was jolted awake by the sound of a fist thudding against her bedchamber door as she sat up groggily half blinded by her own hairfor shed been too tired to bother with her customary night plaitthe door was flung open minna started forward indignant at this invasion of maudes privacy such an intrusion would have been unheardof at the german court but by then ranulf was in the room with adeliza on his heels an adeliza flushed and disheveled obviously just roused from bed maude she cried maude we are under siege maude was lodged in the gatehouse for its upper chamber was spacious enough to satisfy even an empresss imperial tastes she fumbled for her bedrobe as ranulf strode to the window and jerked back the shutters the window opened onto the west offering a view of the village high street the clustered thatched houses the steeple of the parish church and to the south the silvered gleam of the river arun swiftflowing toward the sea but maude saw none of those familiar sights she saw only the battle banners catching the wind heard only the drumming of hooves upon the sundried downs above the town stephen she breathed staring out upon her cousins army the herald rode boldly toward the castle walls i have a message for the lady adeliza and the lord william daubigny he called and my lord king says youd best heed it well you are sheltering the countess of anjou an enemy of the crown and a threat to the peace of the realm the king demands that you surrender this woman forthwith or suffer the consequences the great hall was crammed with people arundels harried servants and disquieted garrison maudes men fearful villagers whod fled their homes for the greater security of the castle the latter milled about in confusion some clutching meagre belongings others trying to comfort wailing children and hush barking dogs all watching their liege lady and her husband mutely entreating adeliza and will to deliver them from this evil come so suddenly into their midst adeliza will maude and ranulf had retreated from the chaos and dread in the hall withdrawing to the privacy of their abovestairs solar adeliza was too distraught to sit still she paced the chamber as if seeking escape pausing only to rock the cradle where her infant son slept how could stephen have found out that you were here maude who betrayed us adeliza kept coming back to that as if it mattered she seemed genuinely surprised that stephen should have spies ranulf frowned glancing over at adelizas husband will had been conspicuously silent so far but he was as tense as his wife fidgeting in his chair fingers drumming absently upon the armrest not once meeting maudes eyes it was becoming all too obvious to ranulf that neither adeliza nor will had given serious thought to the consequences of their act theyd made an impulsive offer without fully calculating the price they might have to pay and now that stephen was presenting the bill they were rapidly reassessing the cost of their generosity ranulf had been irked by roberts refusal to take him on that dangerous crosscountry dash to bristol not truly believing roberts explanation that maude might need him now her need was urgent indeed and ranulf would have given anything to have robert and rainald back at arundel having sole responsibility for maudes safety was a heavier burden than hed been prepared to bear but bear it he would as long as he had breath in his body moving toward his sister he took up position as if by chance behind her chair maude gave him a quick smile his loyalty was a luxury she was learning to rely upon she had never doubted that ranulf would follow her into the flames but god help her for adeliza and will were balking at the first hint of heat she chose as always to face her fears headon if there was a betrayal coming better to know it now let stephen do his worst she said coolly he can besiege arundel from now till judgment day for all it will avail him his only hope of taking the castle would be to starve us into submission and robert will not give him that much time hell be back to break the siege ere the first frost she truly believed every word she said but shed have been more confident had she not been aware of the undercurrents in this room and the silence that followed was a telling one she turned in her chair and under her leveleyed scrutiny color crept into adelizas face and throat i will cleared his throat sounding as uncomfortable as he looked the truth of the matter iswe never thought it would come to bloodshed when adeliza told me she wished to help you lady maude i agreed for i knew how much it meant to her but i did not bargain upon this to have stephen outside the castle walls with an army at his back if we defy the king we could be held guilty of treason and all we own could be forfeit including arundel yesyour wifes dower castle maude said acidly and will suddenly found it a lot easier to contemplate turning her over to stephen he flushed angrily but adeliza forestalled his protest that is not fair maude will has every right to worry about losing arundel we have a son to think of arundel is his heritage ill not deny that the prospect of war terrifies meand not just for us what of the villagers if stephen attacks arundel theyll lose all they have and they have precious little to lose they look to me for protection if i do not keep faith with them i cannot believe what i am hearing ranulf was outraged what of keeping faith with maude she trusted you if you betray that trust i swear that ranulf wait maude reached out put a restraining hand on his arm adeliza i do not wish you harm surely you know that the other woman nodded unhappily and maude rose closed the space between them i would not be the instrument of your downfall but do not expect me to submit tamely to stephen do not ask that of me tell stephen that we gave you no choice that we forced you to aid us ah maude adeliza had begun to blink back tears ranulf doubted that stephen would believe it and he could tell that will doubted it too but it could be made true their men easily outnumbered the castle garrison he edged slowly toward the door too desperate for qualms or second thoughts he was reaching stealthily for the latch when adeliza started to speak and as he listened he realized that he had undervalued his fathers queen i will not betray you to stephen maude no matter what it costs us on that you have my word adeliza will had risen to his feet do not be so quick to promise her salvation for it may be a promise you cannot keep do as i suggested maude insisted if i took advantage of our friendship to seize control of arundel how could stephen blame you adeliza smiled shakily hed not believe it maude not even stephen is that gullible but there may be another way i shall go to him humble myself and try to sway him with my tears say what you will of stephen he does hate to see a woman weep ranulf found maude up on the battlements of the shell keep watching as adeliza and a lone servant rode out under a flag of truce a few yards beyond the castle they were met by stephens escort and headed toward the kings encampment she will accomplish nothing maude said at last stephen will not heed her why should he ranulf agreed with her bleak assessment of adelizas chances but at the moment he had a more immediate concern maude it is not safe for you up here you are within crossbow range did you not realize that what if you were recognized i do not care she said with sudden defiant passion let them recognize me let stephen see that i am not afraid adeliza was welcomed with courtesy but shed expected no less from stephen shed known shed have no chance of getting a private audience his barons seemed to take turns standing as sentinels between stephen and his better instincts shed been resigned to the presence of the beaumont twins william de ypres geoffrey de mandeville and the earl of northampton but the sight of stephens bishop brother was an unpleasant surprise she knew henry invariably advised stephen against compromise or conciliation and when shed learned hed ridden into stephens camp just before she did she took it as an ill omen but she could not lose heart not with so much at stake dropping gracefully to her knees before stephen she caught his hand in hers my lord king hear me i beg you my husband and i have not been disloyal to you we did make the lady maude welcome at arundel but as my kinswoman not as your enemy what else could i do she is the daughter of my late husband may god assoil him her lovely blue eyes were glistening with unshed tears shed always had the useful talent of crying on command how could i turn his child away from my door i owed him better than that surely you can understand my dilemma yes i can stephen said obligingly and she thought there was much to be said for good manners in a king but however well meaning you were lady adeliza that does not change the fact that you are harboring a rebel i am not a man to hold grudges though if you turn her over to me with no delay ill forgive this lamentable lapse in judgmentprovided of course that you never give me reason again to doubt your loyalty adelizas smile was tremulous radiantly grateful we will indeed be loyal my liege i swear it and i would willingly do as you bid me if only it were in my power but how can i betray my husbands daughter how could i live with myself you are known to be a man of honour my lord king she entreated surely you understand this time though he was not so quick to assure her that he did just what would you have me do madame show mercy my liege do not make me prove my loyalty to you by sacrificing my stepdaughter you can afford to be magnanimous give her a safe conduct to bristol let her go in peace to join her brother surely that would be a gesture worthy of a king up until now the men had been listening in attentive silence for adelizas tearful appeal was undeniably entertaining but at that they burst into incredulous laughter all but stephen and his brother the bishop reaching down stephen raised adeliza gently to her feet it would he said wryly be a gesture worthy of a saint i will think upon your request lady adeliza more than that i cannot promise there was much merriment in stephens tent after adeliza had been escorted back to arundel castle her proposal was so ludicrous that even the moody earl of northampton joined in the mockery and waleran a wicked mimic soon had them laughing until they had no breath for talking stephen took no part in their raillery content to drink his wine and listen to the joking and jests occasionally smiling at a particularly clever gibe the bishop remained aloof watching them with none of stephens indulgent good humor when the hilarity finally showed signs of subsiding he said with grave deliberation actually the womans plea may not be as foolish as it first seems it might indeed be to our advantage to let maude go to bristol castle there was an astonished silence and then an explosion of indignant sound as they competed with one another to deride the bishops suggestion as preposterous and absurd but henry was an old hand at commanding attention and he soon drowned them out do you fools think arundel will fall into your hands like a ripe plum the castle could hold out for months and what do you think the earl of gloucester would be doing whilst we besieged his sister hed be ravaging the whole west country to lure us off in no time at all half of england would be in flames or else hed come down on arundel like a hawk on a pigeon and wed find ourselves trapped between gloucesters army and the castle garrison ere you start giving us lessons in military tactics my lord bishop mayhap youd best tell us how many battles you have won i need not swing a battleaxe myself to know it can split a mans skull i need only rely upon my common sense which you my lord waleran seem utterly to lackelse youd see the dangers in a prolonged siege of arundel if we allow maude to join robert at bristol we can contain the rebellion to the west keep london safe whilst we move against them if robert fitz roy marches to his sisters rescue hell be marching toward london or did that never occur to you a good thing it is that you sought a career in the church for if this is an example of your muddled military thinking youd not have been able to rout a flock of sheep much less an enemy army once we take maude the rebellion ends it is as simple as that simple is the word indeedfor you my lord do you truly expect fitz roy to bide peacefully at bristol whilst we stephen had heard enough setting down his wine cup he slipped quietly from the tent no one noticed his departure and the quarreling continued unabated he paused to admire a particularly creative burst of profanity then moved on trailed by a stray dog stephen drew children and dogs to him as if by magic ahead lay his mangonels hauled into position to bombard the castle walls should it come to that how goes it giles he asked and his serjeant turned with a grin whatever faults others found with stephens kingship he was popular with his soldiers for he was fearless accessible and openhanded and they thought those were virtues to make up for a multitude of lesser sins well enough my liege weve been bringing in cartloads of stones from the closest quarry you but say the word and it will be raining rocks all over arundel well see stephen said raising his hand to shade his eyes against the suns glare giles saw the direction of his gaze and volunteered cheerfully oh she is still up there my lord prowling those battlements bold as you please it is almost as if she were daring us to shoot and some of the lads would right gladly take that dare not he added hastily for he knew his king without such a command from you of course stephen scowled make sure they understand that he said with unwonted brusqueness but as he watched that distant female figure upon the castle battlements his mouth softened into a reluctant smile she never did lack for courage not maude i remember a day when we were hunting with her father outside rouen her horse stumbled and threw her a nasty fall leaving her bruised and scratched but she insisted upon getting back on her mare and continuing the hunt damned if she did not giles joined politely in stephens laughter puzzled that his lord should speak so kindly of the woman who was causing him such grief look my liege it seems the lady has grown tired of flaunting herself and is going back inside a pity for well not find a fairer target no stephen agreed you will not gilesgo fetch my herald for me tell him ive an answer for the lady adeliza giles knew of course of adelizas entreaty the whole camp did for tents were not constructed to contain secrets as you will my liege but he did not move halted by the odd smile hovering in the corner of stephens mouth his eyes widening he blurted out in amazement my lordsurely you do not mean to let her go such impertinence would have cost him dear with the old king stephen it amused still with that enigmatic halfsmile like a man savoring a very private joke he said in truth giles i mean to do just that the following day was unseasonably mild for october but to the southwest the sky was filling with fleecy cumulus clouds which to the weatherwise warned of a likely thunderstorm within arundel castle the atmosphere was no less unsettled adeliza and her husband were still dazzled by her success amabel was thankful for stephens astonishing chivalry but baffled by it too as were most of maudes men the villagers were just grateful for their reprieve theyd not ventured from the castle and so had not yet discovered that stephens men had been indulging in that universal soldiers pastimelooting ranulf was confused and uneasy for stephens remarkable generosity had stirred up unwelcome memories of the other stephen not the usurper but the cousin and friend and maude sheathed her emotions in ice distancing herself from them all by the sheer intensity of her will until there was not a soul in the castle whod have dared to ask her what she thought of stephens magnanimity leaving maude to say her farewells to adeliza ranulf called for his stallion and rode out alone to the kings camp waleran and stephens brother were to escort maude to bristol castle but they presented dramatically differing visages the usually equable waleran was smoldering while the prickly bishop looked almost benevolent suspiciously well pleased with himself he certainly greeted ranulf with uncharacteristic civility whereas from waleran ranulf got no more than a grunt the other men were no more welcoming william de ypres was muttering to himself in flemish robert beaumont was glowering and the earl of northampton looked truly murderous but their baleful glares were not directed at ranulf they were staring at stephens command tent and then at stephen himself as he emerged into the cloudsplattered sunlight ranulf stiffened stephen came to a halt at sight of his young cousin and then a smile broke free bright enough to banish the clouds look at you ranulf what ever happened to that gangling raw lad i knew by god if youve not grown to manhood whilst my back was turned it has been nigh on four years ranulf said tautly i came to tell you that my sister will be ready to depart at noon stephen nodded and ranulf flushed for the older mans eyes were fixed unwaveringly upon his face as if they could see into his very soul the bishop had moved to join them saying that the empress could take more time if she needed it but ranulf barely heard him unable to tear his gaze away from stephens he been ready for stephens reproaches for his coolness even his hostility what hed not expected was that stephen should be so genuinely glad to see him he was so flustered that it was only when he was on his way back to the castle that the significance of the bishops words penetrated stephens allies made a point of referring to maude by the title she herself detested countess of anjou her own supporters accorded her the rank she much preferred that of empress and so ranulf finally realized had the bishop maude meant to take just enough men to assure her safety the rest would be left at arundel to try to make their way to bristol once stephens army had been withdrawn for his safeconduct was not allinclusive maude was standing now in the lower bailey listening as adeliza stammered a lastminute confession maudei shall pray that you regain your crown nothing would give me greater joy but i must tell you thisthat prayer is all we can offer from now on my husband cannot bear arms against stephen for i swore to him that wed keep faith if he let you go i hope you can understand that adeliza held her breath then waiting for maudes verdict upon their future friendship and felt a surge of gratitude when maude nodded for she knew only a very real affection could have wrung that concession from maude whose political creed came straight from scriptures he that is not with me is against me their embrace was wordless heartfelt and then maude stepped back beckoning for ranulf to help her mount her head high her back ramrodstraight armored in pride she rode out to confront her enemies they were waiting for her the bishop at his most courtly waleran making no effort whatsoever to mask his frustration or his fury maude was staring past them as if they were both invisible though staring at the man on a splendid roan stallion tawny hair gilded by a sudden flare of sun looking composed and confident and very much a king maude gave stephen one intense burning look all but scorching the air between them and then urged her mare on but stephen spurred his stallion forward blocking her path it was utterly still all eyes locked upon them all ears straining to hear what was said the audience was to be disappointed for their exchange was too brief and lowpitched to be overheard a moment no more than that and then stephen was moving aside maude was sweeping past him without a backward glance and the siege of arundel castle was over as they headed west along the chichester road none intruded upon maude for it would have taken a very brave man or a very insensitive one to breach her shield of silence ranulf his sisters selfappointed protector still held to his vigil but from a discreet distance whistling to his dyrehunds he slowed his stallions pace planning to drop back and ride with gilbert theyd had few chances to talk in these past turbulent days but amabel was beckoning to him and he urged his mount in her direction you know stephen as well as anyone does ranulf what possessed him to let maude out of his trap rumor has it that the bishop is claiming credit for maudes reprieve now i admit i know little of military matters i leave that to robert but if the bishops argument sounded so outlandish even to me how did he get stephen to swallow it ranulf laughed you may be sure he did not stephens one failing as a battle commander is his lack of patience he loses interest if a siege drags on too longunless the prize is well worth the taking and what prize could be greater than his royal rival for the throne no whatever stirred him to offer maude a safeconduct it was not his brother the bishop wellwhat then a sudden fit of madness was there a full moon that night ranulf grinned i think a sudden fit of chivalry is more likely waithear me out stephen is not a man whod willingly make war upon a woman and at arundel hed be making war upon two of them one his own aunt and a former queen of england in the bargain are you saying then that he freed maude for adelizas sake i find that rather improbable lad ranulf shrugged of course it is improbable all of it give stephen credit where due he can always surprise hes ever been one for the grand gesture and you must admit amabel that as gestures go this was about as grand as you get amabel caught those grudging echoes of admiration but she did not share it i grant you it was gallant beyond belief but it was also unforgivably shortsighted ranulf for he had a chance to end the war ere it began and he let that chance escape with maude thank god he did ranulf retorted so fervently that she smiled yes she agreed maude must feel truly blessed by the almightys favor for nothing less than a miracle got her safe away from arundel so why then is she not rejoicing in it ranulf gave her a surprised look after all this time how little she still understood maude because the almightys favor comes disguised as stephens and maude would starve ere shed take crumbs from stephens table it is well nigh killing her to owe her deliverance to his forbearance amabel marveled she hadnt seen that for herself i wonder she mused what they said to each other ranulf wondered too and riding by maudes side later that afternoon he seized his first opportunity to ask her she glanced toward him then back to the road ahead stephen said any debt i may have owed you cousin maude is now paid in full ranulf stared at her so he does have an unease of conscience about you he exclaimed and discovered then that he was glad it was so glad that the stephen who was his cousin and the stephen who was king were not such strangers after all his conscience be damned he owes me more than a debt he owes me a crown maude said grimly and they rode on in silence on an overcast afternoon five days later robert rode out to meet his sister on the bristolbath road so that her entry into bristol could be a triumphant one at sight of the approaching riders maude reined in her mare well my lords it seems this onerous duty of yours has been discharged you are welcome to accompany us to bristol if you so choose i am sure we can find a comfortable nights lodging for you within my city waleran smiled sourly i would rather he said beg my bread by the roadside maude matched walerans smile with an acerbic one of her own keep to your present course and you very well may she said to walerans fury and the bishops amusement he cut off walerans wrathful reply saying smoothly that he would indeed accept her hospitality waleran choked on an extremely virulent obscenity and the bishop swung around to admonish the other man only to find waleran staring past him in dismay turning in the saddle he saw why a number of the men riding with robert were familiar he recognized rainald fitz roy and baldwin de redvers and shrewsburys rebel baron william fitz alan and roberts eldest son william whod been holding bristol castle for him but it was the identity of the two men flanking robert that had unleashed walerans strangled profanity miles fitz walter and brien fitz count come to bristol to pledge faith to their queen maude saw them now too and laughed suddenly joyfully waleran slowly shook his head god forgive you stephen he muttered for what have you loosed upon us stephen wasted no time in besieging briens castle at wallingford leaving an armed force to continue the siege he moved on to attack trowbridge held by miless soninlaw while stephen was occupied at trowbridge though miles outflanked the royal army raced for wallingford and broke the siege he and robert then turned their fire upon waleran newly named by stephen as earl of worcester at daybreak on november th they assaulted worcester breaking through its defenses on the north side of the city fires were set looting was widespread and a number of the luckless citizens were taken hostage back to bristol waleran arrived in his plundered town three weeks later and in the words of the worcester chronicle when he beheld the ravages of the flames he grieved and felt that the blow had been struck for his own injury and wishing to revenge himself for this he marched with an army to sudely whose lord was an ally of robert fitz roy there his men pillaged and burned and again in the words of the worcester chronicle returned evil for evil and so began for the wretched people of england a time of suffering so great that they came to fear christ and his saints slept bristol castle england july for stephen and maude both it was to be a frustrating year one of advances and retreats thwarted victories and inconclusive defeats check and mate matilda scored a diplomatic coup in those early winter months sailing to france she negotiated a marriage for her eldest son eustace with constance young sister of the french king but that good news was soured for stephen by a rebellion in the english fenlands instigated by the bishop of ely whod been nursing a grudge since the oxford ambush stephen raced north and the bishop fled south taking refuge at bristol more trouble was already flaring for stephen william fitz richard the sheriff and greatest landholder in cornwall declared for maude and sealed his new allegiance within the sacrament of marriage offering his daughter beatrice to maudes brother rainald after wedding and bedding his bride rainald joined his fatherinlaw and they set cornwall ablaze stephen hastened west and soon had them on the run he had the greater resources those of the crown and could put more men into the field than any of his enemies but hed begun to feel much like the crazed firefighter of his brothers taunt no matter how he struggled to quench these flames embers still smoldered and the acrid smell of smoke hung low upon the horizon with no end in sight the strife continued miles fitz walter captured hereford and burned winchcombe waleran beaumont torched robert fitz roys favorite manor at tewkesbury caught in the crossfire the english people could only pray for deliverance at whitsuntide there was a brief flicker of hope stephens brother henry decided it was up to him to act as peacemaker and he summoned both sides to bath the conference was quite civil for maude had sent her brother robert and stephen his queen but nothing was accomplished the war went on if stephen still held sway in much of the country maudes writ ran in the west with bristol her de facto capital but she herself preferred to dwell in miles fitz walters riverside city of gloucester for there she was the mistress of her own household whereas at bristol she was amabel and roberts guest since less than forty miles separated the two strongholds ranulf divided his days between gloucester and bristol on this humid hot saturday in late july he was at bristol castle although not for long after saddling his horse he was leading it from the stables when gilbert burst in to bar his way so it is true then what your squire said you are going off on your own with nary a word to anyone ranulf had already had this same argument with his anxious squire was in no mood to have it again with gilbert luke is worse than a broody hen i am quite able to fend for myself luke has enough sense to see the danger in roaming about the countryside in the midst of a war a pity i cannot say the same for you what are you up to ranulf i have a private matter to take care of will be back in a few days you are making much ado about nothing gib gilbert scowled for he knew that stubborn set of ranulfs jaw all too well following ranulf out into the summer sun he watched as the other man swung into the saddle and then reached up clamping his hand on ranulfs boot at least tell me where you are going he insisted if we have to search for your body we need a place to start ranulf looked down thoughtfully at his friend you have a point he said grudgingly if you must know im bound for shrewsbury shrewsbury that shire is closely held by stephens sheriff and hed like nothing better than to have maudes brother blunder into his nets for christs pity ranulf why shrewsbury what could be worth the risk ranulf hesitated but could not resist the temptation i am going to shrewsburys fair he said quite truthfully and with the memory of gilberts incredulous face to enliven his journey he spurred his stallion forward rode laughing out of bristol and onto the road north the abbey of st peter and st paul was not enclosed within shrewsburys protective bend of the river severn it lay just to the east of the town close by the redgrit sandstone span known as the english bridge it was not among the largest of the benedictine monasteries but it was a thriving one owing a measure of its prosperity to the royal charter that permitted it to hold a fair in honour of its patron saint peter ad vincula the fair opened each year on august st lasting until sundown on the third day and attracted merchants from bristol and chester and coventry some from as far away as london people flocked to fairs as much for the entertainment as for the opportunity to buy goods not available elsewhere and ranulf found the abbey already overflowing upon his arrival the hospitaller squeezed him into a corner of the guest hall though and he spread his bedroll made ready to pass the night but sleep would not come although hed dismissed gilberts fears as if they were of no account he knew better his danger was real moreover maude and robert would be furious when they found out what hed done since he was unwilling to lie to them he could only refuse to answer their irate questions and that would fuel their fire even higher no he was in for a rough patch when he returnedif he returned he had more to fear than stephens sheriff the roads were full of bandits masterless men seeking to take advantage of these troubled times and a lone traveler was a tempting target for ambush or assault fortunately hed thought to bring his dogs along but hed still have to keep his wits about him lying awake and fretful in the abbey hall ranulf had to admit that he was risking a great dealand for what conjecture surmise an arrow shot in the dark it had taken him several months of discreet investigation but hed eventually found out what he wanted to knowthat gervase fitz clements favorite manor was located in shropshire west of shrewsbury once he knew where he set about figuring out how and it soon came to him st peters fair he was gambling though and he knew itgambling that the fitz clement household was currently in residence at the shropshire manor that fitz clement himself would have been summoned to stephens service and last that the fair would be a powerful enough lure to draw annora into shrewsbury what could happen then he did not know but theyd left too much unsaid between them not even farewell he had to see her againno matter what it might cost the morrow promised summer at its best sundrenched warmth an easterly breeze and an irisblue sky feathered by wispy white clouds sauntering through the monastery gatehouse ranulf turned right along the abbey foregate heading for the fairground as early as it was the street was crowded with his fellow fairgoers and with others who had less innocent aims than a day of fun at the fairpickpockets and prostitutes and tricksters mingling with the tradesmen and goodwives and eagereyed children ranulf forgot his sleepless qualms and his spirits soared annora would be here today suddenly he was sure of it the fairground was teeming with activity it was as if a temporary town had sprung up overnight row upon row of wooden stalls and booths streets of trodden grass already thronged with the customers that were its citizens had ranulf not been watching for annora with such hungry intensity he would have enjoyed himself enormously there was enough variety to satisfy the most jaded appetite there were booths offering cloth of all kinds fresh and salted fish wine honey spices crockery gemstones needles canvas finely tanned leather perfume soft felt hats mirrors of polished metal holy relics and hooded hunting birds merlins and goshawks tethered to wooden perches while off to the north horses were being put through their paces and cattle and oxen paraded before wouldbe buyers looking upon this bustling colorful scene ranulf felt much heartened for how could annora resist such a beguiling temptation as the st peters fair ranulf wandered among the booths pausing now and then to watch the fairs numerous forms of entertainment there were archery contests and bouts with the quarterstaff acrobats jugglers and strolling musicians strumming lively tunes on lyre lute and gittern there was cockfighting and a small spotted dog trained to balance upon a moving ball and an occasional brawl quickly broken up by the sheriffs men the fair offered all the attractions a fairgoer could wish forsave only annora de bernay by dinnertime the fair was at its busiest ranulf jostled a path toward a crowded cookstall bought a hot pasty stuffed with spiced pork marrow and cheese for himself and a plain pork pie for his dogs washing his meal down with ale it was getting hotter the breeze had died down shortly before noon he decided to check out the horse fair where a race was soon to get under way and it was then that he saw her he caught only a glimpse as she moved between booths but it was enough he heedlessly trod upon a portly merchants heels as he sought to keep her in view spilling the last of his ale his breath quickening with each lengthening stride he had her in sight again shed paused at a drapers stall examining samples of samite and linen as the merchant hovered close at hand hopeful of making a sale she was not alone of course attended by a gangling groom and a young maidservant both of whom appeared delighted by this escort duty the girl was quite pretty but ranulf saw only annora she was clad in a vividly red gown with full hanging sleeves in a lighter shade of rose a green silk cord belted at the hip her dark hair demurely hidden away beneath a soft circular veil she looked just as ranulf had envisioned her in dreams and daylight yearnings these four years past but hed not expected her to seem so contented so comfortable in her role as fitz clements wife he stood rooted watching as she browsed from booth to booth the merchants were very deferential and she took it as her due the hoyden he remembered suddenly transformed into the lady of the manor she selected a pair of scissors and a length of green ribbon turning her purchases over to her groom to carry and then she stopped so abruptly that she stumbled staring after the blackandsilver wolfdog that streaked across her path in pursuit of a spitting hissing cat her face changed her expression both wistful and regretful and ranulf knew in that moment exactly what she was thinkingof him and what theyd lost he took a tentative step forward just as annora turned and saw him annora went white and the combs shed been appraising spilled into the grass at her feet ranulf swiftly closed the space between them bent down and gathered up the combs they were ivory and decorated with delicately carved flowers i think these are yours my lady he said and annora nodded mutely her eyes seemed black and bottomless dilated in disbelief her groom was looking toward them wanting to be sure his lords wife did not need him to defend her honour he was young enough to relish such a confrontation and hed soon be strutting their way as challenging as any barnyard cock annora had not yet moved and ranulf held out the combs saying softly where can we meet as ranulf had feared the groom was bearing down upon them annora snatched up the combs so hastily that her fingers just grazed his thrusting the combs toward the disappointed merchant she beckoned to her servants and moved on toward a silversmiths booth but ranulf had heard her whispered words barely more than a breath st alkmunds church ranulf found st alkmunds with no difficulty the towns weekly market was held in its churchyard but the churchyard was deserted now as were the streets the fair had turned shrewsbury into a ghost town for its merchants were not permitted to compete with the monks and their shops were shut down for the duration of the fair st alkmunds was made of stone and the interior was shadowed and cool summers heat seemed to stop at the church door ranulf walked up the nave then continued on into the choir logic told him that she would not follow him right away but he was already straining for sounds of her entry he convinced himself so often that he heard her steps only to find the nave empty and silent that when she finally did arrive she took him almost by surprise ranulf had moved toward the candlelit high altar and when he turned back annora was there framed in the arched doorway of the roodscreen her face was flushed even in such dimmed lighting he could see the color staining her cheeks and throat he yearned to touch that hot skin had to remind himself that he no longer had the right fumbling for wordsany wordsto break this smothering silence he asked how did you get rid of your servants i did not i told them to await me in the churchyard annora sounded out of breath when i saw that dog i thought at once of shadow but ii never imagined it was really him and when i turned around and saw you ranulf was absurdly pleased that shed remembered the name of his dyrehund i had to come annora he said and she looked at him wideeyed for an unbearably long moment before saying quite simply im so glad thinking back upon it much later ranulf could never be sure which of them had taken that first fateful step but suddenly she was in his arms and they were clinging tightly with such urgency that further words were forgotten they fused together in an embrace so impassioned so intoxicating and so desperate that their return to reality stunned them both it was the slamming of a door a sound harmless in itself but for ranulf and annora fraught with the dread of discovery there was a violence in their recoil a tearingaway that left them momentarily bereft unable to respond to their danger ranulf recovered first flattened himself against the roodscreen and jerked his head toward the door annora drew a shaken breath then stepped out to intercept the intruder the sight of a priest jolted annoras conscience back to life reminding her that sinning in a church had to be one of those wrongs god could not forgive at the same time she was thankful that it was not her groom or her maid for they knew her well enough to notice her agitation but the priest was beaming quite oblivious of anything untoward lady fitz clement this is indeed a pleasure your man told me you were within and i did not want you to slip away ere i paid my respects annora faked a smile that would have fooled only an elderly cleric with dimming eyesight and a celibates innocence yes ii wanted to light a candle for the kings success the priest nodded approvingly i was deeply dismayed to hear of hugh bigods rebellion for he was amongst the most stalwart of the kings men truly the devil is on the loose these days ever ready to lead the unwary astray your lord husbandhe is with you no annora said too abruptly but she could not bear to talk of her husband in ranulfs hearing he is still in the north with the king and will return safe to you in gods good time daughter never fear nowmay i escort you back to the fair i should be delighted for your company annora would have agreed to follow the priest to hades and back at that moment so frantic was she to keep him from entering the choir and finding ranulf father john could you tell my man that ill be returning with you and he and joan can go ahead and meet us there at the cookstall ill be out straightaway i left my pater noster in the choir she did not move until the priest started up the aisle not returning to ranulf until she was sure father john was out of earshot even then they waited for the sound of a closing door ranulf reached for her hard and pressed a kiss into her palm silently mouthing a oneword question where annora was at a loss for privacy was as scarce as sightings of unicorns i do not she began dubiously and then brightened of course the leper hospital at st giles ranulfs brows shot upward a lazar house he echoed in delighted disbelief and began to laugh do hush annoras fingers flew to his mouth to still his laughter but lingered to trace the curve of his lip i do not mean we should meet there for pitys sake just follow the foregate until you get to st giles when you reach the fence cross the road to your right and enter the woods youll soon come to a canal the runoff from the abbey mill wait there for me she took his assent for granted and hastened from the choir but when she reached the door in the roodscreen she paused giving him a dazzling smile over her shoulder so full of love that his breath stopped before going to st alkmunds ranulf had tethered his dogs in the abbey garth much to their indignation he freed them upon his return for theyd make useful sentinels for his rendezvous with annora heading back to the fairground he bought a wicker basket a tablecloth a wineskin a loaf of freshly baked bread a pot of jam apples and a single red rose the same shade as annoras gown with the dogs at his heels he walked briskly along the foregate toward st giles the lazar house was situated just as annora had said where the road forked off toward london and wenlock the hospital buildings and cemetery were enclosed by a wattle fence but several of the unhappy inhabitants were squatting by the roadside for they were not permitted to beg within the town the sight of their ravaged flesh and hooded cloaks would have been an unwelcome reminder to the fairgoers of their own mortality a grim spectre of stalking death in its most grisly guise not what the merchants had in mind for fair entertainment ranulfs steps lagged as the lazar house came into view to a man about to violate one of gods commandments any encounter with lepers was bound to be chilling for many believed that leprosy was a sinners disease the church sought to combat this bias by calling leprosy a sacred malady but scriptures stigmatized the leper as defiled and unclean and most people were more inclined to see leprosy as divine punishment than as a manifestation of gods grace ranulfs gaze was drawn inexorably to those hunched figures and then he strode toward them dropped coins into their alms cups and wished them as cordial a good morrow as he could manage their hoarse expressions of gratitude as much for his civility as for his charity followed after him as he crossed into the woods and ranulf felt pitys taste in his mouth as bitter as gall he soon reached the millrace where he sprawled in the grass by the surging current and tried not to think about st giles and the poor wretches in need of its sanctuary the sun rose higher in the sky the dogs foraged in the underbrush for mice or moles and eventually he heard the snapping of twigs the muffled echoes of woodland steps ranulf jumped to his feet as annora emerged from shade into sunlight there was a moment or two of awkwardness but then ranulf gave her the rose and they smiled at each other when he asked how shed escaped her keepers she looked quite pleased with herself i told them that i wanted to give alms at st giles the very thought of getting within shouting distance of a lazar house turned them greensick with fright they started babbling that even a lepers glance was dangerous and when i agreed to let them await me at the fair i thought theyd both kiss the hem of my gown ranulf took her hand in his and they began to walk they did not talk there was no need without haste they followed the millrace as it curved toward the south leading them farther and farther from the road the sun spangled the water and all about them were the soothing sounds of the summer forest they soon turned away from the millrace moved deeper into the woods until they found a secluded quiet clearing shaded by trees screened by flowering shrubs of wild holly ranulf spread out the tablecloth and annora unpacked the food but they knew theyd not eat it instead annora removed her veil and then slowly and deliberately began to unwind the hair neatly coiled at the nape of her neck when she removed the last pin she shook it loose about her shoulders and they both understood that to be a pledge of intimacy for only a husband or lover ever saw a womans hair flowing free down her back when ranulf reached for her she came eagerly into his arms her hair felt like silk so did her skin her mouth was warm and sweet her perfume scenting his every breath it went to his head like wine the clearing might have been crowded with their ghostsher absent husband all the women hed bedded and forgotten afterward but none of that mattered not now for ranulf there was no world beyond this cloistered glade no woman but this one only annora and when she cried out shuddering and gasping his name he found her climax even more satisfying than his own afterward he held her close brushing butterfly kisses against her temples her eyelids the hollow of her throat kisses so tender that tears began to seep through her lowered lashes he tasted the salt on her skin and was stricken by the realization that she was weeping that he may have seduced her into a mortal sin annora have you regrets sitting up she flung back her hair swiped impatiently at the tears streaking her face how can you even ask that my god if my regrets were raindrops wed both be in danger of drowning when he reached for her this time she pulled away how could we have been such fools but no you had to cling to maude like a limpet and i had to marry straightaway so i could show you i no longer caredranulf how can you laugh she glared at him quite indignant but ranulf merely laughed all the more because he said i thought you regretted thisour lovemaking oh no she cried and threw herself back into his arms how could i ever regret this ranulf this is a memory i shall have to live on for the rest of my life no he said that is not so this is not an ending love but a beginning that i promise you she studied his face intently and then got slowly and reluctantly to her feet ranulfif you are asking me to run away with you i cannot do that tears were glinting again on her lashes i love you she said ive loved you since i was old enough to know what that word meant and i daresay i shall still love you as i draw my last breath but i cannot be your concubine i cannot shame my father and brothers like that they do not deserve that andand neither does gervase for he is a decent man i have the children to consider too and they that had been ranulfs secret dread a festering fear that hed dealt with by denial an option now no longer available to him have you borne this man a child annora no she said oh my darling no she started toward him but he was faster and caught her to him in an emotional embrace annora raised her face for his kiss and then said so softly as to be almost inaudible i miscarried in our second year of marriage but i have not quickened again although she attempted to sound dispassionate ranulf heard echoes of an old grief she had mourned the child shed lost fitz clements child and he did not know what to say for he could feel only thankfulness that this accursed marriage of hers was barren he stroked her hair gently before saying quietly what children do you mean then love daniel and lucette my stepchildren the other lad is older but they are just babes and they love me well i would not have them think of me as aa wanton i would not have a single soul in christendom think you a wanton annoraand they will not there will be no shame in our union for it will be blessed by the church and god within holy wedlock her eyes narrowed what sort of daft talk is that lest you forget i have a husband already and one is all the law and church allow hellcat he said fondly well then well just have to get you shed of him will we not what do you have in mind she said testily murder not unless you insist his teasing had always been able to fire her temper and he grinned for there was a reassuring familiar feel to their squabbling but he relented then for she was getting truly angry i am speaking of a plight troth annorayours and mine because we did not have the words said over us by a priest or put down in writing your father did not bother to forswear it id wager the surety of my soul on that but the church requires only that a man and woman pledge their vows and we did which means that your marriage was not valid for you were not free to wed anyone but me she was looking at him in wonderment oh ranulf if only that could be her hope deflated almost at once though and she frowned again you know better than that the church will annul a marriage for princes but rarely for the rest of us my father and husband both stand in high favor with the king he would never agree to annul my marriage for what would he gain by it no most likely stephen would not ranulf agreed but maude would annora exhaled a ragged breath be sure ranulf she pleaded be very sure of what you say for if it does not come to pass my heart would surely break when maude is queenand she will be queen never doubt thati shall ask her to aid us in declaring your marriage void and then we shall be wed this i swear to you my love upon the life of our firstborn son he was not jesting now never had she heard him sound so serious and she no longer doubted tell me she said tell me how it will be and he laughed drew her back into his arms and between kisses promised her love and lust and a lifetime in which to enjoy them they soon sank down upon the tablecloth that served as their bed and found in each other such passionate pleasure that it no longer mattered if it was outlawed when they were wed their sins would be forgiven by god theyd already forgiven themselves it was very late when ranulf reached gloucester fortunately he was known on sight by now and was allowed to pass into the city he was admitted into the castle with equal ease and was relieved to learn that maude had already gone to bed putting off their reckoning till the morrow he paused briefly in the great hall to exchange greetings with a few friends deftly parried their curiosity about his absence and then headed for his own chamber where he was given an effusive welcome by his squire but given too news not to his liking earl robert summoned you sir ranulf just two days after youd ridden off he was wroth not to find you at gloucester for he and lord miles were seeking to capture bath and he wanted you to ride with them their campaign came to naught though for the city was well defended and they were beaten back lord robert said he wants you to come to bristol to explain yourself and lady maudei fear she is sorely vexed with you too sir ranulf the boy concluded apologetically sounding as if he and not ranulf were the one at fault ah but i do have happier news sir gilbert is here awaiting your return im glad you warned me luke at least ill be braced now when the storm breaks over my head i know it is late but im wellnigh starved think you that you could fetch me some wine from the buttery and then raid the kitchen for me luke promised to be back in a trice with food in plenitude and ranulf did not doubt he would for luke was just fifteen and overly eager to please it still seemed odd to ranulf getting the sort of wholehearted devotion from luke that he and gilbert had given robert but then he would remember he was one and twenty now no longer a squire maudes mainstay prop of the throne he said aloud liking the sound of that and then set about unpacking his saddlebags whistling a tune hed picked up at st peters fair finding it as easy as that to shrug off his coming confrontation with robert and maude a man caught out in a summer squall might get drenched to the skin but the sun would soon get him dry again angry words seemed a small price to pay for the miracle hed wrought in shrewsbury when the door opened he turned in surprise not expecting luke back so soon but it was gilbert without waiting to be asked he strode into the chamber sat down on a coffer and subjected ranulf to a scrutiny that was far from friendly i was going to ask if youd seen her he said but clearly you did saw whom annora fitz clement did you truly think id not figure it out once i put my mind to it i knew annora had to be at the root of your folly so i asked miles fitz walter if gervase fitz clement has a manor in shropshire it would not surprise you i am sure to learn that he does ranulf shrugged what of it do not try to lie ranulf i know you too well you went to shrewsbury to seek annora out and you got what you wanted from her do not bother to deny it for i can see it in your face gilberts accusations had been delivered in flat dispassionate tones but then his outrage broke free christ jesus ranulf how could you do it how could you make a whore out of ancels sister ranulf had been listening in a stony silence but at that he took a warning step toward gilbert dark eyes blazing watch what you say i mean to make her my wife gilbert started to rise then slumped down again on the coffer this was even worse than hed expected you cannot be serious he said but with no conviction ranulf have you lost what wits you have left the girl has a husband not for long ranulf shot back triumphantly annora may have been locked into a loveless marriage but i have the key to set her free our prior plight troth now that his first flash of anger was over he was glad that gilbert had guessed the truth having a trustworthy confidant was a luxury hed not expected and he gave his friend a discreetly edited account of his reunion with annora confided their hopes and dwelled at length upon all the tomorrows they would share time enough to recompense them for these lost years a lifetime in which to wed and love and beget children and pledge fealty to his sister the queen gilbert listened and feared for them both but he kept his qualms to himself for he knew ranulf would not have heeded them night had claimed geoffrey of anjous capital city of angers and the castle was asleep sometime after midnight henry sat up suddenly in bed jolted awake by a remembered sin papas dagger hed been playing with it all day but hed not gotten his fathers permission and then hed gone off to bed and forgotten to sneak it back where it belonged instead hed left it in a window seat of the great hall where it was sure to be found in the morning by one of the servants and his wooden sword was down there too so all would know he was the culprit he was already in disgrace all because of that fight hed had with his brother geoffrey he still did not think it had been his fault geoffrey had deserved his nosebleed for the way hed been badgering will will could not help being scared of the dark he was only four from the superior vantage point of his seven years that seemed very young to henry and he felt protective of his baby brother when will had begun to wake up screaming in the night their father had given his consent for a small candle to be kept lit that made sense to henry but geoffrey could not resist teasing will about his fears and eventually he threatened once too often to snuff out the candle so will could be carried off by the werewolves waiting in the dark henry wasnt at all sorry for hitting geoffrey that memory was still very satisfying but he could not be caught in another misdeed so soon after their squabble not after hed promised to be good well there was no help for it hed have to go get the dagger taking care not to disturb his brothers he edged out of bed fumbling about in the dark until he found his tunic it took him longer to locate his shoes but it was october and the stone stairs were too cold for bare feet both of his dogs were awake by now eager to join in the fun he was sorry he had to shut them up in the bedchamber but dyrehunds always seemed to bark at just the wrong time henry was not afraid of the dark not really anyone would be nervous creeping down a winding stairwell blacker than any cave he kept on going and sighed softly when he reached the great hall for it was dark too but there were people here sleeping on pallets and benches and blankets much to his relief the dagger was still in the window seat half hidden by a cushion now if he could just get it back to papas bedchamber without getting caughtto his surprise he was beginning to enjoy himself for this midnight quest was an adventure with suspense and risk and even a worthy prize a crusaders dagger with a ruby hilt hoping that the hinges wouldnt squeak he slowly pushed open the door of his fathers bedchamber a reassuring sound met his ears the snoring of his fathers squires the hearth had burned low the firelight dying down to a feeble glow his fathers favorite wolfhound a massive beast the size of a pony raised her head then tipped her tail in drowsy greeting leaving the door ajar henry moved toward the coffer at the foot of the bed he was cautiously lifting the lid when his fathers voice suddenly cut through the darkness just what are you looking for henry froze shock robbing him of all speech before he could stammer out a response a womans voice came floating from the bed i do believe ive found it my lord i was but browsing now though i think id like to buy henry was stunned and for a toobrief moment joyful almost at once though he realized his mistake one foolish enough to make him blush how could he have thought mama had come home if she were back all would know it crouching down behind the coffer he tried to make sense of this why was a strange woman in papas bed she was speaking again an unfamiliar voice sounding young and eager to please papa was laughing at what shed said henry didnt like it not at all that papa should be laughing in bed with this unknown woman he wanted to go away to forget what hed heard but he was trapped unable to move until they went back to sleep and to his horror he now heard his father say fetch me that wine cup on the table nan the bed curtains parted and a womans tousled head poked through she had tumbled masses of unruly flaxen curls and henry could not help thinking of his mothers glossy neat braids black as a ravens wing having assured herself that the squires slept the girl swung her legs onto the floor scampered over to the table and snatched up a goblet henry had a lively curiosity about womens bodies not only were they formed differently than males but people acted as if there was something sinful about female nakedness and he still remembered a puzzling sermon hed heard that summer in which the priest had railed about daughters of eve and whores of babylon and satans lures now though he averted his eyes did not look up until the woman had climbed back into bed good lass you cannot imagine how pleasant it is to have a biddable bedmate for a change the girl giggled your lady wife would not have fetched you wine not unless shed poisoned it beforehand another giggle surely she could not be as bad as all that i have to admit though that i was right glad when she left she could stab someone with her eyes gods truth do you think my lord that she will be gone long if god is merciful geoffrey said wryly no you need not fret about my shewolf of a wife nan shes like to be bogged down in that english quagmire for years and even if she does manage to defeat stephen her victory might not be worth much after she and stephen get done with their crownclipping ii do not understand you do know about coinclipping is that not what the jews do not just the jews anyone with a sharp eye for turning a profit they file the edges off the coin and melt the clippings down to make a counterfeit coin anyone caught clipping coins in my domains does not live to regret it but just as the clipped coins are worth less so is a tarnished crown for proof of that we need look no further than the doubledealing by hugh bigod and robert fitz hubert think you that either one would have dared to defy the old king like that when pigs fly the first name was vaguely familiar to nan the second name not at all this hugh bigodwas he not the kings man more than that lass he perjured himself to god and the archbishop of canterbury claiming that maudes father had repudiated her upon his deathbed but he came to feel cheated for he believed stephen owed him more than hed gotten and this past june he rebelled stephen swooped down on him and seized one of bigods castles but freed bigod to wreak more mischief if he chose he did and rebelled again in august this time stephen decided to buy his loyalty can there be a better reason for rebelling raising his voice geoffrey launched without warning into a mimicry of a peddlers spiel are you discontented with your lot in life has your barony begun to seem paltry and insignificant do you yearn for your own deer park wine from cyprus oranges from spain well then do not delay defy the king gain yourself estates castles mayhap an earldom nan joined in his laughter even though the humor eluded her she laughed at all of geoffreys jokes whether she understood them or not what of the other man this fitzherbert fitz hubert he was one of stephens flemish hirelings mayhap the worst of a bad lot last october he turned on stephen and seized malmesbury castle stephen snatched it back butsurprise of surpriseshe then agreed to let fitz hubert go it seems he was a kinsman of william de ypres and he prevailed upon stephen to show his cousin some undeserved mercy was that the end of it of course not fitz hubert promptly hied off to maude at bristol but he soon saw he could do better on his own and by a ruse succeeded in getting hold of devizes castle when righteous robertmy saintly brother by marriagesent his son to take command fitz hubert drove him off using devizes as a refuge he and his brigands set about terrorizing the countryside plundering and raping and burning as they pleased it then occurred to him that if hed done so well with one castle how much better he could do with two and he set his eyes upon marlborough but he overreached himself there for marlborough was held by a man named john marshal and that one could teach the devil himself about guile nan clapped her hands like a child hearing a bedtime story what happened then marshal pretended to believe fitz huberts cockandbull tale about forging an alliance lured our greedy fleming to marlborough and cast him into the castles dungeon he then agreed to turn fitz hubert over to brother robert for five hundred marks robert dragged the fleming back to devizes where he swore to hang him if he did not order the garrison to surrender but fitz hubert balked and robert ever a man of his word hanged him outside the castle walls meanwhile the garrison had decided they did not truly need fitz hubert and so they spurned all demands for surrender instead they waited until roberts forces withdrew and then yielded the castle to stephen for a right goodly profit geoffrey and nan laughed so loudly that henry feared theyd awaken the squires he huddled against the coffer holding his breath but those blanketed forms by the hearth didnt stir so you see sweet it is every man for himself in england these days and itll get worse ere it gets better stephen and maude have opened the floodgates and all they can do is let the tide carry them along whilst trying to keep their heads above water not that it would break my heart if the lady drowned but whether she survives or not shell not be coming back to bedevil me nowenough of these english lunatics weve more interesting matters to discuss when are you going to make good your offer offer nan echoed coyly what offer was that my lord henry did not hear his fathers murmured response only the womans laugh there was an intimacy to their conversation now that was different and disquieting making no further attempts at concealment henry got to his feet he no longer cared if he was caught or not with a deliberation that verged upon defiance he turned away from the bed started toward the door his father had once told him that ice could burn he hadnt believed it now he did the coldness within him was numbing seemed to have seeped into the very marrow of his bones hed never felt like this before did not even know how to describe it the word desolate was not yet in his sevenyearolds vocabulary there was anger too but it was unfamiliar angernot hot more like the ice that burned he had not comprehended all that hed overheard but he had understood what mattered his mother was not coming back westminster england december goffreys cynical assessment of english affairs was more accurate than he knew even as he predicted coming chaos the earl of chester was plotting a royal murder chester had not forgiven stephen for bestowing upon harry of scotland the disputed honour of carlisle when the scots kings son took as his wife a halfsister of the detested beaumonts chesters fury reached the flash point hed never been one to bother about consequences and he had no fear whatsoever of the kings wrathnot this kingfor stephen had repeatedly shown himself to be a believer in second chances even third fourth and fifth chances once he made up his mind to take action chester turned to the only man he truly trusted his halfbrother william de roumare william de roumare was nine years older than chester and of a less volatile temperament he was famed not so much for his own accomplishments as for his fortuitous dockside decision not to sail on the white ship although he was ambitious even his ambition seemed a pale echo of chesters ravenous hunger for power and prestige the two brothers were very close but there was no doubt who dominated and william de roumare became a willing accomplice to chesters vengeful scheme their plan as reckless as it was ruthless was to ambush harry of scotland and his beaumont bride as they made their way home from a michaelmas visit to stephens court fortunately for the scots prince one of their conspirators had a weakness for wine and did some rash bragging to a bought bedmate the young woman was shrewd enough to realize both the value and the danger in such information and she wasted no time confiding her perilous prized secret to the most trustworthy of stephens inner circle his queen matilda was appalled but acted swiftly to frustrate chesters murderous intent persuading stephen to provide prince harry and adeline de warenne with a royal escort all the way to the scots border they were then faced with a draconian dilemma what to do about the earl of chester there was no easy answer for this wouldbe assassin was also the most powerful lord of the realm as furious as stephen was with chesters treachery he and matilda reluctantly concluded that there was no way to punish him for it the crime had been thwarted evidence was lacking and whod take the word of a drunken hireling over his highborn lord an earl might be charged with rebellion but a felony no theyd have to find another way to deal with this overmighty unscrupulous subject however little they liked it resorting to the tactic that had become a habit by now stephen sought to buy chesters loyalty at the time of the old kings death there had been no more than seven earls in his domains in the five years since stephen had claimed the crown though hed bestowed no less than sixteen new earldoms four had gone to the beaumonts and their kin in the past year alone he had created six new earls adding a seventh to that list he conferred upon william de roumare the earldom of lincoln he then returned to london confident that hed outbid maude and the brothers were his but with a sour taste in his mouth withal he had yet to learn that for some men more is never enough instead of rejoicing in their new family earldom chester and his brother fumed for stephen had not included the royal castle of lincoln in his grudging grant and as their king rode south they began to lay plans to remedy his omission christmas eve revelries at westminster were lavish that yeardeliberately so as if rich fare and dramatic spectacle could somehow validate stephens contested kingship as if roast goose and spiced red wine and a bakers dozen of minstrels could make people forget the burning of worcester the sacking of nottingham the newly dug graves and the uncertain tomorrows that lay ahead the great hall of william rufus had been adorned with so much greenery that it resembled the forest in which rufus had met his death decorated with evergreen boughs and holly and beribboned sprigs of mistletoe the meal had been so bountiful that the leftover goose and venison and bread and eel scraped from the trenchers would feed christs poor for days to come the entertainment was equally extravagant a woman rope dancer a daredevil who juggled daggers a nativity play that offered not only the requisite shepherds and magi but even a few sheep as props then the last of the trestle tables were cleared away and the dancing began the irresistible exuberant music of everyones favorite the carol matilda danced so many carols that she began to get dizzy and when the circle started to form for the next one she begged off moving to the sidelines to catch her breath she had no need for center stage would have been quite content to watch her husband have fun but she was still keeping an eye upon her son and his bride eustace and constance had been given permission to attend the evening revelries although it was well past their bedtime hour constance had withdrawn to a cushioned window seat eustace had followed and only matilda saw what happened next saw eustace deliberately pour his cider down the front of constances gown constance gave a scream quickly choked off and began to brush ineffectually at the spreading stain eustace laughed then turned to saunter innocently away before he could make his escape though his mother was there with a napkin for constance and a lowvoiced but stinging rebuke for him he flushed insisting it had been an accident that constance had jogged his arm but matilda was not mollified sounding like the queen and not at all like his mother she said coldly do not make your misdeed worse by lying about it eustace when the carol ends go to your lord father and ask if you may withdraw then go to your bedchamber straightaway and if you wake will youll have reason to rue it eustace started to argue but then thought better of it he was not a stupid child and he well knew which of his parents could be gotten around which one could not giving constance a baleful glance that promised future retribution he stalked off to do as his mother bade and matilda turned her efforts to comforting her daughterinlaw constance was the older of the two children eleven to eustaces ten although none would have guessed it by appearance for eustace was a swaggering handsome boy as yellowhaired and bold as a viking tall for his age and constances fairness was ethereal even fey she had the flaxen hair and blue eyes and shy nature of her elder brother the french king like louis she yearned for approval and like louis she could be surprisingly stubborn but most of the time she was quite biddable eager to do what was expected of her fearful of disappointingfearful too of eustace they had been betrothed that past february wed on the last sunday before advent constance would be raised at the english court learning the customs and ways of her new homeland and when she and eustace were of an age to consummate their marriage they would share a bed it was a common arrangement but matilda was already uneasy sensing that they were poorly matched this little french fawn and her wolfcub son it was not easy to admit for eustace was her flesh and blood and she did love him for some time though she had been troubled by what she was seeing in her son he had known how constance had looked forward to this eveninga chance to attend the christmas fete to sit at the high table and take part in the carol and wear a grownup gown of mossgreen silk in spoiling her pleasure eustace had been playing no mere prank it was a meanspirited act the act of a bully matilda had tried at first to find mitigation for her sons misbehavior tried to convince herself that she was exaggerating the significance of his petty sins sins common to all boys of spirit but once her eyes were opened she saw shadows at every turn her younger son had too many bruises no child fell down that often fouryearold mary had begun to shrink back whenever eustace was nearby her own spaniel would not approach the boy and stephens favorite greyhound was equally wary there was an awkward incident involving a onelegged beggar who claimed eustace had stolen his crutch an accusation hed hastily retracted upon learning the boys identity and then there was the day when eustace was seen flinging a cat from an upperstory window hed been quite forthright when confronted admitted the deed freely explaining he wanted to see if the cat would land on its feet as folklore held but matilda had been unable to repress a queasy suspicion that hed hoped to see the cat splatter upon the hard ground below she did not want to bother stephen he had enough on his trencher as it was after the cat episode though she felt she had no choice stephen hadnt liked what he heard and hed given eustace a stern lecture about the obligations of the highborn the need to protect those too weak to protect themselves the duties imposed by chivalry and christianity duties which no kings son could shirk afterward hed assured matilda that the lad was quite attentive and whilst denying any wrongdoing promised to make them proud of him boys that age ofttimes went astray it was to be expected but they outgrew it for certes he had matilda very much wanted to believe him but she could never imagine stephenno matter how youngtormenting small children or dumb animals she no longer shared stephens implicit faith that all would always turn out for the best and she could not help asking unsettling questions what if eustace did not outgrow it what sort of king would he make what sort of husband shed engaged a new nurse for her children one who understood that her duties included a discreet surveillance but constance was another matter if her suspicions about eustace were correct the girls marriage would be a wretched one shed become very fond of constance and it distressed her enormously to think of her vulnerable daughterinlaw wed to a brutal husband and he her own son pray god she was wrong that they had not done constance a terrible injustice for she did not believe a crown compensated for all of lifes maladies she would have to teach the lass to speak up for herself to show more backbone a pity the child had not come under the sway of her brothers wife for no one would ever call eleanor of aquitaine docile or sweetly submissive matilda had to smile at the very thought during her stay in paris shed been somewhat shocked by eleanors outspokenness while envying it too shed had to take a much more active part in stephens fight to save his crown than shed ever envisioned and she was proud of her accomplishments on stephens behalf but it was neither easy nor natural for her to play such a role not as it was for eleanor she could not leave the hall herself and she looked over her guests until her gaze finally settled upon robert beaumonts daughter isabel the earl of northamptons countess a wife at thirteen a mother at fifteen shed surely sympathize with constances discomfort and when matilda beckoned her over she volunteered at once to assist the child in sponging off her gown salvaging the remainder of the evening watching as isabel gently steered constance across the crowded hall matilda vowed to have another long frank talk with her son one he would not enjoy matilda wanted suddenly to be with her husband for a few hours she was not going to fret about eustace or constance or maude or that vile hellspawn chester for a few hours she was going to focus upon stephen and only stephen hoping that his high spirits would be contagious but stephen would have to wait for one of her guests was bearing down upon her clearly intent upon interception she guessed him to be about her own age midthirties and her initial impression was of a lord both pleasant and prosperous while his tunic was not cut in the latest fashion it was finely stitched and of goodquality wool and his shoes had silver buckles he looked like a man who smiled easily and often he also looked familiar but his name eluded her he was shepherding a woman a slim dark creature not much taller than matilda herself and quite young had her hair been loose and her feet bare she would have looked right at home in a gypsy encampment she did not look at home at westminster and matildas heart warmed toward her as it did toward all of lifes misfits and orphans and lost lambs as they reached her the mans name bobbed up from the depths of her memory just in time for her to say with a smile sir gervase it is a pleasure to see you again her memorys reprieve won her a lifelong champion he beamed so flattered to be remembered by the queen that it was a moment before he recollected himself madame may i present my wife annora the girl curtsied hastily murmuring a conventional response then raised her lashes to reveal brilliant black eyes the little lasswas that the lady constance it was soon apparent to matilda that constance was merely a conversational bridge meant to get annora fitz clement where she wanted to goacross the channel to the french court home of constances celebrated sisterinlaw you met the french queen my lady is she as fair as men claim i heard that she does just as she pleases says whatever is on her mind and yet the french king dotes on her every whim can that be true matilda stifled a laugh amused both by annoras candor and the faintly wistful tone she tried then to think of a diplomatic way to deflect annoras curiosity but annoras husband was quicker you cannot ask questions like that lass queens do not gossip his laugh was indulgent his rebuke kindly meant but matilda saw it was not kindly taken color had flared in the girls face and the corners of her mouth drooped wellin truth sir gervase queens fancy gossip too for certes i do matilda lied cheerfully queen eleanor is indeed a beauty with greengold cat eyes and a cats elegant grace she has a cats confidence too and i suspect that would be true whether she wore a crown or not she is lively and quickwitted and strongwilled and worldly but very young withal only eighteen or thereabouts matilda concluded satisfied that shed given annora an intimate glimpse of the french queen she so admired and envied but without saying anything hurtful or too revealing there was still so much annora yearned to know about the french queen questions she could never have asked in front of her husband for she had convinced herself that eleanor would have been willing to brave scandal for a lovers sake she needed to believe that not all the women in her world had their wings clipped surely there must be a few still able to soar up into the sky untamed and fearless and free she smiled at matilda torn between gratitude and guilt why did stephens queen have to be so likable pray god shed somehow survive stephens fall it was the sudden break in the music that caught their attention the carol had not ended it just stopped in midnote heads were turning toward the door where several of stephens guards were scuffling with a very determined intruder even as they dragged him away he was shouting that it was life or death he must see the king whether it was due to courtesy or curiosity stephen was almost always willing to hear a man out let him approach he commanded and a path cleared among the dancers the man was exhausted staggering with fatigue when he sank to his knees before stephen it seemed more an act of physical prostration than one of protocol ive ridden from lincoln my liege and in four days time too god smite me if i lie i come at the behest of sir robert de la haye your castellan i bear too a letter from his grace the bishop of lincoln and a third plea from the townspeople he faltered then and stephen said quickly wine for this man it was more than one hundred thirty miles to london no man would race the devil over winterravaged roads unless it truly was life or death stephen waited impatiently until the man had gulped down a cupful of sweet wine spilling as much as he swallowed tell me he demanded what evil has overtaken lincoln the earl of chester and his brother the new earl of lincolnthey have betrayed you my liege on thursday last they seized control of lincoln castle there were audible gasps from those listening that cannot be stephen said incredulously the castle could never be taken in just a day they did not assault it like honest men my lord king they took it by guile and perfidy the men of lincoln were to play campball with a neighboring town and the castellan agreed to let most of the garrison take part in the game the honour of lincoln being at stake so there were only a few guards at the castle when the countess of chester and the countess of lincoln came to pay a call upon lady muriel the castellans wife a short while thereafter the earl of chester arrived to escort the ladies back to their lodging but none suspected evildoing for he wore no sword and had just three men with him once they were admitted into the castle though they seized weapons belonging to the garrison and attacked the sentries one of their men then rushed to open the postern gate letting in william de roumare and the rest of their cohort by the time word got out into the town it was too late for the deed was done withdrawing several sealed parchments from the pouch at his belt he offered them to stephen these letters bear out what i say my liege once they held the castle chester and his brother began to make harsh demands upon the townspeople they sent out men to ransack houses and carried off food and provisions to replenish the castle larders and if they came upon an item of value in their search for flour and salted pork they took that too several townsmen have lost horses and rumor has it that women have been molested although i cannot confirm that for certes they would naturally keep silent from the shame of it he at last paused for breath my lord king the citizens and the bishop and your castellan all implore you to deliver them from these wicked men highborn they may be but they are no better than brigands gods own truth as long as they hold the castle they are safe from retribution and well they know it help us my liege take back your castle and return the kings peace to your loyal subjects of lincoln you need not fear stephen said grimly this time that renegade whoreson has gone too far and hell soon regret it upon that you have my word it was late when the earl of chester finally mounted the stairs to his bedchamber and his wife was already asleep he was irked that shed not waited up for him but not surprised for theyd still not made their peace after their last quarrel impatiently waving aside his squires attempts to help him undress he stripped off his clothes left them where they landed and deliberately dropped his boots onto the coffer so theyd make a sleeprousing thudin vain though for his wife did not stir climbing into bed he started to pull the bedhangings but stopped in midgesture gazing down at the woman beside him it was chesters considered opinion that his wife had inherited the worst traits of both her parents for she had amabels barbed tongue and roberts sense of moral certainty she was also the only member of his household who was not afraid of him she was the first woman whod ever dared to stand up to him and he was of two minds as to how he felt about that or indeed about this exasperating prideful vexing exciting wife of his all her virtues were flaws too in his eyes as proud as he was of her royal blood he was often annoyed by her stubborn loyalty to the aunt whose namesake she was he admired her courage admired the way shed played her part as bait for his trap but that same boldness of spirit kept her from being a dutiful and submissive wife even when she did affect that role in public he always suspected it was done tongue in cheek reaching for the bed coverlets he pulled them back so he could look upon his wifes body for that never disappointed him she was a handsome young woman bearing a striking resemblance to maude in both demeanor and coloring fortunately though she differed from maude in one crucial aspect of her womanhood the mere thought of that difference was enough to bring a smile to chesters lips geoffrey of anjou had once confided that the best place for a man to come down with frostbite was in maudes bed but his maudshe was a lustful wench as hot for their bedsport as he was sometimes it even seemed that the more quarrelsome their days the better their nights sliding over onto her side of the bed he entangled his fingers in her lustrous loose hair while his other hand cupped her breast maud opened her eyes looked up at her husband and yawned just once i wish youd let me sleep through till dawn she complained but he could feel her nipple hardening against the palm of his hand and when he continued to fondle and stroke her body she soon wrapped her arms around his neck pulling his mouth down to hers this was the sort of sex they both liked best sudden and hungry with just enough hostility to give it an edge but their lovemaking had barely begun when they were interrupted by a loud hammering on the door chester raised up on an elbow aiming a blistering stream of profanity at the door but his squires were already sitting up sleepily his mastiff was adding his belligerent bellowing to the din and the pounding persisted unabated accompanied now by demands for admittance recognizing the voice as his brothers chester jerked the bedhangings all the way open and snapped let him in his body might still be quivering with thwarted need but his brain was back in command this was trouble william de roumare looked as if hed been roused from bed too he had gone gray while still in his thirties and his tousled silver hair and ashen skin added at least a decade to his actual age one glance and chester felt a chill for will was not a man given to panic striding toward the bed roumare said hoarsely the kings men are in the town and they come not as friends randolph we are under attackor we will be at first light chester swore again with even more heat mauds eyes had widened but she said nothing clutching the sheet to her breasts as she waited to find out their fate roumare envied his brother her composure his own wife was even now having hysterics back in their bedchamber chester swung out of the bed grabbing for the tunic discarded in the floor rushes tell me what you know for sure he said pulling the tunic over his head some of our men were caught in the town one made it back to the castle and he says the streets are full of stephens soldiers those accursed townspeople let them in the city gates damn their souls stephen is vowing to see our heads up on pikes vowing that the siege will last till judgment day if need be randolphwhat shall we do god rot that misbegotten meddlesome bungling lackwit chester said savagely he is no more fit to rule than any beggar wed pluck off the streets a beaumont puppet not worth a cupful of warm piss but even as he raged his thoughts were racing ahead clearly and coldly analyzing their danger weighing their options i will need two of our best horses saddled and ready to go he said abruptly ill take padrig the welshman with me for once i reach cheshire i can send him on into wales with word for cadwaladr hell throw in with us if we make it worth his while and madog of powys may too just padrig though for two men will have a better chance of getting through their lines they must be in disarray arriving in the middle of the night and stephens captains will have no hope of imposing order till daylight if i slip out through the postern gate i ought to be able to get away unseen but it has to be done now and done fast will think you that you can hold out till i get back with aid god willing the older man said somberly but we are in a tight corner indeed even if you succeed in getting safe away from the castleand if i were a wagering man id put my money on stephenwhat then mayhap we ought to give thought to surrender id sooner walk barefoot through hells hottest flames i like it not either but think on this randolph we can always talk our way around stephen it means swallowing our pride no man ever died though from a serving of humble pie and what would it avail us to resist even if you can summon every last one of our tenants and vassals and add in cadwaladrs welsh hirelings for good measure well still not have enough men to raise stephens siege no we will not chester admitted but i know where we can get them striding over to the bed he caught maud by the shoulders claimed her mouth in a brief but passionate kiss for all our sakes girl lets hope that your kin are as fond of you as you say the feast of epiphany was celebrated with great enthusiasm for not only was it an important festival in its own right it offered one last burst of brightness in the winters dark on this twelfth night christians bade farewell to the joy and light of christmastide while bracing themselves for the bleakness of the looming lenten season of sacrifice and selfdenial gloucester castles great hall had been newly whitewashed fresh fragrant rushes laid down and enough candles and torches lit to banish all but the most tenacious shadows for maude was determined that her epiphany revelries be perfect in all particulars her cooks had prepared an elaborate feast fresh herring stewed capon savory rice a spectacular roasted peacock refitted with feathers rissoles of beef marrow pea soup lombardy custard and nut sweetmeats served with spiced red wine and hippocras and a sweet white malmsey afterward a french minstrel from the sunwarmed south sang and strummed a gittern and recited verses from a highly popular chanson the song of roland but his performance was cut short by the arrival of shocking news from the norththat the earl of chester had seized control of lincoln castle no one had any more interest in hearing of rolands epic deeds and for the remainder of the evening there was but one topic of conversation speculation about chesters duplicity and stephens likely response opinion was united on the former that chesters greed had deranged his senses and decidedly mixed on the latter some sure stephen would have to retaliate others equally certain that he would once again turn a blind eye as he had done so often in the past all were hopeful that this astonishing turn of events would somehow rebound to maudes benefit robert and amabel were furious stunned that chester would have so risked their daughters safety a woman was expected to defend her husbands castle if it was besieged in his absence but it was unheardof to use a wife as chester had done as a decoy baldwin de redvers was likewise outraged for his younger sister hawise was william de roumares wife their concern cast a pall over the festivities robert and amabel soon excused themselves intent upon dispatching a messenger to lincoln at first light bearing a demand that chester get their daughter out of that castle straightaway miles fitz walter was no longer in a festive mood either hed had a quarrel earlier that evening with his eldest son and both he and roger were still out of sorts once the fitz walters had withdrawn too there seemed no reason to linger maude dismissed the minstrels and her guests went off to bed but maude was too restless to sleep she wandered aimlessly about her chamber failed to find a book that could hold her interest and finally snatched up her mantle the great hall was already dark beds laid out where trestle tables had stood earlier in the evening maude moved quietly down the center aisle out into the inner bailey it was cold but the wind had died down and the starlit sky was clear of clouds it had snowed earlier in the week and most of it had been trampled into a dingy grey slush but white still glistened along the south wall protected by maudes garden fence maude liked snow liked the way it blurred harsh edges and hid ugliness and made the world seem new and pure and pristine pushing open the garden gate she sat down on a wooden bench her thoughts soon carried her far from gloucester and she started violently when a voice said very close at hand lady maude may i be of service maude flushed selfconsciously she hated to be caught off guard to be watched unaware but the interloper was a man she valued and she bit back a dismissive retort forcing a smile instead thank you brien but nothing is amiss i just could not sleep what about you why are you not abed at such an hour brien shrugged i could not sleep either he said and looked pleased when maude beckoned him toward her bench he smiled as he sat beside her and she found herself thinking that she liked his smile liked so much about brien fitz counthis insight and his loyalty and his competence everything he did he did well he did not intrude now upon her privacy seemed content to sit in silence until or if she chose to speak maude appreciated his reticence and soon realized that she did want to talk after all i had a letter this week from my son henry she said his own letter the first one that was not written for him by his tutor or a scribe her voice trailed off as if shed lost interest but brien knew better he studied her profile thinking that most women benefited from the more subdued softer lighting cast by candles or stars but not maude she looked her best in the bright light of day able to take the suns glare full on without flinching it troubled you this letter he asked and after a moment or so she nodded henry asked me if i was ever coming back she said and he thought he heard her sigh ive not seen my sons for more than a year brien nigh on sixteen months if this war drags on long enough ill not even know them upon my return theyll be strangers he would not trivialize her pain with facile denials or comforting banalities the truth was that shed never get back the time shed lost with her sons childhood could not be relived children grew up and a quest for a crown could last for years to be a mother and a queen too he said at last must be a burden no man could fully comprehend no man needs to understand for no man needs to bear it she said with more than a trace of bitterness what makes it so hard brien is that i see no end in sight sometimes i find myself wondering where i will be in five years will i still be at gloucester or bristol clinging to my shredded hopes whilst stephen clings to his stolen crown all i know for certes is that in five years henry will be almost thirteen i truly believe you will one day reclaim your crown he said softly and she turned to look at him with a brief bleak smile i do too she said most of the time i am not often so downhearted for i do not let myself dwell upon my disappointments or defeats but none of the christmas news has been good lord knows the tidings from cornwall have been dismal rainald is holding on to the one cornish castle he has left but stephen has the shire and rainalds prospects grow dimmer by the day he has been excommunicated by the bishop of exeter who blames him for the damage done to a launceton church and his wiferainald tries to make light of it in his letters brien but others tell me the girl was so distraught and fearful at being caught up in the fighting that her wits have been affected she weeps all the time and hears voices and cannot be left alone lest she do herself harm id heard the lass wasoverwrought brien admitted but just as those sick of body can heal so too can the sick of mind you must not give up hope lady maude i inhale hope with every breath i take maude said ruefully but lately it seems that if anything can go wrong by god it does robert is at odds with his younger son philip as i expect you know it is no secret that robert rebuked philip for being needlessly brutal during the assault upon nottingham and now he and amabel have maud to worry about too miles is another whose temper is on the raw and the same can be said for baldwin de redvers in truth everywhere i turn these days i see naught but discontented surly men and fretful wives what of ranulf he protested that lad is cheerful enough to raise all sorts of suspicions how true she conceded if ranulf were a cat id be checking his whiskers for cream they both laughed and then maude surprised herself by saying youve been a good friend brien for longer than i can remember you helped me get through the worst time of my life and i never thanked younot until now she did not need to elaborate he understood their memories were suddenly functioning as one taking them back more than thirteen years she had been twentyfive and no longer able to resist her fathers will agreeing at last to wed geoffrey of anjou on her betrothal journey from england to normandy the old king had entrusted her to the custody of his eldest son robert and his foster son brien they had carried out the kings charge escorted maude to rouen for the plight troth and the following year she and geoffrey had been wed at le mans why should you thank me i did as the king bade turned you over to geoffrey of anjou when i ought to have hidden you away where he could never have found you maude was startled you did what you could brien you made me feelwithout a word being saidthat you understood that you were on my side that may not sound like much but it was if i had it to do over again his smile held no humor just a disarming flash of selfmockery i suppose id do the same however much id like to think i would not but my regrets would be so much greater knowing as i do now how miserable hed make you i never forgave your father for that for forcing you to wed a man so unworthy of you he stopped abruptly and a tense strained silence followed which neither of them seemed able to break maude was staring at brien a man shed known all her life and seeing a stranger had she lost her wits altogether how could she have confided in him like this shed long ago learned to keep her fears private her pain secret all others at a safe distance yet here in a barren winter garden shed lowered her defenses allowing brien to get a glimpse into her very soul even worse shed seen into his soul too discovered what she ought never to have known she felt suddenly as flustered as a raw green girl she who was a widow wife and mother a woman just a month shy of her thirtyninth birthday a woman who would be queen getting hastily to her feet she drew her mantle close about her throat chilled to the bone i want to go in she said sounding curt even to her own ears brien had risen as soon as she did of course he said an awkward moment then ensued for he started to offer his arm as chivalry demanded but it was no longer a simple gesture of courtesy and they both knew it after a discernible hesitation maude let her hand rest lightly on his sleeve and they walked in silence toward the great hall she would later wish fervently that shed held her tongue but she felt compelled to prop up her diminished defenses and so as they reached the steps she said coolly you should bring your wife with you the next time you come to gloucester it has been too long since ive seen her she at once wanted to call her words back for she saw the hurt theyd inflicted his dark eyes searched her face and in them she found a mute reproach they had just shared all that they could ever have a few brief moments of unspoken intimacy cheapened now by her needless heavyhanded rebuff she understood read his thoughts as if they were her own but what he did not understand and what she could never let him know was that her pointed mention of his marriage was a reminder meant not for him but for herself my wife will be pleased to attend you madame he said tonelessly maude was mercifully spared the need to respond for a commotion had erupted up on the bailey walls shouts were echoing on the quiet night air a challenge offered and met moments later the drawbridge was going down a lone horseman coming through sliding from the saddle the rider tossed the reins to the nearest of the guards you must awaken the earl of gloucester and the empress for my news cannot wait he was young weary and disheveled but he was exhilarated too by the gravity of his mission and somewhat nervous now that his moment was at hand he sounded bellicose combative for he was anticipating a refusal but as he braced himself for a long heated argument he glanced across the bailey recognizing the woman standing upon the steps of the great hall madame thank god and his good angels unable to believe his luck he hastened forward and dropped to his knees before maude i am sir bennet de malpas my lady cousin and liegeman to my lord earl of chester i bring you his urgent appeal for aid and his pledge of fealty there was to be no more sleeping at gloucester that night rumors assailed the castle soon spilling over its bailey walls into the town the great hall was a scene of confusion and turmoil but all knew the solar was where the significant activity was occurring theyd been sequestered abovestairs for hoursmaude robert miles brien ranulf and baldwin de redversand what they decided would affect many more lives than their own within the solar there was no sympathy to spare for chester he had no friends in this room and few indeed in the rest of the realm nor did they give credence to his sudden conversion his belated recognition of the justice of maudes cause they well knew that chester would have embraced the devil himself in his hour of need but all of their foregoing feelings were irrelevant to the issue at hand they would do as chester wanted march to lincoln and confront the king they had no choice for the chance might not come again at lincoln they could catch stephen off guard force a battle that might determine once and for all who would rule englandmaude or stephen the dark had faded away the sky lightening to a shade of misty pearl for dawn was nigh by the time maude returned to her chamber minna had turned back the bed coverlets invitingly and put out a selection of sugared wafers and watereddown wine to break the nights fast but maude had no appetite nor could she sleep crossing to the window she opened the shutters staring down at the uproar below her the bailey was crowded and chaotic at first glance resembling a fairground more than a castle ward people were rushing about shouting orders and yelling out questions trying to dodge the dogs and children darting underfoot half the men in the castle were either in the stables or already in the saddle for they had levies to raise vassals to summon to arms horses and carts and supplies to requisition buy or barter time was the enemy as much as stephen and speed of the essence maude did not feel the cold not on a conscious level but then minna draped a mantle about her shoulders and she realized shed been shivering the german widow was not one for fussing or coddling maude would never have stood for it but minna could not help noticing the sleepless smudges under maudes eyes the greyish pallor of her skin my lady you look boneweary can you not spare a few hours to rest id not be able to sleep minna maude watched as miles fitz walter bade farewell to his wife sybil then mounted and joined his waiting men last night i told brien fitz count that i saw no end in sight now it may well end at lincoln might even be over by the start of lent does that not gladden you madame i ask because you do not sound glad there is too much at stake for gladness minna maude swung away from the window to face the older woman do you not understand my hopes my crown my sons legacyall are balanced upon the blade of a sword my future will be decided at lincoln but not by me i cannot even be there to watch whilst others decree my fate because the lord god saw fit to make me a woman i can do naught but wait nottinghamshire england january if winter was the enemy january was its cruelest weapon the weather was wet and raw the road a quagmire of churnedup mud the men sodden and cold and miserable they were also uneasy for warfare as they knew it was comprised of sieges and raids pitched battles such as they faced at lincoln were rare but they kept slogging ahead mile after plodding mile impelled by the sheer force of robert fitz roys will hed already done what many would have thought impossible in just a fortnight hed assembled an army formidable enough to threaten a king when he then announced that they must be at claybrook in leicestershire by january th his men laughed among themselves and made skeptical jokes about sprouting wings but they reached claybrook on that last sunday in january just as robert had determined they would and found the earl of chester waiting for them they all had the same objectives in mindthe overthrow of the king and a soldiers chance for plunderand so there should not have been friction between the two forces yet there was it was due in part to chester himself for he was not an easy ally and some of the strain inevitably trickled down through the ranks but chesters abrasive personality was only half the problem riding with his cheshire vassals and tenants was a sizable contingent of welsh mercenaries nearly seventyfive years had passed since william the bastard had led an invading army onto english shores but those sons and grandsons born after the conquest did not consider themselves english english was a word with negative connotations for it referred to a people who spoke an odd tongue and clung to odd customs a defeated people those of normanfrench descent felt vastly superior to the subjugated english and that muted their hostility they had not been as successful though in subduing the welsh the welsh were a vexing unpredictable people fiercely independent and few of roberts soldiers were willing to embrace them as allieswith one singular exception to ranulf wales was a mysterious alien land of foreboding mountains and blood feuds and celtic craziness much of the time he even forgot that he was half welsh for his mother had been dead for fifteen years and her gentle elusive spirit had faded long ago into the shadows leaving him with vague memories of a sweet smile bedtime hugs and a lingering fragrance of spring flowers all that ranulf now knew of wales hed learned from robert whose marriage to amabel had brought him the lordship of glamorgan wales robert had explained was a hodgepodge of rival realms each ruled by its own brenin or king the least significant of these kingdoms was in the south where the normans had made the greatest inroads north wales was known to the welsh as gwynedd and ruled for the past three years by a man robert respected owain gwynedd while the third kingdom was powys governed by one madog ap maredudd according to robert theirs was a rural tribal society lacking cities or castles or comforts for the welsh were hunters and herdsmen not farmers hed found them to be a volatile people equally passionate in their loves and their hates uncaring of hardship generous vengeful light of heart often fickle of purpose but always inordinately proud of their small mountainous corner of the world although robert had tried to be scrupulously fair it was clear to ranulf that welsh virtues were not those his brother would value save only what robert deemed their marvelous mad courage on those rare occasions when wales had insinuated itself into ranulfs awareness hed sometimes thought he might like to learn more about this shadowy land and its perplexing people but hed never truly expected to have such an opportunity yet suddenly here he was riding alongside his mothers countrymen up the fosse way as they headed north into nottinghamshire the sound of welsh lilting in cadence and utterly incomprehensible to his ear had begun to stir old memories long buried of a small boy listening sleepily as his mother talked wistfully of her homeland and family shed sung to him in welsh and he realized in surprise that he must have spoken her language too but all of his childhood welsh had sunk down into the bottom depths of his brain beyond salvaging and he soon discovered much to his disappointment that chesters welsh hirelings spoke little or no french their leaders did of course they were both men of importance in their own world for cadwaladr ap gruffydd was the younger brother of a king owain gwynedd and madog ap maredudd was himself a welsh king brenin of powys cadwaladr attracted more attention for he was bold by nature and not loath to speak his mind he had a ready smile a certain cocky charm but ranulf had come to mistrust charm stephen had taught him that he was wary of cadwaladr the discontented younger brother and madog ap maredudd had no interest in satisfying the curiosity of a normanfrench lordling but on their third day after departing claybrook ranulf found gwern who was goodnatured and disarmingly forthright and spoke fluent french gwern was a lean weathered soldier of middle height like ranulf but swarthy as a saracen no longer young hed cheerfully admitted to forty winters joking that it was pitiful an old man like me chasing after english rebels and when ranulf reminded him that they were the rebels hed roared with laughter obviously quite untroubled by the intricacies of english politics from gwern ranulf learned that cadwaladr and madog were linked by marriage and a shared jealousy of owain gwynedd brother and royal rival he learned that the welsh scorned the chainmail armor of the norman knight that their weapon of choice was the spear in the north and the bow in the south and that gwern hoped this war amongst the english would go on for years no offense lad but whilst youre busy killing one another youll be keeping your norman noses out of wales ranulf couldnt help laughing and was rewarded with a miracle for when gwern discovered his name he exclaimed the old kings son by god then youre angharads lad ranulf was dubious at first almost afraid to believe gwern saw his doubt and clouted him playfully on the shoulder there are no strangers in gwynedd hellfire most of us are kin of some sort and that was quite a scandal in its daythe english king and rhys ap cynans daughter nor was she a lass that any man would soon forget as shy as a fawn and just as good to look upon with hair the color of newly churned butter and a smile like a candle in the dark he saw ranulfs sudden grin and chuckled selfconsciously aye ill own up to it i was mad for the girl me and half the striplings in the conwy valley her going left quite a hole in many a welsh lads lustings ranulf laughed for now he knew that gwern was not just telling him what he wanted to hear he had indeed known angharad for shed been that rarity a welshwoman as fair as any norse maid with sunstreaked tawny hair that shed passed on to her son i know nothing of her kin he confided does she still have family inthat valley gwern was shocked by ranulfs selfconfessed ignorance for to the welsh nothing mattered more than bloodlines indeed so lad her father was long dead of course when the english king took her and mayhap just as well now poor emlyn died of a fever ten years back and math was slain in a border skirmish soon after but rhodri is hale as can beyour uncle lad and a good man he is in fact his firstborn was set upon coming with cadwaladrcadell your cousin but rhodri got wind of it in time hed buried two sons already was not about to risk a shallow english grave for cadell i called him a good man and gods truth he is but he is an unlucky one too two boys dead ere they reached manhood a wife gone to god just two years back a babe smothered in her cradle another daughter wholl never find a husbandhes borne more than his share of sorrows small blame to him for wanting to keep cadell close by the hearth ranulf was startled by the rush of sympathy he felt for this unknown uncle of his rhodri he echoed and a forgotten memory revived he was younger than my mother was he not gwern nodded vigorously if my memory serves there were two years between them he was barely thirteen at the time and none blamed him for being unable to play a mans part but he blamed himself for he was right fond of angharad wait till he hears i met her son ranulf was no longer smiling i see he said flatly so her family thought shed shamed herself by running off with the king and although he could hardly blame angharads menfolk for thinking so he resented it nonetheless on his mothers behalf gwerns dark eyes flickered in surprise the shame was not hers lad how could she be blamed when it was not her doing we welsh are fairer to our women than that ranulf stared at him are you saying my father took her against her will gwern shrugged well he did not truss her up and throw her across his saddle but neither did he ask for her yea or nay he saw that ranulf was truly shocked and added by way of comfort kings are never ones for asking though are they ranulf said nothing hed been thinking that mayhap he might bring annora into wales once they were wed and maudes england at peace again for the idea was an appealing one making a leisurely pilgrimage to this conwy valley to seek out his newfound uncle and cousins but that would have been a fools quest what reason would they have to welcome him the seed sprung from an enemys lust and after that he avoided gwern as much as possible no longer at ease with the affable welshman on the first day of february the citizens of lincoln awoke to slatecolored skies and icy rain cursing and coughing stephens soldiers grimly manned his siege machines slipping in the mud they loaded heavy stones into the mangonels sent them crashing into the castle bailey others labored upon the belfry hammering out their frustrations upon the wet wood dropping nails as they blew upon their chapped hands to ward off the cold they had not yet begun covering the tower in the vinegarsoaked hides meant to repel firearrows but unless the weather took an even nastier turn by midweek the belfry would be ready to be wheeled up to the castle wall each of its four stories would shelter men crouching within while bowmen on the top level drove the castle defenders off the wall the belfry drawbridge would then drop down onto the battlements they would scramble across and the final battle for lincoln castle would begin for stephens soldiers it could not come a day too soon especially now that rumors were sweeping the city of an approaching enemy army they wanted this accursed siege over and done with winter warfare was for most men a frigid foretaste of hell the rain slackened by noon but the sky stayed dark and foreboding stephen did not return to his lodgings at the bishop of lincolns palace until dusk it had been an awkward arrangement at first for bishop alexanders memories of the oxford ambush were still sharp enough to rankle he had not forgiven stephen for his disgrace the downfall of his uncle and cousins but once the earl of chester seized lincoln castle stephens sins began to dwindle in the bishops eyes and he was determined to do whatever he could to root out chesters evil influence from his city and his see supper was neither festive nor memorable for the bishops cooks were restricted to a saturday fish menu afterward none strayed too far from the open hearth stephen and the bishop began to play a game of chess at least that spared them the need to make polite stilted conversation waleran beaumont was in a morose mood nursing a chest cold and bored with lincoln stephen and the siege next time he vowed hed be the one to tend to beaumont interests in normandy brother robert could have the dubious pleasure of flushing out rebels from their ratholes he perked up a bit though when william de ypres suggested a game of hasard although gambling was frowned upon by the church the bishops guests knew he was too worldly to take offense and once a pair of dice was found waleran and the fleming took on the earls of york and pembroke pembrokes younger brother baldwin the earl of northampton william peverel and hugh bigod soon came over to watch bedeviling the players and making side wagers of their own there was talk of the belfry and then some speculation about the earl of chesters whereabouts for rumors had begun to circulate that he was no longer holed up in the castle by the time gilbert de gant joined the group conversation had shifted to the new servingwench at the alehouse in danesgate road few topics were of greater interest to gilbert than women especially wanton ones he was by far the youngest lord there still in his teens but for once he had other more pressing matters on his mind he wanted to discuss the rumors for he did not understand why stephen and his battle captains had given them so little credence he was hesitant though to be the one to bring the subject up for he was a battlefield virgin and these men were veterans he waited until the first game ended and while the men were summoning servants for wine and ale he drew baldwin de clare aside no matter how green or foolish his questions baldwin would not laugh for his own military experience was limited to a disastrous expedition against the welsh why is it baldwin that no one believes the report of an army being sighted in nottinghamshire why could it not be true i can give you one hundred and seventy or so reasons gilbertthe miles stretching between lincoln and bristol does it have to be the earl of gloucester what about the earl of chester mayhap he did escape no matter for cheshire is nearly as far an army on the march in the dead of winter would be lucky to cover eight miles a day then you have to allow for all the time it would take to raise an army we were able to head north so fast because stephens flemish hirelings were on hand that is what he pays them for after all but id wager it would take the earl of gloucester a month to muster up enough men when you then consider time for word of the siege to get out youve now accounted for all of january and most of february there is no way under gods sky that an enemy army could be nearing lincoln not unless robert fitz roy taught his troops to fly gilbert was very glad he hadnt asked in front of the others hed have been teased about his phantom flying army for days to come he looked so abashed that baldwin took pity on him come on lad he said lets go find ourselves some fun gilbert grinned ran to fetch his mantle hoping that baldwins idea of fun was a bawdyhouse but before they could start their search one of the bishops servants was hastening into the hall a man had just ridden in with an urgent message for the king should he be admitted stephen welcomed the interruption he was losing pushing away from the chessboard he said send him in as the man entered the hall the bishop leaned toward stephen i know him he said that is torger of hunsgate a local mercer in answer then to stephens unspoken query he nodded yes he is reliable the merchant came forward knelt before stephen i bring grievous news my liege those rumors of an armylord help us for they were true the hall was immediately in turmoil as men pushed in to hear the dice game forgotten stephen silenced them then tersely ordered torger to continue drawing a steadying breath he did i was on my way to newark for id agreed to buy some woolens and silks and could not lose the deal just because the weather was foul but i never reached newark my liege i was only halfway there when i heard sounds ahead of approaching horses and men i barely had time to get off the road and into the woods ere they came into view they did not see me and passed on by banners sodden in the rain more men than i could count mounted and on foot heading up the fosse way toward lincoln you saw their banners the mercer nodded it was the earl of chester i recognized him straightaway and the earl of gloucester i saw his banner saw his face it was robert fitz roy my liege id stake my life on it there was a flabbergasted silence how far were they from lincoln stephen asked in disbelief they are less than ten miles away my lord king torger said bleakly and spoke for them all when he added thank god that the rains have made the river and the fosse too dangerous to cross roberts men passed a nervous uncomfortable night camped just to the southwest of the city the temperature plunged and as they burrowed into their blankets in a futile search for warmth they feared they might face snow on the morrow but when candlemas sunday dawned the sky had been swept clear of clouds by a gusting northerly wind ice glazed the browned winter grass glinted ominously midst the reeds of the soggy marshland that lay between them and lincoln the city was protected by the river witham and the fossedyke an ancient canal of roman origin restored by the old king twenty years past the river was impassable running at flood tide robert hoped though to cross the fossedyke at a ford known to his scouts lincolnshire men hed sent out at first light but they were soon back with disheartening news the ford was being guarded by some of stephens men the marshes along the fossedyke were kneedeep in runoff from the storm and the canals water level was much higher than normal surging with the spillover from the rainswollen river those listening were dismayedall but robert who said calmly if we must cross this marsh then we will and that was enough for most of his men who were learning to take his word as gospel after all they reminded one another hed promised the empress that hed raise an army within a fortnight and by corpus he had hed said that theyd meet chester at claybrook on the th and they had theyd seen pig wallows less muddy than the roads of these shires and had there been any more rain theyd have needed an ark and theyd gotten enough saddle sores and blisters to last a lifetime but theyd covered more than ten miles a day and it was the earls doing so if he said theyd get through this quagmire then they would they agreed among themselves and they made haste to obey his order to break camp their optimism lasted until they saw the fenlands for themselves for the flooding was more extensive than any of them had expected robert gave them no time to reconsider and they were soon splashing through cold murky marshwater linking arms for leverage coaxing recalcitrant horses complaining that they were wetter than drowned cats swearing when the mud threatened to suck off their boots and shouting in triumph when they caught a dull grey gleam through the waisthigh rushes ahead the waters of the fossedyke ran fast and cold surging west toward the river trent on the opposite bank stephens sentries sat their horses in astonishment staring across at these wet muddied apparitions as if doubting their own senses robert and his battle captains drew rein at the canals edge trying to gauge its depth it was they agreed not as shallow as it should be but the ford must still be there else stephen would not have posted guards well robert concluded to no ones surprise there is but one way to find out but he then startled them all by saying it is only fair that i be the one to test it if i seem likely to make it across id welcome some help on the other side he added dryly and drawing his sword from its scabbard he spurred his stallion forward into the water chester was the first to react his flaws might be beyond counting as his enemies alleged but none had ever accused him of timidity what are we waiting for he challenged and charged into the fossedyke after robert ranulf and brien were quick to follow but it was the welsh prince cadwaladr who made sure that no man would dare balk come on lads he called out cheerfully in welsh lets show these pampered english that they need not fear getting their feet wet and laughing as if he relished nothing more than a winters soaking in icy waters he plunged into the fossedyke the welsh needed no further urging scrambled down the bank and splashed into the canal after that they all had to cross over even those who most feared drowning for they could not let themselves be shamed by these misbegotten welsh churls and they waded into the fossedyke shivering and cursing at the first shock of frigid water on their legs fortunately the stormfed current was still not too deep at the ford and by the time they reached the opposite shore there was no need to fumble for weapons stephens vastly outnumbered guards were already in retreat fleeing with a frantic warning for stephen that the enemy would soon be at the city gates february nd was a holy day of special significance the feast of the purification of the blessed virgin mary commonly known as candlemas stephen heard mass in the great cathedral of st mary and dozens of anxious citizens crowded into the church to hear the bishop celebrate the eucharist and to study the king for clues for some indication as to what he meant to do they already knew he was being advised to withdraw to leave behind enough men to hold lincoln until he could return with a larger army that rumor had raced through the city faster than any fire and just as frightening for the men and women of lincoln would feel safe only as long as stephen was personally taking charge of their defense it was not surprising therefore that they reacted with such alarm when stephens candle suddenly snapped in half as he held it out to the bishop a simple mishapor a sinister portent judging from the murmuring he heard sweeping the church stephen well knew which explanation seemed more likely to the congregation during the remainder of the mass he could not keep his thoughts upon the almighty as he ought distracted by his anger and his disappointment for if they were so sure that a broken candle was an ill omen their faith in his kingship must be wavering once the mass was done stephen headed toward the transept door leading out into the cloister garth waving his companions away when they started to follow he was given only a brief respite though only a few moments of quiet and solitude for waleran soon grew impatient and barged out into the cloisters after him with the earls of northampton and york close behind we need to talk my liege waleran insisted for weve settled nothing as i told you last night we ought not to let them force us into any rash action wed be foolish to take the field without enough men to make sure victory would be ours stephen had heard all this before until the early hours of the morning and as i told you waleran he said testily i will not run from rebels stay here in lincoln then but call up the shire levies let us summon our own vassals waleran broke off in exasperation for stephen was no longer listening turning to find out why he saw william de ypres striding up the walkway toward them ypres had scandalized the bishop by missing the candlemas mass instead riding off to judge for himself the immediacy of the danger posed by robert fitz roys army one look at his face now was enough to warn them that theyd not like what they were about to hear if youre all still debating what to do ypres said grimly i can make it easy for you were running out of choices for weve run out of time that flooded quagmire everyone was so sure could not be crossed well someone neglected to tell robert fitz roy it was impassable there were exclamations at that for by now all of stephens battle commanders were crowding into the cloister garth along with the bishop and more and more of the towns apprehensive citizens but stephen ignored their clamoring so they got across the marshes he said not botheringas some of the others werewith futile denials it mattered little if every living soul in christendom would have sworn it could not be done if william de ypres said it was so stephen did not doubt him and the fossedyke he asked although he was already anticipating what the fleming would say they crossed at the ford whilst your guards fled like women by the time i got there they were lighting fires to thaw themselves out what they do next depends upon you my liegewhether you come out to give battle or force them to besiege the city are we outnumbered as far as i could tell but not by much and you have the more seasoned soldiers under your command the welsh are worthless on the field will break and run at their first chance as for the cheshiremenwho knows what theyll do when put to the test if you are asking me my liege if we can win id say you can but im no soothsayer cannot promise you victory just so waleran said emphatically why should we risk defeat when there are other roads still open to us i say we hold fast within the town then send for an army that can give us certain victory it makes no sense to take the field unless we can be sure of the outcome and for that we will need more than gods favor and the good wishes of the townspeople the bishop was highly indignant my lord earl of worcester you blaspheme he said hotly for what power can be greater than gods favor waleran could see the bishop was ready to launch into a lengthy lecture and he sought to head it off with a brusque admission that he had misspoken but he was too late the damage already done for stephen was glaring at him accusingly do you think i fear gods judgment stephen demanded those men are rebels in arms against their lawful king how could the almighty ever give them victory no i will not shrink from this battle better to make an end to this here and now we have right on our side and i am willing to prove it upon the field ill not cower behind these walls whilst traitors and renegades threaten the peace of my realm we will fight and we will win so sure was robert that stephen would come out to confront them that as soon as his men were dried off he set about assembling them in battle array this sparked an argument with the earl of chester who insisted that he should have the honour of striking the first blow the quarrel being his but robert pointed out that maudes grievance was greater and he prevailed roberts battle tactics held no surprises for he was a highly capable commander but not an innovative one and he chose the traditional formation two lines of horsemen flanking the center which would fight on foot the left wing or vanguard would lead the first assault and for that crucial offensive robert shrewdly chose those men whod had their lands confiscated by stephen men like baldwin de redvers and william fitz alan men with nothing to lose these knights the disinherited would fight under the most formidable of roberts battle captains miles fitz walter chester was to have command of the center and robert himself took the right wing while the welsh were positioned out in front of his mounted knights robert then made the commanders customary speech to his troops reviling the enemy and predicting victory for their cause was just a prayer was said and a priest called upon the almighty to bless their efforts with success by then stephens army had already ridden out through the citys west gate aligning his men along the slope that extended from the town wall down to the fossedyke stephen thus began with a tactical advantage for the enemy would have to charge uphill stephen chose to command his center entrusting his left wing to william de ypres and the earl of york whod earned his earldom by defeating the scots king so decisively at the battle in yorkshire two summers ago his right wing was like roberts a division of mounted knights leadership shared among the earls of worcester pembroke surrey northampton and richmond and hugh bigod for none of those prideful lords were willing to defer to the others because stephens voice was softly pitched and did not carry well young baldwin de clare was chosen to speak to the troops on the kings behalf and pleased by the honour he began zestfully ridiculing their enemies promising both victory and retribution but his spirited oration was cut off in midflow by the blaring of trumpets not willing to wait any longer the other army was moving to the attack ranulf had asked to fight under roberts command never had he been so proud of his brother as in the weeks of this campaign robert did not have a flamboyant bone in his body he weighed his words and pondered his actions and in both speech and manner showed all the elan and flair of a sedate scholarly clerk even when hed plunged into the fossedyke hed made it seem perfectly natural and not particularly heroic ranulf loved his brother dearly knew him to be a man of honour but until now hed not appreciated just what robert could accomplish in his quiet understated way he yearned to tell robert of his newfound admiration but of course he could not for that would have embarrassed them both instead he said a special prayer for roberts safety and then reined in his stallion at roberts side so they could watch together the beginning of the battle ranulf had never fought in a pitched battle between equal forces his experiences of warfare limited to geoffreys skirmishings in normandy and raids upon worcester and nottingham with robert and miles he was by turns excited apprehensive fearful and eager and as he glanced over his shoulder he saw those same contradictory emotions chasing across the faces of his friends gilbert urged his mount forward to ask ranulf think you that ancel is with stephens army i hope not ranulf said but he did hope gervase fitz clement was fighting with stephen and god forgive him but he hoped too that when the dead were counted at days end annoras husband would be amongst them he was too ashamed to admit it and felt a superstitious pang of unease for what goes around comes around and evil rebounds upon the wisher he could not help himself though for the thought persisted how much easier it would be if annora were widowed on this candlemas sunday miles signaled and his trumpets blasted again the horses lengthened stride up on the hillside stephens vanguard began a slow advance upon the enemy the wind unfurled their banners waleran and hugh bigod were in the forefront they had lowered their lances preparing to joust in the french fashion a formalized fighting that knights favored for it looked dashing and chivalrous and rarely resulted in fatalities but the disinherited were not interested in tournamentstyle tilting they wanted victory and vengeance and blood and they spurred their stallions forward with wild yells eager to sheathe their swords in enemy flesh slamming into stephens knights with enough force to send horses back on their haunches lances were useless in close quarters and were hastily flung aside as men struggled to draw their swords to defend themselves against this murderous onslaught the disinherited knights bore in with savage singlemindedness not seeking to take prisoners or collect ransoms just to slay as many of their foes as they could and stephens astonished earls found themselves fighting for their lives it was not a fair match men with nothing to lose against those with little to gain and it was over with shocking abruptness as miles charged at a knight on a bay destrier the horse shied away and when it bolted the rider let it go and as suddenly as that stephens vanguard broke and ran the earls made no attempt to halt the flight instead they joined it and within moments the muddy slope was emptied of all but dropped weapons and sprawling bodies as both armies looked on in amazement stephens men spurred their horses away from the field racing toward the north with the disinherited in triumphant pursuit stephen was stunned four of the five fugitive earls owed their earldoms to him he could not believe theyd betray his trust like this kept watching for them to rally their men and return to the field but they were not coming back waleran and northampton and surrey men of proven courage fleeing like cravens abandoning their king all around him he saw dismayed and distraught faces baldwin de clare flushed with shame on his brother pembrokes behalf gilbert de gant waxwhite and wideeyed looking much too young to die on this candlemas battlefield william peverel whose loyalty stephen had once doubted and the citizens of lincoln who had as much to lose as stephen did he read the fear in their eyes and said reassuringly the battle is not over yet swinging about toward the distant forces of his left wing he signaled them to the attack ranulfs ears were ringing for men were shouting and cheering as if they were spectators at a rousing game of campball he was just as jubilant but he also felt a small unwelcome pinch of sympathy for stephen deserted by the very men whom he had most reason to trust and then the shouting changed and he soon saw why for stephens left wing was in motion galloping straight toward them ranulf unsheathed his sword looked to robert for guidance but between them and william de ypress oncoming knights were the welsh they were so poorly armed that ranulf winced as they ran to meet the attack and felt a sudden flare of anger at chester and robert for putting them in a position of such peril he wore a chainmail hauberk that protected him from neck to knees and a steel helmet with nose guard the welsh had padded leather tunics legs and arms bared to enemy blows small shields and spears to deflect sword thrusts if he feared for them though they did not seem to fear for themselves charging forward with the same beguiling mad bravado that had sent them splashing into the icy waters of the fossedyke what happened next was horrifying to ranulf for william de ypres and the earl of york and their men rode the welsh down it looked like a slaughter swords flashing and bodies going under the flailing hooves men crying out to god in three tongues welsh french and flemish but as the knights and flemings raced on many of the downed welsh were stumbling to their feet apparently neither mortally hurt nor much disheartened for instead of fleeing the field like stephens defeated vanguard some of them heeded cadwaladr and madog ap maredudd and sprinted toward the earl of chesters windwhipped banner it did not occur to ranulf to wonder why he was so concerned about the safety of these alien welsh mercenaries he had time only for a heartfelt hope that gwern was among those hastening to join chesters center not one of the bodies trampled underfoot by those battlemaddened warhorses and then ypres and york and their flemings were upon them it was ranulfs first encounter with handtohand combat and it changed forever his view of war as a gallant glorious adventure this was an ugly desperate deadly brawl a drunken alehouse freeforall except that he faced swords not fists with far more to fear than bruises or a bloodied nose hed been trained in the use of weapons knew how to dodge and parry blows and keep his shield close against his unprotected left side but so did the enemy almost at once he found himself crossing swords with a yelling youth in bloodied armor welsh blood ranulf thought and jerked back just in time as the blade slashed past his ear the fleming had mottled skin a brightyellow beard his mouth was contorted his breath coming in grunts as he moved in to strike again their shields thudded together and for a moment of odd intimacy they were near enough to see into each others eyes his enemys were green ranulf would remember those eyes and that face for this was to be the first man he ever killed the fleming looked shocked as ranulfs sword thrust through his mail up under his ribs ranulf was shocked too he wrenched his sword free blade dark with blood and found that he could not swallow had not even enough saliva to spit hed noticed before the battle that many soldiers carried small flasks or wineskins on their belts had not understood the significance he did now men who went too often into battle had more need of wine than any drunkard some knights had gone down for there were riderless horses milling about on the field terrified without the familiar feel of their riders upon their backs yet still hovering near the fighting like horses whod balk at leaving their stalls even if the stable were in flames ranulf thought and then decided he must be going mad else why be thinking of stable fires in the midst of armageddon he had another clash with an enemy knight inconclusive but not unsatisfactory for they both survived it he had just two objectivesstaying alive and finding robertand when he did spot his brother it was as hed feared robert was being hard pressed on all sides a tempting target for any man hoping to curry favor with stephen ranulf began to fight his way over but he was still yards from his brother when a knight on a lathered black stallion careened into him knocking his horse to its knees the knight rose in his stirrups sword poised to strike and ranulf swung his shield up to deflect the blow the impact rocked him back in the saddle and suddenly his shield was gone the strap breaking as his stallion lurched to its feet by then the other knight was attacking again and this time his swords tip caught and tore away metal rings from ranulfs hauberk pain seared down ranulfs arm he ducked low in the saddle as the followthrough whizzed over his head but the tide of battle shifted then swept his foe away and he turned again to look for robert roberts danger was even greater now hed been unhorsed was struggling to protect himself from three determined opponents one on horseback two on foot hed not been forsaken by his household knights but they were in trouble themselves for william de ypres knew how devastating roberts death or capture would be and his flemings were jostling and cursing one another in their eagerness to get to the earl of gloucester ranulf put his horse into a hard gallop and the game animal plunged forward crashing into the flemings walling his brother in he had no clear memory of the next moments a blur of clashing swords and grappling bodies his stallion teeth bared like a huge savage dog raked open the neck of a screaming bay destrier and then they were sliding in the mud going down and as ranulf hit the ground the truth hit him too that they were losing the earl of chesters trumpets sounded his banner took the wind and his men began advancing up the muddy hillside toward the royal standard of the english king the whole of the battlefield was open to view for the few trees growing upon the slope had been stripped of all obscuring leaves were now barren winter skeletons rising against the pale february sky they had not covered much ground before it became apparent to them all that their right wing was laboring and might not be able to hold chester called for a halt he prided himself upon making decisions that were swift and spontaneous that came from the gut and he knew at once what he must do he had the blackest eyes brien fitz count had ever seen and as his imagination caught fire they glowed like smoldering coals stephen can wait he said if we do not come to gloucesters aid that accursed flemish whoreson might well prevail but if we join the fray we can trap his men between us and his flemings will scatter to the winds intent only upon saving their own skins stephen does not pay them enough to die for him now does he then we can turn upon stephen at our ease gaining so great a victory that men will be talking of nothing else for years to come brien glanced back at that seething mass of men and horses his every instinct urging him to go to the rescue of their beleaguered right wing how could he do nothing whilst robert went down to defeat and mayhap death robert who was his friend and maudes brother but what if stephen then attacks us from behind we could be the ones entrapped not ypres hell not have the chance for even now miles fitz walter must be on his way back to the field chesters teeth flashed white in his dark face in a wolfish avid smile that could already taste victory that devils whelp and i loathe each other its no secret ive vowed to outlive him if only for the pleasure of pissing on his grave but fitz walter is still the man id want at my back sword in hand be it on the battlefield or in an alley of the southwark stews he said and gave a loud ringing laugh hell keep stephen too busy to spare even a thought for us on that i would wager my castle at lincoln my lustful little wife and indeed my hopes for salvation and life everlasting youll be wagering your earthly life too and mine and the lives of every man fighting under our banners brien warned but that did not faze chester in the least he was already turning away beginning to shout orders victory was at hand william de ypres had fought in enough battles to read the signs the faces of his enemies showed fatigue and fear and a despairing recognition of their own defeat theyd not yet lost the will to fight but slowly inexorably they were giving ground being pushed back toward the cold grey waters of the fossedyke the wind gave a muted warning carrying ahead the sounds of shouting thudding feet echoes of a trumpet fanfare the flemings paid no heed caught up in the frenzy of the battle ypres was one of the few who did cursing in flemish he swung his stallion about tried frantically to alert his men to this new danger but it was too late chesters soldiers were almost upon them the fighting was brutal but brief roberts knights surged back with renewed vigor chesters men were eager to rout the hated flemings so they could seek the battles real prizethe kingand ypress soldiers finding themselves outnumbered and overwhelmed soon reached chesters cynical conclusion that stephen was not paying them enough to die for him first one and then another wheeled his horse and then they were all in flight across the field away from the fighting william de ypres and the earl of york attempted at first to rally them saw the futility in it and they too fled for once the earl of chester got all the accolades he felt he deserved and he found acclaim was especially sweet when it came from men who detested him shoving his way through to his fatherinlaws side he thrust a wineskin at robert waited impatiently as the older man drank in gulps were not done yet he said and looked about at roberts bleeding battered knights and his own gleeful cheshiremen but bear in mind he warned that the king is mine as soon as chesters center halted its advance stephen guessed what the rebel earl meant to do and he immediately gave the order to attack his men started down the slope swords drawn but by then miles fitz walter had halted the pursuit of stephens runaway earls rounded up most of his own men and headed back toward the battlefield they arrived onto a scene of utter chaos at first glance it looked as if their center was attacking their right wing and a few of the disinherited briefly suspected it might indeed be so for it was generally agreed that the earl of chester would doublecross the devil on a good day miles needed just one look though to comprehend what had happened in his absence seek out the king he commanded and his knights charged over the crest of the hill stephens soldiers scattered as the disinherited rode into their midst but they did not lose heart and quickly rallied to stephens side miles had the advantage of surprise but they had the greater numbers and some of the fiercest fighting of the battle now took place stephen more than held his own and when he caught a glimpse of baldwin de redvers he lunged forward like a man possessed for at last his enemy had a familiar face after months and months of combating rumors and suspicions and smoke he now had a fleshandblood foe before him a rebel baron who could answer for his treachery as maude could not sword in hand but he never reached redvers gilbert de gant was running toward him the boy had been keeping closer than stephens own shadow and hed tried to watch over the lad when he could knowing this was gilberts first battle now he was shouting and pointing but the noise was too great and stephen could barely hear him fleeing the field the youngster darted forward in his agitation forgetting to keep his sword up a knight on a bloodstreaked stallion saw and bore down on the boy stephen shouted a warning that gilbert couldnt hear but at the last moment he sensed danger spun around too fast and stumbled falling into the path of the oncoming stallion the knight was quite willing to run him down but the horse was not the stallion swerved and by the time the knight circled back stephen was there facing now a far more formidable adversary than gilbert the man veered off in search of easier quarry yanking gilbert to his feet stephen brushed aside his stuttered thanks christ lad keep your guard up if you hope to make old bones gilbert gulped and nodded and then remembered the flemingsthey are running away stephen had been shocked by the flight of his earls but he took william de ypress defection even harder for hed come to trust the fleming convincing himself that ypres was more than a wellpaid hireling that he truly cared who was king in a land not his own he kept insisting that ypres would be coming back that hed rally his flemings and return to the fight but ypres was long gone and stephen found himself alone on a cold muddy battlefield with the knights of his household and the scared citizens of lincoln abandoned by his own barons and his most trusted captains surrounded by the enemy men in rebellion against a consecrated king they were being assailed now on three sides and retreated slowly up the hill but once they reached stephens royal standard he looked up at the golden lions on a field of crimson and refused to go any farther they pleaded with him to seek safety within the city for the battle had been fought within sight of its walls stephen was deaf to their urgings and at last baldwin de clare cried out in anguish my liege do you not understand we are beaten i know stephen said that is why you must save yourselves now go and go quickly whilst you still can they looked at him and then one by one they took up position around his standard shoulder to shoulder as they braced themselves for the final assault tears stung stephens eyes for they did not ask if his quarrel was good or his cause was just he was their king and that was enough their steadfast loyalty made it easier to bear the dreadful realization that hed been abandoned too by almighty god judged as a king and found wanting not deserving of victory the last moments of the battle of lincoln were the bloodiest encircled by the enemy stephen and his men fought off one attack after another but his foes kept coming back until stephen found himself shielded by the bodies of those whod fallen his sword was bloody to the hilt so was his chain mail even his beard when he saw william peverel go down he lashed out at peverels assailant with such force that his blade snapped against the mans shield almost at once one of the townsmen thrust a danish axe into his hands and it too was soon sticky with blood hed taken blows and beneath his hauberk his body was already darkening with massive bruises and contusions and he was soaked in sweat as if it were a day in summer he was so exhausted that hed begun to feel drunk the air itself was pressing him down and he moved like a man walking through water his throat had closed up his head was throbbing and when he brought his battleaxe down upon a mans shoulder it seemed to descend in slow motion to take days to slice through chain mail to the flesh and bone beneath but through it all he could still see his golden lions streaming above his head gilded by the sun the royal arms of england baldwin de clare was no longer at his side and gilbert de gant was gone too he reeled back panting against the pole of his standard intent only upon wielding his axe as long as his arms had the strength to lift it but then he saw a familiar face and the fatigue fogging his brain receded enough for him to cry hoarsely ranulf he did not trust his own senses anymore but surely ranulf was real almost close enough to touch looking so stricken and so young like gilbert de gant who might be dead name of god stephen surrender i beg you stephen looked at his cousin poor lad but with no breath to speak no time to explain why he could not do what ranulf wanted he shook his head and his vision blurred briefly he nearly dropped the axe and a shadow lunged at him when he swung the axe up again he saw that his enemies had backed off and ranulf was shouting like a madman at a knight sprawled at his feet his sword leveled at the mans throat my liege this was a voice he knew lowpitched and quiet the way hed heard men speak soothingly to skittish horses a man was coming toward him across the muddy trampled ground there were gasps when he sheathed his sword moved within range of that deadly danish axe my liege youve nothing left to prove he said coaxingly you can surrender with honour get away brien stephen warned and as their eyes met the younger man reluctantly took a few backward steps stephens next breath was ragged and uneven but relieved hed have hated to split briens head open with his twohanded axe it occurred to him that they need only wait him out stand back and watch until he toppled over like a felled tree too weak to keep on his feet and then something was happening voices rose there was sudden movement and men were scrambling to get out of the way as a horse was reined in scant yards from the royal standard stephen felt no surprise hed hunted with chester often enough to know that the earl was always in at the kill chester was in no hurry this was a pleasure to be savored for what seemed like forever to those watching he regarded his foe brought to bay under his own standard like a fox run to earth not so kingly now by christ swinging from the saddle he put his hand on his sword hilt you can yield he said or you can die the choice is yours yield to you stephens voice cracked for he had to force words up from a throat raw and parched never he said and then his bruised swollen mouth twisted into a smile for god had not utterly forsaken him after all chester smiled too so be it he said and then his sword was clearing its scabbard and ranulf flung himself forward too late he never even reached chester shoved aside by several of the earls men by the time ranulf regained his feet chester was stalking stephen the steel of his blade glinting in the sun he was grinning looked to ranulf as if he were truly enjoying himself he feinted toward stephens left then spun away and came in again fast in a low lethal lunge and stephen brought his battleaxe crashing down upon chesters helmet the blow had the last of stephens strength behind it and chester went facedown into the mud did not move again the blow had broken stephens axe the wooden haft splintering away from the blade stephen did not seem to have noticed yet for he was still staring down at chesters body so were most of the men and ranulf was not the only one to feel disappointment when the earl moaned and then someonea number of men later claimed credit and ranulf never knew which one spoke truesnatched up a large heavy rock and hurled it at stephens head it knocked his helmet askew drove him to his knees and a knight named william de cahaignes one of roberts vassals then threw himself upon stephen shouting ive got the king cahaignes kept yelling that over and over ive got the king but as he wrenched off stephens dented helmet stephen somehow broke free and staggered to his feet his head was so badly gashed that he was blinded by his own blood and he was too dazed to draw his dagger the only weapon he had left yet when cahaignes sought to grab him again he knocked the other mans arm away no he said ill not yield to you only to gloucester ranulf whirled to seek robert only to halt afraid to leave stephen alone and defenseless but then the soldiers crowding around them began to move aside to let a horseman pass through stephen was swaying willing himself to stand erect even as the ground quaked under his feet he watched as maudes brother dismounted and for a moment they faced each other on the crest of the hill in the shadow of stephens royal standard are you willing to yield robert asked and stephen started to nod but that slight movement caused him so much pain that he gave an audible involuntary grunt yes he said but then he fumbled at his empty scabbard with the puzzled frown of a man just awakening from an unpleasant dream only ranulf understood pushing his way toward stephen he held out his sword there were cries of protest and alarm at that but by now robert too understood and he raised his hand for silence stephen swayed again then took several unsteady steps forward offering the weapon to robert hilt first very deliberately for he knew how it must be done he surrendered to his victorious foe with his cousins borrowed sword and the battle of lincoln was over lincoln castle england february more than men had died at lincoln it seemed to stephen that reality was a casualty too for nothing made sense anymore what was he doing here in the solar of lincoln castle bleeding all over the earl of chesters wife im sorry he said but maud was quite unfazed by the blood splattering her bodice a good reason to get a new gown she said cheerfully continuing to daub at his gashed forehead with a wet cloth i think it is clean enough to bandage now but a doctor ought to tend to it as soon as possible thank you he said politely although he knew his were wounds no doctor could hope to heal he had claimed a crown been consecrated with the sacred chrism that set him forever apart from other men for a king was gods anointed on earth he had believed in his right so why then had he lost had his kingship been counterfeit from the very beginning had he wronged maude and sinned against the almighty by thwarting his divine will all done maud murmured stepping back to inspect her handiwork not only had her bandage stanched stephens bleeding but she thought it looked rather rakish too reaching for a flagon she poured stephen wine relishing the incongruity of it that she should be treating him as an esteemed guest when her husband would have cast him into the castles darkest dungeon but he was not here to object and so she was taking a perverse pleasure in honouring his enemyuntil it stopped being a game until she noticed that stephen had not touched the wine that his blue eyes were blind and his hands clenched upon the arms of his chair as if it were all he had left to hold on to ill be back she hesitated not knowing what to call him for etiquette was conspicuously silent upon the subject of captive kings she settled upon cousin stephen before giving him the only comfort she could at that moment privacy crossing the solar she joined stephens gaoler in the window seat and answered his unspoken query with a sigh he is in pain she said softly and ranulf frowned a city the size of lincoln must have at least one damned doctor why is it taking so long to fetch him hell be here soon maud said soothingly and was unable to resist adding a playful uncle for it amused her enormously that she should have an uncle so close in years to her own age but in all honesty i doubt that a doctor can ease what ails him ranulf i know he conceded quietly nothing leaves so bitter an aftertaste as betrayal not even wormwood and gall he shook his head still shocked by the flight of stephens earls for hed been taught that men of high birth were more courageous more steadfast and honourable than the rest of mankind ah but you should have seen him maud men were flinging themselves at him without pause for all the world as if he were a castle under siege and he kept beating them back wielding his axe like a scythe ranulfs admiring account of stephens defiance went no further for hed just remembered that mauds husband was amongst those mowed down by that danish axe of stephens upon their arrival at the castle hed informed maud and chesters brother of his injury assuring them that he was not badly hurt william de roumare had rushed off to see for himself leaving maud to tend to their royal prisoner if she was fretting about her husbands health she hid it well and when ranulf now provided additional details she listened with a faint enigmatic smile and by the time robert bade me to get stephen safely into the castle he concluded the earl was already regaining his senses hes like to have a godawful headache in days to come but he was indeed lucky for if stephens axe haft had not broken his helmet might not have saved him thank god for that hard head of his ranulf grinned but he could not help hoping that annora would not be so nonchalant should he ever be hit on the head with a battleaxe he started to tease maud about her unwifely insouciance but she was twisting around on the seat fumbling with the shutter i thought so she cried triumphantly it is my father robert had ridden in through the postern gate in the west wall bypassing the town just as ranulf and stephen had done he was dismounting in the bailey when his daughter shot through the doorway of the keep flew down the stairs and into his arms robert hugged her tightly of all his children this one was his secret favorite for mauds cheeky blithe spirit never failed to stir up memories of a young amabel you were not harmed lass indeed not papa in truth i was not even scared she confided and it was not bravado for shed known stephen would have seen to her safety had the castle fallen to him id wager she even enjoyed herself a new voice now chimed in and maud turned to grin at her elder brother will then stuck out her tongue as if she were still his pesky little sister and not an earls wife we will be departing on the morrow robert said and i want you to come back with us maud your mother will not believe you are truly safe and well until she sees you with her own eyes of course ill come back with you do you think id miss being there when aunt maude learns that weve won maud sounded so excited that robert smiled he knew that even among those whod become disillusioned with stephens rule the news of the battle of lincoln would be greeted with ambivalence with both expectation and unease but at least one of his sisters subjects had no doubts whatsoever maudes niece and namesake was utterly delighted that her aunt wasat long lastto be englands queen this was the first time that theyd been alone since the battle ranulf hesitated then rose and crossed the chamber to stephens side can i get you anything he asked sounding as awkward as he felt hed not expected this to be caught up in a treacherous tide of memory and regrets hed not expected to feel stephens pain as if it were his own stephen did you hear me stephen jerked at ranulfs touch looked up at his cousin with clouded eyes making an obvious effort he focused upon the dried blood caking the sleeve of ranulfs hauberk youre hurt lad ranulf shrugged a scratch although i hope itll leave a scar i can brag about his humor was forced for he did not know what to say wanting to offer stephen comfort realizing there was none he opened his mouth to reassure stephen that his life was in no danger only to stop defeated what solace could stephen derive from the promise of a lifetimes confinement for how could they ever let him go ranulf was still groping for words when the door opened and robert entered followed by maud her brother will and brien fitz count stephen started to get to his feet only to discover that his abused muscles were cramped and constricted beginning to stiffen robert saw his involuntary grimace and waved him back into his chair seating himself on the other side of the table i am sorry it is taking so long to find you a doctor he began but stephen was indifferent to his own injuries i ask nothing for myself he said but i do for my wife and children have i your word robert that theyll not suffer for any sins of mine roberts response was as prompt as it was predictable of course he said no harm will come to them i promise you nor need you worry about your sons right to inherit the county of boulogne since that is matildas legacy matildas legacy that was all eustace had left now for his paternal legacy was to have been englands crown nothing in stephens past had prepared him for this moment for hed been born with an infinitely deep reservoir of hope and hed never before experienced the sort of suffocating dark despair that engulfed him now it was more frightening even than the final moments of the battle for war he knew but desperation was an alien emotion to him he could not give in to it though not here not before these men grabbing for his forgotten wine cup he drained it in several deep swallows and then raised his head defiantly they were watching him intently but he did not find in their faces what hed dreadedmockery or jesu forfend pity what of baldwin de clare he asked huskily william peverel and the lad gilbert de gant what befell them baldwin de clare suffered some grievous wounds peverel that i know not but ill find out for you the gant stripling was lucky for his injuries are trifling and the townspeople stephen made himself ask although he already knew what robert would say there will be looting robert said matteroffactly it is a soldiers right and we cannot cheat them of it ive not been into the city yet but i heard that many of the townsmen fled to the wharves and sought to escape on the river they panicked and overloaded the boats which quickly sank in those floodtide currents i was told that hundreds may have drowned christ pity them stephen said softly hed failed them too these wretched citizens of lincoln whose only sin was believing he could protect them he slumped back in the seat shading his face with his hand how many others were going to suffer for his mistakes the door whipped back banging into the wall with such force that they all jumped the earl of chesters head was swathed in a wide white bandage and his face was drawn and pinched his skin ashen but his dark eyes were smoldering reflecting enough rage to prevail over any bodily infirmities even those inflicted by a danish axe his gaze flicked from stephens face to his bandage down to his wine cup back to his face again how very civilized he said acidly the victors sitting around and sharing wine with the vanquished striding forward into the chamber he gave ranulf a derisory glance in passing forget whose side you were fighting on did you boy ranulf bristled but robert was close enough to put a calming hand on his arm and he quieted stephen pushed away from the table got slowly to his feet as maud moved between them favoring her husband with her most solicitous smile you look dreadful love and must feel even worse after all youve been through this day why not go up to our bedchamber and get yourself some wellearned rest ill fetch a potion for your head and i do not need to be coddled im neither enfeebled nor infirm and if i wanted a potion woman id damned well say so maud was accustomed to her husbands temper tantrums but she did not like being reviled in front of her father and stephen and she snapped back next time you nearly get your head split open i will not even mention it i promise i did not get my head split open i took a glancing blow and a paltry one at that enough of this foolishness robert said testily and ranulf joined in with an unsolicited sardonic comment about chesters helmet flattened out like a shrove tuesday pancake but it was stephen who put an abrupt halt to chesters marital quarrel do not blame your wife because you could not best me on the field the failure was yours not hers he said with such scorn that chesters face flamed and his hand clenched on the hilt of his sword youre an even bigger fool than i suspected chester said scathingly you ceased being a threat to the lady maude several hours ago now you are merely an inconvenience and i daresay im not the only one thinking it a pity that you were not slain on the field but even a minor battle wound can prove fatal afterwardif need be id bear that in mind if i were you stephen felt no fear for at that moment the prospect of living with defeat and disgrace was more daunting to him than death youll have to rely upon your welsh hirelings for the killing he jeered since you proved that you are not man enough to do it yourself you are a dead man i swear it no by god he is not roberts hand had dropped to his own sword hilt only amabel and maude knew him better than those in this solar but none of them had ever seen him so outraged or even thought him capable of such fury this man is my prisoner not yours whatever our differences he is still a consecrated king and were he but a cotters son hed deserve our respect for the courage he showed on the battlefield this day do not threaten him again chester glared at robert but his fatherinlaw was one of the few men he could not intimidate and he knew it so be it he said grudgingly but if we would hang a man for stealing a loaf of bread why should we honour him for being ambitious enough to steal a crown youd do well to think on that for id wager the lady maude sees it as i do he did not wait for a response shoved past his brother who was just entering the solar and stalked out in disgust his brother caught up with him at the bottom of the stairs trailed him out into the bailey asking questions chester did not want to answer he was still seething and his head was throbbing so wildly now that he felt queasy the bailey was fast filling with men wounded in need of treatment prisoners to be confined until they could ransom themselves soldiers in search of food and ale castle servants sent out to retrieve bodies and round up stray horses chesters brother had been waylaid by an irate baldwin de redvers who was berating him loudly for using his sister as bait for their trap william de roumare was shouting back reminding baldwin that hawise was his wife and he had the right to use her as he saw fit chester paid them no heed and as men glanced his way they prudently cleared a path for him hed almost reached the great hall when he heard his name called out he turned as the welsh prince cadwaladr reined in beside him why do you look so sour i know english customs can be right peculiar the welshman gibed but surely you do celebrate your victories you won the day for us so why are you not reaping your reward why not indeed chesters eyes had narrowed he looked past cadwaladr toward the east gate and the town these accursed lincoln churls had defied his authority sent for stephen and joined in his siege of the castle you are right cadwaladr he said grimly this town owes me a debt and now is as good a time as any to collect it from the twelfthcentury norman chronicle of the monk orderic vitalis the earl of chester and his victorious comrades entered the city and pillaged every quarter of it like barbarians as for the citizens who remained they butchered like cattle all whom they found and could lay hands upon putting them to death in various ways without the slightest pity the wind carried into the castle hall the sound of bells for gloucesters churches were chiming compline maude raised her head listening until the echoes faded away she had a book open upon her lap but she could not focus her thoughts on its pages this february friday night seemed endless to her as had each of the nights in the past month during the daylight hours she could keep busy enough to ignore her inner voices but they grew louder and more insistent as soon as the sky started to darken had they reached lincoln yet the wretched roads and winter rain were sure to have slowed them down and once they got there what if stephen refused to do battle if they had to besiege lincoln it could drag on for weeks even months how would she ever be able to endure the suspense without going as mad as rainalds poor wife the hall was the heart of every great household but at gloucester castle it was beating with a sluggish uneven rhythm these days maudes servants and retainers had been infected with her unease and the other women had just as much at stake as she did for they were wives who might become widows if fortune favored stephen and severallike amabel and sybil fitz walterhad sons at risk too there had been a brief respite earlier in the week when amabel arranged a surprise celebration for maudes birthday but tonight the mood was somber maude wasnt the only one finding it difficult to concentrate upon mundane chores or idle pastimes and when adelise de redvers pricked her finger and bled onto her embroidery her outburst did not seem odd or excessive to the other women for they understood her need to swear and fling cushions about ranulfs dyrehunds had been dozing by the hearth they jumped up suddenly and dashed for the opening door nearly knocking down drogo de polwheile maudes chamberlain he sidestepped just in time and as they plunged past him he hastened toward maude my lady your brother has ridden in rainald but i thought he was still in cornwall not rainald my ladylord ranulf maudes book tumbled down unheeded into the floor rushes ranulf jesu what did it mean amabel had heard too and she paled visibly stricken with the same fear for it was too soon what had gone wrong within moments ranulf was coming through the doorway with his welcoming dyrehunds at his heels and gilbert fitz john just a stride behind they were both mudsplattered and as ranulf unfastened his wet mantle he revealed an arm cradled in a sling but it was his smile that maude would long remember the jubilant joyful smile of a man bearing gifts of surpassing wonder with a miracle or two stuffed into his saddlebags mayhap even a crown robert sent us on ahead he said id earned the right that i ought to be the one to tell you wewe won must you sound so surprised he teased beginning to laugh yes we won we reached lincoln on candlemas eve caught stephen off guard and fought the next day we gained a great victory maude by the grace of god and the justice of our cause with a bit of help from stephens craven barons and stephen he was taken prisoner is on his way to gloucester with robert unless the weather worsens theyll be here by monday maude had risen to meet ranulf now she sat down abruptly in the nearest chair ranulf was assuring amabel that robert and her sons had come out of the battle unhurt the other women were crowding around excited and anxious asking about their husbands ranulf was able to reassure them too and then amabel wanted to know what hed meant by craven barons he and gilbert were quite happy to elaborate taking turns lambasting the fugitive earls but ranulf soon realized that his sister was having very little to say maude she smiled up at him then got to her feet it is late she said and you must be boneweary gilbert too i think we all could benefit from a good nights sleep ranulfs jaw dropped as he stared at her in astonishment she leaned over kissed his cheek and then she was gone disappearing so quickly and inconspicuously that the others in the hall did not at once notice shed left but gilbert had overheard their exchange and pulled ranulf aside i do not understand ranulf you told her that she has won her war that she is to be queen and she was as calm as if she had crowns to spare i thought wed be celebrating till sunrise and yet off she goes to bed as if it were any other night ranulf was just as puzzled as gilbert i expected more too he admitted unable to mask his disappointment mayhap it does not seem real to her yet the hearth fire had burned low and there was a decided chill in the air maude sat down on the edge of the bed almost at once got up again five years and two months stephen had stolen more than her crown he had taken those years too and she could not get them back she had not seen her sons for more than sixteen months and that also was stephens doing she would never forgive him never she moved to the hearth for shed begun to shiver shed thought of this moment so often during all those nights when she couldnt sleep and hope dwindled down to bedrock despair seeking to convince herself that it would truly come to pass that she would prevail only now could she admit just how deep her doubts had gone seeping into every corner of her soul i won she said aloud despite stephen and geoffrey and even you papa i did it i won she would bring her sons to england she need not set foot again in anjou and she would never again need a fathers permission a husbands consent she was no longer just a daughter merely a wife she would be englands queen and normandys duchessand then the mother of a king the door opened quietly behind her madame you left the hall so suddenly i had to minna she turned then for she need not hide her tears now not from minna i did not want them to see me cry london got its first heavy snow of the season on the same evening that ranulf reached gloucester the city awakened the next morning to deep snow drifts a sky the shade of pale smoke and random glimmerings of a pallid winter sun matildas children were delighted and dressed with record speed spurning breakfast in their haste to plunge into the towers glistening snowshrouded bailey matilda followed at a more sedate pace with beatrix the childrens nurse was soon joined by cecily de lacy her newest ladyinwaiting cecily was a slender young woman in her early twenties and still unmarried which was highly unusual for a barons daughter but her father was long dead and her brother seemed unable or unwilling to provide a marriage portion of sufficient size to attract a husband for although cecily was appealing in a delicate subdued sort of way she also suffered from the falling sickness was subject to occasional seizures that had so far frightened off serious suitors if she remained unwed her brother would eventually pressure her into using her meagre marriage portion to buy her way into a nunnery for those were a womans choicesunless she was fortunate enough to be befriended by englands queen upon hearing of cecilys plight matilda had taken the girl into her household and shed promised herself that shed see cecily wed to a man able to accept her affliction for matilda was beginning to enjoy exercising some of the prerogatives of power the snow was no longer pristine and unsullied bore multiple tracks of paw prints and small feet eustace had coaxed or coerced his elevenyearold wife and his sixyearold brother into helping him build a massive snow fortress even fouryearold mary was part of the construction crew happily scooping out their moat matildas spaniel stephens greyhound and several of the stable dogs were playing a canine version of tag matilda was seated on a mounting block watching the antics of her children and dogs she smiled at sight of cecily sliding over to make room on the block be warned she said for eustace is likely to press us into service too he has his heart set upon building the biggest snow castle in all of christendom i liked playing in the snow when i was a little lass but cecily did not like geoffrey de mandeville and it was with a distinct lack of enthusiasm that she now reported i glanced out the window ere i followed you downstairs and i saw the earl of essex riding toward the tower matilda looked puzzled and then smiled sheepishly stephen has created so many earldoms that ive lost count of them and i forgot for a moment that hed bestowed one on geoffrey de mandeville i do not suppose we could sneak back inside the keep ere he arrives cecily grinned warmed by the indiscretion proof positive of matildas trust i fear not my lady she said regretfully for the gates are already opening but he is constable of the tower so mayhap he is not here to see you hell still want to pay his respects for the mans manners are always impeccable cecily he has given me no reason to be ill at ease with him and yet i am i wish i had not promised stephen wed stay at the tower whilst he besieges lincoln castle every time i encounter my lord geoffrey de mandeville earl of essex i feel as if im the tenant and hes the landlord and ive fallen behind on the rent cecily gave a surprised giggle for matilda joked almost as rarely as she allowed herself to show anger brace yourself then madame she said for our landlord is heading this way and by the look of him he has eviction in mind geoffrey de mandeville did indeed look grim and the good manners matilda had admired were nowhere in evidence there is no way to sweeten what i have to tell you he said abruptly so id best say it straight out on sunday a battle was fought at lincoln your husbands barons deserted him and the victory went to the earls of gloucester and chester for a merciful moment matilda felt nothing only a stunned sense of disbelief thatthat cannot be true she faltered it must be a mistake yes and stephen made it if hed waited for reinforcements if hed not been set on playing the hero for gods sake stop just tell me what happened to stephen does matilda swallowed hard does he still live he survived the battle and was taken prisoner but no eustace had moved within earshot unnoticed by the adults until now you lie he cried and flung himself upon geoffrey de mandeville fists flailing kicking and yelling liar over and over as if it were the only word he knew the man shoved eustace away none too gently the boy stumbled regained his footing and spat out an oath that was not at all childlike but before he could lunge forward again matilda pulled him into her arms no eustace no he is not to blame and hurting him will not help will change nothing eustace twisted suddenly breaking free he backed up panting and glared at his mother as if she were now the enemy too you believe him he accused but i know it is not true papa would not lose to those men ah eustace but matilda got no further her heart was beating so fast that she feared she would faint and she could not seem to catch her breath cecily saw her lose color darted forward to slip a supportive arm around her waist by the time shed gotten back her balance the bailey was reverberating with shrieks and wailing for eustace had turned his rage upon himself he was destroying his castle trampling its towers and battlements kicking snow onto his sobbing little sister and brother screaming curses at constance and his nurse when they tried to stop him until at last he sank to his knees in the snow choking on his own sobs matilda had reached him by then knelt and held him as he wept but he soon stiffened and pulled away angrily swiping at his tears with the back of his hand when he scrambled to his feet she let him go no beatrix she said when the nurse would have followed as he bolted across the bailey toward the stables let him be at least for now he survived the battle geoffrey de mandevilles words were still echoing in matildas ears fraught with menace would they dare put stephen to death she felt as if her head were filled with silent screaming but she could not let herself think of stephens peril not yet her younger children needed her they were weeping clutching at her skirts terrified by her distress their brothers frenzy matilda held them close murmuring soothing sounds until they quieted clung less frantically constance was hovering nearby trembling and on the verge of tears in need of comfort too and eustaceshed have to find eustace once he calmed down but then what no one would help stephen if she did not but how dear god what was she to do gloucester england february maude had been waiting more than five years for this confrontation with stephen it had gotten her through some of her worst moments those wakeful nights when her faith was faltering and despair hovered in the shadows she had envisioned the scene over and over again until it began to seem as if she were reliving a memory rather than anticipating one she would be seated upon a dais dressed in scarlet silk wearing the emperors emeralds a gold coronet substituting for the crown that would soon be hers the hall would be expectant but respectful as it had been at the german court and then stephen would be brought before her in chains he would not grovel not even in her imagination she knew him too well to expect that but he would be contrite for surely she had the right to demand that much but when it finally came this longawaited reckoning it was not at all as she had hoped it would be it went wrong from the very beginning for they arrived a day early on sunday night maude had already retired to her own chamber and was making ready for bed when ranulf came racing up the stairs and pounded on her door maude dress yourself he panted and make haste for robert has just ridden into the bailey he then whirled and plunged down the stairs again leaving minna speechless at such a blatant breach of royal etiquette maude was less surprised as much as she loved ranulf shed long ago concluded that his sense of decorum was deplorable she had no time though to fret about her brothers flawed manners no time to select the jewelry and fine clothes shed planned to wear instead of dressing with her usual meticulous care she found herself hurriedly snatching up her discarded chemise and gown then gartering her stockings while minna attempted to rebraid her hair grabbing a veil she was still adjusting it as she emerged flushed and breathless from the darkened stairwell into the torchlit brightness below the hall was a scene of chaos the other women had not been as punctilious about propriety as maude and had hastened downstairs in various stages of undress everywhere she looked she saw unbound hair bare feet husbands and wives entwined in joyful welcoming embraces her entrance went almost unnoticed in the confusion and it was several moments before robert disentangled himself from amabels arms and shoved his way through to her side maude reached out taking his hand in hers thank you she said for winning back my throne thank you all she added raising her voice to be heard above the clamor filling the hall her gaze moving from robert to miles and then briefly to brien they looked tired and wet and travelstained but triumphant too and one by one they came forward to receive her praise miles and brien and baldwin de redvers and william fitz alan these men whod wagered their futures upon her queenship wagered and won it was some time before maude was able to ask robert the obvious question what of stephen when will he be brought in the answer she got was totally unexpected oh hes already here in the hall i could not very well leave him out in the rain could i shall i find him for you maude stared at him in dismay good god robert youre not letting the man wander about on his own are you what if he escapes what if maude he is being guarded robert said patiently lookthere he is over by the door maude spun around saw stephen was indeed standing by the door flanked by his guards like a guest politely waiting to be noticed by his hosts bring him to me maude ordered but she could not wait for her command to be carried out she could not wait another moment and she began to push through the crowd toward stephen stephen was not looking his best his mantle was muddied his head was bandaged and his eyes were bloodshot so smudged by shadows that they seemed bruised he stiffened as maude approached but showed no other signs of unease maude halted in front of him and waited silently daring him to defy her for she could imagine only two possible responses defiance or submission but stephen found a third way courtesy lady maude he said and before she realized what he meant to do he reached for her hand and brought it to his mouth maude was outraged it was repentance she wanted not gallantry jerking her hand away she said scathingly i am not the lady of the manor come to bid you welcome i am your sovereign and i expect you to show me the respect due your queen i expect you to kneel stephen sought to remain impassive but he could not keep the color from rising in his face by now it was very quiet all eyes upon them as you wish he said and slowly knelt before her shed won but somehow it did not feel like a victory maude glanced around at the encircling men they were watching intently too intently and she wondered suddenly if they were remembering stephens magnanimous gesture at arundel turning toward robert she demanded why is this man not in irons if the theft of a crown does not warrant it what crime does i did not think it necessary robert said rather stiffly he gave me his word that he would not attempt to escape and so his word maude echoed derisively is that the same word that he pledged to me when he swore to accept my queenship stephen had gotten to his feet although she had not given him permission to rise she wanted to protest to force him back onto his knees she wanted to order him clapped in irons as he so deserved but she was stopped by what she saw in the faces of the watching men disapproval instinctive and involuntary but disapproval nonetheless they were not comfortable when power was wielded by a woman not at a mans expense a man who had just acquitted himself so spectacularly at lincoln winning their reluctant respect in a way she knew she never could the brotherhood of the battlefield she thought feeling a sharp sense of betrayal as she looked about at the silent spectators these were her kinsmen men whod sacrificed and bled for her cause if even they doubted her right to rule as a man could how would she ever convince the others it was a bitter moment for her gazing upon her defeated rival as her triumph threatened to turn to ashes before her eyes but no shed not let that happen she would prove to them that she was worthy to rule she knew what her father would have done and she would show them that she was her fathers daughter englands true queenby god she would i want this man put under close guard she said and i want it done now stephen was steeling himself for confinement in one of the castle dungeons he was relieved to find that his prison was to be a small but comfortable bedchamber in the keep albeit with a guard posted at the door this was the first time hed been alone since the battle of lincoln and he lay down upon the bed without shedding his clothes grateful for the solitude hed known that his encounter with maude would be a daunting one and so it was for he found it very disquieting to have a woman as his enemy he could not deflect her hostility with defiance as he had with chester his dealings with robert were free of rancor for they both knew what was expected of them under the circumstances not so with maude none of the rules of warfare seemed to apply for maude neither knew nor cared what they were his scene with maude had been unpleasant but surprising too in a way he had not foreseen maude and he shared the same inability to camouflage their emotions and the emotions hed read on maudes face were anger frustration and chagrin not triumph if he had not enjoyed their confrontation neither had she much to his astonishment hed even felt a flicker of pity for her plight for hed suddenly seen the truththat there would be no winners in their war he was facing lifelong confinement at bristol or gloucester and maude was about to discover that her english subjects still did not want her as queen she was blazing a trail on her own and there in the great hall at gloucester castle hed realized that she did not even have a map whatever happened to him he doubted that shed reach westminster stephen folded his hands behind his head staring up at the ceiling but it made no sense not that he and maude should both lose a ship with no helmsman would soon founder and so would england how could that be part of the almightys plan was it possible that hed been too quick to conclude that he knew the lords will what if his loss at lincoln was not gods judgment upon him mayhap the lord god had not abandoned him after all the almighty had seen fit to test job so why not his servant stephen mayhap that was why hed lost the battle of lincolnso that he might prove his faith was strong that he was indeed worthy to be englands king this was the first glimmer of light in the dark that had descended upon stephens world at lincoln the loss of hope had been a crueler loss even than his crown for hed never known what it was like to live without hopenot until this past week riding as a prisoner along the muddy winter roads of his own realm stephen needed hope as he needed air to breathe and he lunged toward the light it did not take much to convince him he was halfway down the path toward conviction by the time he heard voices at the door he was sitting up on the bed as the door opened his guard stepped aside and stephen smiled at sight of ranulf beckoning him inside as if he still had that right ranulf seemed ill at ease as if hed somehow ended up in stephens chamber through no doing of his own ii just wanted to see if you need anything stephen considered well how about a fast horse and a head start he suggested and ranulf grinned pleased by this proof that stephens sense of humor had not been one of the casualties of lincoln after all ive no horses to spare he said but i do not come emptyhanded and with a dramatic flourish he unhooked a wine flask from his belt holding it aloft sir ranulf to the rescue stephen joked but when ranulf passed him the flask he put it down untasted there is something you can do for me lad persuade maude to let me write a letter to my wife matilda must be half mad with worry by now ill ask maude ranulf promised wishing he could promise more but he was remembering the obdurate look on his sisters face and he was not at all sure that she would heed his plea for he suspected that stephen was the last man in christendom likely to receive any favors from maude londons justiciar and the leaders of the citys guilds came to the tower to bid farewell to stephens queen and to assure her again that londoners were still loyal to her husband soon after geoffrey de mandeville arrived ostensibly to wish matilda godspeed on her journey to safety in the south of england but he was not long in revealing the real purpose of his visit as sorry as he was to see her go he said he understood that it was for the best i do think though that the little lady constance ought to stay here at the tower matilda stared at him i do not agree my daughterinlaws place is with me geoffrey de mandeville smiled and shook his head i can protect her madame make sure that no evil befalls her in these troubled times i owe her brother that much her brother the french king matilda understood now you are indeed kind to worry about constance she said as steadily as she could but there is no need i assure you ah but i insist he said still smiling matilda looked at himso elegant handsome and urbaneand she had to fight the urge to cross herself suddenly sure that she was in the presence of true evil matilda had chosen guildford as her refuge a fortified castle in the heart of the north downs it was only thirty miles from london but they were braving february weather at its worst and they did not reach the wey valley until dusk on the second day the sky was dark and foreboding the wind as cold and desolate as the future they faced in maudes england it took some time before matilda was able to get her family settled still longer before she could slip away to the chapel for the younger children literally clung to her skirts these days and although eustace rebuffed all her attempts at comfort he watched her constantly with bewildered needful eyes the chapel was deserted but that was what matilda wanted most time alone she was so tired in body and soul drained by the need to be strong for her children her household only at night could she give in to her fears and even then she dared not let herself weep for stephen afraid that once she started she could not stop moving forward into the chancel she sank to her knees before the candlelit altar lord god almighty into thy hands and those of thy blessed son i commit myself holy father hear my prayer my husband is in great peril forsaken by those who had most cause to be true i would help him if only i could but i do not know how show me the way i beseech thee dear lord to send me a sign reveal unto me thy will breathing a shaken amen she got slowly to her feet but she was not yet ready to take up her burden again and she lingered there in the quiet castle chapel trying not to think of constances tearstreaked face that hellspawn mandeville would not harm her matilda knew that but their parting had been wrenching the childs piteous sobs echoing in her ears even after theyd escaped the tower for that was how matilda saw their departureas an escape she did not doubt that mandeville would have kept them all there hostages to win maudes favor if not for the londoners but public opinion was still on stephens side and even mandeville dared not risk the londoners wrath by seizing stephens wife and children shed discussed with cecily the advisability of taking her children to boulogne but she was loath to leave england and she could not bear to be separated from them if only there were someone she could turn to someone she could trust stephens brother theobald would be sympathetic once he learned of stephens downfall but what could he do at a distance he could not rally support for stephen not from blois the bishop could though a prince of the church a papal legate lord of some of the most formidable castles in england he should have been her natural ally but shed not yet heard from him her plea for help had so far gone unheeded just like waleran beaumont and william de ypres and those other craven wretches whod fled the field at lincoln she thought bleakly stephens brother was abandoning him too had stephen gotten her letter yet shed sent a courier to gloucester for where else would he be taken surely maude would give him the letter she could not be so cruel as to withhold itcould she matilda had begun to pace as if trying to outrun her fears what lay ahead for stephen maude would not dare put him to death no god would not let that happen nor would robert surely stephens life was not at risk she must believe that but he would be buying his life with his freedom for they would never let him go the old king had confined his elder brother for nigh on thirty years his daughter was not likely to be any more merciful to stephen caught up in her own thoughts she was slow to realize that she was no longer alone a man was standing in the shadows watching her father paul she asked uncertainly for the silhouette did not resemble that of the portly chaplain when he moved forward into the light she recoiled abruptly you william de ypres strode toward her i must speak with you my lady you dare to face me after what you did my husband trusted you and you betrayed him the fleming had not thought stephens queen capable of such anger i know how could you abandon him after all hed done for you you owed him better than that i know he said again and i am here to make amends it is rather late for that matilda snapped why are you really here what do you want i told youto make amends i did your husband a grave wrong and i want to right it if i can some of matildas rage gave way to astonishment you expect me to believe you if you have a conscience youve kept it remarkably well hidden in the years ive known you it was a surprise to me too he admitted and it is a right inconvenient discovery at this time of my life id gotten along quite well without one up till now but his humor fell flat she continued to look at him suspiciously and he shrugged if i am not sincere why am i here why am i not off selling my swordand my flemingsto the highest bidder to maude she opened her mouth but she could not think of an answer to that and for the first time she began to take him seriously i do not understand what you are telling me if you truly regret deserting stephen why did you do it he shrugged again there is not much time for reflection in the midst of a battle when my flemings broke and ran i tried to rally them obviously i did not try hard enough but id not truly taken the measure of the man not until it was too late until i learned how hed refused to flee willing to fight to the death but why did he have to buy your loyalty with his blood my husband is a good and decent man why could you not see that sooner ah but i did lady matilda stephen has courage and a generous spirit and he is for certes one of the most likeable men ive ever met as you say he is a good man but he is not a good king matilda wanted to protest the unfairness of that verdict but she did not and after a moment she said quietly almost beseechingly why is that why do men think that stephen is not a good king i do not understand well he frowned thoughtfully suppose you had a greenland falcon a joy to behold so handsome he was whiter than a winter snowfall a falcon that flies straighter and higher than any arrow and twice as fast every falconers dreamexcept that he falters when it is time to make the kill once again matilda wanted to argue once again she did not did you truly mean what you saidabout helping stephen he nodded if not id be in gloucester by now offering my services and men to maude instead i am here offering them to you i do not he got no further matilda gave a sudden gasp clasping her hand to her mouth you are my sign she cried i begged the almighty to show me how to aid stephen and he did he sent you to me william de ypres burst out laughing ive often been called the devils henchman but this is the first time anyone ever accused me of being one of gods good angels he stopped laughing though as he realized that matilda was utterly in earnest id not lead you astray lady matilda it may be too late and you should know this toothat many men may have to die to set your husband free will you be able to do what must be done to restore him to the throne matilda hesitated i cannot answer that she said at last for i do not know what might be asked of me if i could secure stephens freedom by sacrificing his crown i would but even if he agreed to abdicateand i doubt that he wouldmaude would still not let him go for she is not a woman who knows how to trust indeed she is not he agreed and that is why we must be very cautious stephen survived the battle and they must not regret itnot yet he was pleased to see that his bluntness had not shocked her she was nodding somberly i know she said that is all i can think about stephens danger and maudes controversial queenship if i were maude id be treading with great care and speaking softly doing whatever i could to dispel mens doubts and ease their minds at least until the coronation he said dryly but you do not think maude will follow that prudent path do you i pray to god she will not matilda said for that is the only chance stephen has his future mayhap his very life depends upon maudes making mistakes it was midmorning but wall torches and cresset oil lamps had been burning for hours in the great hall of geoffrey danjous castle at angers although this last day of february was sunlit and clear it was still too cold to open the shutters a desk had been set up in a corner for study and henry was hunched over a primer his face hidden by a tumbling thatch of coppergold hair geoffrey resented his brothers absorption in the book for he felt it keenly that henry could read and he could not he was still learning his letters and he was supposed to be practicing them now copying the christcross row their tutor had etched onto a wax tablet but the alphabet held no charms for geoffrey and his parchment sheet remained blank instead hed been amusing himself by aligning and realigning his writing supplies a pumice stone to erase mistakes a boars tooth to polish the parchment afterward a small knife to trim his quill pen a ruler to make margins and his favorite an inkhorn made from a real cows horn stuck down into a hole in the desk to minimize spills geoffrey set the pumice stone on its end was attempting to balance the ruler on top of it when he glanced up saw their tutor heading their way he hastily dunked the quill in the inkhorn drew a large crooked a on the parchment master peter had stopped by henry first complimenting him for having gotten through most of the pater noster geoffrey slopped a b onto the page splattering ink upon his sleeve fortunately master peter seemed in no hurry for he was still talking to henry joking about his birthday next week geoffrey scowled putting down his pen that was all anyone talked about these days henrys upcoming birthday he was so jealous of the attention henry was getting that he forgot he was likely to receive a scolding for his own lackluster efforts but luck was with him for master peter was now being called away instead of putting his reprieve to good use though geoffrey leaned over and dribbled ink onto henrys side of the desk so you are going to be eight he said so what ill be eight in june henry prudently moved his book out of ink range no you will not he said calmly youll only be seven as much as geoffrey yearned to refute that fact he didnt know how wellill be eight next year he countered and henry grinned yes he said but then ill be nine geoffrey glowered at his brother somehow henry always seemed to get the better of him birthdays are stupid he said and pretended to stretch taking the opportunity to prod henry in the ribs with his elbow henry jabbed him back but his retaliation was halfhearted he was staring across the hall like a cat at a mousehole geoffrey thought looking to see what had claimed henrys attention it was that lady he decided papas friend he wished he knew why henry disliked her so much but henry would not tell him acting as if he knew a secret no one else did sometimes geoffrey went out of his way to be friendly with the lady just to vex henry but today it was their little brother will who was doing that holding her hand and laughing as she ruffled his hair as soon as she moved away henry gave a sharp whistle and beckoned to will who trotted obediently across the hall in response to the summons i told you to stay away from her will henry said accusingly and will blinked in bewilderment why she tells me riddles and she smells good like flowers in the garden like mama she looks like mama too she does not henry glared at the little boy she is not at all like mama for once geoffrey and henry were united in their indignation her hair is as yellow as butter geoffrey pointed out scornfully and mamas hair is black you must be daft will if you cannot tell the difference wills mouth trembled and henry was suddenly struck by an unlikely suspicion willdo you remember what mama looks like of course i do i remember better than you but in truth will did not his mother had been gone a year and a half and that was almost a third of wills lifetime it had happened so gradually that he was not aware of it the fading of his memories there just came a day when he could no longer call up an image of his mothers face and now when her letters were read to him he heard no echoes of her voice but he could not admit that to his brothers and he insisted i do remember mama i do before spinning on his heel and running from the hall he did not get far colliding in the doorway with his father geoffrey scooped his son up into his arms and soon had the little boy giggling henry and young geoffrey watched as he strode toward them will gleefully riding astride his shoulders his earlier distress quite forgotten setting will back upon his feet geoffrey smiled down at his sons and it was only then that they saw the letter in his hand is that from mama yes henry it is and a remarkable birthday gift she has for you lad it seems she has won her war your uncles fought a battle with stephen on candlemas at a place called lincoln the victory was theirs and stephen was taken prisoner then mama will be queen this from henry and will she come home now from geoffrey yes she will be queen and yes she will come backin time but england will be her home now and normandy of course once she has been crowned though youll be able to visit her me too geoffrey said and laughed for hed just added a silent when hell freezes over youll have to go away now too papa henry said and geoffrey nodded surprised and proud that henry was so quick he was becoming convinced that his firstborn had been endowed with an uncommonly sharp intelligence yes he said i shall have to go into normandy straightaway until maude is formally recognized as englands queen and the crown is set upon her head at westminster the danger of rebellion remains it will be up to me to convince the norman barons to come to terms without delay henry and geoffrey had fallen silent for they understood that when their father rode into normandy he would be riding off to war that had escaped will though for he was still focusing upon the good news that mama would be queen will mama let me wear our crown sometimes geoffrey hid a smile but if will was too young to comprehend the concept of primogeniture his eldest son was not as henry now proved oh no will he said firmly but not unkindly it is not your crown it is mamas and mine a month to the day after the battle of lincoln maude met with stephens brother the bishop of winchester at wherwell it was a wet blustery march afternoon and they were all shrouded in wool mantles and hoods for this kingmaking conference was being held in an open field not far from the benedictine nunnery of the holy cross the mood was almost as cheerless as the weather for neither the empress nor the bishop truly wished to be there theirs was an alliance of expediency a grudging recognition of unpalatable political realitiesthat maudes claim to the throne needed the sanction of the church and the bishops ambitions necessitated a cooperative relationship with englands sovereign at this dismal march meeting they were to ratify already agreedupon terms terms maude liked not at all for she had reluctantly promised that all major affairs especially the bestowal of bishoprics and abbeys should be subject to the papal legates authority in return the bishop had vowed to recognize her as queen and pledged her his loyalty maude had let herself be persuaded but she resented having to concede so much royal autonomy to gain support that should have been hers by right she did not trust stephens brother the bishop and even though she knew they needed him as an ally she could not help despising him a little for abandoning stephen with such alacrity stephen may have been luckier in wedlock she thought but not in brotherhood there shed been truly blessed and she glanced proudly at her own brothers robert and ranulf and rainald newly come back from cornwall oddly enough the bishops private thoughts were not so far removed from maudes musings he was studying the men flanking herrobert of gloucester miles fitz walter and brien fitz countand he was wondering why maude had been able to attract men of stature and integrity whilst stephen had relied upon selfserving knaves and malcontents like the beaumonts and that treacherous fleming if only stephen had not been so stubborn so shortsighted for if stephen had heeded his advice he would not now be imprisoned at bristol castle and maude would not be about to set his crown upon that haughty dark head of hers hed gotten some impressive concessions from her more than hed been able to coax from stephen but this was not how hed wanted it to be yet hed had no choice for he had to protect the interests of holy church in time stephen would come to understand that or so he hoped from the gesta stephani chronicle so that when the bishop and the countess of anjou had jointly made a pact of peace and concord the bishop came to meet her in cordial fashion and admitted her into the city of winchester and after handing over to her disposal the kings castle and the royal crown which she had always most eagerly desired and the treasure the king had left there though it was very scanty he bade the people at a public meeting in the market place of the town salute her as their lady and their queen oxford castle england april beatrice ranulfs sisterinlaw gave him a timid smile and he felt a throb of pity at a distance she looked like a child a little girl borrowing her mothers gown up close she looked fragile breakable i have to go lass rainald said surprising ranulf by the gentle way he kissed his wifes cheek my sister has summoned me but ella will stay with you whilst i am gone beatrice smiled and nodded but ranulf noticed how her hands were clenching in her lap her fingers knotting in her skirts her nails were bitten down to the quick several rimmed in dried blood ella had moved protectively to her side and over beatrices bowed head her eyes met rainalds in a glance of grim reassurance rainald was silent as they moved into the stairwell but as they neared the bottom he said abruptly she cannot bear to be alone not even for a heartbeat ranulf hesitated not sure what he should say had beatrices troubles all begun when she was caught in that siege or had she always been one to shy at shadows to see demons lurking in the dark he knew she was a great heiress but he knew too that rainalds women had invariably been bold and lusty wenches bawdy cheerful bedmates never a bird with a broken wing he was still pondering his response when rainald poked him in the ribs sowhat is this i hear about your turning down maudes offer to find you an heiress of your own ranulf shrugged for he could not tell anyone about annora soon god willing but not yet the truth well my lord earl of cornwall he said playfully drawling out rainalds new title ive my heart set upon a particular lady eleanor of aquitaine i hear she and the french king are mismatched and should their marriage falter i want to be able to put in my bid once more rainalds elbow went into action connecting with ranulfs ribs so keep your secrets then lad id wager youve got a light o love hidden away somewhere rainald said showing unexpected insight but that is no obstacle to a profitable marriage not that youll need to marry for money not once maudedamnation he broke off giving ranulf a rueful grin i let that cat out of the bag for certes me and my runaway mouth what ranulf demanded what does maude intend to do you cannot tell her i told you rainald warned she has it in mind to bestow a title upon you toomortain mortain ranulf echoed butbut mortain is stephens not any more rainald said punctuating with his elbow again christ on the cross will you stop prodding me im not a balky horse in need of the spurs are you sure about this rainald when his brother nodded he exhaled slowly count of mortain he could not deny that he wanted it yet he wished that his gain need not come at stephens expense but eustace still had the bulk of his inheritance intact the county of boulogne when he said that aloud though rainald shook his head you truly think maude will let boulogne pass to stephens son id say the lad has a better chance of becoming pope than count of boulogne ranulf was taken aback that is crazed talk rainald it can be argued that stephen has forfeited mortain but boulogne is matildas eustace is her lawful heir and no court in the land would say otherwise maudes court is the only one that counts now lad nomaude would not do that rainald to deprive eustace of his rightful inheritanceit would be unjust you are such an innocent ranulf do you honestly believe that maude cares tuppence about doing stephen justice she hates him lad as i hope no woman ever hates me you think she detests geoffrey their marriage is a love feast compared to the way she loathes cousin stephen ranulf was not convinced and would have argued further but by then theyd reached the castle solar it was already crowded with men most of the faces familiar to ranulf robert as always by maudes side miles and brien also close at hand baldwin de redvers newly named by maude as earl of devon oxfords castellan robert doilly and his stepson another of the old kings illegitimate offspring but there were a few newcomers to their ranks too john marshal who held marlborough castle although until recently no one could be sure for whom hed managed an adroit balancing act for the past year convincing both stephen and maude that he was on their side william beauchamp formerly one of waleran beaumonts most trusted captains and hugh bigod who was doing his best to pretend that no one remembered hed perjured himself on stephens behalf ranulf squeezed in finding a space against the far wall he was expecting no surprises for he knew why maude had summoned themto hear the eyewitness accounts of the church council held last week called by maudes new ally the bishop of winchester to recognize her as englands rightful queen she was flanked by nigel bishop of ely and bernard bishop of the welsh see of st davids but it was gilbert foliot whod assumed the role of spokesman and ranulf edged over to get a closer look for he was curious about foliot only thirty and already in a position of influence abbot of the benedictine abbey at gloucester ranulf knew some begrudged foliot his rapid rise in the church hierarchy attributing it to his kinship with miles fitz walter they were first cousins once removed but foliot was said to have a quick wit a nimble tongue and a sardonic eye all of which were in evidence now as he described for them the events of the winchester synod gilbert foliot began with an unexpected admission that in his youth hed taken great pleasure in the acts of fair tumblers and ropewalkers but in all honesty my fond memories of those spectacular somersaults and dazzling back flips cannot compete with the remarkable performance i just witnessed at winchester the bishops mental contortions were truly breathtaking he had an adroit sense of timing waited now for the laughter to subside but then he had to justify not one but two turnabouts he was up to the task though first he explained why he had been compelled to break his oath to you my lady as he told it england was in chaos and you tarried so long in normandy that he had no choice but to accept stephenfor englands sake and indeed three whole weeks did drag by between king henrys death and stephens coronation foliot paused again for laughter and was not disappointed the suspense is becoming too much cousin miles said wryly how did he explain then his abandonment of stephen he said that whilst he loved his mortal brother he loved far more his immortal father and stephens defeat at lincoln was clearly gods judgment upon him both as a man and a king and so he urged his fellow clerics to follow his lead which they did and elected you madame as lady of the english after that the bishop excommunicated stephens supporters with special thunderbolts aimed at stephens steward william martel whod dared to seize the bishops castle at sherborne the word elect jarred with maude it was for the church to consecrate a sovereign not select one but at least the bishop had kept faith with her even if he did choose to pass himself off as a kingmaker the archbishop of canterbury balked at recognizing my right claiming he could not break his oath to stephen he insisted upon being taken to bristol getting stephens consent ere he would agree to accept me what of the clerics at the synod did any of them echo the archbishops argument did any of them balk too no my lady foliot said emphatically if not altogether truthfully a number of the clerics had not even attended the synod but he did not want maude to know that for he already had enough troubling news to tell her it was not the clerics who cast a shadow over the proceedings it was the queen quickly amending that to stephens wife for he knew how sensitive maude was on this particular point matilda what could she do she sent her chaplain to the synod a very brave priest named christian the bishop refused to read her letter aloud so christian boldly snatched it back and read it himself much to the bishops indignation memory of the bishops discomfiture brought a brief involuntary smile to his lips it was an impassioned plea for stephens freedom stressing what the bishop would rather ignore that he is his brothers keeper matilda poses no threat but what of the londoners did they obey the summons yes they did but i regret to say that they were not cooperative madame they came to argue for stephens release and restoration to the throne and the bishop had little success in winning them over they agreed to take his message back to the city but they warned it was likely to fall on deaf ears london it seems still holds fast for stephen there was silence after that for they all knew theyd suffered a disturbing setback maude must be crowned at westminster but that could not happen until the londoners came to their senses maudes disappointment was so intense that she actually felt ill chilled to the very marrow of her bones i cannot comprehend such folly at best they can delay my coronation not thwart it what do they hope to gain by antagonizing me like this i have the bloodright to be queen the almighty has judged my claim at lincoln and stephen is my prisoner what else need i do to convince them what more do they want of me maudes cry was heartfelt and found ready echoes she heard murmurs of agreement and anger rippling outward like waves across the crowded solar there was one discordant note though a burst of laughter from the window seat occupied by john marshal baldwin de redvers and her brother rainald they stopped as soon as she glanced their way but the sound of their snickering lingered unpleasantly so in her memory gilbert foliot had nothing more to impart they now knew the best and the worst of the winchestser council for a time they discussed and damned the obstinacy of the londoners and maude then revealed some good news from normandy on easter sunday the bishop of lisieux had surrendered the city to geoffrey it was agreed that miles should return to gloucester where he could keep watch upon the marches lest the welsh seek to take advantage of english unrest after that the days business was done robert waited until he and maude were alone with their brothers miles and brien only then did he say quietly i fear maude that you hold matilda too cheaply she could be more of a threat than you think matilda that little mouse surely you jest robert as long as she controls kent and the coast she is dangerous maude for she could hire flemish mercenaries strip boulogne bare to pay them mayhap even blockade london shed never have the stomach for killing not st matilda she maude stopped abruptly rainald you are going rainald nodded by your leave madame queen he said jauntily and kissed her hand with an exaggerated courtly flourish rainaldere you go i would put a question to you i am curious about something what were you finding so amusing with john marshal and baldwin de redvers what rainald looked blank and then shrugged too nonchalantly ohthat just a jest i would like to hear it rainald the others were now watching for rainalds discomfort was too obvious to overlook he scowled ran his hand through his hair until it bristled like the quills of a ginger hedgehog ah maudeit was a joke not fit for female ears can we not leave it at that i am not likely to swoon rainald rainald ruffled his hair again at a loss if only shed give him enough time he might be able to come up with a less objectionable joke but she was not about to wait had that stubborn look he knew all too well no best to tell her and get it over with but why did she have to be so damnably difficult have it your way maude but youll not like it any you asked what the londoners wanted of you and hehe said ballocks it was passing strange maude had expected such an answer and yet she still felt as if shed been slapped in the face from the corner of her eye she saw miles and ranulf struggling to hide grins were robert and brien laughing at her too very amusing she said with a smile that dripped icicles i want to be sure to give credit where due whose joke was itjohns or baldwins rainalds mouth dropped open i do not remember rainald tell me nono i will not he snapped and spun on his heel ignoring her demand that he halt that he come back no one else had moved but the slamming door broke the spell and ranulf leapt to his feet ill go after him maude talk to him once he calms down the door banged again and a strained silence settled over the room miles had risen too striding forward he kissed maudes hand then gave her a level look you are too thinskinned lady maude if you bleed so profusely from a mere scratch how will you protect yourself from a much greater wound i am no fragile flower miles maude said stiffly you need not fear i will meet whatever challenges lie ahead and prevail over them i do not doubt that madame at the door he paused even so he said it was just a joke robert was the next to depart more tactful then miles he kept his opinion to himself but maude knew him well enough to read disapproval in his very reticence she spun around crossed to the hearth waiting for the sound of the doors closing yet again but it did not come and she glanced over her shoulder saw brien still standing by the table i suppose you think i made too much of it too she said seeking to sound matteroffact but sounding defensive instead yes he said but i think i understand why you did so maudes smile was skeptical do you indeed he nodded a joke about the gallows would find no favor in the house of a man whod been hanged maude took a quick step toward him mayhap you do understand brien this is not at all as i thought it would be why is it still so hard why are they still fighting me nothing frightens men more than the unknown stephen might be discredited and defeated but his flaws are familiar and therefore safer maudes mouth twisted better a weak king than a strong queen she said bitterly and brien nodded again it is so unfair brien for five years i fought to reclaim the crown that stephen stole from me and it cost me dear now that crown is within my grasp and still there are men who would deny it to me miles says i am too easily wounded not by my enemies by my friends my own kinsmen those are the wounds that fester maude it was the first time hed used her given name but in the intensity of the moment neither noticed you will be queen he said and i will serve you faithfully until my last breath that i swear upon the surety of my soul he raised her hand to his lips and for a moment their fingers entwined may i speak freely she nodded but still he hesitated i would cut out my tongue ere id offend you but there is this i must say to you my lady fear cannot always be banished by force of will sometimes it needs to be coaxed away mayhap if you sought to sooth their fears with soft words oh no brien maude said earnestly you are wrong i dare not for they would take that as weakness i must prove that i am my fathers daughter in deed and word as well as blood it is the only way if fortune had been fickle in april it proved bountiful in may maude enjoyed some signal successes her uncle david the scots king arrived in normandy robert beaumont made a truce with geoffrey geoffrey de mandeville came to terms with her too and promised his aid in bringing the recalcitrant londoners to heel that did not prove necessary though a delegation of londoners met maude at st albans had a long discussion with robert and bowed to the inevitable during the third week in june maude was given a subdued but courteous welcome into the capital and was finally installed in the royal palace at westminster robert had just met with the archbishop of canterbury discussing the plans for maudes coronation he was on his way back to the great hall when he was waylaid by his daughter the earl of chester had yet to put in an appearance at maudes court rumor had him busy settling scores with william peverel and the earl of richmond but maud was not about to miss her aunts coronation and shed joined them at reading robert was delighted to have her with them for amabel had been forced to remain at bristol to watch over stephen he followed maud now into the gardens and soon unbent enough to play with her exuberant little lapdog but this rare moment of relaxation was fleeting for gilbert foliot was striding up the path toward him with a haste that bespoke urgency my lord earl im indeed glad i found you the bishop of winchester has arrived and he no sooner paid his respects to the empress than they got into a right sharp argument i thought it best to come looking for you for theyre going to be sorely in need of a peacemaker and youre the only one theyre both likely to heed robert swore profanely enough to startle his daugther wherever did you learn such foul language papafrom mama but her teasing was wasted for robert was already heading for the great hall and she had to hurry to catch up if i may be blunt gilbert foliot continued the fault lies with the scots king if he were not so set upon having his chancellor named as the next bishop of durham let me guess robert interrupted wearily maude told the bishop of winchester that shed approved the appointment of davids man to the durham see and the bishop took it amissbadly amiss you must have second sight for that is indeed what happened lady maudes temper could melt wax at twenty paces and bishop henry is no meek lamb of god when i left they were shouting at each other in a most undignified way to the wonderment of a hall full of witnesses robert swore again quickening his stride and foliot did too you know i have no great regard for bishop henry my lord but he has the right of it in this quarrel the monks of durham do not want the king of scotland picking their bishop moreover lady maude did promise the bishop that hed have the final say in all church appointments as little as i like the man i can understand his anger it was very foolish of him though to scold the empress as if she were a wayward child any chance he may have had of prevailing ended as soon as the words i forbid it passed his lips he said that christ papa maud clutched roberts arm pointing it is too latelook the bishop of winchester was stalking up the path toward them trailed by flustered clerics his color was so florid that he looked to be in danger of succumbing at any moment to an apoplectic seizure and his eyes were bulging glittering with such utter unforgiving fury that the others stared at him in consternation even the blase maud was impressed cousin what happened the bishop brushed past robert as if hed not spoken but after a few steps he stopped turned back that woman he said harshly has no honour maude have you lost your wits i will thank you robert to keep a civil tongue in your head i owe uncle david this he has stood by me never once betraying his oath even you swore homage to stephen even you but not david david is not the problem did you truly say that if henry would not invest davids man with the bishops ring and mitre youd do it yourself tell me you did not say that maude but he saw the flush rising in her face jesus god robert he gave me no choice he forbade me and those were his very words i forbid it he said whilst a hall full of witnesses looked on what else could i do the church does not and will not recognize lay investiture that is a battle our father and your husband both fought with the churchand lost you think i do not know that robert but this i know too that he would never have dared to defy our father like thatnever he started to speak stopped and looked again at her face his relief was enormous thank god shed not meant it the threat was foolish but she was a novice at this would learn so he goaded you into it he said i can understand that for ill not deny that henry can be insufferable at times but this is a fence we must mend he is going to expect an apology maude and no maude you misspoke now you must make it right however little you like it no maude said i will not and he stared at her in dismay for she sounded no less implacable than their enraged cousin the bishop westminster england june the great hall of westminster was said to be the largest in all of europe a vast timbered structure two hundred forty feet in length more than sixty feet wide gervase de cornhill had seen it before as one of londons justiciars hed occasionally been summoned to attend the king each time he stepped across the threshold he was awed by such earthly grandeur marveling what mortal man had wrought but on this humid june afternoon his artistic appreciation was muted he had eyes only for the woman seated upon the dais she did look verily like a queen he conceded and a right handsome one at that pray god that shed prove reasonable as well as comely he glanced at his comrades saw the same unease upon their faces it was a sad day indeed for london when a good man like stephen could be supplanted by a woman once theyd been summoned they knelt before maude theyd agreed that gervase should speak for them but when he started to introduce himself a familiar male voice cut him off saying ah but we know you well master de cornhill the londoners stiffened watching apprehensively as geoffrey de mandeville sauntered up onto the dais to stand at maudes side his presence there was not a total surprise for rumors had been circulating for a fortnight that maude had made it well worth his while to switch sides theyd been hoping it was not so for he was no friend to london or its citizens hed been hostile to their commune from the first had often used his power as the constable of the tower to intimidate and coerce and his animosity now had a personal edge for his fatherinlaw had been killed last month when a demonstration for stephen had turned violent but once maude gave him leave to rise gervase strode forward purposefully and launched into his prepared plea that she should restore to them the laws of good king edward the sainted confessor whose reign had become enshrined in legend as a golden age in the brutal aftermath of the conquest my lord father ruled london for thirtyfive years his reign was peaceful and prosperous and when he died men called him the lion of justice in tribute to his enlightened and righteous kingship are you saying now that his laws were so onerous so oppressive that you need relief from them no madame indeed not gervase said hastily and launched into a wellrehearsed explanation that stressed the londoners reverence for the old ways the old customs while insisting that they were not disparaging the laws or courts of good king henry may god assoil him when he was done maude said that she would take their request under consideration a response that could promise all or nothing but gervase was already sure what her eventual answer would be for as he studied her face hed come to a troubling conclusion this new queen of theirs had no liking for the capital of her realm he had to persevere though madame we have another petition to put before you we beseech you to ease the burden our city is laboring under we have been told that a new royal tallage is to be imposed upon us but we are not able to meet this demand for the city coffers are well nigh empty and why is that master de cornhill gervase blinked madame i asked why the city coffers are so bare no you need not fumble for an answer i already know for the past five years your money has been propping up stephens monarchy dare you deny it gervase shifted from foot to foot hoping she was posing a rhetorical question when he saw that she was not he said haltingly madame hewas the king what choice did we have oh indeed you had a choice when he sought to usurp my crown you could have barred the city gates to him madame that was not for us to do we are not kingmakers since when geoffrey de mandeville queried and gervase tensed for he knew from personal experience that the earls smile was never so disarming as when he was about to draw blood your sudden modesty is commendable master de cornhill but if my memory serves that is exactly what you and your cohorts claimed that it was the londoners whod brought stephens kingship into being and you in particular have been remarkably loyal to the man not only have you been urging your fellow citizens to keep faith with him youve been doing some interesting almsgiving to the lady matilda down in kent gervase wasnt the only one taken by surprise so was maude what she exclaimed turning to stare at her new ally are you sure of this my lord of essex quite sure madame master de cornhill has been generously aiding stephens wife in her efforts to engage flemish hirelingsfor what purpose we can only speculate about unless hed care to tell us madame that is not so it was not at all as the earl makes it sound i agreed to lend the queen a sum of money and she pledged one of her cambridgeshire manors as collateral it was purely a business transaction how very reassuring knowing that your treason was done for profit and not principle certainly sets my mind at ease treason madame i did not yes master de cornhill you did you are accomplices in stephens usurpation all of you londoners who aided and abetted him in his treacherous quest for my crown if not for your disloyalty hed never have become king you rejoiced in his theft and supported his outlaw kingship without conscience qualms even after gods judgment had been passed upon him at lincoln you still balked at recognizing me as englands true sovereign i ought to have been crowned months ago but you made that quite impossible and now you dare to ask me to remit your taxes better you should seek out stephen in his bristol prison for youll get no such reprieve from me madame i entreat you to be fair to ive heard you out that is fairer than you deserve go home master de cornhill and tell your friends that a bill has come due five years late payable upon demand theyd gathered to hear ranulfs report of his reconnaissance mission into london he was relishing the attention and spun out for them a vivid account of his reconnoitering i think i might have a promising career as a spy he boasted for i was able to mingle freely without arousing any suspicion but it is just as you feared robert i wandered about the marketplace i tarried in alehouses and taverns and the cookshop down by the river i even paid a visit to the friday horse fair at smithfield no matter where i went the talk was of maude and it was blistering hot they are angry and fearful and some of them are defiant too they accuse maude of being overweening and unwomanly of seeking to bleed them white and destroy their commune they are even quoting from scriptures that the lord will be a swift witness against those that oppress and all wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman ive never seen london in such a furor maude has stirred up a hornets nest for true this time i know robert conceded this is why ive asked you all here we have a problem for certes maude seems set upon doing herself grievous harm and we must find a way to limit the damage we have to act for she is losing the church the londoners her mind rainald said acerbically and robert glared at his brother this is no time for joking rainald who is joking i think she has gone stark raving mad how else explain it it cannot always be her time of the month can it but what do you propose robert i see no means of silencing her shy of stuffing a gag in her mouth and she pays you no more heed these days than this serves for naught the scots king interrupted impatiently and rainald yielded grudgingly deferring to the other mans greater age and rank i am not here to mock my niece but to determine why she has gone astray and figure out how to correct her course i was thinking ranulf said pensively that it might be that her first taste of power has gone to her head she has never had any after all not until now wine always hits a man harder if he is not one for drinking mayhap it is like that for maude he trailed off a little shy before the scots king and was pleased when brien concurred i know i am not her kinsman as the rest of you are but i think ranulf might well be right lady maude has always been compelled to obey as a daughter and a wife even as a widow if you cage an animal up from birth it takes time to adjust once it is finally set free what are you both blathering about rainald was scowling we all have to obey our betters you think i have always done just as i please my father kept me on a tight lead i assure you but i did not go helling about like a lunatic after he died did i no brien said coolly but then no one ever told you that one of your betters was to be a lad of fourteen rainald showed signs of pursuing the argument but david headed him off i think the true problem is that maude was not schooled in kingship she seems to believe that royal power is absolute and her father ought to have taught her better than that it was not enough merely to name her as his heir she needed guidance as much as she did a husband and she did not get it in a sense we are paying now for henrys shortsightedness there was a moment of circumspect silence none of them wanting to say what they were all thinkingthat davids heavyhanded clash with the monks of durham had not helped any either we seem to be in agreement robert said that something must be done but what it occurred to me that we ought to summon miles back from the marches maude respects his opinion she respects you too robert ranulf insisted and robert shrugged mayhap so but she is not listening to me much these days rainald reached across the table for the wine flagon well i think brien ought to be the one to talk to maude come now brien you need not look so surprised it makes sense after all anyone with eyes to see knows you fancy her so maude must know it too if you he stopped abruptly for brien had just jerked the wine flagon out of his reach let it be he said in a voice lowpitched and dangerous or youll have reason to regret it it was suddenly very tense ranulf was fascinated for although it was almost universally agreed that brien was a man of uncommon honour hed heard others say too that he made a bad enemy but hed not seen that side of brien not until now rainald not another word do you ever think ere you talk at times id swear your tongue and brain cannot possibly be connected the man just threatened me robert im supposed to ignore that robert leaned over and grasped the younger mans wrist you heed me and heed me well nothing is easier to start and harder to stop than rumors of scandal i do not ever want to hear you slander our sisters good name again is that understood rainald was accustomed to giving his temper free rein but the hostility was repressive walling him in on all sides i can see i am not wanted here he said and shoved his chair back no one tried to stop him as he stalked toward the door and pulled it open almost at once he recoiled maude however did you know i was outside rainald id not even knocked yet but maudes smile wavered as she stepped into the room for the men it was like watching a shield crack after taking an unexpected blow for in the instant that her defenses were down they saw with unsparing clarity her surprise her suspicion and her hurt you are getting forgetful robert you neglected to let me know wed convened a council for this afternoon is it not lucky she said tonelessly that i happened by robert got slowly to his feet i asked them here maude i am troubled by your recent actions and i thought it best to tell them of my qualms ere i sought you out that is true david agreed as far as it goes but i cannot let him take all the responsibility upon himself i share his qualms too lass i suspect we all do i see sonow that youve had a chance to tally up my shortcomings have you reached any conclusions is there any hope for me at all or should i just abdicate at the first available opportunity you cannot abdicate until after your coronation rainald muttered and if you stay true to form youre likely to offend the archbishop of canterbury so mortally that youll end up having to crown yourself i am sorry that you find my behavior so shameful rainald but youve not always been so critical have you as i recall you said nary a word of protest when i bestowed the earldom of cornwall upon you rainald flushed but before he could retaliate robert said swiftly maude we need to talk about this ive tried to tell you of my concern but you seem to have defective hearing these days i labored long and hard to win the londoners over and in one angry audience you undid all my efforts they are now convinced that having you as queen will be putting a cat amongst the pigeons and it need not have come to that you are making enemies faster than i can count them and i do not understand why no you do not understandnone of you do but when she would have turned away ranulf stopped her tell us then he entreated make us understand maude we are not the enemy surely you know that she looked at him and then nodded yes she admitted i know the anger had drained out of her voice but so had the animation as they watched she walked to the window stood staring out at the regal silhouette of westminster abbey if stephen had taken me prisoner at arundel all resistance would have ended within hours of the words getting out youd have been loath to do it but youd have made your peace with him what else could reasonable men do she swung back to face them and was reassured by what she saw for they were listening intently but what happened after lincoln stephen and i had submitted our claims to trial by combat and i prevailed that should have been enoughbut it was not still men balked still they refused to recognize my right how many of stephens barons have come to my court where are these craven souls who abandoned stephen at lincoln robert beaumont hastened to make a truce in normandywith geoffrey but neither he nor waleran has made any peace overtures to me neither have the earls of northampton or surrey or pembroke even chesters brother has kept his distance and that after you saved his skin at lincoln maude i know they have been slow to submit to you but they will in time you must have patience robert i have been patient for more than five years and where has it gotten me when my norman barons learned of stephens defeat at lincoln did they rush to acclaim my victory you know betterthey offered my crown to stephens brother theobald and what did he do he tried to strike a deal with geoffrey if geoffreyd accept theobalds claim to tours and agree to set stephen free theobald would then recognize him as duke of normandy and king of englandgeoffrey not me but maude geoffrey did turn theobald down for the love of god rainald are you so blind that you cannot see how do you think that makes me feel how many times do they get to spit in my face stephen was crowned within three weeks of my fathers death more than four months have passed since our victory at lincoln and i am still waiting for my coronation that is four more months away from my sonsor did you never think of that henry is old enough to make the journey even if the younger lads are not i wanted him to be here for my coronation to watch the archbishop set upon my head the crown that will one day be his but the londoners have denied me that and yet you wonder robert why i love them not just put that question to my eightyearold son if you truly need an answer maude i do understand robert said i do not begrudge you a moment of your anger i am simply saying that you cannot always act upon that anger youve proven that you have the courage and perseverance and will to rule england now you must show the english that you have the discipline too maude said nothing but her silence was a concession of sorts and they took heart from it shed made mistakestoo many in truthbut shed learn from them encouraged robert crossed the chamber and kissed his sisters hand with deliberate formality subject to sovereign ranulf came over too only his was a brotherly kiss upon her cheek youll see he said it will get easier once you are crowned maude gave him a weary smile i hope so ranulf she said for there has been precious little joy in this queenship so far emerging from his tent the earl of northampton stood motionless for a few moments gazing upon matildas encampment newly hired mercenaries mingled with matildas vassals william de ypress flemings and the earls own men not quite a month had passed since hed offered his services to stephens queen hed have come much sooner had he not dreaded facing her cynics might assume that he was motivated by the arrival at maudes court of his stepfather and hated rival the scots king but it was more complex than that for hed been deeply shamed by his flight at lincoln he was a proud man one whod been held up to public ridicule and his disgrace was a gnawing cancer in his vitals he owed stephen a debt of honour and he was here in the lush kent countryside in an attempthowever ill advisedto repay it matilda had made it easy for him her need was too great to indulge in the luxury of reproaches or recriminations but if his welcome was warmer than he deserved the position he was expecting to fillmatildas mainstaywas already occupied the earl found it baffling that william de ypres had not offered his sword to the highest bidder he was equally astonished to see how high the fleming had risen in matildas estimation they made the oddest pair imaginable there was no question though of her trust and he had to admit that ypres seemed to accord matilda what hed rarely shown other womenrespect but if matilda had faith in the fleming northampton did not and he was determined to watch over stephens queen whether she wanted such protection or not stopping a soldier he asked about matildas whereabouts and it was no surprise to be told that she is conferring with the fleming my lord matilda and ypres were walking together not far from her tent heads down so intent upon their discussion that they did not at once notice the earls approach when they did matilda greeted him gravely looking so pale and tired that he felt a prickle of unease have you heard anything madame no word about the king for that was his secret fear he marveled sometimes that there had been no regretful announcement from bristol castle breaking the sorrowful news that stephen had been stricken by a mysterious mortal ailment nono word ive had just the one letter from stephen nothing since then matilda looked toward the fleming back to northampton willem thinks the time has come the intimacy of the flemish willem vexed him but the earl did not hesitate i think that he is right my lady youve sought to reason with the woman you promised her that stephen would abdicate and pledged castles and hostages as surety what more could you offer she did not believe me matilda said sadly and mayhap she was right for i could not be sure stephen would have agreed nonetheless you did try to avoid bloodshed my lady not only did she spurn your plea she would deny your son his just inheritance ypres is right and surely you know that so why do you hesitate soldiers had begun to move closer straining to hear some of them glanced away shyly as their eyes met matildas others grinned and doffed their hats neither ypres nor northampton would understand her reluctance even if shed tried to tell them theyd not comprehend for they knew war and accepted its consequences and its casualties it was not that easy for her it was a sobering realization that men would die because of her decision and her husband might well be one of them she fumbled at her throat for the reassuring feel of her crucifix thy will be done but how did she know if it was gods willor her own so be it she said i agree willem tomorrowat first light gervase de cornhill was one of londons wealthiest merchants as his bishopsgate street house unblushingly proclaimed it was newly built and of stone which made it a rarity in a city of wood and timber constructed after the fashion of a lords manor with a spacious great hall a private solar even a privy chamber instead of the usual outdoor latrine when the men began to arrive they were welcomed by a young maidservant and offered not ale but wine the beverage of the gentry if some of them thought that gervase was getting above himself others were impressed by his affluence and all hoped that good might come out of this urgent evening conclave rohese was not supposed to be in the hall but she was too curious to keep abovestairs she was afraid that she might be sent home if londons troubles were as bad as her cousin gervase feared and she did not want to go life was infinitely more interesting since shed been chosen to attend gervases wife agnes shed not been sure at first just what attending meant but it turned out to be easy enough assisting with agness grooming taking care of her clothes accompanying her in public and keeping her company in private just as young women of good birth did for the queen and ladies of rank no rohese definitely did not want to lose so agreeable a sinecure and so she lingered in the shadows intent upon eavesdropping for her future and londons had become one and the same if gervase sees you hell send you abovestairs straightaway agnes warned but she was an indulgent mistress and instead of banishing rohese to the bedchamber she soon found herself answering the girls eager queries about their influential guests it was indeed a gathering of distinction she said proudly there were several former sheriffs some past and present aldermen a magistrate john fitz ranulf and three members of the powerful buccuinte family oh rohese was staring at two newcomers to the hall by the saints she hissed who is he that is osborn huitdeniers no friend to gervase but too important not to include he is a justiciar like gervase and no not the balding stout one the other the young one agnes laughed oh you mean thomas he is a kinsman of osborns and his new clerk he was studying in paris but came home last year when his mother died and his father then got him this position with osborn that is his father over there gilbert becket one of the former sheriffs i mentioned he was quite prosperous once but lost most of his property in the great fire a few years back and never recovered but rohese was no longer listening for she had no interest whatsoever in the sire only in the son snatching a platter from the maidservant she swayed gracefuly across the hall up close she found thomas becket even more attractive tall and elegant with fair skin and gleaming dark hair favoring him with her most seductive smile she offered him wine but to her disappointment he politely declined she was not so easily discouraged though was mustering her forces for a counterattack when gervase happened to glance her way and that was that for her flirtation with master thomas becket i thank you all for coming gervase said striding to the center of the hall and ill waste no time getting to the heart of the matter i fear for our city under that spiteful womans reign london will be no more than a royal milch cow milked dry for the queens exchequer and that will be the least of our troubles geoffrey de mandeville is looking for any excuse to avenge the slaying of his wifes father and when we complain to our new queen i can assure you that it will be mandeville she heeds not us let me speak bluntly london will suffer untold hardships if the empress ever sits upon stephens throne for she have you gods ear gervase you know something the rest of us do not why do you use words like if and ever when you speak of her queenship id say that is no longer in doubt the bishop of winchester has already proclaimed her as lady of the english her coronation is but a formality and an inevitable one at that inevitable i think not osborn that is why i have summoned you here tonight to remind you that she has not been crowned yet it is not too late to save our cityif we have the courage to act and act now there were murmurings at that and osborn huitdeniers said forcefully i did not come to hear talk of treason how can it be treason to support our lawful king stephen is gods anointed not maude i say we keep it that way she cannot be crowned if the city rises up against her so there is still time you think we want that alien woman as our queen i do not for certes but still less do i want to see bloodshed sometimes john there is no other choice maude reminded me that her father was called the lion of justice well let me tell you about the justice he meted out to luke de barre most of you may not know of this for it happened in normandy some of the old kings barons had rebelled against him and it took months ere he was able to put the rising down waleran beaumont was amongst the rebel prisoners he was young though not yet twenty and the king was persuaded to take pity upon him he was eventually set free and even restored to favor but luke de barre was not so lucky for the king commanded that his eyes be put out with redhot awls men thought this was unjust as luke de barre was not one of the kings vassals and thus was not forsworn not guilty of treason but he was a poet and he had offended henry by his mocking scornful verses even the count of flanders pleaded on his behalf to no avail the king would not yield barre had made men laugh at him he said and there could be no forgiveness for that as it happened the sentence was never carried outbecause the poor wretch preferred death to blindness and beat his head against the wall of his dungeon until he died but the king did not relent and this i can tell you for true that maude is his daughter well get no more mercy from her than luke de barre did from henry his story seemed to have the desired effect men shifted uneasily in their seats a few blessed themselves as inconspicuously as possible osborn felt a chill the sheep did they not see that gervase was leading them right to the cliffs edge what does the fate of a norman lord have to do with us he demanded i do not deny that the empress is a vexing and overweening woman but she is not going to destroy our city that is for us to doif we heed reckless men like gervase de cornhill what will happen to us if we do rise up as he urges she will retreat only to come back with an army and lay siege to london how long could we hold out who is going to come to our aid i do not suppose that stephen commands too many men from his prison chamber at bristol i admit there is a risk but if we take a stand others will join us no one wants that woman as queen and men would be heartened by our defiance they would rise up too would and if they did not what would befall us then if the empress is even half as vengeful as gervase claims she would exact a dreadful price for our rebellion let gervase talk about longdead norman poets i say we talk about history closer to homelincoln is there a man here who does not know what that city suffered after it was taken by the empresss army do you truly want to see london reduced to the same pitiful straits the spectre of the ravaged ruins of lincoln was a powerful deterrent although gervase continued to argue he soon saw that he was swimming against the tide hed wager that most of the men agreed with him but they needed more than hope ere theyd commit to such a perilous course he subsided slumping down in his chair as the discussion ebbed and flowed around him if the fools would not listen what more could he do thomas becket had taken no part in the debate listening intently but voicing no opinion of his own when it was clear that osborns arguments were going to carry the day he asked his clerk to fetch him more wine thomas rose obligingly and it was then that he saw the monk being ushered across the hall toward gervase he paused to watch sensing something out of the ordinary was occurring silence gervase shouted suddenly ive just gotten an urgent message from bermondsey priory and it changes everything it seems there is a new player in this game brother anselm here has come at the behest of prior clarembald to bear witness he says that queen matilda and william de ypres have led an army out of kent and they are ravaging and burning south of the river that announcement unleashed brief pandemonium quiet gervase cried over and over until he got his way let brother anselm tell us what he knows it is true the monk said calmly he alone seemed untouched by the chaos permeating the hall they spared our priory but others were not so fortunate if it were not full dark you could see the smoke along the horizon and by the morrow theyll be in southwark as i said gervase repeated triumphantly this changes everything the queen is sending us an unmistakable messagethat we have as much to fear from her wrath as we do from maudes it is so unfair how can people hope to survive trapped between two armies what can we do is it not obvious we ally ourselves with the queen we keep faith with stephen and we show maude the mettle of true londoners this stirring declaration set off a burst of cheering osborn shuddered seeing his rental houses and his luxurious thames street home going up in flames a lifetimes work lost and for what lets not be hasty we must think this through must what was it youd asked osbornwho would come to our aid well now we knowqueen matilda i say we send word to her straightaway and this time gervase prevailed agreement was swift and almost unanimous on this midsummers eve london cast its fate with stephens queen june th the nativity of john the baptist was also known as midsummers day it was a popular festival celebrated with bonfires and flowering garlands and torchlit processions westminsters great hall was hung with st johns wort rue roses and vervain the palace cooks had been laboring all morning to produce a truly spectacular meal a trial run for maudes coronation banquet and the air was redolent with the aromas of simmering venison stew and roast swan and freshly baked bread as noon approached the guests were escorted into the hall then to their designated seats at the linendraped trestle tables while youths hurried to offer lavers of scented washing water and hand towels it was not until the first course was serveda savory rabbit soupthat maude had the opportunity to question robert about the bishop of winchesters conspicuous absence when you saw him this morn robert did he tell you hed not be attending what excuse did he offer i did not see him maude he has left westminster without a word to me where did he go i do not know i have to admit maude that im troubled in this disappearance of his i know you do not like hearing it but we have to make our peace with the manand it will not be easy if we cannot even find him maude set her spoon down most likely hes gone off to one of his manors to brood waiting to be coaxed back i understand that was his usual routine whenever he did not get his own way with stephen i never expected to be in sympathy with stephen but i can well imagine what he must have gone through after denying henry that archbishops mitre he so craved it amazes me that he had the backbone to hold fast she waited until a server had removed her soup bowl before turning back toward her brother nowwhat of the rumors about ypres is it true that he plundered and burned manors and villages south of the river have you been able to verify that yet my scouts have not returned but geoffrey de mandeville says it is true enough and he ought to know robert lowered his voice for the earl of essex had been given a seat of honor at the high table ive heard it claimed that half the whores in southwark spy for him and id not be surprised for little gets past him maude found it difficult to admit shed so misjudged stephens queen she was baffled too for she would never have expected matilda to put stephens life at risk but this was neither the time nor the place to discuss matildas astonishing metamorphosis and she contented herself with saying only i thought matilda had more common sense the conversation at their table was now focusing upon the continuing saga of the earl of chesters lordly banditry hed claimed proprietary rights over most of the prisoners captured at lincoln and those unlucky souls had been bled for exorbitant ransoms not always in money young gilbert de gant had been compelled to wed chesters niece as the price of his freedom and william peverel had been forced to yield nottingham castle but if the table talk was true it seemed that chester had pulled off an even more outrageous coup hed lured his old enemy the earl of richmond into an ambush cast the man into one of his dungeons and neglected to feed him until hed agreed to turn over galclint castle as usual chesters utter indifference to public opinion stirred amazement amusement disapproval and possibly even envy maudes feelings were not so ambivalent though her response was anger pure and simple once her coronation was over and she could concentrate upon matters of state she meant to teach the outlaw earl a sharp lesson in the powers of the crown he seemed to think he was above the laws of the land and for that she blamed stephen her father would never have tolerated such arrant breaches of the kings peace and neither would she she glanced down the table now toward her niece maud was giggling at something ranulf had just said if she was distressed on her husbands behalf she was concealing it remarkably well maude still thought it prudent to divert the conversation away from chesters manifold misdeeds and she signaled for silence i have good news to share i received a letter this morn from my husband he writes that the city of caen has yielded to him as have verneuil and nonancourt and he predicts that by summers end he will control all of normandy west of the river seine audible ripples of approval and relief eddied about the hall all were warweary and impatient for the succession dispute to be settled maude was not the only one who resented stephens barons for their stubborn reluctance to come to terms with political realities the venison stew was being ladled onto trenchers when a flustered youth was admitted to the hall insisting that he had an urgent message for the earl of essex geoffrey de mandeville rose at once and maude watched with interest as they conferred so did robert for it had occurred to them both that mandevilles spy system might have unearthed information about matildas whereabouts or intentions when the earl turned around they knew at once that whatever hed just learned was calamitous for the color had faded from his face and he was not a man to be easily shaken striding swiftly back to the high table he said the londoners are rising up against you madame they are massing in the streets making ready to march on westminster nothey would not dare yes he said flatly they would you can believe it or not as you choose but i do this lads master is a local merchant a man whos given me reliable information in the past and he is not likely to make a mistake of this magnitude osborn huitdenierss servant had trailed the earl to the dais and he nodded vigorously it is true my lady i swear it he assured maude solemnly by the time i reached ludgate the church bells had begun to peal throughout the city calling men to arms listencan you not hear maude and robert tilted their heads and indeed they could hear the distant muted chiming of church bells as stunned as maude was she rallied fast and got hastily to her feet still clutching her napkin thank god for the warning but well have to act at once if we hope to repel them robert the command is yours what command geoffrey de mandeville snapped were facing a mob not an army that is not a fight we can win but we ought to be able to get away ere they run maude was flabbergasted never robert was on his feet too maude he is right not only are we outnumbered but our wives and daughters are with us if wed been able to reach the towerbut we could never hope to keep them out of westminster and christ pity us if we try by now those at the high table knew of their peril men were pushing their chairs back ranulf had already reached maudes side with brien just a stride slower maudes niece was leaning over rainalds wife coaxing her to rise but beatrice seemed incapable of moving shed begun to make soft whimpering noises sounding eerily like a mewing kitten maude saw the truth of roberts words in their stricken faces but her every instinct fought against flight is there not some way that we can resist robert shook his head even if we could hold them off for a time there is another army on the loose just across the river how long do you think it would take the londoners to open their gates to matilda and ypres no maude if we stay we doom ourselves he glanced around at the hall now in a state of spreading confusion fear stood poised to strike and nothing was more contagious as he well knew if they hoped to head off utter panic theyd have to act swiftly i will tell them he offered if you wish no maude said it is for me to do wondering how she would ever find the words she moved toward the edge of the dais be silent so you may hear me she urged for there is something i must say the retreat from westminster was done without tumult and with military order according to a chronicle favorable to maudes cause one much more sympathetic to stephen described a panic and a disorderly flight the truth lay somewhere in between maude and her coterie got away safely to oxford but some of her adherents veered off on their own the londoners surged into a ghost palace food still heaped on trenchers in the deserted great hall chairs overturned doors oddly ajar open coffers burning candles and silence a few of the angry citizens were disappointed to have won by default most were relieved they celebrated by ransacking the palace carrying off clothes and bedding and belongings left behind and some sat down to enjoy maudes interrupted meal as word spread into the city people flocked into the streets again to cheer and hug and marvel at the ease of their triumph while church bells were rung with joyful exuberance until all of london reverberated with the clamorous silvertoned sounds of victory they had gathered at eastcheap to wait at this time of day the marketplace ought to have been thronged with people looking for bargains moving from stall to stall examining the fresh fish choosing the plumpest hens buying candles and pepper and needles the stalls were open but the fishmongers and cordwainers and butchers were doing no business despite the growing crowd the sun was hot flies were thick and the odors pungent no one complained though they talked and gossiped among themselves strangers soon becoming friends for the normally fractious and outspoken londoners had forgotten their differences at least for a day united in a common purpose and determined to revel in their triumph for they were pragmatic enough to understand this might be their only one now they joked and swapped rumors and waited with uncommon patience and at last they heard a cry swiftly picked up and echoed across the marketplace she is coming people had been clustered at the bridge lining both sides of the narrow street but matilda had not expected a crowd of this size nor did she expect the sudden cheer that went up as she came into view her mare shied and the earl of northampton kicked his stallion forward ready to grab her reins if need be william de ypres was content merely to watch hed learned by now that matilda was better able to take care of herself than most men realized matilda soon got her mare under control and reined in as the spectators pressed forward she found herself looking out upon a sea of friendly faces and she smiled at them wishing she could thank each and every one these londoners whod fought for stephen as his own barons would not we have made a beginning this day she said with your help good people we shall set my husband free and restore him to englands throne guildford england july william de ypres was taken at once to the queens presence despite the lateness of the hour not for the first time matilda found herself marveling at the flemings stamina he was past fifty his hair thinning into a silver fringe his skin as roughhewn as bark from constant exposure to sun wind and winter gales he was fighting age though as fiercely as hed fought all his foes continuing to expend his energy with the reckless abandon of a twentyyearold matilda knew he must be greatly fatigued for hed been in the saddle since dawn but she knew too that hed never admit to it ignoring his protests she insisted upon ordering him a meal from the kitchen and then stood over him while he ate it it still surprised her that she could have become fond of a man so likely to burn in hells hottest flames casting aside a drumstick ypres reached for a napkin can we forget about chicken now and talk instead of crowns i have news my lady about your enemy the empress my scouts were right she did indeed head for oxford but she did not tarry there for long and she and brother robert were soon riding west in all haste matilda stiffened bristol nogloucester most likely to confer urgently with miles ypres caught the echoes of alarm in her voice and gave her a level faintly admonitory look that is not a fear you ought to dwell upon madame it serves for naught i know matilda admitted i have no reason to think maude capable of outright murder andeven if desperation did drive her to it i cannot believe that robert would ever agree but such comforting certitude comes more easily to me during the daylight hours alone at night i begin to hear whispers in the dark i cannot swear to you madame that you have no cause for fear nor will i deny that you have put your husband in greater peril but had you done nothing hed have no chance whatsoever of regaining his throne or his freedom remember what he was facing a lifetimes confinement with no hope of reprieve with the stakes that high id willingly gamble my life on the outcome and from what i know of your husband i suspect he would too matilda smiled wanly you do find your own way willem anyone else would have reassured me that stephens life is not truly at risk you assure me instead that hell go to his grave bearing me no grudge ypres grinned he was always encouraged whenever matilda essayed a jest however tentative or forced for hed initially feared that she lacked any humor whatsoever shed moved to the solar window gazing out at the summer darkness after a few moments of silence she said i have news of my own i had a clandestine visit from stephens brother whilst you were gone ypres showed no surprise but then he was the most cynical soul shed ever met always expecting the worst of men and rarely disappointed the bishop is seeking to mend fences is he let me seehe did not want to forsake stephen but he had no choice for he had to put the good of holy church above all else however deeply it pained him if i did not know better id swear you were there willem for that is exactly what he said by the time he was done hed even managed to make his betrayal seem almost heroic hed rarely heard her sound so bitter it was easy enough to guess what he would say but what of you madame what did you tell him i wanted to spurn his hypocrisy matilda confessed to curse his treachery and revile him as cain instead i made myself smile i let him clasp my hand and i lied i said i understood and then i told him the truth that we need his help we do he said succinctly i know and to save stephen id have made a deal with the devil himself matilda paused in truth i think i did word soon spread of maudes return to oxford she wasted no time conferring with her uncle david the scots king and then summoning the others to the castle solar they were heartened to find miles at her side for he had the gift of the best battle commanders that ability to banish doubts and exorcise the spectre of defeat by the sheer contagious force of his own selfassurance his presence seemed to have bolstered maudes spirits too she looked tired and thin but resolute we have made mistakes most of them mine she said surprising them by her candor fortunately mistakes can be made right and that is why i have called you here that had not been an easy admission for maude to make but she could not deny even to herself that she bore much of the blame for this sudden downturn in her fortunes she still believed that her grievances were justified shed not been able to argue though with miless blunt assessment of her plight had she paid more heed to roberts cautious counsel shed have been spared the humiliation of being chased out of her own capital by those misbegotten knavish londoners they at least would pay for their treachery geoffrey de mandeville would see to that and she told them then of her proposed pact with the earl of essex one which would grant him the sheriffdoms and justiciarships of london middlesex and hertfordshire would promise him the bishop of londons castle at stortford and agree to make no peace with the londoners his mortal enemies without his consent that was not well received there were murmurings disapproving frowns and brien said skeptically is it wise to give mandeville so much power when i think of men worthy of trust he is not the first one to come to mind we do not trust him either maude conceded and miles stirred laughter by saying brusquely id wager that even the mans own mother did not trust him but we do need him we cannot allow the londoners rebellion to go unpunished the sooner we regain control of the city the sooner we can get our lady crowned stephens kingship has been a stinking corpse for nigh on six months now i say we bury it once and for all that was the sort of tough confident talk they needed to hear but they needed answers too and john marshal was not shy about seeking them that sounds well and good but ere we go looking for shovels what about the chief mourner at this funeral what about the bishop of winchester geoffrey de mandeville told me that one of his spies trailed the bishop to the queens castle at guildford until now robert had taken no part in the discussion there was a deliberation in his movements that bespoke exhaustion and he was carrying all of his fiftyone years heavily these days we heard the same rumor he said we have decided therefore that i should seek out the bishop in winchester do what i can to soothe his wounded pride and assuage his anger we can only hope it is not too late but if he does mean to ally himself with stephens queen better we find out now we need to know our enemies speaking of enemies miles prompted glancing toward maude and robert ought we not to tell them about stephen robert took up the challenge with obvious reluctance when we reached gloucester i sent to bristol for my wife she brought troubling news on two different occasions stephen was found out in the bailey each time after dark clearly we erred in taking him at his word he cannot be trusted maude had been arguing that all along and it was hard to resist a tart i told you so even a fortnight ago she wouldnt have but how could she decry their poor judgment nowafter the london calamity stephen had none to defend him the men still admired his battlefield bravery but much of their sympathy had been left in the dust on the londonoxford road even ranulf acknowledged the danger shifting uneasily in his seat he asked what will you do we shall see to it maude said coolly that he does not get a third chance to escape stephens jerked upright on the bed the dreams terrors were already fading he no longer remembered what had set his heart to racing caused the sweat to break out on his skin like this so much he thought for sleeping during the day but what else was there to do who would have guessed that a prisoners greatest foe would be sheer boredom getting to his feet he wandered restlessly about the chamber because hed been lucky enough to have been born male and a kings grandson hed passed his adult years doing as he pleased hed been spared maudes painful lessons in obedienceuntil now the room was stifling on a hot july day like this he would have been out hunting how many more months would he be caged here tethered like one of his own falcons finding himself at the table stephen picked up a book soon set it down again he knew there were those who read for fun but that was a pleasure which still eluded him the window was unshuttered he could see menatarms crossing the bailey a groom unsaddling a lathered gelding several blackclad benedictine monks these months of enforced celibacy had given him a new respect for those men who willingly chose to deny the hungers of the flesh not even for the love of god could he have forsaken the love of women he sat down in a chair by the window and tilted it back at a precarious angle thoughts of matilda were invariably bittersweet this past week had been particularly difficult for their sixteenth wedding anniversary was approaching he refused to let himself believe though that he might never again make love to his wife without hope he could not endure nor keep faith with god if this ordeal was indeed a test if he must prove himself to the almighty as a true christian and a worthy king he could not let himself despair he could not doubt that he would eventually prevail church bells were pealing in the distance what was matilda doing at this hour was she still in england or had she taken their children back to boulogne he knew shed be loyal to her last breath nor did he doubt her courage or resourcefulness hed never believed that women were weak his mother had effectively dispelled that male myth early in his childhood but matilda could not be his salvation for she labored under the same burden as maude a woman could not act alone she could not lead men into battle maudes claim to the crown depended upon support from men shed never have been able to mount a serious challenge to his kingship if shed not had robert to fight her battles in england and geoffrey to fight them in normandy but matilda had no robert of gloucester or geoffrey of anjou the men she ought to have been able to turn tohis brotherswere unable or unwilling to come to her aid theobald was too far away to be of assistance and henry too treacherous nor could he expect men like the beaumonts and the fleming ypres to rally to matilda men whod so shamelessly abandoned him on the battlefield no he did not see how he could winbarring a miracleand it seemed very presumptuous to expect the almighty to intervene actively on his behalf if the opportunity arose again hed risk an escape but his best hope was that maude would lose that shed blunder badly enough to confirm all those queasy suspicions about her queenship maude or a miraclehis was stephen acknowledged wryly a most unlikely battle plan a shout floated up through the open window and he tipped his chair back still farther craning his neck to see a rider was coming through the gatehousea courier from maude of all the crosses he had to bear his sense of isolation was surely the most onerous it was all the more frustrating for being a new burden up until a month ago his guards had kept him apprised of the happenings beyond bristols walls even his enemies had never denied his charm and it had been easy enough for him to disarm his young gaolers with his affability and his humor only one guard had been immune to his friendly overtures a burly freckled youth from shropshire whose cousin had been one of the shrewsbury garrison hanged at stephens command the hostile godwin had still been a source of news though hed been the first to tell stephen that his brother the bishop had betrayed him and when the londoners capitulated hed come at once to gloat but without warning it all changed the well went dry now stephens questions went unanswered deflected with shrugs and silence he was baffled by their sudden reticence if maude had been crownedas surely she must by nowwhy were they so loath to tell him so confinement had sharpened his senses and he heard the muffled footsteps on the stairs long before a key turned in the lock he was puzzled for supper was still hours away but pleased to a man as gregarious as stephen solitude was a punishment in and of itself the first man into the chamber was a disappointment thoughgodwin the embittered shropshireman the second guard was a stranger to stephen but he smiled at sight of the third for hed become fond of edgar a painfully shy youth whose stoopshouldered height and harelip had earned him a cruel nickname from his fellow guards scarecrow edgar did not return stephens smile he looked so ill at ease that stephen glanced instinctively toward godwin when he did he set his chair down with a thud staring in disbelief at the dangling chains godwin smiled grimly id begun to despair of this day ever coming but it was worth the wait by corpus it was i daresay you think a king deserves shackles of silver but youll just have to make do with the sort used on common folk like my poor cousin stephen shoved his chair back with enough force to overturn it although hed not yet spoken it was impossible to misread the defiance in his stance and edgar said hastily please my lord do not resist theyll just summon more men to hold you down stephen had taken a backward step his eyes flicking from the chains to the closest weapon at hand a pewter candlestick but edgar had spoken the simple truth this was not a confrontation he could hope to win he slowly unclenched his fists then stepped forward and held out his wrists for the manacles stephens rage had sustained him until the guards withdrew but as soon as he was alone his shoulders slumped and he sank down in the window seat the shackles were surprisingly heavy and had already begun to chafe his skin he jerked the chain suddenly and futilely wincing as the iron bit into his wrist like a hobbled horse better to have died on the field in lincoln than this edgar came back at dusk alone and apologetic carrying stephens supper tray stephen was still sitting in the window seat he ignored the food seemed equally indifferent to edgar and the youth became flustered under his aloof uninterested gaze even if stephens friendliness was false as godwin claimed it mattered to edgar that this man a crowned king remembered his name looked upon his harelip without flinching and when caught out in the bailey concocted a story to deflect suspicion from edgar whod forgotten to lock his chamber look my lord ive brought you these he said nervously with your permission i can wrap these rags around the irons that will keep them from rubbing your wrists raw stephen met edgars imploring eyes and nodded curtly edgar knelt began to fumble with the rags i am so sorry my lord it does not seem right to me shackling you like this i do not blame you for trying to escape for any man would but it gave them an excuse you see mayhap once the empress is able to be crowned she will relent what are you saying edgar maude has not been crowned yet why not edgar hesitated if i tell you my lord please do not let anyone know you heard it from me the empress cannot be crowned for the londoners rebelled and chased her out of the city christ jesus have they forgotten what befell lincoln they are safe enough from the empresss wrath at least for now they have your lady wife to protect them need not fear as long as she holds london matilda holds london stephen leaned forward grasped edgars arm who is helping her the beaumonts my brother name of god lad tell me it is the fleming my lord no one knows how your lady won him over but she ypres you are telling me the truth edgar you swear it is so edgar nodded solemnly and stephen pulled away leaning back in the window seat edgar waited a moment or so before asking tentatively do you not want me to fix your manacles my lord stephen merely shrugged as if the chains no longer mattered and then startled edgar by laughing edgars eyes were wide for he could find no humor whatsoever in stephens plight a consecrated king shackled like a felon my lord for the past six months edgar ive been telling myself that as much as i needed a miracle it was foolish to expect one but id forgotten stephen said beginning to laugh again that i had my own miracle all along i married her brien fitz count was standing upon the battlements of oxford castle watching as the day died away the sun was haloed in brightness deepening from molten gold to a fiery copperred and seemed to have set the river on fire gazing down at that shimmering sunsettinted current brien found himself thinking of past battles remembering rivers that had run red with the blood of the wounded and the slain he was so caught up in his own thoughts that he did not at once hear his name being called by the time he did maude was coming up the battlement wallwalk toward him ive been searching all over for you she said im glad i finally thought to look up he made room for her at the embrasure and together they watched as the sun disappeared beyond the distant hills did you arrange matters with geoffrey de mandevilles vassal he asked and maude nodded yes a man named hugh ding mandeville is sending him to normandy to obtain geoffreys approval of our pact and then on into anjou to get my sons consent henry will enjoy that maude said with a smile for this will be his first official act as heir to the throne by now the vivid sky was past its peak the colors beginning to fade brien turned away from the embrasure focusing all of his attention upon maude did you say you were looking for me my lady yesi wanted to talk to you about an earldom brien smiled in all the years ive known miles ive never seen him so joyful is all ready for the ceremony yeson the morrow i will confer upon miles the earldom of hereford it is no more than he deserves for he has been amongst my most stalwart supporters but so have you brien it would give me great pleasure to grant you an earldom too will you not reconsider when he shook his head still smiling maude moved closer looking up intently into his face but why brien you have been steadfast a loyal ally and as dear a friend as i could hope to have why will you not let me reward you as ive done the others brien was no longer smiling i want no reward for serving you if i can offer you nothing else i can give you thisthe certainty that i seek only to help you claim the crown that is your birthright as their eyes met maude found she could not look away ah brien she said almost inaudibly i begin to think you could be more dangerous to me than stephen her words seemed to surprise her as much as they did brien for color suddenly burned its way up into her face and throat he drew a sharp breath and then reached for her hand bringing it up to his mouth to anyone watching it was a perfectly proper gesture of respect but maude knew better and she freed her hand from his clasp she did not draw away though not until a sudden shout echoed from the west gate riders coming in maude and brien moved back to the battlements peering down through the gathering dusk at the approaching horsemen they were still some distance away just crossing the bridge but maude recognized the rangy grey stallion in the lead for it was her brothers favorite mount it is robert she exclaimed i do not like this brien such a rapid return from winchester does not bode well for us robert soon confirmed the worst of maudes forebodings in a solar poorly lit by smoldering cresset lamps he told them that his mission had failed the bishop of winchester was he reported as slippery as any eel impossible to pin down without a forked stick the bishop had refused to return with him to oxford but hed denied conniving with matilda to restore stephen to the throne hed insisted that his only concern was the welfare of holy mother church disclaimed any ambitions of his own contended that he bore maude no grudge for her intemperate behavior provided that she kept faith in the future and robert concluded bleakly i believed none of it i daresay the bishop knows far more of scriptures than i do maude said and i am not sure if this comes from the book of matthew or luke but the message itself is beyond dispute he that is not with me is against me she paused her gaze sweeping the solar moving from face to face she found what she sought a unity of purpose and a grim resolve to do what must be done what had been lost in london would be recouped at winchester stephens kingship died at lincoln she said i agree with miles that burial is long overdue well god willing we shall hold the funeral in winchester winchester england july william de chesney finally located his brother roger in a shabby alehouse on gold street in unseemly proximity to the church of all saints what sort of peculiar folk do you have in this town i stopped a monk on the street asked him the whereabouts of the bishops palace at wolvesey and damn me if else but he spat into the dirt at my feet roger laughed there is a sea of bad blood between the bishop and the brothers of hyde abbey for more than six years he has been blocking their election of a new abbot why you ask very simple lad as long as they lack an abbot bishop henry gets to control their revenues will shook his head ruefully if men only knew how easy it was to commit legal larceny banditry would be cut in half overnight that fits though with what ive heard about bishop henry that he loves money overly well i came to winchester seeking a position in his household as you suggested but first i ought to ask you this is he miserly with those in his service if so id rather look elsewhere you need not fret about that he is tightfisted for certes but he is also shrewd enough to understand that a man gets only what he pays for in this life serve him well and he will reward you as you deserve let him down and you get no second chance sowhat say you will shrugged if im going to sell my sword it might as well be to the church mayhap the bishop will put in a good word for me come judgment day his brother laughed again scattered a few coins onto the table and they sauntered out into the sunlight this was wills first visit to winchester and roger insisted upon acting as his guide keeping up a running commentary as they ambled along high street also known as cheap or cheapside the castle was situated in the southwest corner of the city and had supplanted the old palace as a royal residence bishop henry had sweettalked stephen into turning the palace over to himback in the days when they were still talking roger said with a grin he also held the bishops palace at wolvesey off to the southeast and had embarked upon an ambitious building project to make wolvesey the wonder of winchester will liked what he saw a city prosperous and thriving while roger didnt know the exact population he estimated it to be between six and eight thousand which made it one of englands larger cities it had its own fair its own saint and a proud history for it was once a roman settlement later the capital of the saxon kingdom of wessex and several english kings had tombs within the great cathedral so many bells were chiming that it sounded as if there were a house of god on every corner and indeed there were too many parish churches to count roger reported as well as the priory of st swithun the nunnery of st mary and just beyond the walls hyde abbey but he added there are alehouses and bawdyhouses too lad and i might be coaxed into taking you on a sinners search after dark they bought apples from a peddler fended off a tenacious street beggar then stopped to watch as several small boys threw mud upon a man in the pillory he raged and cursed but could not defend himself from the onslaught for once a mans hands and head were locked into the wooden frame he was effectively immobilized the chesney brothers saw no reason to spoil the boys fun but when a drunkard was attracted by the commotion and started scrabbling around for goodsized rocks they sent him reeling on his way shaming a prisoner was permitted even encouraged but stoning was not for the pillory was a punishment for petty crime serious offenders could expect the gallows out on andover road the entertainment over roger and will continued east along high street past the royal palace that was now the bishops stronghold where they lingered to flirt with a pretty girl strolling by it was midday therefore by the time they reached the water gate that gave entry into the precincts of wolvesey palace their leisurely afternoon ended abruptly though upon their arrival at wolvesey the atmosphere was charged with tension and roger de chesney was ushered at once into the bishops private quarters in the west hall no one challenged his brother and so he followed too will was expecting luxurythe bishops lavish lifestyle had long provided fuel for gossipand the chamber furnishings did not disappoint the walls were hung with rich embroiderings the bed was vast in size piled with featherfilled pillows and silk coverlets a polished oaken table held gleaming silver candlesticks an ivory chess set and several leatherbound books what startled will was not the elegant surroundings but the man standing in the midst of them a thin nondescript figure clad in the anonymous black habit and cowl of a benedictine monk my lord roger seemed baffled by the monks presence too he sounded very dubious of course it is me the bishop said impatiently jerking back the hood of his cowl why did you take so long to answer my summons he gave roger no chance to respond never mind for weve no time to waste that accursed woman is approaching winchester with an army roger drew a quick comprehending breath youll not be waiting around to welcome the empress into the city then the bishop frowned he could never understand why so many men insisted upon joking about matters of lifeordeath urgency why else would i be wearing this monks cowl it will enable me to slip out of the city undetected and by the time maude reaches the east gate i ought to be well on the way to my castle at waltham i will then seek aid from my own vassals from my sisterinlaw and the fleming but it will be up to you roger to hold wolvesey and the palace until we can break their siege can i rely upon you roger nodded i will do my best my lord bishop good man turning aside the bishop unlocked a small casket and tossed a pouch toward roger he caught it deftly it had a reassuring heft and clinked loudly as he tucked it away my lordthis is my brother william he wishes to serve you too the bishop glanced over at will nodded briefly but before he could dismiss them roger said hastily your gracewait i must be clear about what you expect of me you once told me that if we found ourselves under siege i was to take whatever measures i must to hold out is that still your wish the bishop gave him a level look silent leges inter arma that was said by a great man roger a roman statesman named cicero in time of war the laws are silent upon her arrival in winchester maude took up residence in the castle she then summoned the bishop to her presence the bishops men stalled for time sending forth the bishops response that he would prepare himself once they were certain that his delay was in fact defiance robert dispatched one of his men with a formal challenge he sent a spear thudding into the gate of wolvesey palace and the siege of winchester began on saturday noon the second day of august in the year of christ waleran beaumont count of meulan and earl of worcester arrived in winchester to make his peace with the empress maude waiting with two of his household knights to be admitted into the castles great hall he sought to sound jaunty and nonchalant well here i gointo the shewolfs den say a prayer for my pride which is about to be shredded into salad and served up to maude for dinner there was too much truth in the joke for humor though this was an ordeal he was dreading to his surprise and relief he discovered that his anticipated submission had been more painful than the actual event proved to be it was not an experience hed want to repeat he felt that maude kept him too long on his knees and she made no effort to conceal her satisfaction but hed expected to be bleeding profusely by now knowing what a lethal weapon her tongue could be he rememberedin disheartening detailtelling maude that hed beg his bread by the roadside ere hed acknowledge her as queen and he well knew that maude also remembered so as grateful as he was for her unlikely restraint he marveled at it too mayhap those londoners had done the country a good turn scared some sense into her but noit would not last if ever there was a woman unable to learn from her mistakes it was this one for certes no more than stephen could if the lord god plucked him out of his bristol prison on the morrow and restored him to power at westminster nothing would change hed still go on forgiving men he ought to hang promising more than he could deliver failing to keep the kings peace maude and stephen a match made in hell what was it geoffrey de mandeville had once saida lifetime ago ah yes that maude would listen to no one and stephen to anyone had there ever he wondered been a war like this was there a single soulnot related to them by blood or marriagewho truly wanted to see either one of them on englands throne maude interrupted his morose musing with a pointed query are you here my lord earl to assist in the siege of the bishops strongholds no madame i am not waleran admitted i shall be returning to normandy straightaway forcing himself to add a politic with your permission of course i promised your lord husband that i would aid in his campaign geoffrey or maudethat was verily like choosing sodom over gomorrah how much the old king had to answer for if only hed named robert of gloucester as his heir how much grief and misery they all could have been spared being born out of wedlock seemed a minor matter indeed when compared with maudes unwomanly ways geoffreys perverse humors and stephens wellmeaning weakness no by the rood hed had enough hed do what he must to safeguard his holdings in france but if he never saw these english shores again so much the better he knew maude would make him pay for his past allegiance to stephen and so he was not surprised when she demanded that he turn over to her the worcestershire abbey of bordesley for it had been founded on royal desmesne lands given to waleran by stephen and maude refused to recognize stephens right to make such grants waleran yielded with what grace he could muster which wasnt much as you will madame he said grudgingly i shall inform the abbot that he got no further for maude was staring past him half rising from her seat on the dais turning he saw her brother striding up the aisle toward them maude ranulf was laboring for breath hed come on the run the window he panted look maude darted down the dais steps with her uncle david and waleran close behind the shutters were open wide maude leaned out and then gasped for the blue summer sky was sullied by an ominous cloud of billowing black smoke high street was thronged with agitated people some running toward the fire others fleeing it ranulf and gilbert realized almost at once that they should not have taken their horses they had to keep reining in to avoid trampling the men and women surging into their path and as the scent of smoke reached the animals they began to balk after his mount shied and gilbert banged his head against an overhanging alehouse pole ranulf signaled for a halt well make better time on foot he said swinging from the saddle he was handing the reins to his squire when he heard the screaming the crowd was scattering people ducking into doorways of the shops lining both sides of the street ranulf followed their example but then he saw her a young girl sprinting toward them her hair streaming out behind her her skirts smoldering several people were shouting telling her to roll on the ground but she was too terrified to heed them ranulf doubted that she even heard a woman tried to catch her arm as she ran by her fingers just falling short ranulf had better luck flinging himself forward he sent the girl sprawling then scooped her up and dropped her into the closest horse trough she thrashed about wildly drenching ranulf too and when he lifted her out sputtering and choking she clung to his neck and sobbed she was even younger then he had first thought only ten or so her entire body shuddering with every breath she took her wet hair was in his face had an unpleasant burnt smell but he couldnt tell if she was trembling from fear or pain or both by now several wouldbe samaritans had gathered around and when he asked a gangling youth in a bloodied butchers smock identified her as aldith the wainwrights lass his squire was standing a few feet away having somehow managed to keep their frightened horses from bolting and ranulf entrusted the weeping child into his care take her back to the castle luke this lad here will help you and then find her familyright the butchers apprentice nodded shyly and the crowd parted to let them through the royal palace was just a few streets ahead already ranulf could feel the heat could see the flames shooting skyward along the north side of high street several shops and houses were ablaze and the fire was moving with deadly speed even as he watched flames leapt across the narrow width of the closest side street and ignited a thatched roof when he reached the siege site he stopped in shock unable to credit what he was seeing firebrands were being shot from the palace walls launched from mangonels in a sizzle of sparks and cinders raining death down indiscriminately upon citizens and soldiers alike the scene meeting his eyes was chaotic men were shoving and cursing coughing whenever smoke blew their way loading mangonels with heavy stones as archers sought to drive the enemy off the battlements in the midst of so much urgent activity it took him some time to find robert his brothers face was streaked with soot and sweat his eyes redrimmed his voice hoarse from shouting orders at sight of ranulf he said wearily can you believe it those whoresons set fire to their own city i saw this done once before in normandy the breton commander put lisieux to the torch rather than have it fall to geoffrey but he was a mercenary whilst bishop henryjesu robert he is a man of god tell that to those people out on high street watching their homes and livelihoods go up in smoke others were clamoring now for roberts attention his own captains a man who claimed to be the citys royal reeve some of the imperiled merchantsand a tearful nun sister you ought not to be here my lord earl you must help us our nunnery is afire robert swore softly ill do what i can he said seizing her elbow and steering her toward the greater safety of the barricades ranulfs first impulse was to follow but hed promised maude that hed report back to her straightaway he hesitated and then john marshal solved his dilemma for him ive just heard that the fire is spreading to the west and i own two houses on scowrtene street i could use some help if it turns out to be true ranulf didnt care for marshals peremptory tone but he didnt take it personally for those who knew him joked that marshal would be barking orders to st peter himself if ever he made it to heavens gate moreover scowrtene street was on the way back to the castle and so he and gilbert trailed after john marshal as he hastened along high street using his elbows and shoulders to clear his path by now the turmoil was spreading as fast as the fire most of the shops had family dwellings abovestairs and frantic men and women were trying to save all they could staggering out of their threatened houses with whatever belongings they could carry away others were desperately seeking to contain the fires dousing nearby homes and shops with water forming bucket brigades brooks ran down the center of several streets but they were shallow meandering streams meant to sweep away garbage dumped into the streets never to quench a conflagration such as this ranulf marveled at the courage of the people they kept plunging into smokefilled buildings to retrieve what they could and when they heard that st martins church in fleshmonger street was ablaze they rallied to the rescuethe elderly and the young as well as the ablebodiedall responding to the priests frenzied plea for help john marshal had quickened his pace beginning to curse for smoke was spiralling up ahead by the time they reached the corner marshals worst fears were confirmed one of his houses was already in flames and the other seemed likely to be consumed too the neighborhood residents were trying to save the rest of the street by soaking down the roofs some were demanding more drastic measures insisting that they must pull down those houses already doomed in the hopes of creating a fire break john marshal at once allied himself with the men arguing against it for his second house was among those to be sacrificed under normal circumstances he would easily have prevailed for he was a baron a man with a notoriously quick temper and a sword at his hip but the circumstances were anything but normal and these men were in danger of losing all they had the argument raged on and might well have come to blows if not for the screaming it was high and shrill and filled with too much terror to ignore they turned toward the sound as a woman lurched into their midst falling to her knees you are lords she sobbed you can save him john marshal pulled away when she plucked at his arm his sense of chivalry was stunted in the best of times ranulf was more obliging but she was almost incoherent and he did not know what she wanted of them it was not until she gasped out the word pillory that one of the men understood oh christ there was a man locked in the pillory the woman sobbed again i could not get him free she choked clutching now at ranulf hurry she pleaded please hurry ranulf was already in motion running back toward high street the others at his heels turning the corner he came to a horrified halt the closest house was ablaze and collapsing rafters had fallen upon the pillory setting it afire the man was engulfed in flames even his hair was on fire and there was a sickening stench of burning flesh but he was still alive his mouth contorted in a silent scream ranulf lunged forward but the heat drove him back when he tried again gilbert grabbed him by both arms it is too late ranulf we cannot let him burn to death ranulf wrestled free but by then john marshal was there shoving him aside as he drew his sword ranulf shouted but the sword was already thrusting downward it was a clean powerful stroke decapitated the man with one blow splattered with blood ranulf stumbled backward fighting queasiness the other men looked sick too one had doubled over and was vomiting into the dirt several were trying to keep the woman from seeing to no avail she screamed just once then crumpled to the ground almost at john marshals feet sheathing his sword he said matteroffactly id hope that someone would do as much for me they watched him in silence stunned not so much by his act as by the realization that he was utterly unaffected by it with the coming of night the city took on an eerie awful beauty flames lit up the darkness for miles smoke shrouded the town in a garish orange haze and each time the wind shifted embers drifted down like fiery snowflakes it was past midnight but no bells were chiming the hour too many churches lay in ruins a few fires still burned but the worst seemed over ranulf fervently hoped so never had he been so exhausted finding an overturned horse trough he sank down upon it not looking up until he heard footsteps crunching through the ashes and debris brien did not have to proclaim his fatigue his slow uneven step did it for him upon recognizing ranulf he limped over and ranulf made room for him on the trough did you hurt yourself i fell off a ladder brien did not elaborate and ranulf did not probe theyd all seen sights this night that theyd want only to forget they sat in silence for a time absorbed in thoughts neither wanted to share but then briens head came up horses he said and they watched as riders emerged from the shadows a moment later both men were on their feet maudes name an unspoken echo between them they reached her even before she reined in insisting that she should not be there that it was too dangerous that she must return to the castle where shed be safe maude heard them out with unusual patience and then said simply i could not wait any longer had to see for myself do you know where robert is and is it true that st marys nunnery could not be saved no it all burned brien moved closer to maudes restive mare fighting the urge to reach for her reins i do not mean to belabor the point but some of the bishops men might still be loose in the city and if you were recognized brien enough maude frowned but as she gazed down into his face her mood changed abruptly and she surprised them by yielding if it will ease your mind ill return to the castle but i want you both to come back with me you look as if either one of you could be toppled over by a feather and little wonder after such a night as this maudes guards could not hide their relief and hovered protectively around her when she insisted upon a pace slow enough to accommodate brien and ranulf as they walked along high streets smoldering trail of misery ranulf found himself wondering what would become of these people burned out of their homes and their shops winchester was in for a wretched winter he concluded bleakly just as a shower of sparks blew across their path spooking the horses maude was a good rider and soon quieted her mare but then she looked up uneasily at the sky tell me i am wrong she said tell me the wind is not rising they could not for they felt it too the wind was indeed picking up flames that had almost died down were surging back to life embers kindling anew flames burning higher and hotter putting the city again in peril the fire raged through the night and into the following day driven by gusting winds the flames razed much of winchester north of high street by midmorning airborne embers and cinders had soared over the city wall onto the shingled roofs of hyde abbey the monks managed to save most of their livestock but their church chapter house infirmary kitchen and stables were burned to the ground the sky was an overcast ashen shade the air humid and still as if the nights firestorm had never been daylight revealed a scene of widespread desolation ashes and rubble and charred fragments of shattered lives maude was shocked and shaken by what she saw had she been asked about a kings responsibilities she would have said that he must safeguard the subjects of his realm for scriptures spoke of saving the poor from the sword and feeding the hungry but faced with the reality of ita city in ruins people homeless and in despairshe was suddenly at a loss what could she possibly do to ease suffering on a scale like this she was accompanied by william pont de larche sheriff of hampshire and castellan of winchesters royal castle by her brothers and miles and brien all of whom had argued in vain against this expedition and by the newly arrived archbishop of canterbury who seemed stunned by what he was finding maude and the archbishop had wanted to visit the burnedout nuns of st marys but robert balked at that for the nunnery was perilously close to both siege sites he was so adamant that they had to content themselves with an offer of shelter until the nunnery could be restored but who would rebuild the shops and homes of the townspeople it was a question that shadowed maude as they inspected the scorched wreckage of high street a troubling one for she had no answer william pont de larche proved to be too knowledgeable a guide for he had fought the fires all night long and there seemed to be no tragedy that hed not heard about no sorrow that had escaped him he pointed out a blackened shell where a child had died he reeled off the casualty list of the citys churchesat least twenty he said mayhap more he showed them the spot where the pillory prisoner had met his gruesome death and he told them what had occurred at st marys church over in tanner street the priest had rushed back inside to retrieve the holy relicsst swithuns tooth and straw from the christ childs mangerand had been overcome by smoke when three parishioners attempted to rescue him the roof collapsed trapping them all inside our city will never be the same he said mournfully and there were none to refute him people were wandering about like sleepwalkers as if the full magnitude of their loss had not yet sunk in many clutched bundledup clothes candlesticks blankets whatever theyd been able to snatch from the flames some merely stared blankly at maude as she passed by others sought to get close to her and when her guards kept them away their voices echoed after her crying out their fear and their grief and their pleas for help she ordered her chaplain to distribute alms but it seemed a futile gesture offering good wishes to one bleeding to death and maude felt a rush of relief as they neared the castle for there was naught she could do but then she drew rein abruptly common sense forgotten the woman might have been maudes own age but childbearing and hard work had aged her beyond her years she had three boys clinging to her skirts a baby in her arms and she was weeping silently rocking back and forth as if oblivious to the devastation around her it was the children whod drawn maudes eye for they all had curly reddishcopper hairthe same shade as maudes sons the smallest had looked to be about three and in him maude saw her own youngest son for will had been just three when she left to claim her crown when she saw him lastnigh on two years ago the womans husband had been searching through the charred timbers for anything worth salvaging he straightened up slowly belatedly becoming aware of the royal cavalcade this was my apothecary shop he said over there i kept my mortar and pestle and in the back my brazier some of my customers came all the way from southampton for no one had a better selection of herbs and spices and soothing potions ginger and clover and antimony and wormwood and henna and camphor and calamine and hemlock squatting down he sifted ashes through his fingers looking up at maude with a lopsided smile not much for a lifetimes toil is it our house is gone too for we lived abovestairs not that we lost everything alice found a ladle and our fire tongs did not burn fire tongs he repeated and began to laugh hoarsely a painful rasping sound that caused those listening to glance away a small crowd had gathered and robert nudged his mount forward offering them the only comfort he could a grim promise that the men responsible for burning winchester would pay a terrible price for it maudes guards urged her on toward the castle but she kept looking back over her shoulder and at last reined in her mare she was fumbling with a ring as miles rode up beside her as their eyes met he shook his head why not she demanded you saw them miles they lost everything i know he said but do you have rings for them all sweeping his arm to encompass the rest of the ravaged city maude looked away you know i do not she conceded and they rode on in silence theyd almost reached the castle before she spoke again although he caught her words he did not understand them and gave her a quizzical questioning look i was just remembering an old german proverb she said in a low voice in time of war the devil makes more room in hell winchesters great fair was held annually on august st the eve of st giles on the hill of the same name just east of the city gunter had not missed a st giles fair for the past ten years it was one of his most profitable markets hed expected this trip to be particularly rewarding for his cart was loaded with goods sure to appeal to discriminating fairgoers staples such as razors scissors and spindles supplemented by luxuries like incense perfume parchment and quicksilver his sojourn in winchester was to be special for another reason his daughter was accompanying him hed been reluctant to expose monday to the perils of the road but it seemed riskier to leave her home alone for she was twelve now balancing precariously on the border between childhood and womanhood not yet ready to cross over but close enough to see the other side gunters doubts had been swept away by her excitement to monday this trip to winchester was as great a gift as shed ever been given gunters disappointment was acute therefore when he learned that winchester would be holding no fair this year for his loss was twofold as both merchant and father monday was inconsolable all the more so because shed come so close theyd been within ten miles of winchester when they encountered people fleeing the city she was no longer weeping but her eyes were still swollen and her voice held a betraying tremor i do not understand papa even if the fair was called off this year why could we not go on into the city at least id get to see it it would be too dangerous girl you heard what we were told that half the town is in ruins and a siege is still under way think you that id have brought you to winchester had i known that the town would be full of soldiers monday sniffed into her sleeve obviously not convinced gunter glanced at her occasionally from the corner of his eye but shed averted her face and all he could see was a curve of flaxen hair she was getting too old to wear her hair loose like that more and more he regretted not having remarried after isolda died it was no easy task raising a lass alone here girl you take the reins for a while he said she was always pestering him to let her do that but now he got only a shrug and she slid over on the seat as if she were doing him a great favor pull up lass gunter said suddenly and beckoned to the couple trudging along the side of the road i can see your woman is with child she can ride in the cart with us his offer was gratefully accepted and the woman was soon seated next to monday her husband walking briskly beside gunter he was young and brawny looked as if he could hold his own in a brawl an important consideration in these lawless times now that they had three males in their partygunter his hired lad and the strangergunter felt somewhat safer for bandits and masterless men were less likely to prey upon travelers able to defend themselves gunters generous gesture was indeed bread cast upon the waters for his new companion had more to offer than youth and muscle and a stout oaken staff thick enough to crack a mans head wide open oliver was a winchester man born and bred able to provide gunter with a vivid eyewitness account of his citys troubles he and his wife were luckier than most though for they had kin willing to take them in until the siege ended and life got back to normal were going to alton oliver confided clemence will stay with her brother until i can fetch her home and you youre not staying with her oliver shook his head casting a regretful glance toward the cart the babe is not due for another three months not till after martinmas pray god that the fighting will be long over by then in truth i am loath to leave her but i must go back i will lose my job if i do not id not think thered be much work not if the fire was as bad as id heard it was oliver said somberly i just hope i live long enough to see the bishop stripped of his finery and turned out of the city if it were up to me id send him on pilgrimage to jerusalem with bare feet and hairshirt and no bread but what he could beg but there is not much chance of that the great never seem to pay for their sins at least not in this lifetime then you want to see the empress win oliver smiled mirthlessly what i want is to repair my house bring my wife home in time for her to give birth there to our childa son god willing i want to see the bishop punished but i doubt he will be for the church tends to its own and i want this accursed war to end let maude rule or stephenyou think i care am i ever likely to see westminster hellfire ive never even seen southampton and thats but twelve miles away ill own up that im not losing any sleep over the outcome either i thought it was for the best when stephen claimed the crown but if a king cannot keep the peace what good does he do us the roads were never so dangerous whilst the old king was alive gunter is something amiss it may be gunter said and there was suddenly so much tension in his voice that oliver felt an instant unease the older man was staring off into the distance his eyes narrowed against the sun riveted upon the horizon do you see it it would take a lot of men and horses to churn up that much dust making up his mind he swung around toward the cart yelling for his hired man asleep in the back wat bestir yourself i want to get the cart off the road into that grove of trees and fast oliver helped him lead the horses across the field while clemence and monday clung to the cart as it swayed and bumped over the rough ground is this truly necessary gunter even if it is an army most likely it is geoffrey de mandeville since theyre coming along the london road it was known in the city that the empress has summoned him to aid in the siege gunter gave the young townsman the pitying gaze of a seasoned traveler for a rank novice the pope himself could be leading that army and id still burrow down till theyd passed by it matters little if they be friend or foe would you trust your wife with a tamed wolf once theyd hidden the cart amid the sheltering trees gunter and oliver crept forward to watch the road hunkering down in the underbrush after a while the high grass began to ripple and gunter swore as his daughter crawled up beside them get back to the cart he ordered but then he grabbed her arm pulling her down again for it was too late stay still he warned and as they watched from their hiding place the armys scouts and advance guard rode by sun glinting on the chain links of their armor lean and fit and sunbrowned and fascinatingat least to monday whod never before seen men who looked like the heroes in her favorite minstrel songs the ones about gallant knights errant who had amazing adventures and never failed to rescue highborn ladies in peril after the advance guard passed the army followed menatarms and mounted knights monday was so enthralled that it almost made up for missing winchester she wished she could squirm closer to the road but her father held her in an iron grip oh look papa she whispered a lady rides with them nonsense he said curtly but when he raised up on his elbow he saw that she was right jesus wept he murmured it is the queen oliver gaped at him how can you be sure ive seen her before once at the st ives fair and twice in london it is stephens queen and no mistake oliver had gone very pale he stared after matilda and when monday glanced his way again she was startled to see tears in his eyes papa she whispered why is he so distraught why does he weep for winchester lass he said softly he weeps for winchester winchester england august the citizens of winchester were still sifting through the ashes and charred debris of their homes and shops when the queens army descended upon them her forces augmented by more than a thousand londoners men from her lands in boulogne and kent and the bishops vassals and tenants matilda posed a formidable threat and maude and robert at once dispatched urgent messages to geoffrey de mandeville the earl of chester to all their allies not already in winchester matilda was accompanied by several earls but she entrusted the command of her army to william de ypres and he at once cast a net around the city blockading all of the major roads leading into winchester with luck and knowledge of local terrain a lone rider could still get through the lines but cumbersome supply convoys were snared like flies in cobweb and hunger soon stalked the streets of the beleaguered town the besiegers had become the besieged and the trapped citizens of winchester could only pray for divine deliverance entreating the almighty to spare their city the fate that had befallen lincoln william de ypres was returning from a foray into winchester that was not as reckless as it sounded for their arrival had forced maudes men to withdraw into the city thus raising the siege of wolvesey he had been admitted into the palace by a postern gate in the outer wall and as hed gazed down from the battlements at the deserted city streets hed marveled that the smell of smoke was still so acrid three weeks after the fire looking out over the ruins of cheapside hed laughed exultantly for the scent of victory was in the air too riding back to matildas encampment south of the city walls ypres encountered william de warenne earl of surrey who reported gleefully that yet another of maudes supply convoys had been captured theyd soon be scouring the city streets for stray cats and dogs he predicted and as the siege dragged on theyd be eating mouse soup and rat stew and thanking god for it as much as id love to see maude gnawing on a mouse leg ypres grinned it is not likely in a siege the townspeople starve first for what food there is goes to the army ere the castle larders get bonebare theyll try to break out of the trap id say in a fortnight or soassuming of course that they do not get help from some of maudes missing barons any chance of a few of your kinsmen showing up on the wrong side my lord there was no real malice in ypress gibe it was merely force of habit it did no damage though for warenne was not thinskinned about the propensity of his kindred for fencestraddling waleran and robert beaumont were his halfbrothers the earl of warwick was his first cousin and his sister was the wife of the scots kings son and heir so their family history did indeed present a complex mosaic of contrary and uncertain loyalties warennes own allegiance to stephen was shadowed by past conflicts and an outright betrayal he was one of the earls whod fled the battlefield at lincoln like ypres and northampton he was seeking now to make amends for that abandonment and for that very reason ypres trusted him shame was a powerful inducement even more of a goad than selfinterest they were passing holy cross the hospital founded by the bishop of winchester to aid men indigent and infirm the hospital had been far luckier than hyde abbey and the nunnery and much of winchester for the fires set by the bishops men had never spread south of the city protected now by matildas army holy cross seemed likely to be one of the few buildings to survive the siege intact warenne glanced back at the hospital precincts floating above the fray like an island haven in a storming sea i do not understand he said why the queen refused to stay at waltham shed be safer for certes at the bishops castle and more comfortable too why did the bishop not insist upon it the queen has a mind of her own or so rumor says ypres said blandly but his mouth was twitching in an involuntary smile for he was hearing again matildas private comment that shed sooner seek shelter in a lazar house than under her brotherinlaws roof she says she can do more good in our camp and id be the last one to dispute that she comforts the wounded prays for the dying never misses an opportunity to remind themever so gentlythat they are fighting for their lawful kingand if she asked them to sprout wings and fly into winchester at least half would start flapping their arms for takeoff warenne laughed she does inspire devotion in the unlikeliest of men lets hope that is a trick maude never learns for if breaking off in surprise what is going on by now theyd reached the camp and both drew rein for men were bustling about horses being unsaddled additional tents being set up it looks ypres said as if we have gained some new allies your brother leicester warenne shrugged he knew robert beaumont wanted to see stephen restored to the throne but he also wanted to protect what was his dismissing their escorts they dismounted before matildas tent entered and halted abruptly at the sight that met their eyes matilda sharing a wine flagon with the earl of northampton and geoffrey de mandeville earl of essex matilda greeted them with a tight smile saying the earl of essex has come to pledge anew his allegiance to my lord husband in truth geoffrey de mandeville said placidly my allegiance to the king never wavered but when the bishop of winchester ordered all christians to accept the countess of anjou as queen i felt compelled to obey as a good son of the church however little i liked it you can well imagine my relief when the bishop recanted for i was then free to follow my own conscience to do whatever i could to gain the king his freedom warenne looked dumbfounded by the sheer effrontery of it but ypres was delighted his only regret was that the bishop was not present to hear himself blamed for geoffrey de mandevilles defection as for the unrepentant defector he seemed equally indifferent to warennes amazement and ypress amusement he was already on his feet kissing matildas hand with ostentatious gallantry by your leave my lady i ought to get my men settled in northampton had risen too i will keep a close eye upon him madame he promised as soon as the earl of essex had departed and ducked under the tent flap warenne followed leaving ypres alone with matilda and her ladyinwaiting for cecily had stubbornly insisted upon providing matilda with female companionship mindful of the proprieties even in the midst of war matilda was staring down at her hand with an expression of distaste as if she could still see the imprint upon her skin of geoffrey de mandevilles mouth ypres helped himself to some of the wine then refilled the womens cups i suggest a scrubbing with lye soap for your hand a few flagons of hippocras for the foul taste in your mouth you ought to be very proud of yourself my lady i am for certes the temptation to spit in his face must have been well nigh irresistible no willem you are wrong matilda said earnestly it never even occurred to me i dared not offend him or let my true feelings show not as long as he holds the rest of her sentence was lost in the depths of her wine cup ypres was about to finish her sentence for her with the obvious answerthe tower of londonwhen matilda said constance he looked away quickly lest she read his surprise in his face for he did not want her to know hed almost forgotten that mandeville had abducted her sons childwife matilda set the wine cup down snatching up a parchment he even brought me a letter from constance the gall of the man she sputtered indignantly muttering something under her breath that hed have taken for an obscenityhad it been anyone but matilda he is still posing as constances protector she said shaking her head in disbelief promising to return her to me as soon as her safety can be assured and what promises did he demand from you what price does he put on his resurrected loyalty to the crown he wanted me to match all that maude had given him at oxford which i did of course it is passing strange willem the more i lie the easier it gets did i forget to warn you that sinning can be habitforming but matilda found no humor in his joke she looked down at constances letter again and he said quite seriously this time you are doing what you must my lady i know she said but what if it is not enough willem what if it is not enough as ranulf crossed the castles inner bailey in response to his sisters summons he slowed to watch the crowd lined up outside the kitchens door when theyd begun giving out bread most of the supplicants had been women and children for the townsmen had been shamed at having to rely upon charity and had sent their wives to collect their share but that was no longer so on this overcast afternoon in early september most of the people in line were males for no man wanted his woman or child out on the streets not anymore the danger was too great matildas blockade had brought more than hunger to the citizens of winchester once shed lifted the siege of wolvesey their town had become a battlefield the bishops men prowled the battlements of both his strongholds shooting at anything that moved even venturing out occasionally to clash with the enemy and they included the townspeople in that hostile category for winchester had backed maude not their bishop and he was not likely to forgive or forget the city was now split into two broken halves divided by the blackened boundary of cheapside the bishops men held the south side and maudes forces the castle and the damaged neighborhoods north of high street there were daily skirmishings daily deaths and many feared that the worst still lay ahead of them miles and robert were standing on the steps leading up into the great hall the tension between them was unmistakable and not a surprise to ranulf for their rivalry was no secret exacerbated by the very real differences in their natures and their approach to war both men were capable battle commanders but robert was inherently more cautious than miles and that made conflict all but inevitable ranulf was near enough now to catch the gist of their argument lowvoiced but intense nonetheless hed heard it all before for miles had been very vocal about his desire to fight fire with fire insisting that they take advantage of the castles high ground to hurl firebrands down upon their enemies hed not been convinced by roberts counterargument that if the winds shifted the rest of the city could burn and hed not taken defeat with any measure of grace continuing to complain long after the issue had been rendered moot by matildas arrival upon the scene they turned as ranulf approached he opened his mouth to remind them that maude was waiting instead heard himself say belligerently robert was not the only one loath to put the citys survival in peril so was maude miles was caught off balance hed long ago tagged rainald as the family hothead not ranulf he recovered quickly though and said caustically i daresay stephen would have balked too and where did his misguided mercy get him we are wasting time robert said impatiently and turned on his heel miles and ranulf followed in a strained silence the others were already in the solar maude her uncle the scots king rainald brien baldwin de redvers william pont de arche and john marshal weve been waiting for you the usually urbane david snapped the siege was rubbing raw the nerves of even the most phlegmatic among them miles was irked but not enough to contradict a king straddling a seat he said we need to talk about that mob down in the bailey i know charity is a virtue but we can no longer afford to be quite so virtuous maude frowned it is not a womanly weakness to feed hungry children miles i did not say it was madame but it is an indulgence weve already cut our daily portions in half and even that may not be enough youve not been in a prolonged siege and i hope to god you never are for it is an ordeal no woman ought to endure he is right my lady baldwin de redvers said emphatically i am indeed grateful that you were not at exeter during stephens threemonth siege my men ended up eating their horses and when the well went dry they had to put out fires with wine until that ran out too had they not surrendered when they did theyd have been drinking their own piss maude was not impressed she hated it when men treated war as their own private province acting as if suffering were a uniquely male experience that no woman could hope to comprehend she was particularly vexed by baldwins contribution for hed escaped at the start of the siege leaving his wife behind in the castle she yearned to point that out but she resisted the temptation contenting herself with a cool reminder that our well has not gone dry moreover we are expecting aid any day now they had reason for optimism for theyd sent out writs to geoffrey de mandeville the earl of chester his brother the earl of lincoln the earl of warwick the earl of oxford and hugh bigod among others robert created a stir therefore by saying suddenly what if aid does not come mayhap we ought to consider a withdrawal no maudes indignant cry was echoed at once by other voices all expressing the same urgent argumentthat maude could not afford two successive defeats after the disastrous setback shed suffered in london she must prevail here in winchester she dared not lose again robert did not dispute them merely waited them out i am not saying that we should retreat i am saying though that we need a plan should it become necessary why would it rainald demanded even if a few of these lords do not keep faith they could not all fail us once we have more men we can force a battle put an end to this damnable war once and for all we have to settle this robert maude agreed if i were to withdraw people would see it as running away and what of the townspeople what would happen to winchester once wed abandoned it to ypress flemings in war madame miles said calmly soldiers expect to be rewarded for the risks they take when a city falls it is plundered by the victors so it was at lincoln so it would be at winchester maude started to protest stopped herself just in time what could she say after all she had indeed accepted the suffering of the citizens of lincoln as a necessary evil wars ugly aftermath so why could she not do the same for winchester was the suffering real only if she could see it for herself but she had never seen suffering like this beforehungry babies and homeless women and a city in ruins she could not admit that though they would neither understand nor approve compassion was a womans frailty one she dared not show for it would but confirm their qualms about her fitness to rule john marshal was lounging against the wall arms folded across his chest seemingly oblivious to the tensions and undercurrents swirling about the solar when he spoke up now heads turned in his direction as i understand it the good news is that reinforcements are on the way whilst the bad news is that we may run out of food ere they get here so we ought to be thinking how to feed ourselves in the meantimeunless we really do want to empty out the stables baldwin de redvers took that as a jab at his siege story i suppose you have a way to do that he scoffed and was startled when marshal nodded i may he said i just may he glanced around to make sure they were all listening and only then did he tell them what he had in mind it was very quiet after he was done speaking maude was regarding him thoughtfully youd be taking a great risk sir john he responded with a shrug a laconic if i were not willing my lady id not have offered maude admired his audacity but she was not about to secondguess robert or miles on a matter of military judgment she was turning to find out what they thought of john marshals scheme when the door burst open and gilbert fitz john plunged into the room forgive my bad manners my lady he said but this news could not wait geoffrey de mandeville has betrayed us that whoreson judas has gone over to stephens queen food is getting scarcer by the day in winchester william de warenne reported they cannot hold out much longer not unless they get help and soon and in truth i doubt that aid will be coming those who can stomach maudes queenship are already with her the others are reluctant bridegrooms at best being dragged to the altar against their will if they think there is a chance that the wedding might be called off theyll go to ground faster than any fox youve ever seen men like my cousin warwick and hugh bigod are not about to spill their blood on maudes behalf theyre not likely to get within a hundred miles of winchester not as long as the outcome is in doubt the other men agreed with his optimistic assessment matilda alone kept silent listening uneasily as they shared stories of the siege rumors of sickness in the city and dissention in the castle accounts of livestock being butchered for food a wordofmouth tale about a pack of starving stray dogs chasing down a drunkardor was it a child that was too much for matilda she understood the strategyto force maudes army into a fight it could not win with hunger the weapon of choice an effective weapon for certes but an indiscriminate one was she the only one troubled by that i have a question she said so abruptly that they all turned to stare at her those who are suffering the most during the siege are the citizens of winchester women and children priests pilgrimsthey are supposed to be spared those are the rules of war are they not but these rules do not stop the shedding of innocent blood so how do you keep from thinking of themthe innocents pleasei truly need to know there was an awkward silence she looked from one to the otherfrom the fleming ypres to her brotherinlaw the bishop to the earls of northampton surrey and essex to william martel her husbands stewardand saw the same sentiment on the faces of these very unlike men discomfort that she should ask such a foolish question and reluctance to offend her by saying so the bishop took it upon himself to allay her qualms it is always distressing to see christians sorely afflicted matilda my dear but it is not given to mortal men to understand the workings of the almighty it is as scriptures say that now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face all will be revealed to us in gods good time this was not the answer matilda had been looking for the men realized that but only william de warenne ventured to improve upon the bishops effort after a brief hesitation the young earl decided he could best serve his queen by candor i am not qualified to argue theology madame but i can speak as a soldier in war men do what they must to stay aliveand sometimes they do what they later regret am i sorry for the suffering of those you call the innocents i am do i think much about their suffering no in all honesty i do not what good would it do the people in winchester will be no less hungry because i pity their plight she should have known better what had she expected to hear matilda nodded politely and saw their relief after a few moments the conversation resumed they were still certain that they need not fear reinforcements from scotland and normandy maude and robert would have been leery of bringing a scots army across the border nor would maude have entreated geoffrey to come to her rescue the men laughed at the very thought agreeing that maude would starve first matilda said nothing she seemed composed but shed begun to fidget with her wedding band as she invariably did whenever she was under stress that was how well ypres had come to know her during this unlikely alliance of theirs even her nervous habits were familiar to him he watched her twisting and tugging at her ring and he would have comforted her if he could but hed rather she grieve for the townspeople of winchester than mourn for stephen the bishop was proposing a plan to divert a stream that flowed past the castle when there was a sudden commotion outside warenne was the closest and the most curious and ducked under the tent flap to investigate he was back almost at once wideeyed and incredulous this he exclaimed you all have to see for yourselves the camp was in turmoil and in the very midst of itseated astride a sleek white stallion surrounded by an armed escort and reveling in the uproarwas none other than randolph de germons earl of chester they were all taken aback none more so than matilda she stared at chester in disbelief not finding her voice until he started to swing from the saddle no she cried do not dismount for youll not be staying you are not wanted here chester looked truly surprised and she hated him all the more for that for the arrogance that allowed him to imagine his betrayals would be overlooked his treachery forgotten that is a strange jest madame he said coldly one likely to offend rather than amuse i assure you i find no humor in your presence here my lord earl i want you gone from my sight how much more plainly need i speak than that chester was enraged angry color scorched his face and he communicated so much tension to his stallion that the animal kicked out suddenly causing the closest spectators to scatter the earl yanked savagely on the reins glaring at matilda you are distraught madame do not know what you are saying but i cannot indulge your whims not with so much at stake the kings need is too great i think it best that i speak with you my lord bishop matilda spun around but the bishop was as deliberate as stephen was impulsive and his face was impassive his thoughts his own she was never to know what his response would have been for william de ypres had sauntered forward brandishing a drawn sword and a smile so full of mockery that it was in itself a lethal weapon conveying mortal insult without need of any words whatsoever words he had though each one aimed unerringly at chesters greatest vulnerabilityhis pride i can speak for the bishop he said for every man jack here we heed but one voice in this campthat of the queen now that flag of truce means no more to me than it would to you but our lady is a woman of honour so thank god for her forbearance and ride out my lord earl whilst you still can chester showed no fear only fury you fools he snarled you shortsighted pompous fools mark this day well remember that you had a chance to save your king instead you heeded a woman and a foreign cutthroat and sealed his doom hell stay chained up at bristol till he rots and glad ill be of it chester spurred his stallion without warning and men dived out of his way as the horse plunged forward into the crowd his men hastily followed retreating in a hail of hostile catcalls and curses matilda had moved away jamming small fists into the folds of her skirts as she sought to regain her composure when she turned back to face the men she was braced for disapproval if you say i ought to have accepted his offer i cannot dispute you but i could not help myself i could not pretend that i believed his lies that i did not despise him i can only pray that i have not harmed my husband you did not ypres said with an assurance that she envied you think not willemtruly i think spurning chester was for the best ill not deny that i enjoyed it immensely but it was still a wise move for the man would have been a constant source of trouble not even a saint could fully trust him and our men are far from saintly wed have had an army of hungry cats so intent upon watching the rat in our midst that maude would be forgotten the bishop smiled at that then nodded it is rare indeed when the two of us are in agreement about anything under gods sky he said wryly but we do agree about the earl of chester he would have been a dangerous distraction more of a hindrance than a help the man has proven himself to be thoroughly untrustworthy an unscrupulous selfseeker who serves only himself matilda stared at her brotherinlaw in amazement for he seemed to have spoken utterly without irony shed been incensed not just by geoffrey de mandevilles treachery but also by his cynicism in offering his aid hed made no attempt to convince her of his good faith sardonically sure that her need would outweigh her anger he was not blind to ethical boundariesas was chestermerely indifferent to them but as she looked now at stephens brother she realized that he was quite unlike those two renegade earls it would never occur to him that others might consider him an unscrupulous selfseeker too he truly believed himself to be on the side of the angels a pious man of god defender of holy church burdened with a feckless ungrateful brother a foolhardy king and matilda found his sincerity even scarier than mandevilles mockery or chesters amorality chester was being damned now from all sides with great zest and considerable venom soldiers were not accustomed to censoring themselves but few of them were comfortable cursing so freely in front of their queen matildas presence was inhibiting therefore and she knew it turning aside she started back toward her tent smiling at warennes colorful way with words hed just described chester as able to slither under a snakes belly with space to spare that got a laugh from geoffrey de mandeville to give the devil his due though he roots out secrets like a pig going after acorns how many men know about the king yet bristol must be swarming with chesters spies hemadame matilda had darted forward grabbing mandevilles arm know what has something happened to stephen my lady we did not mean for you to hear william de warenne stammered i am truly sorry for what mandeville demanded unlessyou mean she does not know warenne shook his head looking more miserable by the moment know what matilda repeated what are you keeping from me she had her answer not from either man but from chester himself for his parting taunt came back to her then chains she echoed oh sweet jesus no whirling around she sought the one man she trusted not to lie to her have they put my husband in irons willemanswer me ypres was already beside her yes he said it is so he has been shackled since midjuly or thereabouts why did you not tell me that was a difficult question for him to answer hed had so few protective urges in his life that he did not know how to justify such an alien emotion i did not see what good it would do for you to know he said gruffly you had no right to keep this from meno right tears had begun to sting her eyes but she made no attempt to hide them to wipe them away what man among them would not have wanted a wife whod weep for his pain whatever happens to stephen she said tautly i must be told you are fighting to free your king but i am fighting to free my husband do not ever forget that ranulf fitz roy and john marshal led a force of three hundred knights crossbowmen and menatarms out of winchesters north gate and onto the old ickniell way toward andover it was still dark dawn more than an hour away the men were silent tense they had less than ten miles to go but every one of those miles would be fraught with peril john marshals plan was not only dangerous but controversial too hed proposed setting up an outpost at wherwell where the river test could be forded once they had control of the andover road they would be able to escort supply convoys safely into winchester they would have to fortify the crossing but that could be done with surprising speed when a castle was under siege timber countercastles were often put up by the attacking army this would be far riskier and to protect their men while they were building a temporary stronghold john marshal meant to take over the nearby nunnery of the holy cross the nuns would be sent to safety in andover until the nunnery could be returned to them and would be compensated for their dispossession but maude and her allies would be bringing the wrath of the church down upon them for this intrusion into a house of god and the archbishop of canterbury already irate at being trapped in the siege would not be easy to placate it was a measure of their desperation that theyd approved john marshals daring stratagem maude had not been so willing though for ranulf to lead this highrisk mission and had quarreled hotly with her brother over it but ranulf had insisted and hed prevailed the argument hed made was a valid one that john marshal was a good man to have on their side in battle but not the ideal candidate to negotiate with a convent of nuns but there was more to his motivation than concern for holy cross and its brides of christ ranulf was in need of diversionhowever dangerousfor his nerves were fraying under the strain he was still an optimist still believed that maude would win her war but theyd come so close just three months ago hed been lodged at westminster palace anticipating his sisters coronation and annora was within his reach if not yet his grasp now she seemed to slip further away with each passing day of this accursed siege maude had lost ground that it would take them months to regain he was trying not to blame maude for this but those were months he could never get back months in which annora would be sharing gervase fitz clements life and bed instead of being where she belongedat his side and in his bed easing his stallion ranulf now slowed its pace until gilbert caught up i still say you ought to have stayed back in winchester he grumbled you act at times as if i cannot be trusted out of your sight wellthe last time you ventured into a nunnery you got yourself arrested gilbert glanced up at the greying sky for theyd outrun the night would be racing the sun to wherwell what are the chances you think of ancels being in the queens encampment more than likely ranulf conceded we know northampton is there so why would ancel not be with his liege lord it could be that he has seen the error of his ways is now ready to acknowledge lady maude as his rightful queen as if you believe that gilbert shrugged i will if you will he offered and got from ranulf a reluctant grin they rode on bantering into a waiting ambush they had no warning for the terrain was ideally suited for concealment the road narrowing and curving as it wound its way up into the hills bordered by deep woods tangled oak and beech and yew providing perfect camouflage for the soldiers who now rushed out to the attack there was instant chaos horses rearing up men swearing hastily drawing swords reeling back under the onslaught what followed was not so much a battle as a wild melee confusing and random and deadly there was no organized retreat no orders given it was each man for himself doing his best to stay alive assailed from both sides of the woods ranulfs companions bunched together for protection spurring their horses mercilessly for those who halted were quickly struck down dragged bleeding from their mounts trampled and left for dead as the running battle surged up the road until it reached the mosscovered walls of the wherwell nunnery warned by the sounds of conflict two nuns and the porter were struggling to close the doors of the gatehouse they jumped aside just in time as the first horsemen swept by them into the convent grounds as the nuns and porter watched helplessly their nunnery was invaded by armed men all striving urgently to kill one another ranulfs stallion swerved suddenly almost unseating him steering with his knees until he was able to snatch up the reins he glanced back and gasped for had his horse not veered off so sharply hed have ridden down a small child it was quite common for nunneries to take in children as boarders or pupils and several youngsters had been drawn outside by the commotion this particular child was in the greatest peril for shed toddled directly into the path of the riders galloping through the gateway fighting to swing his stallion about ranulf yelled run lass but she was frozen with fear crouching down in the dirt she disappeared into the dust clouds being swirled up by the flying hooves when ranulf got a glimpse of her again her little body was being cradled by one of the nuns and he was never to know if the nun had gotten to her in time nuns had come running out of their dorter from the bakehouse and the buttery not all the women wore the black habit of the benedictine order for widows often lodged in nunneries renting themselves a safe haven away from worldly temptations and turmoil but the real world had intruded upon them with a vengeance on this second tuesday in september some of them screamed fled back into the nearest buildings others stood rooted as the battle raged around them john marshal slashed and cut his way toward the church take shelter inside he shouted shoving aside the priest who tried to block the doorway flinging themselves from their horses his men sprinted after him into the church ranulf had just traded blows with a young fleming their swords coming together with numbing force clashing in a shiver of sparks when the flemings horse stumbled ranulf spurred his mount toward the church too he never made it a dog lunged toward them barking ferociously the stallion reared lost its footing and went down when ranulf tried to throw himself clear his spur caught in the stirrup he hit the ground hard enough to drive all the air out of his lungs yanked desperately to free his spur and rolled away from the horses flailing hooves before he could regain his feet a soldier was standing over him wielding a bloodied mace his helmet took the brunt of the blow undoubtedly saved his life but the impact was still strong enough to stun his vision blurred and he saw the mace start to descend again through a wavering red haze powerless to deflect it the blow never landed someone grabbed his assailants arm spoiling his aim do not kill this one you fool look at his horse hell be able to pay a goodly ransom ranulfs arms were pinned behind his back bound with leather thongs he and the other prisoners those judged worthy of ransoming had been dragged over to the almonry shoved against the wall and held under guard ranulfs head was throbbing so wildly that his slightest move set the world to whirling around him he closed his eyes tightly until the dizziness subsided when he opened them again he could think only of those ancient roman circuses for the comic and the tragic had merged into a scene as bizarre and compelling as any hed ever witnessed bodies lay sprawled at odd angles horses milled about in panic convent dogs barked hysterically plundering had already begun soldiers had broken into the abbesss dwelling and the guesthouse in search of valuables others were ransacking the buttery for wine not far from ranulf two youths were squabbling goodnaturedly over a lute while a third staggered under the weight of a massive coffer when he broke the lock revealing neatly folded veils wimples and habits his friends roared with laughter at his chagrin there was an almost festive air about the looting but sporadic fighting still continued john marshal and the men with him had managed to barricade the church and some of the flemings were attempting to force their way inside and through it all there echoed the screams of the nuns and children ranulf tugged at his bonds to no avail hed have to concoct a false identity for if they learned he was maudes brother hed not have a prayer in hell of being ransomed mayhap he could claim to be a knight of her household that would explain why shed be willing to buy his freedom it was hard to think clearly though when his head was pounding like a drum as he tried to contrive an alias one that would alert maude as to his true identity more riders rode through the gateway as they passed ranulf and the other prisoners his heart skipped a beat for he recognized william de ypres and he did not doubt that the fleming could also recognize him ypres beckoned to several of his captains after conferring briefly with them he started toward the church hed not ridden far before a nun ran out to intercept him she was an elderly woman barely five feet tall plump and pinkcheeked as unlikely a foe as he could imagine but she displayed no fear whatsoever boldly blocking his horses path and when ypres reigned in she cried fiercely god will curse you forever if you do not stop this from occurring ypres assumed that she was blaming him for shedding blood in gods acre but when she warned that there is no greater sin than to defile one of his daughters he understood where he said and she pointed toward the stables the horses had already been led from the barn for they were among the most prized of all plunder it was not empty though in a shadowy back stall two men crouched over a struggling thrashing figure one was kneeling on the girls outstretched arms a hand clamped over her mouth to stifle her screams while his partner was tearing away her habit they were so intent upon their prey that they did not at once realize they had an audience their recoil was almost comical therefore when ypres queried i trust i am not interrupting anything of importance they whirled groping for their weapons weapons that went untouched as soon as they recognized the identity of this intruder they knew ypres on sightand by reputationevery man in his army did the young nun gasped for breath then pleaded with ypres to help her but he kept his eyes upon the men ypres seemed in no hurry gazing down at them impassively she is a pretty bit what i can see of her soif shes what you want go to it in all fairness though you ought to know this the last time one of my men raped a nun i cut off his cock and fed it to him the nun understood none of this for ypres spoke in flemish please she sobbed but without hope for this coldeyed man on a grey stallion did not have the look of a saviour it seemed miraculous to her therefore when her assailants suddenly let her go scrambled to their feet and fled the stables her relief gave way almost at once to a new jolt of fear what if this foreign knight meant to finish what his men had begun she clutched at her ripped garments and when she dared to look up again she started to weep in earnest no longer doubting her deliverance for ypres was gone as he rode out of the stables ypres was met by one of his captains and the elderly nun now gripping a pitchfork much to his amusement your lamb is within sister he said scared but unsullied she gave him a hard hostile look then brushed past him into the stables ypres laughed that old lady he said loves us not his captain grinned i truly thought she was going to run those fools through no loss if she had when you can buy a woman for a fistful of coins why do these dolts have to muck about with nuns nowwhat is happening in the church some of them have holed up inside refusing to surrender marshal is amongst them and that one will hold out till were all too old and feeble to fight patience ypres said is a nuns virtue not mine lets make it easy on us all martin find some kindling ranulf had tensed as ypres emerged from the stables fearing that at any moment the fleming would glance his way he was not close enough to hear the orders being given but he soon saw what they meant to do and began to struggle frantically against his bonds until one of his guards came over and threatened to slice off an ear if he did not keep still ranulf slumped back for by now it was too late ypress soldiers had flung blazing torches onto the porch were shooting fire arrows into the shutters up onto the roof shingles ranulf watched in horror as the church began to burn for he was sure that gilbert was one of the men trapped inside when hed raced into the church gilbert had thought ranulf was right behind him by the time he discovered his mistake the other men were hastily barring the doors and latching the shutters dragging altars over to blockade the entrances with daylight cast out so suddenly the church was plunged into darkness it was hot and uncomfortable inside crowded with anxious men and two terrified nuns whod had the bad luck to be in the chancel when john marshal seized control the atmosphere was grim for they knew they could not hold out for long their only hope was to offer so much resistance that their attackers would decide it was not worth the effort to overcome them under john marshals command they managed to beat back two assaults but one of the doors was beginning to split under repeated blows and when they opened a shutter for their crossbowmen to fire out a torch was tossed through into the nave they were able to quench it but they could still smell smoke and they soon discovered whythe church was afire when john marshal ripped up an altar cloth and soaked it in the holy water font as protection against the smoke gilbert did the same and when the smoke and flames became too intense he followed marshals lead again and they retreated up the stairs to the dubious shelter of the bell tower he was not long in regretting it not long in realizing hed made the greatest mistake of his life the heat was getting unbearable smoke was seeping up into their sanctuary and they could hear the crackle of the flames below it sounded to gilbert as if half the church were ablaze my lord he said if we stay up here well die for certes wed best surrender whilst we still can john marshal blotted sweat from his forehead with a corner of the altar cloth raising his head he stared at gilbert you take a step toward that door and ill kill you myself we are not going to surrender gilberts mouth dropped open was the man serious marshal was regarding him with unblinking inscrutable eyes what are you saying that it is better to be roasted alive than surrender i have no intention of being roasted marshal said calmly that door ought to keep out the worst of the smoke for now this church is stone will take a while to burn we can wait them outas long as we do not panic i cannot speak for you fitz john but im not one for panicking gilbert had never doubted his own courage but he was not willing to dice with death not like this hed watched from one of the tower windows as men reeled out of the flames coughing and choking some were spared some were not but a quick sword thrust was not the worst of ways to die being trapped in a burning building with a lunatic suddenly seemed a far worse fate well be doomed if we stay up here no marshal said we will not and to gilberts dismay he sounded faintly amused god favors risktakers hell not let us burn gilbert was speechless he watched warily as marshal moved toward a window having made up his mind to bolt for the door at the first opportunity but then marshal gave a triumphant cry what did i tell you they are riding off truly god be praised gilbert darted over joining marshal at the window the older man was leaning out recklessly laughing but then he screamed and stumbled backward gilbert was stunned not sure what had happened had he been hit by an arrow there was a sudden stench although hed encountered it only once the night the man in the pillory had died hed never forget itthe smell of burning flesh marshal had dropped to his knees making no sound now rocking back and forth in agony when gilbert bent over him he got his first look at marshals face and his stomach heaved christ he choked your eyeit is gone nuns had rushed from hiding in a futile attempt to save their church ypress soldiers held them back and they watched in despair as flames swept through the nave when the roof collapsed they wept and then prayed but their prayers went unheeded for the wind was swirling fiery embers up into the sky a shower of cinders drifted down into the cloister garth and some of them landed upon the dorter roof setting the shingles afire by then the enemy was gone william de ypres saw no reason to tarry any longer in the ravaged abbey he was disappointed that john marshal was not among the men whod fled the flames but the whoreson was probably halfway to hell by now he said for no one was getting out of that inferno alive halting the looting he dispatched some of his men back to camp with their wounded and dead their prisoners their captured horses and booty the others he took with him for the town of andover lay just a few miles up the road too tempting a target to resist theyd reached the river ford when they heard the bells pealing in the distance his men were puzzled as to the source of the sound but ypres merely laughed do you not know what that is he said those are funeral bells tolling for winchester ranulfs balance was still unsteady and he stumbled frequently but his emotional equilibrium was even more precarious he no longer cared about his own peril he realized that winchester was now doomed but it did not seem to matter anymore there was but one image filling his brain a burning church hed watched gilbert die as hideous a death as he could imagine and a needless one if hed not been so stubbornly set upon taking part in this lunacy gilbert would still be alive surrounded by other prisoners and guards ranulf was alone with his grief and his remorse he trudged along in a daze not noticing when he was prodded to keep pace when a knight reined in beside him he paid the man no heed not even the sound of his own name could cut through his fog ranulf christ jesus have you gone deaf ranulf ranulf stopped but the sun was in his eyes the mans face was dark and sharply sculptured and familiar ancel ancel slid hastily from the saddle i want a word with this man he said curtly waving away the closest of the guards i could not trust my eyes at first he confessed pitching his voice now for ranulfs ears alone why would you risk your neck like this did you truly expect to take us by surprise a starving city is a natural breeding ground for spies you ought toranulf what ails you do you even hear me i hear you ancels narrow black eyes probed ranulfs face then roamed over his hauberk in search of blood finally finding it encrusted along ranulfs temple half hidden by the tousled blond hair more fool i he said how badly are you hurt i am not the one ranulf swallowed with difficulty gilbert is dead he was in the church ancel paled then spun around to stare at the distant smoke billowing up behind them when he turned back his eyes glistened with unshed tears and his hands had balled into hard fists god rot them all he spat stephen and ypres and yes that precious sister of yours ranulf blinked annora not my sister ancel hissed yours just how clouded are your wits can you fend for yourself ranulf started to nod and winced i think sowhy instead of answering ancel turned his attention to his horse he seemed to be adjusting the girth strap but ranulf soon saw what he was really about hed moved so that his stallion now blocked the closest guards view hold still he said and ranulf felt his bonds giving way ancel swiftly stooped slid his dagger into the top of ranulfs boot he gave ranulf no chance to respond swung up into the saddle and urged his stallion on not looking back ranulf lagged farther and farther behind biding his time his chance came as the road dipped for the ground fell away to the right and he crouched then slid down into the hollow some of the other prisoners saw him go he did not think though that theyd give him away had any of the guards noticed but his fear of capture was soon forgotten for his head was spinning again long after his enemies had moved on he lay there in the hollow his cheek pressed into the grass his fingers digging into the dirt as he prayed for the pain to pass it was almost dark by the time ranulf was within sight of the walls of winchester maudes men still controlled the fields within arrowshot of the city and he approached the north gate without fear he was admitted at once and it was like plunging down into a well for the citizens had heard of their calamitous defeat at wherwell and they were understandably terrified they trailed ranulf to the castle but when they sought his promise that his sister would not abandon them he had no assurances for them only a heartwrenching and exhausted surge of pity maude came running down the steps of the great hall flung her arms around ranulf even through his numbed fatigue he was surprised for hed never known her to be so unrestrained in public thank god she cried oh thank god stepping back she sought to compose herself gave up the struggle and embraced him again we were so afraid you were dead by then robert had reached them i do not know he said when i have ever been so glad to see anyone as i am to see you lad turning he called to a man just coming through the doorway of the hall fetch lord rainald tell him his brother is alive after a second closer look at ranulf he added and find the doctor i have no need of a doctor ranulf insisted even as he wondered where hed find the strength to climb those few steps into the hall you know then what happened we know maude said and while her words might have referred only to the ambush ranulf could see in her eyes what they truly encompassedher anguished acknowledgment that wherwell was a devastating setback for her queenship claims and for winchester possibly a death blow a few men were able to get back to winchester robert said like you but there are not many survivors most are either prisoners or slain what of john marshal ranulf do you know what befell him he is dead ranulfs voice thickened so is gilbert he said and it should have been me the dream was fragmented foreboding and filled with dark undercurrents more frightening than overt menace ranulf awoke with relief which lasted only until memory came flooding back waking or sleepinghe was no longer sure where lurked the worst nightmares the room was shadowed it seemed to be night and for a troubling moment he could not remember which night it was wednesdayit had to be wednesday for tuesday night he did remember the doctor had given him a potion to ease his pain but hed drunk little of it and tossed and turned restively till dawn maude had sat up with him that he remembered too stretching out he tried to will sleep to return and when it did not he sought to coax it along with a flagon of wine eventually he did sleep again a shallow uneasy doze instead of the dreamless stupor he craved and then it was morning and his guiltridden grieving began anew hed gotten up and dressed but although his earlier bouts of nausea had abated he still had no appetite and when his squire brought him bread and cheese for breakfast he left it untouched luke hovered nearby eager to serve but ranulf wanted no comfort no solace wanted only to be alone when the door opened suddenly he did not even glance up it was maude i am glad you are awake she said for you have a visitor i do not need the doctor again i still have some of that concoction he brewed up for me betony and feverfew and god knows what else anyway my head feels better probably because i did not drink it all down your head may be better but your good humor is breathing its last ranulf turned to stare at her unable to believe she could be joking she was smiling the sort of smile hed not seen on her face since the siege began we may have been defeated at wherwell she said but we did not lose as much as you think see for yourself opening the door wider she stepped aside and gilbert walked into the room he looked dreadful an ugly welt seared across his forehead blistered and raw as red as his hair his eyes were swollen and puffy his lashes and one eyebrow had been singed off and when ranulf flung himself off the bed he recoiled hastily holding up his hand to stave off the embrace easy he cautioned im not up to one of your bear hugs yet ive peeled off more skin from this arm than an onion youre a ghost ranulf said by god you are not even the devil himself could have come through that fire unscathed gilbert grimaced scathed i am he said broiled might be a better way to put it he was trying hard for levity too hard his smile contorted and when ranulf grasped his good arm and steered him toward the bed he sank down upon it gratefully luke poured wine and then disappeared they didnt even notice that maude had also discreetly vanished between us we used up the luck of a lifetime at wherwell gilbert said hoarsely for all i knew you were dead too when lady maude told me you were safe i could scarce believe her i had a guardian angel one you happen to know ancel i can see though that maude already told you about my adventuresexcept for the part about me retching in a ditch since i did not share that golden moment with her but do not keep me in suspense gib how did you escape from that inferno john marshal and i took refuge in the bell tower when it began to look as if wed end up as smoked hams i suggested we yield he responded as any reasonable man would that hed kill me if i tried ranulf choked on his wine you are joking no and neither was marshal name of god gib are you going to leave me twisting on the hook what happened gilbert gazed down into his wine cup frowning something horrible happened he said quietly the fire had not yet reached the upper story of the tower but it had spread to the roof it was only afterward that i figured it out i think the heat was so intense that the lead on the roof started to melt when marshal leaned out of the window some of the molten lead splashed him in the face he shuddered at the memory gulping down the rest of the drink ive never seen anything like that ranulf hope to christ i never do again his skin justjust melted like candle wax but the worst was his eye it was burned away as if scooped out with a spoon leaving nothing but an empty socket ranulfs mouth was suddenly dry and he reached quickly for his own wine no wonder you looked so greensick that poor soul so that was when you escaped but how what did you do what i did was nearly get us both killed i tried to go down the stairs youve never lacked for imagination ranulf envision what it would be like to be stuffed into an oven for that was the tower stairwell he gestured selfconsciously at his burns you can see for yourself i slammed the door shut just in time next i tried shouting for help but no one heard so i did the only thing i could think of i rang the bells ranulf was riveted i heard it he said i did fortunately so did the nuns they are remarkable women ranulf id not have blamed them for turning a deaf ear to my pleas jesu look what we brought down upon them but as soon as they saw me at the tower window they did all they could to save us dragging bales of hay from the stables i anchored the bell rope knotted it around marshals waist and lowered him down when he got to the end of the rope he cut himself loose and fell onto the hay i said the most fervent if brief prayer of my life and followed you mean marshal was still in his right senses an injury like that would have driven most men mad oh he is mad gilbert said very seriously only a madman could lack all fear as he does i swear to you that he was not afraid up in that tower i saw it in his face and that scared me for certes but crazed or not he is as remarkable in his own way as those nuns i cannot even imagine the sort of pain he must have been in he was soon burning up with fever too and sick as a dog i had to keep reining in the horse so he could puke and by the time we got there he got where gib back up to those bales of hay and start over the nuns did what they could smeared our burns with fennel and goose grease we dared not stay there though for ypres would be coming back the nuns said hed ridden off to raid andover andas we discoveredhe burned it to the ground i could not take marshal back with me to winchester and he insisted upon going to his castle at ludgershall that made some sense to me his wife could tend to him there as we were starting out we got lucky and stumbled onto a loose horse from the battle i do not know how far ludgershall is from wherwellabout ten miles mayhap more but it was without doubt the longest journey of my life we got there though marshal suffering in silence all the way as i said an amazing man i admire him mightily but i much prefer that it be at a distance from now on ranulf was quiet marveling leaning over he emptied the last of the wine into their cups ill grant you that marshal must have been suffering the torments of the damned but what of your own pain have you even seen the doctor yet i think the nuns and marshals lady did right by me as much as any doctor could do i will let him tend to me though if you insist but later nownow i just want to sit here and get drunker than ive ever been before i know were fast running out of food but how is the wine holding up ill tell luke to bring up enough wine to fill a bathtub that way you can drink it or bathe in it or both ranulf smiled crookedly my god gib why did you come back why did you not stay at ludgershall earl robert is my liege lord gilbert said as if that explained all and for him it did and id rather take my chances with you and lady maude than our friend marshal for all the trouble youve gotten me into not once did you ever trap me in a burning tower gilbert had lain back on the bed his voice was blurring his odd lashless eyelids drooping just when he seemed to be asleep he murmured i feel like i escaped from hell ranulf reached out taking the tilting wine cup from gilberts lax fingers that you did gib he said softly from hell back to purgatory winchester england september my lady minnas selfcontrol was impressive shed had a lifetimes practice in curbing unruly emotions but even her vaunted composure had been affected by the strain of the siege and she could not completely conceal her anxiety has a decision been reached maude closed the bedchamber door yes she said we are withdrawing from the city on the morrow we have no other choice minna it has become painfully clear that we can expect no aid of all the lords we summoned weve heard from none but chester and whilst he claims he is making ready to march on winchester none of us are willing to wager our lives upon his good faith if he truly meant to help hed have been here by now could king david not send to scotland for more men or lord geoffrey by the time they could get here wed all have starved weve talked it over and agree that we must try to break free matildas men have blocked the roads to the south and east and now that ypres has taken over the wherwell nunnery he holds the andover road too in the palm of his hand but we think the road westthe salisbury roadremains open weve decided that i should go out first ahead of the army and ride hard and fast for john marshals castle at ludgershall robert believes that would be the safest way although minna said nothing maude quickly added as convincingly as she could you need not fear for me minna i will be with brien and rainald and theyll not let me come to harm minna did not doubt that brien and rainald would do all they could to protect maude but would it be enough what if the road was not still passable as they hoped or if they could not outrun pursuit it would serve for naught though to give voice to her fears her lady well knew the dangers forcing a smile she sought to sound rueful as she said i ought to have heeded you my lady and stayed at oxford castle with lady beatrice and lord ranulfs wolfdogs it is good of you to resist reminding me of my folly but i do not want you to fret on my behalf ill be quite safe here at the castle that might have been true if stephen were commanding this siege but i would never entrust your safety to a man like ypres no minna ill not leave you behind my lady you must listen to your head not your heart i am an old woman past fifty once you go out that west gate you must ride for your life i could never keep up with you would be an anchor dragging you down that is why i have arranged for you to ride with the archbishop of canterbury and his retinue they will have a flag of truce and the greater protection of gods cross youll be safe with them minna you at least will be safe minna was at a loss what maude needed to hearthat the men who mattered most to her would not be in perilshe could not say for it would have been a lie what will happen come morning my lady once the archbishop departs the army will ride forth led by miles and my uncle david robert will then bring up the rearward i tried to talk him out of it minna i tried so hardbut he would not listen he insists upon commanding the rear guard i know naught of military matters my lady is that so dangerous he means to delay pursuit as long as possible minna so that i might have time to get away he would not admit it but i know that is what he intends to do robert always lays claim to the heaviest burden the greatest risk and if any evil befalls him because of me i do not think i could live with it i will pray for him madame minna said earnestly i will pray for us all pray for the poor people of winchester too minna may almighty god protect them maude said softly for i cannot it was no longer night not yet day dawn was still hovering beyond the horizon although faint glimmerings of light had begun to infiltrate the eastern sky torches were flaring in the castle bailey giving maude one last glimpse of the taut shadowed faces of her kinsmen and liegemen farewells had already been said muted and measured and private and once shed mounted her mare robert confined himself to a grave godspeed meant as a benediction it sounded more like an epitaph ranulf salvaged the moment though by drawling the first one to reach ludgershall gets to go to church with john marshal since gilberts account of his belltower interlude had not only circulated throughout winchester but was fast passing into legend that got an edgy laugh maude looked at her brothers her throat constricting and then urged her mare forward toward the opening gate once they passed through the citys west gate they turned onto the salisbury road maude did not look back at winchester she did not dare never had she felt so powerless and she envied the men their weapons their male right to selfdefense shed thought she knew all of the burdens imposed upon her because shed been unfortunate enough to have been born female but theyd not gone a mile before she discovered yet another of eves afflictions that her very skirts were hampering her escape she was riding sidesaddle for women of rank rode astride only on the hunting field and although she was an accomplished rider sidesaddles were not meant for a flatout gallop at full speed as she could not match the mens pace they had to slow their mounts to accommodate her mare and maudes fears for brien and rainald soon rivaled her dread for those shed left in winchester if they were pursued theyd never be able to outrun the enemy but she knew theyd not abandon her no matter how badly her mare lagged behind had she doomed them too the road was an ancient one of roman origin the major route to salisbury and the west they would follow it until they reached le strete a raised causeway also dating from roman times there they would cross the river test and then turn off onto a narrow trackway that would take them safely past andover on to ludgershall castle maude tried to focus her thoughts upon the hard perilous ride ahead of them but her brain would not cooperate it kept conjuring up bloody images of dead and dying men would robert and the others be able to fight their way free how much time had passed daylight was nigh the sky a soft milky shade of grey what would this day bring for winchester for them all the countryside was hilly and the road was rising when they reached the crest they drew rein abruptly for the road below was blocked by a large log there werent that many soldiers in the camp just enough to keep watch or halt a supply convoy they were not as alert as william de ypres would have wished for they did not appear to have posted a guard and they were rolling sleepily out of their blankets cursing to find their fire had gone out during the night yawning and stretching and then gaping up at the riders above them for seconds that seemed endless both sides stared at one another and then brien grasped maudes arm do not stop he said no matter what as soon as he saw she understood he spurred his stallion forward led his men down the slope into the enemy encampment lacking spurs women riders carried small leather whips maude rarely used hers and when she brought it down now upon her mares withers the horse shot forward as if launched from a crossbow gathering momentum as they swept down the hill the mare did not falter as they approached the barricade soared up and over maude thought one man had grabbed for her reins as she galloped past but she could not be sure for it all happened in a blur she heard shouts and swearing another sound shed never heard before but would never forgetthe metallic lethal jangle of clashing swords she did as brien had bade urged her mare on until the noise had begun to fade behind her and the road ahead was clear only then did she ease her mount and look back at the enemy camp the battle was already over but it had been as bloody as it was brief outnumbered on foot and just roused from sleep these careless young sentinels had been no match for briens armed knights handpicked for their killing capabilities bodies lay crumpled in the road half hidden by the tall grass slumped across the log barricade there were no survivors for there could be no witnesses theyd suffered but one casualty of their own and they left him where hed fallen amidst his enemies for on this sunday september morn debts owed to the dead had to be deferred they paused only long enough to set free the tethered horses rainald was cursing his own clumsiness he seemed more aggrieved by the damage done to his hauberk than to his arm and submitted grumbling as maude hastily bandaged his wound with her silk veil she was about to mount her mare again when brien rode up you are not hurt much to her relief he shook his head he slid his sword back into its leather scabbard but not before she saw the blood smeared upon the blade can you ride astride like a man he asked i urge you to attempt it for speed may well be our salvation although shed only ridden astride during an occasional hunt maude did not hesitate i will she said and when they brought forward the slain knights stallion she let brien assist her up into the saddle as they turned the mare loose maude felt a pang for the graceful grey palfrey was her favorite mount i am sorry brien said but we cannot spare the time to switch saddles maude was surprised and touched that in the midst of all this carnage and chaos hed remembered her fondness for the filly i pray she said that by days end the greatest of my regrets will be for a lost mare despite the early hour the citizens of winchester turned out to watch as miles led his army out of their city logic had told them this day was coming but they seemed stunned nonetheless now that it was finally here for theyd had to believe all the more fervently in gods mercy knowing they could expect none from william de ypres and his flemings but neither the almighty nor the empress was answering prayers on the second sunday in september on one of the sacred days of the church calendar the exaltation of the holy cross the apocalypse was at hand as robert approached his stallion the man holding his reins spoke up i am ellis my lord groom here these ten years past i fear for my family now that you are going what shall i do how can i keep them safe there will be looting robert said afterward stay off the streets if you can bar your doors and shutter your windows do nothing to call attention to yourself i can tell you no more than that ellis still clutched at roberts reins my lord he said i have daughters robert felt anger flare anger at a world in which so many men saw war as sport hed fought when it was necessary killed when he must but never had he taken any pleasure in it hide them away he said knowing how inadequate an answer that was yet having no other advice to offer he could do nothing for ellis nothing for winchester his men were mounted and waiting they looked tired and tense and of a sudden younger than their years never did men seem so vulnerable to him as when they were about to go into battle under his command he glanced again at their faces then drew a sharp breath ranulf he beckoned and his brother nudged his stallion forward what are you doing here you agreed to ride out with miles ranulf shrugged i overslept roberts reaction was hopelessly conflictedenormous pride in ranulf warring with an urge to grab hold of the younger man and shake some sense into him i should think that one fool in the family would be enough you just be sure to get through this unharmed or maude will never forgive me come on ranulf said ill race you to ludgershall theyd come more than eight miles and were almost upon le strete it was on the other side of the hill rainald signaled for a brief halt to ease their horses and unwittingly earned maudes undying gratitude she shifted gingerly in the saddle seeking inconspicuously to tuck her skirts in under her legs when brien glanced her way she mustered up a smile for she was determined to keep her discomfort hidden as long as possible hopefully it would not occur to them that skirts were not meant for riding astride nor were they likely to realize that her stockings were gartered at the knee that with nothing between her inner thighs and the saddle leather the constant jouncing had soon rubbed her skin raw she was already chafed and blistered and they had hours of hard riding ahead of themif they could get safely across the river test that was still in doubt for theyd run into two of ypress scouts a few miles back briens crossbowmen had brought one of them down but the other had been luckier and had vanished into the woods their greatest danger lay just ahead at le strete for there the salisbury road was joined by the one from wherwell if the scout had succeeded in giving the alarm ypress men could be waiting for them at the river crossing maude was not the only one thinking of that brien moved his horse close so they could talk the man on the roan is a local lad wholl guide us across the downs to ludgershall he says there is a ford at leckford but it is too close to wherwell for us to risk it there is a royal manor at le strete a handful of houses and a bridge if we can get across it without being seen by ypress men theyll not know which path we took are you ready to ride as if the devil were on our tails she nodded if i had to choose between ypres and the devil im not sure which one id pick lets outrun them both for ranulf and gilbert the battle of winchester was chillingly familiar it was as if they were reliving that frantic skirmish on the wherwell road for once again they were being assailed from all sides caught up in a surging frenzied tide of thrashing bodies panicked horses and bloodied weapons only this time there was no abbey to take shelter in just the road ahead and the enemy behind robert was urging them to stay close together and to keep going and they did their best to heed him for his was the one voice of reason in a world gone mad a world filled only with their enemies now that their retreat from winchester had turned into this wild rout miles had known theyd be pursued what suspense there was lay in the timing of the attack but hed not expected his men to crack under the assault it happened though and with shocking suddenness his army had disintegrated as more and more men lost heart in this unequal struggle sought salvation in flight and roberts rear guard found itself on its own fighting a desperate and valiant delaying action in a war already lost the battle raged along the salisbury road the fugitives from miless broken command were being chased down bodies were being looted and riderless horses seemed to be everywhere circling about in confusion ranulfs own mount was tiring it had begun to shorten stride he had to strain now to find robert midst the crush of men and horses they would have to make a stand soon if not theyd be cut to pieces but where the road was sloping up again he glanced over his shoulder seeking gilbert and was jolted to discover hed lost his squire he twisted around in the saddle some yards back a chestnut stallion was flailing about on the ground unable to rise it had a white blaze and foreleg and so did lukes palfrey as little as that was to go upon it was enough for ranulf and he swung his horse about he soon spotted luke the youth was on his feet although he seemed dazed by his fall and did not respond to ranulfs shout but hed drawn the attention of these men searching a nearby body for valuables recognizing him as easy prey the men moved in confidently their cockiness almost cost them dearly they scattered just in time as ranulfs destrier plunged into their midst but they did not go far instead they spread out and began to circle warily swords and pike at the ready ranulf aimed his stallion at the closest of his assailants blood spurted the mans sword thudded to the ground and he recoiled hastily ranulf turned to confront the others only to find them in retreat too for he was no longer alone gilbert was coming toward them at a gallop you came back for me luke lurched forward tripped and nearly fell under the hooves of ranulfs stallion ranulf saw no blood but the boys face was the shade of curdled milk i hurt my arm he said sounding apologetic as if his injury was somehow his fault i fear it is broken ranulf and gilbert exchanged troubled looks they could not leave the lad here injured and on his own but never could they have ridden away abandoned robert to his fate they wasted no time in discussion caught a loose horse for luke put his foundering chestnut out of its suffering and hastened after their beleaguered comrades the battle had swept past them over the crest of winchester hill they spurred their horses up the road glancing back to make sure luke was following and came upon the last bitter moments of the illfated sevenweek siege of winchester it ended there at le strete when roberts struggling rear guard collided with a contingent of flemings coming down the wherwell road ended in one final flurry of doomed resistance dying and defeat the longest and most desperate day of maudes life was at last drawing to a close in the inner bailey of ludgershall castle she was trembling so great was her fatigue and when she was helped from the saddle she feared that her legs would not support her brien came to her rescue offering his arm for support she thought he looked exhausted too they all did men and horses alike drenched in sweat and choked with the reddish dust of the dry september roads she allowed herself a moments indulgence borrowed briens strength then she squared her shoulders and moved to meet the man just emerging from the tower keep she was not surprised that john marshal was up and about rather than languishing upon a sickbed she knew the man well enough to have been sure that if he was not dead of his wounds hed be on his feet she thought she was prepared for the extent of his injuries but she was not her breath stopped as she saw his face she forced herself not to avert her eyes feeling that she owed it to him to look without flinching upon the wounds hed gotten in her service his eye socket was covered by a pusstained bandage and from hairline to beard his skin was raw and red and encrusted with scabs slathered with goose grease but she knew hed have scorned her sympathy in that they were alike so she said only do you think you can find room for some unexpected guests his mouth twitched ive never yet turned an empress away from my door a woman had come from the keep behind him and he said madame may i present my wife the lady adelina adelina made a graceful curtsy maude took one look and liked her not for she was smallboned and fairhaired and flowerfragilelike matilda but when marshals men began to crowd around assailing them with questions it was adelina who saw maudes utter exhaustion ill not have it said that the mistress of ludgershall does not know how to welcome a highborn guest she chided explanations can wait if youll be good enough to follow me my lady maude did gratefully and by the time she was seated upon the bed in john and adelinas private chamber shed completely revised her unfavorable impression of marshals wife adelina brought her a laver of scented washing water a soothing salve for her sunburned face a flagon of spiced and sweetened wine all the while carrying on an easy conversation that was oddly comforting in and of itself for she asked no awkward questions and gave maude no time to dwell upon winchesters fall and the men who might be dying even now on her behalf when she urged maude to stretch out on the bed maude did not demur although she insisted that shed never be able to sleep just rest then adelina said supper can wait shed already helped maude to strip off her gown lamenting its bedraggled condition and the fact that maude was too tall to wear one of her own gowns never you mind though well clean and mend this one for you ill look in on you later my lady now i must tend to john the doctor said i should soak his bandage in vinegar and change it often it is a wonder maude murmured that the pain did not drive him mad most likely because we kept him drunk for days adelinas voice was lulling maude closed her eyes when adelina leaned over the bed and touched her shoulder she thought at first that shed just fallen asleep but as she sat up groggily she saw the night sky framed in the bedchambers open window madame i am indeed sorry to awaken you but i was given no choice your brother and lord brien insist upon leaving at once for your castle at devizes i urged them to let you sleep the night through but they say the danger is too great for you here maude asked no questions but she could not suppress a gasp when she swung her legs over the bed for even that slight movement was painful her hair was trailing down her back the true measure of her fatigue for adelina must have unbraided it while she slept on unaware as maude tried again to get to her feet adelina gave a soft cry there is blood on your chemise did your flux come upon you of a sudden no i had to ride astride like a man but i lacked the undergarments that men wear and my thighs blistered badly how can you ride on to devizes then that is nigh on twenty miles i can and i will i must and you cannot tell the men adelina i do not want them to know the other woman nodded reluctantly then you must let me do what i can to ease your discomfort she said and turned aside to ransack a coffer by the foot of the bed with gentle deft strokes she rubbed an herbal ointment into maudes blistered abraded skin then fashioned bandages from a pillowcase and she understood when maudes thank you seemed grudgingly given saying those are words that catch in my johns throat too he finds it hard to admit a need maude did not know what to say to that for it seemed to require a confidence in return but adelina did not wait for a response instead crossed the chamber to retrieve maudes gown she was helping to lace it up when brien and rainald sought admittance maude looked from one to the other why must we leave ludgershall in such haste what is it that youre so loath for me to know rainald cleared his throat marshal sent a few of his men toward winchester to find out what happened only one of them has gotten back so far but after hearing what he learned we knew we dare not stay here for this will be the first place they think to look once they start searching for you in earnest weve got to get you as far away as we can as fast as we can it will not be easy for you but you think i care about my comfort just tell me was there a battle brien nodded ypres and the queens earls fell upon our army soon after they rode out along the salisbury road marshals scout says they scattered to the winds every man for himself he says not even the archbishop was spared that the clerics were roughly handled their horses stolen oh dear god maude whispered minna and what of ranulf miles and david and all the others tell me the rest she said the worst tell me about robert we do not know for certes rainald said but he no longer met her eyes and it was brien who told her the truth marshals scout says that roberts men did not bolt like the others they fought a running battle as far as le strete where they were surrounded and overwhelmed by warenne and ypres and his flemings brien saw her shudder and started to reach toward her then let his arm fall to his side they would have wanted to take robert alive he said i swear to you that is true maude swallowed with a visible effort you are saying then that either robert was captured or he was slain neither man spoke but she had her answer in their silence and she shut her eyes squeezing back her tears she would be able to weep soon hidden by the darkness riding through the night toward devizes but not now not yet she would leave ludgershall dryeyed and unbowed she would not shame robert with her tears cecily watched anxiously as matilda moved again to the tent entrance but she no longer urged her mistress to attempt to get some sleep she knew that matilda would be up until dawn if need be until she got the word about maude rising she poured a cup of wine and carried it across the tent the other woman accepted it absently continuing to gaze up at the stardusted dark sky there is a fire in winchester she said seeover to the east come back inside my lady cecily pleaded ere you catch a chill try to put the towns troubles from your mind it does no good to dwell upon what cannot be helped matilda let the tent flap drop stephen kept his army from pillaging and raping in shrewsbury she said there must have been something i could have done and why did the kings soldiers heed him at shrewsbury because hed just hanged ninetyfour men from the castle battlements and they feared not to my lady this is the way of the war we need not like it but accept it we must what other choice have we what you say makes sense cecily but i doubt that i will ever understand the londoners were so fearful for their city so afraid that maude would wreak havoc upon their homes and families how then could they have been amongst the first to despoil winchester my lady i cannot answer that but this i do know that you have nothing to reproach yourself for you seek only to free your lord husband from unjust confinement and against all the odds you have prevailed this day he has won his liberty and it was your doing matilda felt a prickle of superstitious dread we do not know that not yet if maude escapes all this suffering and dying will have been for naught the war will go on andand stephens life might well be forfeit because of me that will not happen she has been taken prisoner i know she has i would to god i could share your certainty matilda said wearily but she seemed sure to be taken at arundel too and then again at westminster did she not the kings gallantry spared her at arundel and blind luck at london luck that is fast running out matilda sat down at the table pushed the candle aside and leaned forward resting her head upon her arms but almost at once she straightened up did you hear that more men coming in her senses had been betraying her all night hearing sounds that echoed only in her head but this time she was right and she was on her feet waiting by the time william de warenne and william de ypres pushed their way into the tent warenne looked dirty and tired and jubilant god has shown us such favor madame for what a victory we had i know that matilda interrupted but what of maude is she captive ypres shook his head i regret not that woman has the most unholy luck she ought never to have been able to slip through our net yet she somehow did you need not fear though for well soon track her down we have men on her trail even now but matilda was no longer listening then we lost she cried can you not see that without maude we gained nothing neither man seemed fazed by her despair they looked at each other and grinned ah but we did ypres said maude may have flown the nest but we plucked her tail feathers for certes and turning he lifted the tent flap bring him in the man escorted into the tent was a stranger to cecily he was no longer young for his brown hair was well salted with gray and save for an ugly bruise under his left eye he seemed unhurt what struck her most forcefully was his composure if not for his bound wrists shed never have known he was a prisoner lady matilda he said calmly it is always a pleasure to see you although i would rather it be under different circumstances matilda was staring at him in shock robert she breathed so softly that only cecily heard and her eyes widened my lady is this man the earl of gloucester this man matilda said unsteadily is stephens salvation her voice was muffled midway between laughter and tears reaching for the flemings hand she held fast how good god is blessed be his name and bless you too willem for youve given me back my husband near devizes castle wiltshire england september when maudes lashes flickered a voice said she is coming around she wondered hazily what brien was doing in her bedchamber the light seemed glaringly bright and it actually hurt to look up at the sky sky her eyes opened wide and she discovered that she was lying on the ground a mantle wadded up under her head brien how far away her voice sounded how weak brien what happened you fell from your horse you do not remember no she bit her lip no his fingers brushed her cheek her forehead youre feverish and little wonder after all youve been through these three days past why did you not tell us you were ailing maude maude blinked and rainalds face came into focus over briens shoulder you said it was too dangerous to stay any longer at devizes yes but i had it in mind to get you to gloucester alive rainald patted her shoulder awkwardly tender no matter though for weve gone only a few miles ill send back to devizes for a horse litter a horse litter was used only by the aged and the infirm the helpless maudes flush deepened you risked your lives for me she said huskily and ive let you down maude that is not so i agree with brien sister youve done right well for a woman and that rainald added hastily is but a joke rainaldthank you for seeing to my safety he shrugged then smiled i reckoned it was time i started earning my earldom brien make sure she stays put whilst i see about the horse litter maude did lie still as he moved away although her compliance was due to exhaustion brien she said so softly that he had to lean closer to hear i thank you too i owe you more than i could ever repay mayhap even my life youve been so loyal and ii did not even give you an earldom like rainald her smile was hesitant her jest no less tentative but brien knew what she was really askingwhy hed been so loyal he even knew what she would never let herself askwhy he cared reaching out he entwined the tip of her long black braid around his fingers remembering the way her hair had looked in john marshals bedchamber tumbling loose and lush and free about her shoulders i admire courage above all else he said and you are as brave as you are beautiful as brave as any man and braver by far than most loyalty is the least that you deserve to maudes horror tears filled her eyes what will i do brien if robert is dead you will grieve for him and then youll go on that was a lie for robert was their linchpin without him to hold it together her cause would falter fall apart like her army at winchester but she was grateful to brien for believing that she was strong enough to survive without robert he is alive she insisted robert and ranulf and milesthey are all alive i am sure of that brien and if that was a lie too it was one they both needed to believe sleep had always come easily to stephen he could catnap at a moments notice and it was a rare night when the days troubles invaded the safe shadowrealm of his dreams even in sleep he was not one for violating sanctuary but that had changed abruptly in midjuly the irons clamped upon his wrists had done more than chafe his skin and shrink his space they also clanked loudest at night dragged down by their weight he snatched what sleep he could never more than skimming the surface and so it took only the slightest sounda stealthy footfall muffled in the floor rushesto bring him upright in the bed wide awake and wary before he could speak though a shadow flitted forward make no noise my lord for i cannot be caught here it is meedgar stephens eyes were adjusting rapidly to the dark for you to come calling in the middle of the night edgar you must have news that is very good or very bad which is it lad edgar hesitated in truth my lord it could be either squatting in the floor rushes by the bed he said you must know what i overheard in the hall lady amabel got word tonight from the empress from winchester edgar shook his head winchester has fallen to your queen the empress fled the city on sunday morn and escaped by the grace of god and a fast horse she reached gloucester last night weary unto death but luckier than many for her armys retreat turned into a wild rout men lost their weapons and shed their armor and hid themselves howsoever they could lord miles and the scots king and the earl of devon and lord ranulfthey are all unaccounted for their whereabouts unknown stephen was quiet taking it all in you omitted one name from that list of missing men what of robert fitz roy edgars voice hoarsened no one knowsnot yet he did not run like the others fought off the flemings until they trapped him at the river test but in giving the empress time to escape he may well have doomed himself and she fears the worst so does his wife poor lady i heard her in the chapel weeping as if her heart would break are you sure it was amabel id have thought she had more sense than that tears are a womans weapons and she ought not to squander them needlessly edgar was shocked by the levity enough to venture a timid reproach a widows grief ought not to be mocked my lord god would not approve amabel is no widow lad robert is not dead theyd have been loath to see him even bruised much less mortally hurt they took him alive you may be sure of that for robert is my ransoma kings ransom stephen said and laughed suddenly jubilantly i hope so my lord indeed i do hope so edgar said sounding so dubious that stephen gave him a quizzical look id not blame you if you did not lad i understand that you are loyal to robert oh no my lord it is not that i wish the earl well admire him mightily butbut if i had money enough it would be your freedom id buy not his hearing what hed just blurted out edgar blushed shamed by his disloyalty to robert he owed his lord better than that and stephen was the enemy the possessor of a stolen crown yet none of that mattered not anymore earl robert is my lord he said softly but you are my king stephen smiled should you not be glad then for me you do understand what this means to gain roberts freedom maude will have to give me mine shell like it not but shell do it for shell have no choice edgar nodded solemnly i know that my lord butbut what if the earl was not taken alive what if he was struck down in the battle then maudes queenship hopes were struck down too she cannot win without him edgar squirmed uneasily butwell people without hopethey might what are you so shy of saying ladthat i might soon follow robert to the grave i have more faith in maude than that if she were capable of outright murder id have been dead months ago edgar was not reassured he knew stephen was more worldly than he but he suspected that hed had far more experience with desperation than ever stephen had what if the empress was not consulted beforehand what if some of her men took it upon themselves to rid her of her only real rival if you were dead my lord i daresay most men would accept her as queen now that hed finally confessed his fears edgar looked up quickly to catch stephens reaction to his amazement stephen seemed quite unperturbed almost amused it does not pay to borrow trouble lad if you do youre sure to end up with more than your share i am not going to be smothered in my sleep or poisoned or take a convenient tumble down the stairs how can you be so sure because i believe in happy endings if the almighty had meant for me to die id have died at lincoln what would be the purpose of my confinement if i were slain now with vindication just within my reach no lad the almighty would never be so cruel edgar didnt argue although stephens benevolent deity did not sound at all like the one hed been taught to revere and fear jehovah god of wrath he had a multitude of reasons for envying stephenhis health and high birth and handsome face and devoted wifebut he found himself envying above all else stephens utter certitude his sunlit faith in what hed just jokingly called a happy ending edgar could not imagine what it would be like to dwell in a world so free of shadows but then his own world was one in which he was knownto all but stephenas scarecrow id best go he said ere i am missed ill not see you on the morrow my lord for it is not my turn to guard you but if i hear anything more about earl robert or the battle ill find a way to get word to you stephen shoved his pillow behind his shoulders knowing hed never be able to get back to sleep he had long wakeful hours ahead but they would be a gift a private time alone in which to rejoice to thank the almighty and to anticipate a reunion with his wife edgarthink you that you might like to see london one day if so you need only seek out my steward william martel and identify yourself youll have a place in my household waiting for you as long as i am king you have but to come and claim it edgar was mute awed by the offer and all it encompassed reaching the door he opened it cautiously glanced back over his shoulder grinned and then was gone the memory of that rapt shining smile lingered though for it was the first time that stephen had seen edgar smile without bringing up his hand to shield his cleft lip from the castle solar matilda could catch a glimpse of winchesters streets people were out and about the city slowly getting back to normal but the damage done by the siege was even more extensive than she had first feared on this sunwarmed september morning she found herself dreading the coming of winter knowing what suffering it would bring to winchester turning from the window she studied the men seated at the solars table they were tense expectantexcept for robert he seemed quite calm she suspected that hed gotten a better nights sleep than she had and her anger flared without warning if not for robert maudes claim would have flickered out by now a candle quenched and cast aside but anger was a luxury she could not afford not yet instead she smiled she was learning to use smiles as shields i trust youve thought about our last conversation she queried pointedly but still polite robert smiled too a noncommittal smile that was as meaningless as her own saying nothing and her brotherinlaw stirred impatiently what is there to think about weve made you a remarkable offer robert you need only renew your allegiance to stephen and take your rightful place in the governmentas his secondincommand how could you even contemplate turning down an opportunity like that robert glanced from the bishop to matilda then over at ypres theyd promised to give him a vast amount of power he wondered impersonally if they meant it if it was bribe or hoax as you say cousin henry a remarkable offer but it is not one i can fairly judge under the present circumstances set me free and i shall give it the consideration it deserves he saw their faces change as they absorbed his answer saw their disappointment and anger andfrom ypresa grim glimmer of amusement i will not betray my sister he said quietly you ought to have known that matildas eyes narrowed i will not apologize for trying to halt this needless bloody war i am sorry robert that you cannot see the harm you are doing sorrier than i can say but so be it i think you made a fools choice the bishop said brusquely but you are the one wholl have to live with it solets talk of a trade your freedom for stephens that should be simple enough to arrange there is a pen and inkwell on the table and plenty of parchment the sooner you write to your sister the sooner you i cannot do that they stared at him why not i cannot agree to a trade on those terms i am but an earl whilst stephen is a consecrated king i would have an inflated sense of my own worth indeed were i to believe i was a kings equal if stephen is to be freed it is only fair that the men taken prisoner with me at le strete should be freed too there was an astonished silence broken by ypres set them free without ransoms never whilst i draw breath he sounded so indignant that robert knew at once he must have captured one or more highborn prisoners himself those are the only terms that i can accept i hardly think you are in a position to dictate terms the bishop snapped i think it is time for some plain talking youve been very well treated so far cousin but that can change we know that maude clapped stephen in irons i daresay we can find some for you too if it comes to that robert remained impassive we all do what we must ypres leaned across the table youd do well to remember that i am no friend to you fitz roy moreover ive always looked upon mercy as a character flaw willem matilda confined herself to that involuntary objection not willing to reprimand ypres in roberts presence the bishop had no such scruples and aimed a withering look in the flemings direction you are but wasting your breath and our time ypres he knows full well that well not be torturing him to break his will matilda would never abide it nor would i lets talk instead of confinement not the kind youd enjoy cousin and not in england either where you might find friends foolhardy enough to attempt a rescue noif you force us to it well send you to matildas lands in boulogne id advise you to think on that prospect long and hard a lifetime alone in the dark with no hope of escape robert was not intimidated but neither was he defiant sounding eminently reasonable as if he were merely pointing out a hitherto overlooked fact he said and whilst i was rotting away in a boulognese dungeon what do you think would be happening to stephen amabel picked up a pen without enthusiasm shed been taught to read and write in her youth lacking a son her father had lavished unusual care upon the education of his daughters writing was a clerks task though and shed had little practice at it but this was not a letter she dared dictate to a scribe she no longer trusted her own discretion to my daughter maud countess of chester greetings i would that i had word for you of your fathers fate but it has been three days now since i joined maude at gloucester and weve heard nothing i fear i shall go stark mad if we do not soon reconsidering she scratched out that last sentence gripping the pen again she wrote miles fitz walter reached us yesterday in a sorry state indeedbruised and bleeding and hungry and dispirited having made his way alone to gloucester after his command shattered and last night a message arrived from gilbert foliot the abbot of the benedictine monastery here he was one of the churchmen with the archbishop of canterbury and reports they were ill used their horses stolen their belongings rifled those impious knaves even robbed the archbishop of a silver cross but they were not harmed and abbot gilbert vows to bring minna back with him as soon as he can provide a safe escortyou remember minna that dour german woman of maudes we still do not know though what befell ranulf or the scots king pray god they were able to escape as miles did her pen hovered above the parchment as her attention wandered and ink dripped down onto the letter she could not seem to control her thoughts anymore every road led her back to robert and that wretched river crossing at le strete your brothers will and philip are back at bristol keeping a close watch upon stephen but i brought roger with me he is so sure that robert is alive and unhurt but a priest would not be likely to lack faith would he she got no further her head came up the pen slipping from her fingers her maid had heard it too casting aside her sewing she said something is amiss belowstairs but by then amabel was already halfway to the door the great hall was lit by smoking torches and an open hearth fire coming from the dark of the stairwell amabel squinted at the sudden brightness maude and rainald and brien and miles were clustered in a circle utterly intent upon a new arrival she could tell only that he was of middle height for her view was blocked by those crowding around him but her heart leapt in a sudden desperate surge a hope that plummeted as rainald moved aside revealing the man in their midst she thought ranulf looked ghastly his face bloodless and haggard dark eyes glazed and unfocuseduntil he glanced her way you are a welcome sight she began as he strode toward her but ranulf cut her off as if his safety were of no matter robert was taken prisoner at le strete he said but he was not harmed amabel i swear he was not be sure what you say ranulf for gods pity be very sure i am sure he insisted i was there i saw him surrender you were there she echoed blankly and you left him you just rode off and left him jesus wept how could you his face twitched as if hed taken a blow itit was too late he stammered was all over by the time i got there he sounded as wretched as he looked and somewhere in the back of her brain she perceived his pain acknowledged her own unfairness but she did not want to be fair not anymore robert had toiled his entire life striving to be fair and where had it gotten him he would never have abandoned you she cried never you know he how dare you maudes voice was choked so great was her fury ranulf would have given his life for robert if you must blame someone blame me then but not ranulf damn you not ranulf you are rightfor once the blame does belong to you maude and ill not cheat you of any of it maude stepped closer grasped amabels arm i care not if you make a fool of yourself but robert would you owe him better than this the realization that robert would indeed have disapproved of her behavior only stoked amabels rage all the higher you are right again she said with a tight brittle smile twice in a rowa record for certes she pulled free of maudes hold then so violently that she stumbled backward and when she felt a steadying hand upon her arm she started to lash out at this new enemy it was only when she heard his indrawn protest of mama that she glanced up at his face recognized her youngest son lets go to the chapel mama he urged and pray for papas safe deliverance roger was still new to his calling painfully earnest in his priestly dignity to the rest of the world he may have seemed like one of gods chosen but to amabel he was a lost lamb and she did not object when he tugged her toward the door but if prayer does not gain roberts release it was an unspoken threat and a needless one maude would do whatever she must to pay roberts ransom those in the hall knew that but they knew too what his freedom would costfor maude for them all and for england the bishop had settled in at wolvesey for it had not been badly damaged by the siege unlike the royal palace which was in ruins declining his hospitality matilda chose to stay at the castle and people were soon lining up outside the kitchen for the threat of starvation no longer hung over the city but hunger was still winchesters unwelcome guest robert was gone though william de ypres had escorted him to the greater security of rochester castle in kent deep in the heartland of matildas english domains it was midoctober before ypres reported back to matilda and the news he brought was not good robert was still refusing to end his own captivity by setting stephen free not without additional concessions they were unwilling to make they were seated close by the hearth in the great hall for there was a chill of early winter in the air stretching his legs cramped from long hours in the saddle ypres complained half humorously it is extremely irksome having to respect someone i dislike so heartily but i cannot deny the mans courage if he was cut hed likely bleed ice matilda did not find roberts fortitude quite so admirable she didnt share ypress conviction that courage was the defining measure of a man if we agreed to free the other prisoners you cannot do that when a man takes a highborn prisoner he expects to profit from it that is the way its always been you cannot change the rules with no warning not without risking rebellion my ladygloucester is engaging you in a clash of wills do not let him win he thinks he can outwait you that youre so eager to get stephen back that nothing else matters prove him wrong how simple make him want his freedom just as much as you want stephen matilda shook her head i do not like the sound of that willem i am not suggesting we hang the man up by his heels although the idea does have some merit but we need not make his confinement quite so comfortable either he is being treated more like an honoured guest than a prisoner of war allowed to have visitors to write letters to go into the town if he chooses last week he even bought some blooded horses i know what you are about to say that he gave his sworn word hed not attempt to escape and ill concede that hes probably the one man in christendom whom id trust to keep such a preposterous oath for he has always been insufferably prideful whenever honour is involved but your generosity is leading you astray he can afford to balk to reject your terms for what is it costing him i say we change that impose a price hell not be willing to meet matilda frowned i will think upon what youve said willem i know my brotherinlaw agrees with you i will admit that my patience is fast shredding thin if robert does not see reason soon a servant was hovering close by ready to refill their wine cups once the man withdrew matilda shook off her disappointment and sought to sound more cheerful as she said we did have an unexpected stroke of luck last week we intercepted a courier from the scots king on his way to gloucester with a message for maude so david finally surfaced for air did he well we knew hed not been taken prisoner and i found it unlikely that a king would be lying dead in a ditch and no one know of it where is he nowand more to the point does he intend to rejoin maude by now he ought to be back in scotland his letter was dated on the nd of september and by then hed gotten as far north as durham to hear him tell it he had as many narrow escapes as maudeit must run in the family twice he was cornered and bribed his way free his letter was sparing of details so i assume he still had enough men to defend himself and his wouldbe captors must have decided it was easier to take what was offered the third time that he ran into trouble he was recognized but the knight in charge turned a blind eye let him go by for he just happened to be davids godson i have to confess that i am glad he got away he is my uncle too after all what gladdens me even more is that he will be staying up in scotland where he belongs he said as much to maude tactfully of course still the meaning seemed clear enough that from now on maude is on her own that was what ypres was hoping to hear pulling his seat closer to the fire he listened with amusement as matilda related the bishops latest undertaking hed sent his men to scour through the ruins of hyde abbey sifting the ashes until theyd recovered those abbey treasures that had survived the flames hed gotten back enough melted gold and silver to pay for the soldiers hed hired matilda reported much to the outrage of the monks ypres was still laughing when the message arrived matilda gazed down at the seal of the countess of gloucester and all else was forgotten ypres had tensed too and watched intently as she read amabels letter he could not read her face as easily as he once had for she was belatedly learning a queens skill at camouflage but it seemed to him that shed gotten paler and when she glanced up her eyes gave away her unease amabel has heard rumors that weve threatened to drag robert off to boulogne she reminds me that stephen is being held at her castle in her custody and she vows that if any harm whatsoever comes to robert she will send stephen where even god could not find himto ireland as threats went that was a daunting one you know the woman he said as i do not is this a bluff or is she capable of carrying out her threat amabel oh yes matilda said without hesitation and ypres slouched back in his chair reconsidering their options theyd have to tread with care for if gloucesters wife knew her scripturesan eye for an eye a wound for a woundmatilda was not likely to follow his advice and strip gloucesters confinement down to the bare bone jesu would she be desperate enough to give in to let gloucester win matilda was studying amabels letter but her initial disquiet seemed to have ebbed away she looked pensive now not dismayed and as he watched he saw a smile flicker about the corners of her mouth what is it he said sharply what do you have in mind i am thinking she said that weve been going about this the wrong way we have been negotiating with the wrong people willem weve been seeking to come to terms with robert and maude when the one we ought to have been bargaining with is the woman who holds stephenthe woman who wants her husband back just as much as i want mine bristol england november the first of november was not a comfortable day for travel rain had been falling intermittently since dawn and the wind had been constant blustery and biting eustace did not care about the cold he was so tense he barely felt it he looked occasionally at his mother but more often at william de ypres for he was very much in awe of the redoubtable fleming when ypres happened to glance in his direction eustace stiffened his spine and raised his head hoping that ypres would notice how well he rode he wished he had a stallion as spirited as ypress chestnut but his horse was a docile gelding wolfbait he thought scornfully longing for spurs like ypres and the other men wore despite his disappointment with his placid mount it was still easy to pretend that he was the one leading an army to bristol not ypres and his mother if only theirs were a real rescue mission he was sure they could catch the enemy by surprise assault the castle and set papa free a pity mama was so timid so loath to see bloodshed feeling her sons gaze upon her matilda gave him a quick smile eustace knew it was meant to reassure but he resented it for that very reason i do not need to be coddled mama he said indignantly i am not a bairn like will and mary and i am not scared to be a hostage not at all i know that eustace matilda found herself yearning for bygone days when the distance between them was never so great that it could not be spanned by a hug after some moments she said choosing her words with care it will all be over in a matter of days upon our arrival at bristol your father will be set free he and willem and roberts eldest son will then ride straightaway for winchester once they get there robert will be released leaving his son as his pledge he will hasten to bristol you and i will then be escorted safely back to winchester and roberts son will be freed so you see eustace well scarcely have time to unpack will be reunited with your father at winchester by weeks end it sounds as if none of you trust each other very much he said with a cynicism that seemed too adult and knowing for his eleven years matilda was troubled by it but she could not contradict him one another she corrected automatically not each other and you are right lad trust never entered into it he slanted a sidelong glance her way will she be at bristol toothe angevin slut matilda was no novice at motherhood knew full well that she was being tested i like it not when you use such unseemly language eustace moreover you are mistaken as well as rude maudes husband is the angevin she is of norman and scots stock nor is she a slut eustaces lower lip jutted out then why do men call her that ive heard them he insisted i do not doubt it but that does not make it true when people want to insult a man they cast slurs upon his courage but the worst they can say about a woman is to impugn her chastity it is unfair though for no scandal has ever sullied maudes good name whatever her other failingsand i find them plentifulshe is not a wanton eustace was not convinced but he prudently refrained from saying so he didnt really want to quarrel with his mother not today will she be there or not mama no she will not she has withdrawn to oxford castle will be awaiting robert there upon his release i suspect she could not bear to see your father ride forth as a free man eustace felt a momentary disappointment for hed envisioned himself confronting her this troublesome wicked woman whod dared to make war upon his father mamaafter papa is free what happens then will maude give up go back to her husband and leave us in peace matilda kept her eyes on the road ahead i doubt it she said bleakly i very much doubt it matilda had never been to bristol and she was both impressed and chilled by the fortified defenses of town and castle protected by two rivers and a deep manmade ditch they would never have been able to free stephen by force thank god and his holy son that it had not come to that now they passed unchallenged into robert fitz roys great citadel and when they dismounted in the inner bailey of the castle the countess of gloucester was awaiting them following amabel inside matilda found a hall crowded with curious wary and hostile onlookers but one glance was all she needed to see that the only man who mattered was not in their midst whirling upon amabel she demanded where is my husband why is he not here her suspicions were insulting but amabel was willing to overlook the affront for she could identify with matildas fear stephen is waiting for you in the solar he wanted your first meeting to be private and ushering matilda and eustace across the hall she herself led them up into the stairwell matilda soon moved ahead lifting her skirts and taking the stairs two at a time when eustace would have followed amabel blocked his way give them a few moments alone lad ere you enter eustace stared at her in astonishment for this woman was the enemy did she truly think hed do as she bade him but to his fury she refused to move aside when he sought to push past her effectively trapping him in the narrow stairwell matilda was not aware that her son had been waylaid by the time shed reached the door she was breathless and flushed nine months hed been a prisoner to the very day how would he look could a man like stephen survive confinement with no scars on his soul her heart was pounding reaching for the door latch she shoved inward stephen was standing by the window it had occurred to her that he might have gained weight an active man suddenly forced into idleness instead he seemed to have lost weight his face was thinner his cheekbones noticeably hollowed and he had more grey in his hair than she remembered but his eyes were crinkling at the corners alight with such a blazing blue joy that her throat tightened and she found herself thinking that no crown was worth more than stephens smile he moved so fast that before the door could close behind her he had her in his arms holding her so hard it hurt a little she clung tightly raising her face so he could claim her mouth not even realizing she was crying until hed begun to kiss away her tears i was so afraid she confessed that this day would never come i never doubted he assured her encircling her waist and pulling her even closer never shed worried as much over his mental state as she had over his physical danger truly stephen truly he said and grinned with you and god both on my side tilda how could i lose he kissed her again hungrily but id pawn my crown right now for a bed yes she agreed oh indeed yes giving him so ardent a look that his joke lost all humor but at that moment there was a loud banging on the door followed by their sons angry entrance that meddlesome woman would not let me in eustaces outrage flamed out quickly though at sight of his father he was suddenly uncertain oddly ill at ease stephen felt no such shyness look at you lad he marveled you are taller than your mother eustace nodded very pleased that his father had seen it at once just how much hed grown i am glad you are free papa he said sounding rather formal even to his own ears but surely he was too old now for open displays of affection stephen thought otherwise and once eustace found himself caught up in his fathers embrace he forgot his qualms and clung no less urgently than his mother had done amabel gave them as much time as she could but she could not wait long not with so much at stake i am sorry to intrude she said but the sooner you are on the way to winchester stephen the sooner ill have my husband back now there is someone else waiting to see you and she stepped aside so william de ypres could enter the room the fleming paused almost imperceptibly before crossing the threshold in his entire adult life he could not remember ever offering an apology for any act of his and he was not sure how to go about it but if they were to put the ghost of his lincoln betrayal to rest hed have to say a few words at graveside i owed you better than you got he began awkwardly and for what it is worth i did regret it but by then it was too late regrets always are stephen said he felt matildas hand tighten on his arm and he covered it with his own before turning his gaze back to ypres it is passing strange he said how confinement has affected my memory for the life of me i cannot seem to remember anything at all about your conduct at lincoln yet i have a very clear and vivid recollection of the great service you did me at winchesterand i was not even there amabel watching from the doorway said nothing she was still furious with her sisterinlaw but somewhat to her surprise she experienced a sudden sharp pang of pity for maude who had right on her side but little of stephens generosity and none of his charm matildas dream was at first fanciful and then increasingly erotic stirring drowsily she opened her eyes and discovered this dream wasat long lastreal are you getting hungry again my love she murmured and stephen laughed into her hair i did not mean to wake you i was just taking inventory of treasures ive been too long without i ought to warn you tilda that we are likely to create something of a scandal for i may not let you leave this bed for days promise she said and he laughed again drawing her in against him until they lay entwined two halves made whole i was so proud she said of the way you accepted them back into the fold all the sheep who had strayedwillem and northampton and warenne and the others willem he echoed as if affronted by the intimacy but she caught the playful tone and bit him gently when he traced her mouth with his fingers it was easy enough he said lightly for i believe in redemption i would that i could say i also believe i am my brothers keeper but that saintly i am not sweetheart she saw through the flippancy for she knew that of all the betrayals hed suffered none wounded so deeply as his brothers defection shifting so she could cradle her head in the crook of his shoulder she said i think henry will be loyal from now onin his own odd way at least you need not fear any more dalliances with maude hes burned that bridge for certes along with most of winchester he said and i wonder if he spares any regrets for the city when he mourns all his losses speaking of loss she said softly i came too close to the abyss stephen you must promise me that youll never put yourself so at risk again you have nothing to prove for not even your most bitter enemies have ever questioned your courage no more lincolns my lovepromise me such a promise would be hollow matilda unless it came from the almighty i cannot promise you that ill never come to harm i can pledge to you that i will not be so careless of my own safety in the future lincoln wasmy antioch but that is not a mistake a man makes twice lincoln and antioch the similarities between the two sieges had occurred to matilda almost at once so striking were they the crusaders capturing antioch stephen besieging lincoln castle both armies then caught by surprise confronted by a large enemy force stephens father had abandoned the siege rode away from antioch andfairly or notinto infamy disgrace that not even his subsequent martyrs death had fully expiated stephen had chosen to stay and fight it was matildas belief that hed been paying off his fathers debt but she had not expected him to see that for himself as he was the least introspective of men he sensed her surprise and said wryly solitary confinement gives a man plenty of time to think what else was there to do reaching for her hand he kissed her fingers one by one i do not have too many memories of my father tilda for i was only five when he took the cross again at my mothers insistence but i do have one very strong memory of a church probably the cathedral at chartres he was telling me about antioch and what i remember was the sadness in his face raising up on her elbow matilda brushed her lips against his cheek what a heartless wife adela had been that she could have valued her husbands honour above his life she was no longer threatened though by her indomitable motherinlaw for adelas shadow had receded in the three years since her death in the cloistered quiet of a marcigny nunnery matilda supposed most people would say her life had been a great success daughter wife widow mother and nunshed never failed to play the part expected of her and lived long enough to see one son as a prince of the church a second as count of blois and champagne and a third as englands king but when adela died few had grieved for her stephen had been stroking her hair sliding his hand down her back along the curve of her hip before his caresses could become more intimate she laced her fingers through his holding his hand still against her thigh stephenwe need to talk about betrayals those beyond forgiving geoffrey de mandeville yes i realize that you can take no action against him now not yet but he must be punished for what he did i entreat you to see that he is to hold him accountable for his treachery of course i will jesu the man abducted constance moreover he abandoned you when your need was greatest do you truly think i could ever forgive him tilda forgiveness comes easily to you my love sometimes too easily her smile was tender enough to take any sting from her words you are not a man to nurture grudges and i admire you greatly for that but mandeville owes us a debt that cannot be remitted promise me stephen that you will harden your heart against him he is not deserving of clemency yours or the almightys she kissed him then a kiss so soft and seeking and full of promise that he began to laugh what is hardening at the moment he said is not my heart she laughed too and gave herself up gladly to the joys of the marriage bed those pleasures of the flesh that were so sweet and mayhap sinful for the church said passion was suspect even if sanctified by wedlock but it seemed a strange sin indeed that of loving her husband overly well and she could not believe it was one to imperil her soul ive been so wretched without you she confided and those were the last words she got to say for some time thereafter latermuch lateras they lay at ease in each others arms he could not resist teasing her about her sudden thirst for blood dropping a quick kiss on the tip of her nose he said can this truly be my matilda my gentle little wife who would not even frown at a mangy dog or a surly beggar can this be the same woman who now plies her seductive wiles with a skill that salome might envy matilda was unperturbed if i remember my scriptures she said placidly salome did her dance of the veils for the head of john the baptist but i do not want you to kill geoffrey de mandeville stephen she turned her head on the pillow and smiled at her husband just ruin him upon roberts arrival at oxford maude celebrated his freedom with a lavish supper of roast swan stewed venison baked lamprey and a sugared subtlety sculptured to resemble a unicorn wines were poured freely her minstrel entertained them between courses and all did their best to act as if they truly had cause for rejoicing afterward they retired to the solar ostensibly for privacy but also because they could keep up the pretense no longer the castellan robert doilly and his stepson yet another of the old kings byblows had excused themselves as soon as they could leaving behind a fractured family circle rainald thought those remaining were as glum a bunch as hed ever had the bad luck to encounter robert was so quiet one would have thought hed taken a holy vow of silence whilst he was captive amabel and maude were being polite to each other but it was the kind of courtesy to set a mans teeth on edge and ranulf was brooding again he was usually good company cheerful and obliging but something was sitting heavy on his shoulders these days over and above his natural chagrin at maudes rout from winchester whatever it was though he was keeping it to himself rainald had made one attempt to find out what was festering only to have the lad snap at him like one of those blasted dyrehunds ranulf was staring intently into the fire and did not even notice when rainald leaned over and helped himself to his brothers drink it would be a shame to waste good wine he reasoned his gaze roamed the chamber flitting over his wife sitting meek and mute in the window seat before coming to rest on maude she and robert were hunched over a chessboard but neither of them seemed to have much interest in the game rainald felt pity stir and looked away hastily lest she read it in his face for he knew shed forgive him almost anything but pity he did feel sorry for her though damned if he did not he did not even blame her anymore for botching things so badly mayhap it was just not meant to be at least hed done better than most for hed gotten an earldom out of it all if he could hold on to it getting to his feet he reminded them that he was leaving for cornwall on the morrow and bade them goodnight remembering just in time to take beatrice with him amabel soon went off to bed too she was finding the atmosphere in the solar just as oppressive as rainald had ranulf was the next to make his escape claiming he had to let his dogs out and robert and maude were left alone with a flagging chess game and a silence heavy with all that lay unspoken between them maude pushed her chair back i cannot concentrate upon this game i am truly glad to have you safe robert but tonight i feel as ifas if wed struggled and panted and clawed our way up a mountain only to stumble just as we neared the summit and fall all the way down landing in a bloodied bruised heap at the bottom what in gods name do we do now i suppose he said we start climbing again how many of our men will have the heart for it rising she began to pace to come so close and then to have it all snatched away like thisit is so unfair robert so damnably unfair life is unfair he said sounding so stoical so rational and so dispassionate that she was suddenly angry a scalding seething impotent rage that spared no onenot herself not robert not god you think i do not know that when has life ever been fair to women just think upon how easy it was for stephen to steal my crown and how bitter and bloody has been my struggle to win it back even after wed caged stephen at bristol castle he was still a rival still a threatand why because he was so much braver or more clever or capable than me nobecause i was a woman for it always came back to that ill not deny that i made mistakes but you do not know what it is like robert to be judged so unfairly to be rejected not for what youve done but for what you are it is a poison that seeps into the soul that makes you half crazed with the need to prove yourself she stopped to catch her breath and only then did she see the look on roberts face one of disbelief and then utter and overwhelming fury burning as hot as her own anger hotter even for being so long suppressed i do not know what it is like he said incredulously i was our fathers firstborn son but was i his heir no i was just his bastard he trusted me and relied upon me and needed me but none of that mattered not even after the white ship sank and he lost his only lawfully begotten son he was so desperate to have an heir of his body that he dragged you backunwillingfrom germany forced you into a marriage that he knew was doomed and then risked rebellion by ramming you down the throats of his barons and all the while he had a son capable of ruling after himhe had me but i was the son born of his sin so i was not worthy to be king as if i could have blundered any worse than you or stephen maude was stunned she stared at him too stricken for words not knowing what to say even if shed been capable of speech robert seemed equally shattered by his outburst his face was suddenly ashen he started to speak then turned abruptly and walked out the night was bittercold and starless the sky choked with clouds maude leaned into the embrasure gazing down into the darkness of the bailey she knew her presence on the battlements was making the guards uneasy they kept their distance but she could feel their eyes following her curious probing wondering what she was doing up here alone at such an hour she wondered too it may have been memory that had drawn her up to the battlements shivering each time the wind caught her mantle she remembered watching a summer sunset from this very spot brien at her side not so long ago just a lifetime brien was back at wallingford castle now not far away twelve miles or so as if distance mattered as if what kept them apart could be measured in miles she did not often let herself think of brien of what might have been and what could never be but she did now deliberately and unsparingly she wiped away tears and thought of them all robert whod turned into a stranger before her eyes robert whom shed trusted and taken for granted and never really known ranulf whod lost the earldom shed promised and mayhap much more rainald whod profited too from her questa mad wife and a precarious hold upon a corner of cornwall geoffrey whom shed loathed from the very day of her wedding because it was easier to hate him than to hate her father and her sons growing up without her her sons whom shed not even seen in more than two years she lost all sense of time and when the sky began to pale it was with shock that she realized shed passed the entire night out on the battlements standing guard over the wreckage of her ravaged kingdom the cold seemed to have penetrated into her very bones yet for hours shed not even been aware of it she watched as the shadows receded and daylight slowly gained the ascendancy only then did she turn away from the battlements go to find her brother as early as it was robert was already up and dressed attended by a sleepy squire the bed curtains were closed amabel still slept but after one glimpse of roberts face maude was sure his night had been as wakeful as her own the squire soon remembered an urgent need to be elsewhere and muttering about bringing his lord cider and bread to break his fast he made a swift discreet exit maude was still trembling with the cold and she knotted her hands together to still their tremors when robert gestured toward the bed she nodded and kept her voice low no more wanting to awaken amabel than he did i am sorry robert i do not say that as often as i ought but never have i meant it more you have been my rod and my staff more loyal than i deserved you would have made a very good king his shoulders twitched in a halfshrug well better than stephen for certes he said with the faintest glimmer of a smile our father was a fool she said and he did not dispute her robert her mouth was suddenly dry i am never going to be queen am i no he said quietly you are not shed known what he would say but his uncompromising honest answer robbed her of any last shreds of hope she averted her face briefly and he too looked away not willing to watch the death of a dream id best go now ere amabel starts to stir she gave him a smile so pained that he winced maude she turned back to face him slowly and he said you are not giving up you know better than that robert i may have lost but ill not let henry lose too i shall fight for my son as long as i have breath in my body he must not be cheated of the crown that is his birthright she saw sympathy in his eyes and what mattered more respect i will do whatever i can he vowed to make sure that does not happen and in that moment she realized the truththat hed been fighting for henry all along devizes england march the countess of chester arrived the day after her aunt and father held an urgent council at devizes castle maud needed to take but one meal in their company to conclude that something was amiss for her senses were finely attuned to emotional undercurrents as soon as she could she lured her mother away and after some bantering about the tedium of the lenten menu she demanded to know why aunt maude and papa and the others look like mourners at a particularly dreary wake amabel settled herself in the window seat they have cause child for they have had to swallow their pride and that goes down much harder than salted fish they have decided to send envoys to maudes husband asking geoffrey to aid them in overthrowing stephen mauds eyes widened were they sober at the time i cannot believe theyd turn to geoffrey well they did which proves i suppose just how desperate they are maud was still incredulous i would have sworn upon my very soul that aunt maude would never have agreed no matter how great her need for herself i daresay she would not but there is very little she would not do for her son maud sat down abruptly suddenly realizing the full magnitude of what her aunt had lost at winchester it is not fair mama she ought to have been queen most people thought otherwise amabels tone had an edge sharp enough to slice bread or so maud thought she was sorry that her mother and her aunt were so often at odds for they were the two women who mattered most to her but she was insightful enough to understand why it was so and pragmatic enough to accept it diplomatically steering the conversation away from hidden family reefs she said i understand now why uncle ranulf was in such a black mood he trusts geoffrey even less than he likes him and he once told me that if he was given a choice between befriending geoffrey and trying to tame a polecat hed take the polecat every time do you remember that bristol goldsmiths son maudthe wretch who was caught setting all those fires when he was asked why he said he just liked to watch things burn well geoffrey likes to set tempers afire and he does it right well but ranulfs black mood cannot be blamed on geoffreys coming for he has been troubled for some weeks now even robert commented upon it and men are usually blind to any wound that does not bleed mauds curiosity was piqued she was quite fond of ranulf no less fond of intrigue and later that afternoon she set herself a dual taskto ferret out ranulfs secret and to console him if she could she was halfway up the stairs to ranulfs chamber when she bumpedquite literallyinto her uncles young squire luke recoiled stammering incoherent apologies for his natural shyness became almost paralyzing in the presence of selfassured flirtatious young women like maud eventually though he managed to suggest that this would not be a good time to seek out lord ranulf has he a woman with him she asked and when he blushed at her bluntness but shook his head she gave him a bewitching smile and continued on up the stairs in his haste to escape luke had left the door ajar she was about to knock when she heard the voices as angry as they were audible i swear by the rood ranulf that youve gone utterly daft lets suppose you are able to evade bandits and the kings men and get safely to shrewsbury what then how are you going to contact annora hope she comes into town ere the year is out or do you just intend to ride out to her husbands manor and ask him if you can borrow his wife for a bit damn you gilbert this is none of your concern someone has to keep you from dying so young and so needlessly ive had enough of your meddling ranulf jerked the door open only to find himself nose to nose with his niece maud what are you doing out there i should think it would be obvious i was eavesdropping of course she stepped forward into the room and winked at gilbert my turn to talk some sense into him good luck he muttered giving the door a satisfying slam on his way out i want no lecture maud ranulf warned but his rudeness fazed her not at all perching on the edge of the bed she arranged her skirts decorously and then smiled sweetly sermons are for church id much rather talk about your tryst withannora was it the girl to whom you were once plight trothed such fidelity is rare indeed in our world and must be rewarded first of all i need to know what she is like my husbandand most men if truth be toldseem far more interested in what is between a womans legs than between her ears but maud since when are you offended by plain speaking just tell me if this lass of yours has a brain in her head does she have the wits to read between the lines of my letter what letter the one i plan to write to her husband telling him how much i miss my dear friend annora and how i yearn to have her visit me is she clever enough to need no further prompting yes ranulf said slowly she is but what of your husband maud ahso annoras husband supports stephen then that should pose no problem though for randolph is taking no part in the war these days his creed at the moment seems to be may the pox take stephen and the plague take maude he may be no friend to stephen but he is still the most powerful lord in the realm annoras husband will be greatly flattered that the countess of chester is so fond of his wife and when i suggest that i send an armed escort to bring annora safe to chester castle for a visit hell snap at the offer like a starving trout nothing is so alluring she added playfully as a crown of some sort you make a most convincing argument ranulf conceded but when i asked about your husband i was not thinking of his political affinities i was wondering how hed react upon learning that yours was the guiding hand behind ourtryst did you call it she waved away his objection with a graceful airy gesture of dismissal what makes you think hed even be there as soon as he heard that stephen had gone north to forbid a tournament at york he became more nervous than a treed cat fearing that stephen might try to reclaim lincoln castle whilst he was in the neighborhood he and his brother have been holed up at lincoln since the beginning of lent making sure the castle could withstand an assault but even if he were at chester hed be no hindrance to us randolph brings great passion to what interests him utter indifference to what does not hed never even notice your dalliancenot unless you were indiscreet enough to make love in the great hall ranulf sat down beside her on the bed it means more than i can say that you do not pass judgment upon us that you have offered to help but if i let you do it wed be ensnaring you in our sin maud laughed i assure you that ill have so many sins of my own to answer for come judgment day that any secondary sins will count for very little he shook his head laughing too in spite of himself and said again that he could not accept her help maud merely smiled knowing that he would annora supposed she should have been nervous as the distant walls of chester came into view she was after all answering a mysterious summons from an utter stranger and intending to commit adultery if she was right about the real reason for the countess of chesters sudden avowal of friendship but she was not nervous at all so sure was she that she would find ranulf waiting for her in chester people stopped to watch as she rode through the hamlet of handbridge recognizing the earl of chesters badge upon the sleeves of her escort impressed and curious annora liked the attention and she smiled graciously when they stared and pointed playing the great lady with zesteleanor queen of france and duchess of aquitaine on her way to a rendezvous with a royal lover crossing the wooden bridge that spanned the river dee annora entered the city through bridge gate and rode into the castle bailey the countess of chester was awaiting her on the steps of the great hall coming forward to greet her as annora was assisted from her mare annora recognized maud at once so strongly did she resemble her aunt the empress she hastily dropped a respectful curtsy and was then enveloped in an affectionate perfumed embrace dearest annora how good of you to come maud was enjoying herself enormously linking her arm in annoras she led the other young woman across the bailey giving such a flawless performance that none would ever have doubted shed just been reunited with a cherished childhood friend i see you brought no maid she observed adding a soft approving clever lass before assuring annora that her own maid would be pleased to be of service i may have forgotten to mention in my last letter that a dear kinsman of mine might be visiting i am sure you will remember him she said blandly but annora was no longer listening at that moment there was no one in her field of visionor her worldbut ranulf just emerging from the great hall out into the daylight blond hair gleaming in the sun dark eyes shining with excitement triumph and such tenderness that annoras own eyes misted and she moved to meet him with a light step and a secret smile making sure they were unobserved ranulf and annora ducked into the stairwell they had discovered by trial and error that the one place where they could be ensured privacy during the daylight hours was in mauds bedchamber as soon as they were inside ranulf slid the doors bolt into place an act that never failed to give him pleasure for it washowever brieflya means of shutting out the world annora wrapped her arms around his neck tilting her face up until her mouth was temptingly close to his own it was not an invitation he could resist between kisses they backed toward the bed where ranulf pulled her onto his lap turning her head so he could kiss her throat she sighed how could a week go by so quickly ranulf i said id be away just a fortnight so our time together is already half over this time he corrected there will be other visits sweetheart and we can write to each other for maud has offered to pass on your letters that well nigh drove me mad not being able to contact you but with maud on our side it will be much easier for us from now on but how long must we wait ranulf i know you say well be together eventually and i know too that youd not lie to me yet i cannot help wondering if youre not lying to yourself maude had her chance and botched it in this life how many people get a second chance we already have he reminded her when we found each other again at shrewsburys fair and maude will have another chance too i told you that geoffrey will be crossing the channel bringing us enough men to keep stephen on the defensive until he can be defeated once that happens you and i can share our lives as it was meant to be you must believe that annora you must not lose hope you have enough hope for both of us annora gibed but she was smiling whatever do i see in you no one else can make me as angry as you do you are impulsive and impractical and so stubborn that ranulf stopped her words effectively and pleasurably when annora got her breath back she gave a low shaken laugh you ought not to have interrupted me for i was going to admit that i am utterly besotted with you for better or worse are you prove it ranulf challenged and she set about convincing him with such success that he was soon unfastening the lacings of her gown she was reaching up to unbraid her hair knowing how he loved it loose and freeflowing when they were jarred by a sudden sharp knocking on the door sitting up they hastily adjusted their clothing waiting to see if the knocking would stop it did not ranulf it is memaud let me in as soon as ranulf unbarred the door maud swept into the chamber she never just entered a room she made an entrance this one was more dramatic than usual for her face was flushed and her dark eyes were flashing men she exclaimed are the most vexing creatures in christendomnever around when you want them always underfoot when you do not my husband who is supposed to be at lincoln has ridden into the bailey ranulf and annoras instinctive alarm passed as soon as they saw that maud was irritated not fearful they hurriedly smoothed the rumpled bedcovers were making a final check for incriminating evidence when they heard chesters voice blaring in the stairwell loud enough to rival any hunting horn maud where the devil are you like his wife chester never simply entered a room instead hurling himself across the threshold as if he were about to launch an assault but he was not in a rage quite the contrary taking hold of mauds hands he grinned down at her cheerfully glad to have me home girl not waiting for her response he kissed her exuberantly bending her backward in a passionate embrace one that seemed likely to lead straight to their bedhad he not caught movement from the corner of his eye and realized they were not alone who are you he asked staring at annora in surprise hed yet to notice ranulf this is annora fitz clement randolph one of my oldest friends i am sure you must remember how often ive talked about her in the past of course i remember chester insisted his eyes flickering over annora without any real interest i trust you are enjoying your visit with maud he added politely if unenthusiastically and then swung around as ranulf stepped forward they knew no reason why chester should look so startled at sight of ranulf for he was mauds favorite uncle but it was quite clear to them all that chester did not expect to find ranulf here why are you not with maude now of all times he demanded it is an incredible stroke of luck for certes but she must act swiftly if she is to take full advantage ofwhy are you looking at me so oddly unlessyou do not know do you youve not yet heard about stephen i heard he went north ranulf said warily what else should i know chester shook his head impatiently stephen left york after easter hed gotten as far as northampton when he was stricken with a fever the kind that burns hotter than any fire that consumes a man like kindling chester saw ranulfs shock and he smiled grimly with infinite satisfaction he is said to be dying stephen had never been trapped in a nightmare like this one for it would not end somehow he knew it was a dream and he kept trying to wake up but it was as if he were caught in a riptide being dragged farther and farther from shore and safety he would not give up though and struggled on toward the light when he finally broke free he found himself in a strangers bed in an unfamiliar bedchamber even his body seemed to belong to someone else for the coverlets were weighing him down like lead and his lungs wheezed and heaved as if he were starved for air he wanted to say that he was thirsty the words stuck in his throat when he tried again they emerged as the thinnest and weakest of whispers stephen thank god allmerciful henryhenry come quickly this voice was a womans the face bending over him was pale and tearmarked my love do you know me matilda pleaded and when he mouthed her name she fumbled in the blankets for his hand youve been so ill she said almost inaudibly the doctors despaired do youremember i think so his lips were chapped and raw blistered by fever you kept calling to me he said hazily i followed the sound and then his brother was there shouldering matilda aside in his urgency stephen listen to me youve not been shriven for youve been out of your senses with the fever you must make your confession to me now so you can go to god cleansed of your sins am i dying matilda made an involuntary movement quickly checked but the bishop did not flinch i hope not he said i truly hope not but we cannot put your immortal soul at risk for we are all in gods hands and i would not be so presumptuous as to promise you what only he can decree i agree stephens voice was slurred and scratchy and when matilda put a cup to his lips he drank gratefully greedily i want to be shriven but not by you henry he looked up at his brother the corner of his mouth curving as he added you already knowtoo many of my guilty secrets the bishop was not amused very well he said stiffly if that is your wish i shall fetch your confessor straightaway matilda saw that halfsmile of stephens through a blur of tears for she was suddenly hearing her own words so often directed at her lighthearted husband in gentle bemused reproach that hed be jesting verily upon his deathbed tilda stephen cut his eyes toward the cup she still held and she helped him to drink again thank you he said and then softly do not be afraid i am not going to die she swallowed you promise yes he said and squeezed her hand before giving her another ghostly shadow of a smile it would give you too much pain and my enemies too much pleasure maudes shrinking circle of partisans had been summoned back to devizes castle on a wet warm day in midjune as they gathered in the great hall waiting for the council to begin there were gaps in their ranks missing faces the scots king had elected to remain on his own side of the border rainald was still in cornwall trying to save his imperiled earldom more dubious allies like hugh bigod and geoffrey de mandevilles brotherinlaw the earl of oxford were keeping their distance but miles fitz walter was there so were baldwin de redvers and the exiled lord of shrewsbury william fitz alan from wallingford had come brien fitz count and from marlborough john marshal the worst of his wounds hidden behind a rakish eye patch as they waited for maude and robert to join them they swapped stories about the dangers of the road these days roving bands of outlaws were springing up like dragons teeth for there was no more fertile soil for banditry than a realm in the throes of civil war and anarchy they then shared the latest rumors about stephens health by now they knew the worstthat those early reports of his death had been regrettably premature while hed been laid up at northampton for the entire month of may word filtering south was that he was expected to recover they indulged in some grim gallows humor at stephens expense but their jests were labored for stephens death would have won them a kingdom few in this warbattered and bleeding land would have had the stomach to continue the struggle on behalf of stephens young son eustace and so they cursed stephens luck and sheer stamina and cursed too the doctors whod tended to him and the priests whod prayed for him but by common consent they did not discuss the reason for their presence at devizes on this trinity sundayto hear geoffreys answer it had taken three months for maudes envoys to bring back her husbands response and they did not think that boded well for their cause when robert and maude entered with ranulf following a step behind their faces were somber enough to confirm the worst miles was the one to put it into words saying with a soldiers bluntness geoffrey balked at coming did he not to their surprise maude shook her head no he did not refuse she said but then added reluctantly outright he says he is loath to break off his campaign in normandy for he has met with considerable success he is willing though to consider it if we can convince him that his presence in england could truly mark a turning point in our war to overthrow stephen but he says the only opinion he can trust is roberts and so he insists that robert come back to normandy to discuss it in person a long and dangerous trip robert said morosely and most likely a futile one geoffrey does not want my counsel he wants my help in his war too many normans view angevins as spawns of the devil with me riding at his side some of them might be more willing to accept his lordship i do not doubt that hell be lavish with his promises but i do doubt that well ever see him set foot on english soil it was unlike robert to be so imprudent speaking out so harshly in public about a man they needed to win over was impolitic at best there could be no more convincing proof of roberts discontent than this uncharacteristic outburst and the men exchanged disappointed glances seeing yet another opportunity slipping away from them once again it was miles who gave voice to their misgivings i daresay you are right robert to suspect the mans good faith but a reedthin chance is still better than none and if you do not even try to persuade him well never know if you might have prevailed or not i urge you to think again ere you refuse there is no need for that maude said sounding very tired robert has agreed to go yes robert said tersely making no effort to hide his frustration geoffrey has left me no choice soi will sail for normandy and i will do my utmost to gain his support but i expectnay demandsomething from all of you in return whilst i am gone i want your sworn oaths that you will see to the safety of my sister let her come to no harm they responded without hesitation promising to protect maude in roberts absence maude said nothing but hot blood scalded her face and throat ranulf noticed understood and sympathized for he knew how she hated any reminder of her special vulnerability as a woman he was impressed now by her restraint for it was not so long ago that she would have rebuked robert sharply for shaming her by his unwanted solicitude however well meant but she was not the same woman whod blundered so badly that shed gotten herself chased out of her own capital city she had learned from her mistakes it seemed bitterly unfair to ranulf that she had learned too late they could not give up though it might be too late for maude but not for her young son they must do whatever it would take to claim the english crown for henryeven if that meant doing the bidding of maudes hated angevin husband matilda was very glad to be back in london more and more it seemed a haven from the troubles besetting the rest of her husbands realm on this morning in early july she was performing one of her more pleasurable duties as queen bestowing largesse upon the neediest of her subjects her servants loaded a cart with jars of honey sacks of flour baskets of eggs loaves of bread woolen blankets even a few toyswhipping tops and balls matilda then mounted her favorite white mule and she and cecily and her escort set out to deliver her bounty to londons two hospitals st giles in the fields was a leper hospital just outside the city walls founded by a queen maudes mother matilda felt great pity for those poor souls afflicted with such a fearful malady although she found it exceedingly difficult to look upon their dreadful deformities but she forced herself to smile and show none of her revulsion when they came forward to thank her and afterward she confided to cecily her awed admiration for maudes mother who had kissed lepers and washed their ulcerated sores with her own hands to demonstrate they were still beloved by god cecily agreed that such a woman well deserved to be known as good queen maude although she could not help adding mischievously that it explained much about the empress maude child of such a disparate matinga notorious lecher and an earthly saint matilda laughed commenting that stephens parents were surely an oddly matched pair too but then her smile faded for she found herself thinking of yet another incompatible coupleher brash young son eustace and constance his timid french bride from st giles matilda continued on to the hospital of st bartholomew situated next to the augustinian priory of the same name in west smithfield st bartholomew took in the needy and orphans as well as the sick and it was for the orphans that matilda had brought tops and balls her own children had puppets and wooden swords and dolls and whistles but toys were a luxury and she knew the skinny solemn youngsters at st barts were unlikely to have had any but makeshift playthingsscraps of rope and stones and hollow reeds she was warmly welcomed by the hospitals master and nuns but the memory she took away with her was of the shrieks and laughter of boys playing with their first real ball a pigs bladder filled with dried beans they reentered the city through cripplegate headed back toward the tower matildas progress was a slow one for people flocked to her as she passed by seeking to find out if the king was fully recovered from his nearfatal fever if the questions directed at her were occasionally intrusive or overly familiar matilda did not object had the londoners not been so forthright and cocky they never would have dared to defy maude and so she waved and smiled and assured them that the king was on the mend of good cheer and eager to take up the reins of kingship again just how eager stephen was she was soon to discover upon her arrival at the tower she hastened up to the royal apartments on the top floor of the soaring whitewashed keep there she found her husband sitting around a table with his brother and william de ypres and william martel his steward they had a large map spread out before them but that was not what caught matildas attention it was the charged atmosphere one of barely suppressed excitement you look she said like foxes whove just found a way into the hen roost what has happened that i do not yet know about there was a time when she would never have spoken up so boldly but now she did not even hesitate taking it for granted that she had earned the right to share in their decision making and of the men only the bishop thought her candid curiosity was unseemly but even he held his tongue tacitly acknowledging that matilda would not be retreating back into the shadows for better or worse he conceded hers had become a voice to be heeded we have gotten some very interesting news tilda stephen leaned back in his chair smiling at her maudes brother has gone to normandy to meet with geoffrey robert sailed for barfleur a week ago leaving the hen roost unguarded william de ypres said happily i never thought id owe geoffrey of anjou such a debt of gratitude matildas first reaction was unease stephen might be ready for the rigors and risks of an active campaign but she was not her memories of his northampton illness were still too raw but she did not confess her qualms for fear was a wifes burden to be borne alone what are you planning she asked and stephen beckoned her toward the map robert sailed from therefrom warehamputting his firstborn in command but the son is not the man his father is and he promptly went back to the greater comforts of bristol leaving the castle poorly garrisoned if we capture it we can deny robert a safe port for his return where is maude nowstill at devizes no she is back at oxford castle with miles fitz walter baldwin de redvers and ranulf amongst others keeping a close watch upon her robert seems to have been so worried about her safety that id almost think he had second sight matilda did not share stephens smile that does not sound like an unguarded hen roost to me nonot yet maude is well served at the moment that is why i do not plan to besiege oxford after we capture wareham no there is our next target he said cirencester for however devoted maudes men are to her theyre not likely to stay cooped up at oxford if their own lands in the west are threatened my raid on cirencester will draw them away from oxford and then stephen said with a grim resolve hed not often shown we take maude captive and end this accursed war once and for all oxford england september oxford like winchester had two royal residences the eleventhcentury castle by the river and the kings house just north of the city walls the latter was the more comfortable of the two but maude always chose to stay at the castle for its castellan robert doilly was a loyal supporter and kin by marriage his stepson being one of maudes numerous halfbrothers even by english standards it had been an unusually wet summer and autumn but this th day of september dawned dry and clear and mild ranulf was standing on the steps of the great hall savoring the sun as men passed in and out of the bailey more riders were coming in a dozen or morenot an uncommon sight these days for only foolhardy or desperate travelers braved the roads alone as they dismounted ranulf started forward catching a glimpse of a familiar figure at sound of his name bennet de malpas turned around his dark face lighting up with a grin of ready recognition ranulf was not surprised that bennet should be so well mounted and armed for he was one of the earl of chesters household knights the man entrusted by chester with that urgent appeal for maudes help he and ranulf had struck up a casual friendship on their wretched winter march to lincoln and renewed acquaintance this past april at chester castle he seemed genuinely pleased to see ranulf now although he was deliberately vague about his current task saying only that hed been to coventry at the earls behest ranulf would have loved to learn more about bennets mysterious mission for the earl for he was morbidly curious about chesters doings hed never been able to resist turning over rocks even if he knew hed not like what lurked beneath them but bennet would not be revealing any of the earls secrets although chester might not practice what he preached he demanded complete discretion and utter loyalty from those who served him ranulf could only hope that chester was not casting his nets wide enough to entangle maude and he said cautiously what brings you to oxford bennet i am performing a double duty first off to coventry for the earl and then on to oxford for his countess lady maud entrusted me with a letter for the empress i also have one for you he said turning aside to root in his saddle bag ranulf took his letter with a nonchalance he was far from feeling for he was sure maud had included a letter from annora along with her own after an unobtrusive check to assure himself that mauds wax seal had not been tampered with he tucked the letter inside his tunic and summoned up a distracted smile i missed that you were sayingwhat is it true that the earls of hereford and devon are no longer with the empress ranulfs mouth tightened chester must have more spies than a dog had fleas the mere mention of the earls defection was enough to stir up his anger again for miles and baldwin had promised robert that they would put maudes safety before all other considerations but he was not about to unburden himself to a man whod carry his complaints straight back to the earl of chester they were naturally disquieted when word reached us of stephens raid upon cirencester he said striving to sound offhand untroubled but they will be returning to oxford once they are sure that their own lands are not in peril i am glad to hear that and so will my lady she was concerned lest her aunt be put at risk by their departure nowid best seek out the castellan as i mean to ask his hospitality for my men and myself i ought not to be tardy in paying my respects i am afraid you are too late bennet sir robert was taken ill last month and he was not as lucky as stephen he died a fortnight ago bennet had watched too many men die for death to take him by surprise nor did he see any point in mourning a man hed never met i am sorry he murmured with perfunctory politeness mayhap i ought to look for lodgings in the town then indeed not there is more than enough room come on ill take you to my brother the word brother never failed to echo oddly in ranulfs ears whenever he applied it to rob doilly for it seemed such an intimate way to refer to a stranger they were not actual strangers of course more like acquaintances who happened to share the same blood ranulf sometimes wondered how many other halfbrothers of his might be scattered throughout england and normandy sons not even his father had known hed sired any man who could claim more than twenty bastards was bound to have missed a few leading bennet into the hall ranulf watched the other man from the corner of his eye anticipating bennets surprise when he first saw rob doilly in truth robs appearance could still unsettle him too so uncanny was his resemblance to their father the same stocky build the same inkblack hair and deepset eyes rob did not have the old kings commanding presence though he wasranulf had discoveredjust what he seemed to be an affable wellmeaning man of wealth and privilege and modest ambitions of whom the worst that could be said was that he was obstinate at times and too impulsive his vices like his virtues were inhibited by his lack of imagination bennet did a comical doubletake upon being introduced to rob for no one whod ever met the old king would have forgotten him recovering his aplomb he was expressing his condolences for the loss of robs stepfather when he was interrupted by a sudden shout loud enough and urgent enough to turn all heads toward the sound when it came again ranulf and rob both moved swiftly across the hall with a curious bennet on their heels a rider had just reined in his mount in the crowded bailey as the man flung himself from the saddle and ran toward them ranulf watched with foreboding for hugh de plucknet was well known to him a quicktempered but intensely loyal breton one of maudes most trusted household knights hugh had departed at first light for wallingford castle bearing maudes letter to brien fitz count so why was he back so soon what had caused him to abandon his mission for maude and return to oxford in such haste ranulf was already sure he was not going to like hughs answer the king is leading an army up the abingdon road heading straight for oxford rob gasped then began to assail hugh with questions was he sure it was stephen where had he seen them could he have been mistaken how many were there ranulf paid no heed for he knew the interrogation was a waste of time hugh was not a man to conjure up phantom foes but what now would maude be better off slipping out of the city whilst there was still time but where could she go wallingford lay to the south if she tried to reach briens castle shed be riding right into stephens army no shed be safer staying in oxford the town was well protected by two rivers the cherwell on the east and on the south and west the great river known as isis in oxford as the thames elsewhere the citys walls were of stone its defenses augmented by a deep outer ditch and the castle itself presented a formidable challenge hed almost convinced himself that they could easily withstand a siege when bennet pulled him aside thrust the countess of chesters letter into his hand and asked him to see that the empress got it ranulf stared at him in amazement unwilling to believe that bennet truly intended to ride off indifferent to maudes danger but bennet was beckoning to his waiting men telling them to mount up what are you doing jesu bennet we will need every man we can get to stave off stephens attack bennet shrugged i wish the empress well but i am not about to risk my life for her ranulf this is not my fight and with that he signaled again to his men put spurs to his stallion and cantered across the bailey toward the drawbridge leaving ranulf with an unenviable tasktelling maude that stephen would soon be at the city gates maude was keeping vigil upon the roofed ramparts of the castle keep south of the city where the river cherwell flowed into the thames the late robert doillys uncle had built a raised clay causeway known to locals as grandpont ranulf and rob had aligned their men to block this causeway for the rivers themselves were impassable swollen with the runoff from the heavy rains theyd spilled over their banks flooding the adjacent meadows the september sunlight was dazzling but still not able to lighten the swirling depths of the water a dark greygreen like the moss on cemetery tombstones there were sporadic flashes of brightness as the sun reflected off the swords and chainlink hauberks of the soldiers arrows were being intermittently launched across the river to the accompaniment of taunts and jeers some of the citizens had come out to join in this dangerous sport daring the enemy to attack their more prudent brethren were patrolling the city walls making ready to repel the invaders should they somehow manage to surmount the fastflowing barrier of the thames there were some whod escaped like bennet de malpas and his men out of the citys north gate but most were not willing to abandon their homes to abandon hope facing down a kings wrath and a large hostile army oxford remained defiant maude was attended by several of her household knights by adam of ely her clerk and william marshal a bluntspoken priest who shared some of the steely qualities of his betterknown brother john maude had been impressed enough with wills abilities to have named him as her chancellor but at this particularly precarious moment he was the wrong brother it was john marshal whom she needed arrogant and pitiless and scarred and miles away like all the others who had taken stephens bait just before noon ranulf returned to the castle while the kitchen cooks hastily prepared a meal that he could eat quickly he joined maude up on the keep battlements rob was sure he reported that stephens men would not be able to cross the grandpont their bowmen were likely to prove almost as formidable as the river the city gates were under guard and the townspeople seemed determined to resist not cowed or disheartened you sound confident maude said when he was done speaking but your words are at variance with what i see in your face do not keep your qualms from me ranulf we owe each other better than that he gave her a quick tense smile one that acknowledged the validity of her complaint and then he told her the truth why hed really come back to the castlenot for roast chicken and ale but for the superior view from the keep roof i do not understand what are you looking to find a missing king stephen has been able to bring together a redoubtable force most of his barons and vassals seem to have answered his summons i saw william de warenne and geoffrey de mandeville and the earls of northampton and pembroke amongst others even his brother the bishop is across the river doing gods work with a mace these days but i looked in vain for stephen and that troubles me more than i can say just where is he maude downriver from the grandpont stephen stared across at the surging windchurned current after several moments he stooped and pitched a stone out into the water watching as it splashed and sank this is the secret ford he asked skeptically it looks to me like a crossing fit only for fish the man at his side nodded vigorously stubbornly the river can be forded here my liege he insisted i swear it upon the tears of the blessed mother mary it is just deeper than usual because of the rains stephen looked at the mans earnest face then back at the river this is probably not one of my more rational decisions he said at last but i say we risk it william de ypres shrugged why not it is as good a day to drown as any i suppose if robert fitz roy could cross the fossedyke at flood tide in the dead of winter then we ought to be able to survive a september dunking in the thames besides stephen smiled suddenly if the almighty meant for me to drown hed have let me sail on the white ship even god can change his mind ypres pointed out but he was already gesturing to one of their scouts tell my lord earl of northampton and the others that we are going to cross at the ford have them stand ready to move onto the grandpont mounting his stallion stephen glanced at his waiting men handpicked by ypres and eager to reap the bounty that victory would bring now he said and plunged into the river their guide had not lied there was indeed a ford there but it was not for the faint of heart the current was strong and the water level dangerously deep for such a crossing splashing toward the shore swimming at times stephens stallion scrambled up onto the bank and the others soon followed only one man had been swept from his saddle and hed managed to grasp his horses tail holding fast until he could regain his footing in the shallows stephen looked them over his eyes moving from face to face shadowed by their conical helmets satisfied by what he found he unsheathed his sword a gold ring he promised to the first man into the city they were soon spotted by sentries up on the city walls who hurried to sound the alarm but by then it was too late rob doillys men were not expecting a flank attack on their own side of the river they recoiled in confusion and as rob and his captains frantically tried to regroup the main body of stephens army came charging across the causeway and into the fray assailed from two sides the defenders broke rank and sought to retreat back into the town but when the guards up on the walls opened the south gate to admit them stephens soldiers surged in too and the battle for oxford was suddenly being fought in the streets of the city from the keep battlements ranulf and hugh de plucknet and the others had watched helplessly as stephen and ypres bore down upon oxfords defenders racing to aid their beleaguered comrades they were halfway down pennyfarthing street when the first fugitives from the battle fled into the town warned by the noise ahead ranulf slowed his stallion the men with him reined in their mounts too just as the wind brought to them one of the most dreaded of all cries fire as soon as they saw the smoke swirling up from the direction of southgate street ranulf and hugh looked at each other in appalled understanding christ they are in the city swinging their mounts about they galloped back to the castle there was no need for words they all knew what must be done if they hoped to survive stephens assault fortunately maude had anticipated disaster and servants were already heating water in huge cauldrons once it reached the boiling point they carried it up onto the wallwalk on either side of the gatehouse knowing theyd have no margin for error and but one chance oxford was in chaos the citizens had no training in the skills of war and many of them panicked now fleeing from stephens pursuing soldiers instead of defending themselves stephens men were throwing torches into shops and onto roofs and people were soon stumbling out of their barred and shuttered houses coughing and choking some tried to take refuge in st frideswides priory clambering over the monastery walls when the monks refused to open their gate knights on warhorses rampaged through the streets and a few unlucky souls were trampled when they fell under the plunging hooves there was some resistance offered and the fighting was bloodiest in great bailey street where rob doilly and his knights were attempting an ordered retreat back to the castle once they were within sight of its walls the drawbridge was lowered and they sprinted desperately for safety when the enemy followed seeking to rush the castle gates as they had the towns gate the men up on the walls poured scalding water down into their midst there were terrible screams most scattered and several rolled on the ground in agony before the attackers could try again the castle defenders raised the drawbridge rarely had a city been captured with such ease stephen could afford to be magnanimous and sent some of his men to help put out the fires they had set thus sparing oxford the massive fiery destruction that had devastated winchester but when a town was taken by storm it was turned over to the victorious army for their sport knowing what to expect some of oxfords women had fled hiding themselves in the woods or seeking refuge in the nearby nunnery at godstow and the priory at osney oxfords shops were located mainly in northgate street and high street and these neighborhoods were pillaged first private homes could be plundered too and often were for crimes were not crimes if committed in war the townsmen concealed their valuables as best they could feared for their wives and daughters and prayed for oxford not all the citizens were so distraught of course some were relieved for the suffering of those trapped in a besieged city could be terrible now at least they need not fear starvation and the alehouses and brothels in gropecunt lane would thrive under the occupation they were in the minority though and most of oxford passed a nervous wakeful night the quiet broken by the brawling of celebrating soldiers by laughter and cheerful cursing and occasionally a womans screams in the morning the city reeve the prior of st frideswides and several members of the merchants guild made their way to the kings encampment and pleaded for an audience with stephen when they finally returned they brought comforting news for their anxiously waiting colleagues the king had assured them that he held no ill will for the citizens of oxford and as long as they cooperated fully with his army theyd not be harmed all he wanted was the castle and the woman trapped within maude stood at the open window in the upper chamber of the castle keep looking out at her cousins army it was three years almost to the day since shed gazed out upon a similar scene at arundel castle but there were deadly differences between that siege and this one robert would have been able then to come to her rescue now he was in normandy and unaware of her peril nor was stephen going to set her free send her safely on her way in another act of mad gallantry oxford was not arundel this time there would be no reprieve cerences normandy november winter came early that year to normandy upon his arrival at cerences the latest norman stronghold to yield to his father henry was delighted to find a dusting of snow upon the ground hed spent several hours collecting enough to build a snow fort and two days later it remained intact out in the bailey not yet melted although a blazing fire burned in the open hearth the great hall still held a chill henry had a wax tablet propped up on his knees and a bone stylus clutched in his fingers he was supposed to be practicing his declensions of latin nouns and adjectives for hed promised that his brief visits to his fathers sieges would not disrupt his studies but hed gotten no further than amicus magnus and amici magni he knew what came nextamico magnobut instead he scratched bastebourg into the wax followed by trevieres villiersbocage briquessard aunaysurodon plessisgrimoult vire tinchebray teilleul st hilaire mortain and pontorson he had just space enough to add cerences hed not made a conscious effort to memorize his fathers conquests but hed followed the campaign so closely that he now knew the names of the captured castles as well as he did the names of the servants who tended to him back in angers they were getting easier these victories cerences had surrendered at once glancing across the hall henry studied his father and uncle as he should have been studying his latin he knew about their quarreling all of normandy knew one more castle it was always one more castle they would triumph and then they would argue and his father would make robert more promises promises few thought he had any intention of keeping henry did not understand the rules about lying his tutor said that lying was a grievous sin but his father often joked that life without sinning was like food without salt pure but tasteless as far as henry could figure some lies were harmless some were necessary and some were unforgivable but what if people could not agree which was which men kept coming into the hall seeking shelter from the frigid november wind some of them henry knew from past visits to siege sites fulk and hugh de cleers were rarely far from his fathers side but his uncle helie was usually as far away from geoffrey as he could get men jested grimly that they could teach cain and abel about brotherly rivalry tonight helie was dicing with henrys cousin philip philips family ties were tattered too these days henry hoped his father would never look at him the way hed caught robert looking at philip with disappointment too deep for words henry did not like philip he was moody and sarcastic and insisted upon calling henry nine and eight after hearing henry explain that he was nine years and eight months old henry didnt mind being teasedhis father teased him all the timebut he did mind being mocked to his thinking those eight months mattered he did like the man watching the dice game one of his uncles knights hed been put off at first by gilbert fitz johns odd appearance for he had but one eyebrow and no eyelashes but gilbert never failed to smile at sight of henry hed patiently answered henrys questions about the fire at wherwell nunnery and henry no longer even noticed his scars geoffrey was usually the focal point of all eyes that was a role he relished tonight he was sharing center stage with a new arrival a man unfamiliar to henry a tall fairhaired lord with a loud laugh and a tendency to run roughshod over any conversation but his own men seemed willing to listen to waleran beaumont though for hed just come from paris and was well informed about the great scandal sweeping the french court henry already knew about the scandal for theyd been gossiping about little else back in anjou the queen of frances younger sister petronilla had fallen in love with the count of vermandois count raoul de peronne was the french kings cousin and his seneschal he was fifty to her nineteen an age that seemed vast indeed to henry but it was not the age difference that troubled people it was not so uncommon for men to take much younger wives the problem was that raoul already had a wife petronilla would have him though wife or no and shed gotten her sister the queen on her side eleanor in turn had won over her husband and to please her king louis set about finding a way to get rid of raouls unwanted wife the bishop of noyon who happened to be raouls brother declared himself willing to dissolve the marriage on the grounds of consanguinity and louis found two other compliant bishops to go along with him the marriage was invalidated the countess and her children packed off to her uncle and petronilla and raoul married before the ink was dry upon his annulment decree unfortunately for the newly wedded pair raouls repudiated wife was not without allies of her own her uncle was none other than count theobald of blois and champagne stephens brother and long a thorn in the french kings side theobald had promptly appealed to the pope and the verdict was now in according to waleran beaumont the papal legate had reaffirmed the validity of raouls marriage excommunicated the guilty lovers until raoul agreed to take back his lawful wife and suspended the three bishops whod been so overly eager to please their king the news created a sensation for it was sure to have dramatic repercussions yet none doubted the accuracy of walerans account for he was kin to the lovestricken count raoul de peronne was his uncle and when he added that the french king was so enraged by theobalds meddling that he was swearing upon christs cross to take a bloody vengeance upon the counts lands in champagne and blois none doubted that either for it would not be the first time louis had gone to war on his wifes behalf just a year ago louis had led an assault upon toulouse which eleanor claimed through her grandmother the claim was questionable and the campaign so ill planned and poorly executed that it soon resulted in louiss ignominious retreat back to paris nursing a nasty wound to his pride it was clear to henry that these men held the french king in no high esteem and he tucked his newfound fact away for future reference that a man ought not to love his wife overly well for if he did other men would laugh at him the rules about men and women were just as confusing as the code about lying wives were supposed to obey their husbands but not all of them did not his mother for certes but the french queen not only did as she pleased she got her husband to do what she wanted too that was a trick his mother had never learned papa begrudged her so much as a smile henry wondered why the french king was so eager to do his wifes bidding and he found himself suddenly curious about eleanor this woman who seemed to play by her own rules and get away with it once he was old enough that was what he meant to do too the men were still joking about the scandal but the festive mood ended abruptly when waleran asked geoffrey which castle would be assailed next avranches geoffrey said promptly he did not look at robert as he spoke though and henry tensed for he was learning to read storm signals in faces as well as cloud formations papa and uncle robert were on another one of their collision courses he kept hoping that eventually uncle robert would wear papas resistance down either that or theyd run out of castles to besiege but each time they clashed he feared that their quarreling would flame out of control end with his uncles giving up in disgust and that must not happen papa had to agree for mama to ask for his help her need must be dire he was watching them uneasily for signs that trouble was brewing when servants ushered a stranger into the hall henry had never seen anyone look so bedraggled his face was reddened and chapped by the cold his clothing torn and filthy but he was no beggar for as his mantle parted henry glimpsed a sword riding low on his hip he sat up hastily understanding the significance of what hed just seen this pitiful wretch was a courier one bearing a message worth risking his life health and horse for geoffrey had already pushed his chair back getting to his feet but the man never even glanced his way stumbling forward he sank to his knees before maudes brother roberts first fervent hope was that this messenger was from maude for he was becoming more and more worried by the silence echoing across the channel the seal on the letter though was not hers you come from brien fitz count he said and the man nodded numbly i swore to him that id get to you as quick as i could but my ship was caught in a gale and blown off course we finally came ashore in flanders and then i did not know where you were campaigning he stopped realizing he was rambling putting off the moment of revelation the empress is in grave peril my lord three days before michaelmas stephen swooped down on oxford forced his way into the city and lay siege to the castle robert stared at him appalled then tore the letter open and read rapidly when he looked up his face was flushed with outrage they left her miles and baldwin de redvers and the othersthose fools just rode off and left her to fend for herself the messenger nodded again bleakly stephen lured them off by raiding cirencester all but ranulf fitz roy and my lord brien at wallingford but he lacks the men to break the siege robert already knew that briens letter had been brutally honest about the gravity of the danger maude was facing michaelmas he said and then jesus god for that meant maude had been under siege for six weeks the castle could fall to stephen any day nowif it had not already fallen swinging around he pointed an accusing finger at maudes husband this is your fault too if not for your damnable delays and excuses id have been back in england in time to keep this from happening and just what do you think weve been doing hereplaying chess with real castles we have been waging a campaign to conquer normandy for my son and id say that matters as much as your endless and futile skirmishings in england robert made an enormous effort to master himself clenching his teeth until his jaw muscles ached how much time will you need to make ready more time than you can afford to spare i am not about to break off this campaign and go chasing off to england on a misguided mercy mission there are too many malcontents eager to take advantage of my absence geoffrey said with a pointed glance in his brother helies direction youd best sail on your own robert and ill join you when and if i am able if you are able robert echoed scathingly no longer bothering to mask his contempt your wife is facing a lifetimes confinement and you cannot even bestir yourself to ride a mile on her behalf just out of curiosity is there anyone in christendom whom youd risk your selfish skin foranyone at all not for that bitch at oxford geoffrey snapped and spare me your selfrighteous wrath the last i heard men pray to god for expiation of their sins not to the earl of gloucester if i must choose between maude and my son that is as easy a choice as any man ever made normandy is henrys legacy and i am going to see that he gets it which is more than i can say for maude and her pitiful efforts to claim the english throne you dropped the crown at her feet after lincoln and she had only to pick it up but she threw it away and i might forgive her for thatif it were not henrys crown too so whatever trouble she is in she brought it upon herself and not even you can deny it not if youre half as honest as you claim to be ill not deny that maude made some serious mistakes but she shows more honour and courage in a single day than you can hope to find in a lifetime youve overstayed your welcome brotherinlaw geoffrey said and there was a quiet menace in his voice that was more daunting than threats or bluster robert did not look in the least daunted though and the men began to crowd in closer some to intervene if need be others to get a better view but they soon moved aside for henry had shoved his way into their midst using his elbows like weapons kicking his uncle in the shins when helie did not let him through helie let out a startled oath and grabbed for the boy but henry ducked under his outstretched arm and flung himself forward fists clenched at his sides chin up and head high he stepped between his father and uncle his defiant stance all the more poignant for the glimmer of blinkedback tears you need not go papa he said tautly let uncle robert take me there were murmurings at that pity and surprise and a few suppressed smiles helie his ankle still smarting from henrys blow laughed outright i can just see you sprout he gibed toting a sword taller than you are and geoffrey turned upon him in a fury you are the last one in christendom qualified to give my son lessons in manhood he snarled and helie gave an indignant gasp but before he could retaliate henry urged again let me go papa it was not a demand but neither was it an entreaty and geoffrey reached out putting his arm around the boys rigid shoulders come over here lad where we can talk the rest of you men find some other way to entertain yourselves he said sharply steering a resistant henry toward the comparative privacy of a window seat geoffrey was uncertain what to say next it wasnt often he found himself so thoroughly discomfited you were not meant to hear what you did we did not realize you were in the hall i know you are confused lad but youre too young to understand what can go wrong between a man and his wife henry pulled away so abruptly that he stumbled he wanted to run but he stood his ground for there was no escaping what hed overheard his mother was in danger and his father did not care father and son were so intent upon each other that theyd not even realized robert had joined them not until he said quietly this is not about your wife geoffrey it is about his mother geoffrey started to speak stopped himself and henry seized his chance when you told me what happened at winchester papa you said mama had lost her chance to be queen you said that from now on she was fighting for me i ought to be there then i ought to be in england so men can see me with mama trapped they need a reason to keep fighting i can help uncle robert rescue her i know i can geoffrey was silent for several moments regarding the boy in thoughtful reappraisal i am not saying you are wrong henry but i am saying it would be too dangerous do you think stephen would hurt me henry challenged and geoffrey cursed himself for all the times hed mocked stephens soft heart in his sons hearing there are other dangers henry robert pointed out just getting to england would be hazardous for november is a bad month to cross the channel henry looked from his father to his uncle back at his father again yesterday i heard some of the castle servants talking about a funeral for one of the stable lads he went skating last week on the pond in the village but the ice was not thick enough and he drowned i like to skate on the ice too papa have my own pair of bone skates i could drown crossing the channel as uncle robert fearsor i could drown back in angers if i was unlucky like that stable lad geoffreys mouth twitched god help me he said ive sired a lawyer henryyou go back to the hearth and get warm whilst your uncle and i talk about this seeing that further argument was futile henry reluctantly retreated casting them several anxious looks over his shoulder the two men watched him go enemies suddenly allied in their concern for one small stubborn boy if youd not been so quick to start your sermon geoffrey said id have told you that im willing to spare some men for maudes rescue i can probably part with two hundred or so more if you can wait i cannot robert said tersely every day brings maude closer to capture but what of the lad you are going to let him go with me am i that obvious yesi am are you sure of course not geoffrey said an edge creeping back into his voice maude and i may not have agreed on much but we do on thisthat we cannot coddle the lad soi am trusting my son to you robert and to stephen another smile tugged at the corner of his mouth god pity him if henry did fall into his hands for that lad of mine would talk him into abdicating by sundown ill keep him safe robert said i can promise you that no geoffrey said you can only promise that you will try look at him over there watching us like a hungry hawk whilst pretending to play with those dogs of his he is still so youngcome on lets tell him ere i change my mind henry had knelt to pet his dyrehunds but he straightened up abruptly as they started toward him well geoffrey said id not advise a man to buy a horse sight unseen so i suppose the same holds true for kingdoms youd best check out the wretched english weather for yourself lad make sure it is a realm you want to rule henry swallowed his pulse quickening with an emotion that was not excitement and not fear yet oddly akin to both i can go truly and when his father nodded he swallowed again before saying uncle robertwe will be in time i do not know lad robert admitted i hope so that was not the answer henry had been expecting hed wanted reassurance had gotten instead an uncompromising adult reply honest and unnerving he could not have articulated the awareness that came upon him now but he sensed however instinctively that when he sailed for england hed be leaving the greater part of his childhood behind i hope so too he said striving to match his uncles matteroffact tones a moment later though he blurted out i want to take my dogs with me no longer sounding like a young king in the making just a nineyearold boy afraid for his mother the wind was banging against the barricaded windows of the keep the wooden shutters creaking and groaning under the onslaught it sounded to henry as if the storm were besieging corfe and having better luck than uncle robert was at wareham the chamber was dimly lit and cold on awakening that morning hed found his washing laver iced over in the three weeks that hed been at corfe hed come to hate it trapped inside much of the time by the wretched weather people were convinced this was going to be the worst winter in years for there had already been three heavy snowfalls and it was only the second week in december not that corfe had gotten much of the snow it was too close to the sea a few miles inland the roads were drifted over but at corfe and wareham theyd been buffeted by windlashed sleet and freezing rain wolf lass that was all the encouragement his dogs needed piling onto the bed they crowded henry toward the edge but he didnt mind the last time hed opened the shutter hed looked out upon a sky clogged with leaden clouds dusk at midday his uncle was at wareham just four miles to the north as hed been most days since theyd forced a landing there theyd taken the town but the castle still held out and that was why henry was stranded at corfe waiting for wareham to surrender hed tried a few times to write to his father but hed not gotten very far a smudged page or two blotched with ink smears and crossedout words it was not that he lacked for material to write about the channel crossing had been a rough one and he was proud of the fact that he hadnt gotten seasick like many of the men their original plan had been to land at southampton but some of the sailors balked for that was their home port so their fleet had come ashore at wareham and henry had watched from a ship in the river harbor as the town was captured in the weeks that followed his uncle let him visit the siege whenever the weather permitted as long as he kept well out of arrow range no he could have filled a dozen letters with what hed seen and heard in the past month but he was too troubled to write his uncle had explained to him that the besieged garrison had appealed to stephen for aid agreeing to surrender if he did not come to their rescue the rules of war gave them that right henry understood that or tried to he understood too his uncles strategy he was using the castle at wareham as bait hoping to draw stephen away from oxford such tactics had always worked in the past for stephen had rarely found the patience for a long siege that was not his nature so far though he had not taken the lure and with each passing day it seemed more and more likely that he was willing to sacrifice wareham if it meant he gained a far greater prizemaude when henry had confronted his uncle with these fears robert had acknowledged their validity but hed explained then the grim truththat the three hundred men with him were not enough to raise the siege at oxford hed need a far greater force to expel stephens army sheltered behind the citys walls and newly dug earthworks unless they could provoke stephen into coming out to meet them as he had at lincoln oxford castle seemed doomed for certes after that stark revelation henrys fears took a far darker turn hed spent a lot of his time at corfe thinking of his mother holding on to memories as elusive as the fireflies he chased every summer it had been more than three years since hed seen his mother what if he did not recognize her even more unsettling was the thought that she might not recognize him hed been only six then and he was nigh on ten now he fretted too about what she was enduring at oxford people were always interrupting conversations as he came by but he already knew what they did not want him to hearthat her food supplies must be running very low by now for the siege was into its third month but after his uncle admitted that they could not just ride to the rescue the way hed expected them to do he could not bring himself to write to his father whod shrugged off his mothers peril with the scornful words whatever trouble she is in she brought upon herself and each day when he awoke his first conscious thought was always the same would it be today that the castle fell today that his mother was taken prisoner his worry about recognition seemed a small care indeed when measured against the dread that hed never see his mother again his dogs were rooting in the coverlets for hed eaten bread and jam in bed for breakfast and spilled enough crumbs to warrant their attention wolf gulped down the last morsel then began to bark the female dyrehund joined in and a moment later robert entered the chamber wareham castle surrendered to me this morning he said not sounding at all like a man whod just gained a significant victory henry scrambled down from the bed what will you do now what id hoped to avoidlay siege to oxford weve got to muster as many men as we can so ive summoned all our allies to meet me at cirencester will you take me with you to cirencester henry asked and was very relieved when his uncle nodded uncle robertyou do not think well be able to rescue mama do you robert debated the merits of a kind lie versus a cruel truth but he waited too long to make up his mind and his hesitation confirmed the worst of henrys fears he turned away knelt by the closest of his dogs and buried his face in the dyrehunds thick silvery ruff if stephen captures the castle will he hurt my mother no robert said swiftly he would not harm her not stephen henry glanced up eyes wide and very dark in the candlelit shadows but he would not let her go he said and robert slowly shook his head no lad he admitted he would not let her go oxford castle england december it was snowing again from his vantage point up on the castle battlements ranulf gazed out upon a frigid frozen landscape of barren foreboding beauty stephen had set up his quarters at the kings house north of the city walls much of his army was billeted within the town but hed established an outer defensive perimeter and at night it looked as if the city were ringed with flames now it was midday and the blowing snow hid the smoldering campfires so much snow had fallen in december that it even covered up the uglier scars of the siege the newly dug graves in the outer bailey the churnedup pitted earth where mangonel missiles had landed the ruins of the stables which had been ignited by a flaming arrow more than a month ago the snow muffled sound blurred vision and transformed the familiar and known into another world altogether one pristine and alien and eerily deceptively tranquil ranulf did not remain up on the battlements for long the wind soon drove him to seek shelter inside not that it was so much warmer indoors as their food supplies had dwindled so too had their fuel their firewood had been consumed weeks ago these days they kept fires burning only in the great hall and the kitchen but even so theyd slowly stripped the castle of most of its furniture stamping snow from his boots ranulf hastened toward the open hearth other men were taking their turns there too thawing out only the ailing had the privilege of staying put and there were always a few blanketclad figures crouching close to the flames for their increasingly spartan diet and the constant cold were taking an inevitable toll the faces around him were grim and pale and gaunt for hunger had become the enemy lurking within stephens remorseless accomplice they had not been as careful with food as they ought in the beginning confident that aid would be forthcoming by martinmas though they were on strict rationing and maude had contributed greatly to the mens morale by insisting that portions be shared equally the highborn usually claimed more than their just due as the provisions in their larder were depleted theyd killed the castle livestock one by one and then their horses ranulf had hated that but they had no more grain to feed the animals and less and less to feed themselves so it mattered little whether he liked it or not if the siege dragged on for another month he might have to make a wrenching decision about his dyrehunds so far hed been sharing his own meagre allotment with them and even if men thought it was foolishly sentimental of him they kept their opinions to themselves for he was a kings son and the empresss brother but that could all change if the spectre of starvation became a real danger moving reluctantly away from the hearth ranulf began to look for hugh de plucknet it took a while for it was hard to distinguish one bundled form from another eventually he found hugh slouching morosely in a corner playing a game of merels with alexander de bohun the angevin captain of maudes household knights alexander aligned his pieces in a row just as ranulf joined them and both he and ranulf braced themselves for hughs complaints the hotheaded breton was a notoriously poor loser now though he did not react at all demonstrating anew how the siege was sapping their spirits they made room for ranulf in the window seat but no one bothered to talk it expended too much energy and what was there to say beyond the castle walls the world went on as usual but they no longer seemed to have a part in it ranulf in particular found the isolation hard to endure it was he thought like a foretaste of death the smothering silence of the grave theyd had but one outside contact since the siege began a daring archer had gotten himself admitted into the city waited till dark and then shot an arrow over the castle wall with a letter from brien fitz count wrapped around the shaft brien assured them that hed sent for robert hed had no luck luring stephen out to do battle but hed been doing all he could to harass and harry stephens occupying army engaging in hitandrun raids disrupting stephens supply barges as they paddled upriver past wallingford but stephen ignored the challenges and rerouted his supply trains overland and since then nothing october had yielded to november and then december the snows came and the noose tightened what indeed was there to talk about alexander was too restless to sit for long and soon wandered off ranulf and hugh were trying to muster up enough enthusiasm for another game of merels when rob doilly headed their way never the most articulate of men he seemed even more tonguetied then usual did maude tell you about our talk when ranulf shook his head rob frowned and worried his thumbnail between his teeth i spoke to her last night i told her thatthat we ought to consider surrendering ranulfs no merged and echoed with hughs equally impassioned protest and rob flushed i do not want it that way he insisted god knows i do not but there comes a time when resistance for its own sake makes no sense were past the point of hope and are merely prolonging our own suffering i understand if you do not want to hear that but it must be said and maude knew that too for she did not argue she agreed with you i do not believe that well she did not say it in so many words ranulf but she listened to what i had to say and made no protest if you want my opinion i think she is losing heart for this struggle women are not meant for hardships and privation after all they despair more easily than men youre raving maude is braver than any man i know ranulf snapped and hugh chimed in no less indignantly arguing that maude would starve ere shed surrender then why is she acting so oddly why did she say nothing when i talked of surrender andand there is more ranulf when i came to her chamber this morn she was behaving in a most peculiar manner she and minnathey were sewing ranulf and hugh exchanged astonished glances and then both burst out laughing good godsewing that is indeed proof of madness rob bridled his face getting even hotter do not mock me till youve heard it all the room was in utter disarray the coverlets thrown on the floor the bed stripped coffers open as if theyd been searching for something and there they were sewing away in the midst of all this chaos so intently youd think they were getting paid by the stitch and mind you they were not mending old clothes or even making new ones they were cutting up and hemming bed sheets sheets ranulf said blankly are you sure rob what could they possibly make out of bed sheets that is what ive been trying to tell you rob frowned again lowered his voice and said uneasily ive thought upon it and i can come up with only one answera burial shroud ranulf did not share robs anxiety about maudes emotional state he knew their sister better than rob he was curious though about those mysterious bed sheets but when he sought maude out she shrugged off his curiosity with a cryptic smile saying shed explain that evening after vespers the twilight service was held in the chapel adjoining st georges tower it was well attended most men found that their piety increased in direct proportion to the urgency of their need once it was over ranulf accompanied maude and minna across the snowdrifted bailey back to maudes chamber in the upper story of the keep there they found alexander de bohun hugh de plucknet william marshal and adam of ely maudes clerk awaiting her return they were soon joined by william defuble another of maudes knights ranulf could not help smiling thinking they made an odd sight indeed muffled in mantles up to their ears their breath frosting the air as they searched for seats the castles chairs benches and stools had long ago gone up in smoke rob doilly was the last one to arrive as a rule maude did not like to be kept waiting tonight though she seemed quite tolerant of robs tardiness which confirmed ranulfs suspicionshis sister had something in mind and hed wager the surety of his soul that it was not surrender i have been giving thought to what you said rob and i have decided that you are right our men have put up a gallant defense but they have endured enough the time has come to put an end to this if you offer to surrender the castle you ought to be able to get generous terms from stephen a promise that the garrison goes free rob looked relieved the other men stunned maude no ranulf exclaimed it may seem hopeless ill not deny that but you cannot give up if you surrender youll be shut away from the world for the rest of your life stephen will never let you go i am not giving up ranulf and i have no intention of surrendering to stephen but it is obvious by now that we have no reasonable hopes of being rescued robert would never abandon me if he has not come to my aid it is because he cannot so it is up to me to save myselfif i canby escaping from the castle my lady i doubt neither your resolve nor your enterprise and for certes not your courage but this time i fear you are well and truly trapped you cannot very well fly over the castle walls and every gate is watched night and day by stephens sentries even the little postern in the west wall no hugh i cannot fly over the wall maude agreed with just the hint of a smile but i could be lowered down from st georges tower onto the icedover moat the marshes must be frozen solid by now and the river too if i am right i ought to be able to cross in safety if i am wrong a slight shrug as i see it i do not have much to lose she did of course she was putting up the highest of all stakesher life but ranulf would have made the same wager had he been the one facing a lifetimes imprisonment you are proposing then to walk right through stephens lines that is without doubt the maddest idea ive ever heard when do we try it maude looked at him and laughed tonightafter it is full dark would it not be safer to wait until the snow stopped to be out and afoot on such a nightyoud have as much to fear from the weather maude as from stephens men marveling at his slowness maude said patiently what better cover could i have rob than a snowstorm stephens guards will not be able to see beyond the noses on their own faces and theyll be too cold and wretched to be showing much zeal for sentry duty with but a bit of luck we ought to be wellnigh invisible show them minna even as minna reached into the closest coffer ranulf had a sudden epiphany the sheets he cried bursting into enlightened laughter hugh began to laugh too the others remained perplexeduntil minna straightened holding up her handiwork for them to see a hooded mantle as white as milkor newly fallen snow by now they were all laughing maude passed the white cloaks around for their admiring inspection i count four of these remarkable garments hugh said and since two are already spoken for i hereby lay claim to the third who gets the last one alexander de bohun looked irked that it should even be open to question but before he could speak maude headed him off i would like you to remain at the castle alex so you might assist rob in striking a deal with stephen the words themselves were bland the real message was relayed as their eyes met theyd been together long enough to read each other without difficulty and alexander understood at once what maude was telling himthat she wanted him to keep rob from making any costly errors in the negotiations with stephen he did not like it any but he did not argue he shared her doubts about robs judgment the fourth man has to be a local lad ranulf pointed out someone who knows every lane and deer track in the shire stephens sentries are not going to be the only snowblind ones out there without a truly trustworthy guide were likely to wander around out in the woods till we freeze to death their eyes all turned toward rob who was quiet for a few moments his brow furrowed in thought and then he smiled i know just the man you need he was born and bred in berkshire could probably find his way to wallingford in his sleep and he is cocky enough to jump at the chance to show off his tracking skills moreover he has a brother or a cousinim not sure whichwho took vows at st marys abbey you will be heading for abingdon first maude nodded moved to the coffer chest and drew out a small leatherbound book rob i want you to keep this safe there are two letters hidden in the binding one to robert telling him that this was my doing and my choice and one to my sonsjust in case they looked at one another the edgy laughter stilled acknowledging in their sudden silence the magnitude of the risk and the slim likelihood of success they gathered in an upper chamber of st georges tower shortly before midnight the only light was a flickering oil lamp and when they were ready to unlatch the shutters minna prudently blew upon the sputtering wick for darkness was their only defense the continuing snowfall their only hope their preparations had been made hugh had a small sack filled with dried meat ranulf carried flint and tinder maude a pouch in which coins had been wrapped in cloth to keep them from clinking and the men had wineskins hooked to their belts the farewells had already been said and maude had coached rob in how to deal with stephens demands tell him she instructed that you ask nothing on my behalf that your concern is for the safety of the garrison that way he cannot accuse you of lying later once he learns i am gone their guide was a skinny undersized youth barely twenty with an unkempt shock of fair hair so blond it looked white and as incongruous a name as they could imagine sampson at first glance he seemed an unlikely candidate for such a dangerous mission but his slender build was deceptive he was as lean and lithe as a greyhound and as eager to hunt are we ready he queried jauntily sounding for all the world as if they were embarking upon a grand adventure instead of attempting to cross through enemy lines in the midst of a snowstorm ill go first he offered swinging his legs over the window ledge a moment later he was gone climbing down the rope so rapidly that he made it look easy ranulf was the next to go if any of you whoresons eat my dogs once im gone ill come back from the grave if need be to make you pay he warned and launched himself out into space to the accompaniment of joking threats about dyrehund stew his trip was a lot rougher than sampsons had been buffeted by the wind he was bumped bruisingly against the tower and slid the last few feet leaving rope burns on his palms hugh was already shinnying down the swaying rope alexander and rob were to lower maude slowly once the men had climbed down and ranulf and the others watched nervously now as she started the perilous descent the wind tugged at her cloak blew back her hood and at one point the rope jerked plummeting her briefly toward the ground before the men above were able to brace themselves again by then she was close enough for ranulf and hugh to catch she leaned against ranulf struggling to regain her breath as hugh cut away her rope harness no one spokethey dared not risk itbut the same thought was in all their minds it was not a comfortable feeling being on the wrong side of the castle walls their first test of faith was the castle moat with sampson in the lead they stepped out gingerly onto the ice and when it held they shared tense smiles it was bitterly cold but the wind was not constant a sudden gust would send snow swirling across their path stinging their eyes and skin but then it would subside if not for the castle wall rising up at their backs ranulf would have been utterly disoriented for all recognizable landmarks were camouflaged or buried but sampson showed no hesitation striking out boldly as if following the kings highway peering into the impenetrable blackness ahead he whispered were coming up on the millstream ranulf and the others could not see a foot in front of their faces so dark was it they could only put their trust in sampson and they trailed after him out onto the ice again for the millstream was just where hed said it would be off to the east and west they could now see smoke rising and sampson plotted a course that would take them between these enemy campfires they had agreed that stephens sentries would not likely be patrolling on a night like this for certes any man with sense would be keeping as close to the fire as he could get they felt sure they had logic on their side but they knew too that gambles are won by luck as much as logic the drifts were deep and it was more tiring than any of them had anticipated their pace a slow and laborious one the marshes were hidden under a blanket of soft snow but the ground was frozen so hard that it was difficult to remember these same meadows had been under water when the siege began they crossed a second stream with encouraging ease ranulf guessed they had come no more than half a mile but already the castle had disappeared into the darkness visibility was so poor that hugh walked straight into a tree a mishap that might have been comic if not for the fact that he gashed his cheek on a splintered branch just missing his eye more proofas if they needed itof how vulnerable they were out here for any mistake was likely to be lethal sampson was in the lead with ranulf and hugh close behind breaking a trail for maude who was hampered by her skirts when sampson stopped abruptly flinging up his hand in warning they froze as a rider materialized out of the night his stallions hoofbeats made no sound upon the snow moving with a ghostly grace it seemed more like a phantom spirit than a fleshandblood animal an illusion enhanced by its odd color the shade of pale smoke the rider was enveloped in a dark mantle his face shadowed by a peaked hood and he seemed no more real than his mount there was a fey dreamlike quality to the encounteruntil he turned his head and looked in their direction no one moved no one even blinked for seconds that lasted longer than years he seemed to be staring right at them and then he shook his head like a man trying to clear cobwebs from his brain made a sketchy sign of the cross and rode on no one spoke for another eternity had he decided he could not possibly have seen what hed first thought had he concluded that these spectral white shapes were but a figment of his imagination or had he only sensed a presence instinct overruled then by reason they would never know as soon as they dared they pushed on blessing maudes foresight her camouflaging white cloaks theyd not gone far when they saw a gleam through the trees up ahead quickening their steps resisting the urge to keep looking over their shoulders they halted on the riverbank staring in silence at the icy grey surface of the thames the moat and millstream had been obstacles to be overcome but the thames would be their grave if maudes gamble failed if the ice was not solid trying not to think of the depth and power of that frigid current trying not to remember how unusual it was for the thames to freeze over they clasped hands and slowly ventured out onto the ice as they moved farther from shore they could hear snapping sounds as the ice settled and first one and then another would pause eyes straining for cracks each footstep was an act of hope an expenditure of courage they had almost reached the far bank when ranulfs boot skidded in the fragmented instant before his body hit the ice they all saw it break under his weight pitching them into the inkblack water there was a thud that could surely have been heard back in oxford and thennothing the ice held firm and a few moments later they had achieved a rare distinction they would be able to say in all honesty that they had crossed the river thames without even getting their feet wet that was fun maude said faintly and caught the flicker of shaken grins by common consent they sought the shelter of a massive oak hugh pulled out his wineskin and passed it around maude drank so deeply that she choked the wine was heavily spiced burned its way down her throat but she welcomed the heat for never in her life had she been so cold shed not expected to be so tired so soon she estimated theyd come about a mile or more which meant they had at least another five miles ere they reached abingdon i am rested she lied lets go on the ground was sloping upward and the snow was kneedeep in spots it was like trying to run through water the wind had shifted was coming now from the south and seemed intent upon blowing them back to oxford they stumbled repeatedly clutching at one another to keep from falling the trees were glazed in ice branches broken off by the weight of the snow crunched underfoot and occasionally sent one of them sprawling hughs hands were growing numb he tucked them into his armpits in an attempt to warm them deciding that gloves might not be such an effete fashion after all even if they were worn only by women and princes of the church panting and shivering they struggled on until at last they reached the crest of the hill look maude said softly pointing back down the hill the blowing snow was already drifting across their trail soon all signs of their tracks would be gone blotted out as if theyd never passed this way by god hugh murmured sounding awed we just might make it you did not think we would maude asked and he shook his head with a grin not a chance in hell he admitted cheerfully and maude turned away hastily moved almost to tears by their fealty and their reckless rash gallantry and there in the december darkness on this snowclouded silent hill she beheld a glimmer of illuminating light the realization that such loyalty could only be earned not commanded no matter who claimed englands crown it took them another six hours to reach abingdon and by the time they were within sight of the abbey walls of st marys they were in danger of losing the night leaving ranulf and maude to hide in the woods sampson and hugh trudged out to seek admittance from the porter at the gate maude and ranulf were both acquainted with abbot ingulph had dined with him at oxford castle that summer and maude did not want to implicate him in her escape while stephen was not usually given to searching for scapegoats it was difficult to predict what a man might do when reeling from the blow stephen was about to take so they had concocted a cover story for sampson and hugh which explained their urgent need for horses without stirring up suspicions sampson was going to claim that hed left rob doillys employ before the siege began and now served hugh whod taken on bennet de malpass name for the occasion ranulfs sardonic contribution to the fable sampsons cousin brother joseph would know better of course but sampson swore hed not say so and they were fast learning to accept whatever the slight young soldier said as gospel for hed gotten them this far had he not the snow had stopped several hours ago but began again as soon as hugh and sampson were out of sight and this time the flakes were not soft and lazy floating wisps of white lace this dawn snowfall was wet and icy pelted against their skin like sleet hugh and sampson had shed the white cloaks that had so effectively disguised their mantles and maude and ranulf made a little tent of them huddling together in a futile search for warmth they took turns talking keeping each other awake for exhaustion was on their trail even if stephen was not and they could not be sure of that either discovery and capture were still very real threats that sentry might have reevaluated what hed seen and decided to give the alarm or they could have the bad luck to run into one of stephens patrols now that daylight was nigh or hugh and sampson might fail be unable to buy or borrow horses there were any number of ways disaster could descend upon them and between them maude and ranulf thought of them all seeking to scare away sleep the last nightshadows were in retreat and the wind was picking up as they heard approaching horses ranulf unsheathed his sword drawing maude in behind him moments later sampson and hugh rode into the clearing mounted upon matching bay geldings grinning from ear to ear theyd agreed that it would be too suspicious to seek four horses and now sampson swung nimbly from the saddle tossing ranulf the reins as soon as hed assisted maude up behind her brother he vaulted onto hughs mount and confidently pointed out the direction they were to take putting spurs to their horses they set off at as fast a pace as the weather and their double burdens would allow leaving in the snow for the villagers to find and puzzle over four hooded white cloaks wallingford castle was nine miles away so close and yet so far sampson was taking no chances though and steered clear of the abingdonwallingford road in favor of a safer crosscountry route that he followed as unerringly as a bloodhound on the scent of prey so it was almost noon before the castle at last came into view wallingford was one of the bestdefended strongholds in england and they were challenged as soon as they came within bow range of its massive walls open up ranulf shouted for the empress a claim so unexpected and so startling that the guard forgot all about caution and popped up to peer over the wall embrasure the empress is trapped at oxford he shouted back what sort of lunatic trick is this maudes teeth were chattering too much for speech reaching up impatiently she pulled back the hood of her mantle so the skeptical guard could see her face there was a strangled sound up on the battlements which might have amused her had she not been so very very cold she would later realize that briens men had acted with impressive dispatch but now it seemed to take an extraordinarily long time before the drawbridge began to lower and the gate swung open to admit her crossing into the bailey they rode into utter pandemonium men were coming on the run from all corners of the castle and they were mobbed as soon as they reined in a dozen eager hands reached up to help maude dismount but her muscles were so numbed and cramped that she stumbled and had to grab at the nearest arm to keep from falling when she faltered again brien was there to catch her as soon as he felt her trembling he jerked off his own mantle and wrapped her in it before escorting her into the great hall leaving ranulf hugh and sampson to fend for themselves maude was dazed by the furor she had often been the center of attention but never before the object of such intense and unbridled enthusiasm every man in the hall was beaming at her admiring marveling approving she was being assailed from all sides with shouted questions and lavish praise it was unseemly behavior and she reveled in it ranulf and hugh and sampson were fighting their way toward her overwhelmed by so much goodwill men were slapping them on the back spilling wine on them with overeager generosity inadvertently keeping them from what they most wanted to thaw themselves out by that blazing hearth maude was so close to the flames that she was in danger of being singed she was thirsty and hungry and half frozen and so fatigued she felt lightheaded but none of that mattered she was quite content to stay right where she was in briens arms surrounded by laughing exultant men men who were calling her queen maude as if they truly meant it rejoicing in her triumph and making it their own brien was holding her as if he had no intention of letting her go dark eyes never leaving her face you are the most amazing woman he said and laughed too happy to hide it to keep up the pretense between them any longer maude smiled at him as her own defenses dropped realizing what was happening and not caring not now not anymore my only regret she said is that ill not be there to see stephens face when he finds out ive bested him that set them all to laughing and this time she knew the jokes were at stephens expense not hers if i do not sit down soon im likely to fall down she confided to brien for she could admit to physical frailties now shed earned that right his arm tightened around her shoulder and when he called out for a chair so many men volunteered that maude began to laugh never had she felt like this so in harmony with her world so at ease with herself it was a wonderful feeling had been a long time coming she smiled again at brien but he was no longer gazing down into her face with such flattering and heartfelt joy he was looking over her shoulder and although he showed no overt signs of tension maude saw enough subtle indicationsa tightening around his mouth a flickering of his eyelidsfor her to turn around seeking the source of his stress a woman was coming toward them she was about maudes age although without maudes statuesque carriage or her elegant highcheeked handsomeness maudes features were boldly stated her coloring as dramatic as her demeanor this womans appeal was as delicate as it was conventional delineated in gentle muted shades hair a pale ashbrown golden lashes eyes a soft misty blue eyes that were as clear as spring water and as transparent giving maude an unwanted glimpse into the very depths of her womans soul there was pain in the look she now gave maude pain and fear and a quiver of hopeless hatred welcome to wallingford madame she said tonelessly welcome to my husbands home stephen felt more than triumph as he watched the castle drawbridge being lowered he felt a quiet but intense sense of vindication judging from the comments he overheard as they rode into the bailey he knew his men were experiencing emotions no less jubilant and a good deal more vengeful as much as hed wanted to take maude prisoner he had no desire to see her humiliated and in that he was clearly in the minority his brother in particular was anticipating maudes surrender with more pleasure than seemed becoming for a man of god stephen hoped henry would not gloat too openly but he could not very well say anything not only would that infuriate his brother for days and even weeks to come but it would reinforce the lingering suspicions of his other allies that he lacked the old kings implacable will and unforgiving royal memory it would be a great relief once he no longer had to compete with a ghost in ending the threat maude posed he hoped too to put her father to his longoverdue rest rob doilly was awaiting them upon the steps of the great hall standing with a tall burly man whom stephen recognized as the captain of maudes household knights but there was no sign of maude and stephens smile faded that is odd he said i would have wagered any sum that maude would be the first one wed see it is not so surprising the bishop countered she is facing utter ruin confinement for the rest of her days little wonder she might want to put off the moment of surrender as long as possible after all this time henry do you know maude as little as that the greater her defeat the more determined shed be to meet it headon i do not like this not at all mayhap she is ailing that might explain her sudden capitulation in truth id expected her to hold out until the last morsel of bread had been swallowed rob doilly drew a visibly bracing breath he was obviously not looking forward to this coming confrontation and that was the true measure of the difference between them alexander de bohun thought with just a trace of disdain for he was relishing what lay ahead his eyes flicked past stephen to the familiar faces behind him the cutthroat fleming the swaggering warenne whelp that sour pickle northampton whose smiles always looked borrowed and winchesters ungodly bishop as smug as a cat with a mouse between its paws no he was glad now that his lady had asked him to keep her brother from blundering hed not have missed this for all the whores in babylon rob doillys sin was not in being nervous it was in letting it be seen he was determined though to follow the proper code of conduct for such occasions and as stephen dismounted he stepped forward stiffly knelt and formally offered his sword oxford castle is yours my liege stephen accepted the sword with appropriate gravity and did not keep rob on his knees any longer than need be say what you will about the man rob thought he knew how to play his part but he did not yet know that maude had rewritten the ending and when he did where is the countess of anjou the bishop of winchester demanded and rob found himselfoddly enoughtaking umbrage on stephens behalf that his partisans should feel so free to usurp his role he hesitated and was not sure whether to be relieved or resentful when alexander de bohun spared him the dangerous duty of revelation you were expecting to find the empress here alexander queried blandly you are in for a disappointment then there was a brief moment of stunned silence and then uproar stephen had to shout to make himself heard above the din how witless do you think we are she must be hereunless she has learned to fly now where is she ill have the truth from you he warned adding ominously one way or another rob gulped saying nothing but thinking all the while of the garrison hanged at shrewsbury castle alexander was not as easily intimidated he even smiled i do not expect you to take my word for it see for yourselves several of the men seemed ready to fling themselves at alexander de bohun and rob threatening to beat the truth out of them if need be and rob took an involuntary backward step but stephen stopped them with a peremptory gesture search the castle he commanded take it apart stone by stone if you must but find her they took stephen at his word all but tore the castle apart rob and alexander de bohun and the rest of maudes men were herded into the great hall under guard those who showed too much pleasure in the frantic search were soon nursing bruises and split lips and rob warned them hoarsely that prudence was the order of the day sidling up to alexander he asked softly if they ought not to remind stephen of his promise to free the garrison but alexander shook his head no just stay quiet till their fury burns out only once has stephen sent men to their deaths in a rage and it is said he later regretted it i do not doubt ypres or the bishop would hang the lot of us before breakfast without blinking an eye but stephen will not let them take out their anger on usif we are half as lucky as the empress it was sound advice and rob took it for the remainder of the search he and his men kept as low a profile as they could the bitch is gone the earl of northampton reported sounding as if he could not believe his own words weve looked in every corner and cranny of this accursed place if she is still here she is in one of those fresh graves out in the bailey for weve not missed so much as a mousehole stephen turned away without answering his brother was beside him now ranting in his ear again listening to henry was like pouring salt into an open wound swinging about he headed for the stairwell taking the stairs two at a time up to the chamber hed been told was maudes his spurs struck sparks against the stone steps and his heart thudded in rhythm to the dirge echoing in his brain gone she is gone but how christ on the cross how maudes chamber had been demolished bedding slashed coffers spilled open her clothes strewn about ripped into rags william de ypres had backed a heavyset woman against the wall pinning her by her wrists her hair had been shaken loose falling over her face in saltandpepper dishevelment and there was blood welling in the corner of her mouth but she showed no fear and that seemed to goad the fleming all the more where is she old woman youd best tell me now whilst you still have a tongue to talk i do not know and if i did id never tell you she spat before calling ypres a name that sounded german to stephen and clearly no compliment let her go william he said angrily and ypres spun around to protest but saw something in stephens face that silenced him moving to an overturned coffer he picked up a womans chemise tore it in half and flung the pieces contemptuously at minnas feet minna expelled an audible breath as ypres stalked out watching stephen warily as he moved about the chamber i know who you are he said you have been with maude for a long time it surprises me that she could leave you behind like this had she no fear for your safety she knew youd not harm a woman minna said calmly retrieving the torn chemise and using it to daub at her bleeding mouth did she indeed i find it passing strange stephen said with sudden bitterness that my enemies value my virtues more than my friends do minna continued to watch him closely rubbing her chafed wrists now that ypres was not there to see i was not lying she insisted i do not know where my lady is i do stephen said wallingford where else could she go but i need to know how she did it you owe me that much he did not truly expect her to answer him but she did saying readily she had us lower her from st georges tower down onto the ice outside the walls and then what she just walked past my army stephen asked incredulously and she nodded proudly i seeso you are telling me she escaped from a besieged castle in the midst of a snowstorm i suppose i should say that if she could endure such an ordeal take such a mad risk then she deserved to get away but i will not i cannot he said his voice cracking with rage and another emotion one more raw and revealing than anger minna was folding the bloodied and shredded chemise neatly as if it were still a whole garment and not a fragment beyond salvaging even if you had captured my lady she said you would not have won your war he turned to look at her and she continued quietly youd only have gained yourself some time the empress is fighting for her son and even if you were to confine her in the tower until she died men would still see young henry as the rightful heir that may well be he said at last but maude had best understand this that i am fighting for my son too at wallingford maude was still enjoying her newfound celebrity status the garrison could not do enough for her and on the few occasions when shed ventured beyond the castle walls the townspeople flocked around her the way londoners had once trailed after her mother good queen maude on her visits to the citys lepers and christs poor maude was no saint nor did she want to be one but shed been popular with her german subjects and it had stung her pride when the english acknowledged her so grudgingly with suspicion and scorn instead of approval so there was a healing balm in this belated acceptance even though she knew that nothing had truly changed men might praise her courage admire her intrepid escape but they were still not willing to obey her the sun was blinding on the snow so bright that it hurt maudes eyes some of the younger men were having an exuberant snowball fight but they waved and held their fire until shed safely passed by as soon as she entered the hall a young page offered to fetch her an almond milk custard from the kitchen and when she declined he confided that the cooks were planning a special christmas eve subtlety in her honour they were baking a cake shaped like oxford castle surrounded by sugared snow up in her bedchamber maude found shed been given extra pillows and yet another gown was spread out on the bed a soft wool in a flattering shade of green as maude was too tall to borrow any clothes from briens wife he had engaged some of the townswomen on her behalf and to judge by the way her wardrobe was expanding they must be sewing day and night maude had never been treated so well as she had during her stay at wallingford and she wanted nothing so much as to get as far away as she could ranulf was in the solar decorating it with mistletoe and evergreen boughs smiling at sight of his sister he said catch and tossed maude a wafer it was hot from the oven and filled with honey the aptly named angels bread if robert does not get here soon ranulf confessed ill not find a horse big enough to bear my weight ive not been able to stop eating spend more time in the kitchen than the cooks he was pleased when she laughed for he knew she was not as cheerful as she would have others believe he suspected that her victory had left a sour aftertaste in her mouth and he thought he knew why but maude would never admit it mayhap not even to herself i saw sampson in the stables this morning maude flying higher than any hawk is that lad he says hes coming with us back to devizes sounding like a man offered a post guarding heavens gate actually he approached me first said he had a yearning to see more of the world than wallingford i was going to take him with us anyway though for i do not care to think what might have befallen us without him sitting down she helped herself to another wafer ranulf ive been thinking about the ransoms we might as well send word to stephen now find out what we must pay to free rob and alexander and minna and the others i know brien wants to wait till robert arrives but surely stephen knows by now where i am ranulf sat down across from her so simple an act as sitting in a chair was a pleasure after all those weeks of feeding their furniture into the fire you are not worried about your safety here maude there is no need you know robert was already gathering an army to march to your rescue when he got briens message about your escape and so he should reach us any day now and you may be sure that stephen knows he is on his way but even if stephen were foolish enoughor furious enoughto assault wallingford this very morn hed have no chance of taking it ere robert arrives if the worst happened and he somehow captured the town as he did oxford hed never be able to take the castle and brien has his larders well stocked id wager we could hold out at wallingford till spring and beyond if need be hed meant to reassure her but the look on her face was one of dismay it was painfully obvious that she found the prospects of a wallingford siege even more daunting than the dangers shed braved in escaping from oxford she would he suspected flee barefoot out into the snow rather than be trapped here with brien and his wife and he understood why thinking of annora he understood all too well the door burst open and hugh reeled into the room riders approach he panted under a flag of truce maude and ranulf both flew to the window fumbling with the shutters for all his bold talk ranulf felt a chill that was not caused by the sudden infusion of cold air was stephen making a demand that brien give maude up he leaned out the window so recklessly that maude and hugh grabbed for his belt to anchor him i can see them now he reported they are stephens men for certes either a messenger or an escortholy mother he was blocking maude and hughs view and they could only wait impatiently until he withdrew safely back into the solar as soon as he turned they knew his news was good it is minna stephen has sent her back to you maude his grin widened and damn me if else but he threw in my dyrehunds too maude was sitting beside the hearth in her bedchamber while minna brushed out her long dark hair it had been quiet for a while a comfortable quiet they were finally talked out moving to the table minna poured wine for them both then went back to brushing maudes hair maude sipped the wine without enthusiasm it was a malmsey too sweet for her taste did you ask for ranulfs dogs minna shook her head regretfully in truth i never thought of them she admitted no that was stephens doing maude set her wine cup down turning so she could look into minnas face did he take it hardmy escape yes minna said and maude smiled another silence settled over the chamber minna had begun to hum under her breath a german song from her youth and it was like a cats purring proof of minnas contentment what a christmas this will be madame it would be wellnigh perfect if only lord robert were here do you know what sort of festivities are planned i asked that woman but she was not very forthcoming minnas loyalty was a fierce and elemental force it took no prisoners she managed to make the innocuous phrase that woman sound as damning as anything maude had ever heard she hid a smile in her wine cup for there was a primitive sweet pleasure in it but it was a forbidden pleasure nonetheless one she dared not indulge you might as well call her what she is minnabriens wife i know minna said but she could not resist adding a muttered comment under her breath which seemed to fault briens wife for an odd sin indeed that she shared maudes name maude said nothing but she could feel heat rising in her face it had happened on her third night at wallingford shed gone into the solar to retrieve a book and she was already in the room before she realized she was not alone they were standing in the shadows beyond the reach of the cresset lamp brien had his hands on his wifes shoulders his back was to maude and he was speaking too softly for her to hear but his tone was soothing his wifes face was turned up toward his and it was wet with tears maude froze not wanting to be there to witness this intimate moment shed taken a stealthy backward step when the other maudes voice rose just enough for her words to carry clearly across the solar how lucky for you brien that i was christened maude for you need never fear crying out the wrong name in bed maude never knew how brien responded for she heard nothing after that but the blood pounding in her ears as she slowly retreated toward the door she could not have borne it had they turned and seen her but she was spared that at least yet the memory lingered one she would never share with another soul not even minna ive never been able to abide women like that minna the ones who flutter their lashes and coo like doves whenever a man walks by just the sort of woman geoffrey would fancy just remember my lady what god has given you and denied her her marriage is barren whilst you have three healthy sons that gave maude pause sons i never get to see she said and at once regretted it for even to her ears that sounded suspiciously selfpitying i am so thankful minna to have you back with me weve traveled a bumpy road together too many miles for us ever to go our separate ways minna smiled began to hum again within moments dogs were barking out in the bailey that sounds like ranulfs wolf pack maude said the barking did not subside the other castle dogs were joining in minnado you think it could be robert maude was on her feet retying the lacings of her gown and minna was brushing her hair back preparing to pin it at the nape of her neck when they heard the footsteps on the stairs it was ranulf and brien and maude knew at once that her hunch had been right robert she asked eagerly and they nodded in unison ranulfs emotions always ran close to the surface briens did not now though the same expression was mirrored on both their faces a look of jubilation and joy that was somehow expectant too the sort of inner excitement that hinted at secrets and surprises but maude had no time for curiosity for robert was coming in behind them and then she was in his arms being held in a wordless embrace one that said what they could not these narrow escapes of yours robert said are becoming the stuff of legend maude laughed ah robert i cannot begin to tell you how the sight of you gladdens me i have to admit he said that you truly surprised me with that miraculous midnight escape of yours but i have a surprise of my own he looked back toward brien then and nodded maude watched puzzled as brien pulled the door all the way open and then she gasped dear god for her son was standing in the doorway henrys qualms about not being recognized now seemed very foolish to him for he was suddenly sure that his mother would have known him anywhere on any street in christendom he liked the way her hair fell loose about her shoulders black and shiny like the polished jet in the hilt of his uncles dagger and he liked it too that she did not pounce on him swooping him up in one of those tearful perfumed embraces that squeezed the air out of him he did not want her to act like the mothers of his friends she said his name making it sound like the amen that ended prayers and he was drawn forward into the room straight as an arrow toward its target we were coming to rescue you he explained with just a trace of reproach and we would have too but you were too quick mama you rescued yourself had she known he was on the way she said shed have waited and she laughed he laughed too and then she was hugging him and instead of being embarrassed he found himself hugging her back henry was not shy and he was soon settled crosslegged across from his mother in the window seat talking a blue streak asking about her trek through the snow interrupting to brag a bit about his own adventures then wanting to know if shed been scared if shed gotten lost if shed mind that he went to bed later tonight since he was not tired at all and there was so much still to share minna and the men watched and listened and then one by one discreetly slipped away brien was the last to go hed seen maude look more beautiful than she did at this moment ironically enough hed always thought she had never looked fairer than on the day of her wedding to geoffrey but never had he seen her look happier merry christmas maude he said softly and closed the door leaving her alone with her son devizes castle england june june was a good month for maude her son was back at devizes castle his visits were never long enough left her yearning for more but boys of henrys age did not belong with their mothers only a man could teach them the navigational skills they would need to reach the distant shores of manhood or so society and the church dictated maude had reluctantly acquiesced entrusting henry into her brothers keeping for motherhood could not compete with kingship no matter what she must do or endure or sacrifice it would be worth iton the day her stolen crown was placed upon henrys head that she did not dare to doubt on this sultry june saturday ranulf and hugh de plucknet had taken henry on a hunt in the royal forest of melksham and they did not return till dusk grimy and sweatsoaked and tired and triumphant this was henrys first hunt and his enthusiasm was so intense that his audience knew it was witnessing the birth of a lifelong passion one of his arrows had helped to bring down a hart and with each telling the tines on the stags antlers grew more numerous and awesome maude listened patiently as he relived the hunt for her praising the lymer hounds and recounting the chase and describing in detail the moment when their quarry turned at bay but when he started to explain how a skilled tracker could determine a stags size by the shape of its droppings maude called a halt deer droppings that explains why you smell so ripe she teased and henry grinned for being dirty and bedraggled was part of the fun go bathe and then you can come back and teach me all about the mysteries of deer dung she promised and he began grumbling goodnaturedly about taking a bath bargaining for a lesser washup not conceding defeat until ranulf weighed in on maudes side you need not bathe harry not as long as you stay downwind at supper he suggested and henry grinned again for he was old enough now to laugh at himself but maude turned to look at her brother in surprise harry she echoed where did that come from you did not tell your mother yet lad he wants to be called harry from now on just as henry had feared his mothers brows slanted downward in a disapproving frown and he said hastily why not mama ive always hated henry it sounds like the name of a priest oror some peddlers nag it is just not a heroic name mama i like harry much better and that is the way the english say henry and since im to be king of the english i ought to have an english name and at that point he broke off not having run out of arguments just out of breath but before he could rally maude shook her head henry is what you were christened and henry you will remain nicknames are undignified ranulf started to speak stopped himself henry was not as prudent his disappointment was too sharp to swallow instead he let it out in anger saying accusingly that is not fair it is my name not yours that is so maude conceded coolly but it is also so that you are ten years old once you are grown you may call yourself whatever you choose until then you must make do with henry the obdurate look on her sons face was one she was becoming all too familiar with it is not fair he said again but this time as defiance not complaint and when maude showed no signs of relenting he turned away abruptly deliberately knocking over a chair on his way to the door but he did not get far his mothers voice froze him in his tracks henry i will not abide such churlish behavior and you well know it go and take your bathnow ranulf had watched in astonishment and as soon as henry had gone he admitted that is the first time ive seen the lad flare up like that has he done this before yes i am sorry to say once when he did not get his way he broke a pitcher sohe inherited his share of the infamous angevin temper after all tempers can be controlled geoffrey controls his no ranulf these fits of temper are not a tainted legacy of the blood henry was not given to tantrums not whilst he was in my care these sprang up in my absence like weeds and took root once he saw how well they worked i suppose it was only to be expected for geoffrey was always overly indulgent with our sons and whilst he was off waging war in normandy there were few to say no to henry or his brothers that is another reason why i agreed to put henry into roberts keeping for i knew robert would never brook disobedience or deliberate mischief indeed not ranulf agreed ruefully remembering his own apprenticeship under roberts tutelage his brother was even more of a disciplinarian than maude with no tolerance for tomfoolery robert will set the lad straight if anyone can but if you do not mind my meddling i think you were too hard on him about the name what harm in letting him call himself harry did you never want to change your name i did for certes truly maude sounded so puzzled that it was obvious this particular childhood craving had eluded her altogether what did you want to be called she asked curiously and ranulf hesitated ill tell you only if you promise not to laugh i was so bedazzled by the heros exploits in the song of roland thatmaude you are laughing no i am not she insisted untruthfully and unconvincingly roland fitz royi cannot believe our father countenanced that you do not think i ever asked papa no that was whilst i was still a page in stephens household and if memory serves he called me roland for nigh on a fortnightand with a straight face tootill the whim passed he would maude said tartly but she fell silent after that and ranulf hoped she was pondering what hed said if geoffrey had to learn how to rein henry in she needed to learn how to slacken those reins changing the subject he asked her about geoffreys last letter and she told him of her husbands victorious siege of cherbourg all of normandy south and west of the river seine was now his she reported but with a discernible lack of enthusiasm he understood why as much as she wanted to see the duchy conquered for henry it had to ranklethat geoffrey was succeeding spectacularly in normandy whilst her english campaign was mired down in controversy buffeted by setbacks and shadowed by defeat from normandy their conversation shifted to the latest news from the french court urged on by eleanor the french king had invaded champagne to punish count theobald for championing raoul de peronnes repudiated wife and the resulting carnage had been shocking even to an age inured to bloodshed and civilian casualties when the french army had swept into the town of vitrysurmarne and laid siege to one of theobalds castles the frightened townspeople had taken refuge in their church but when the town was fired the wind shifted and the flames spread to the church within moments it became an inferno and few escaped more than thirteen hundred bodies were later found in the smoldering ruins the young french king was a horrified eyewitness and his sleep was said to be haunted by those dying screams even now six months after vitrys fiery death throes but the kings anguished conscience had not bidden him to withdraw his troops from champagne and the campaign continued it was ranulf and maude agreed incredible follyfighting a war to vindicate an illicit love affair when her own peace was troubled by memories of the terrible suffering in winchester maude confided at least she knew her cause was just her sons kingship was worth fighting for even dying for henry chose that moment to reenter the chamber his mother and uncle scowled at sight of him and his disgrace stung anew for their good opinion mattered greatly to him you could not possibly have taken a bath already maude said suspiciously and he readily admitted that he had not the servants are fetching the bathwater but i did wash my face and hands and even my necksee he said tugging aside his tunic to show a patch of newly scrubbed skin i came back mama to say that i was sorry for being rude maudes mouth softened you deserve to be forgiven then but do you know what i would value as much as an apology your promise that it will not happen again henry hesitated id rather not mama he said at last i cannot be sure i could keep that promise and if i could not then my sin would be twofoldrudeness and bad faith too very scrupulous of you henry maude said dryly but i would suggest that you try to mend your manners in the future that you try very hard i will mama i will not throw any more chairs about and ill make no more mention of names will not ask you again to call me harry he said solemnly and then heaved a wistful sigh papa will agree and ill just have to settle for that ranulf coughed to camouflage a laugh while maude wavered between exasperation and amusement i may not know as much about military tactics as your uncles but that is one i do recognizedivide and conquer no henry grinned at being caught out and she beckoned him forward fortunately for you your uncle ranulf has been pleading your case and he would have made a worthy lawyer for he convinced me that harry is a fitting name for an english king thank you mama and you too uncle ranulf henry beamed at them both but youd best write and tell uncle robert that you agree i asked him last week and he looked at me like id lost my wits henry had no time to savor his triumph for a sudden commotion had erupted out in the bailey demanding investigation darting across the chamber he knelt on the window seat and leaned recklessly out the window armed riders he reported breathlessly lots of them and one of them is your friend uncle ranulfgilbert fitz john gilbert bore an urgent summons for ranulf and maudes household knights you know my lady how stephen tried to recapture wareham castle but backed off once he saw how well defended it was he has since moved into wiltshire and he is now at wilton ranulf and maude exchanged glances for wilton was only twentyone miles from devizes what does robert think he has in mind an attack on us possibly earl roberts spies have warned him that stephen has sent out writs summoning his lords and vassals to wilton in the meantime he has taken over the nunnery is using it as an outpost whilst he builds a castle he could then isolate salisbury since the river crossing is at wilton and threaten all our holdings in the west but he has made a grievous mistake madame for wilton cannot withstand a siege not yet robert means to take him by surprise gilbert nodded he sent me to fetch you ranulf and as many men as lady maude can spare he wants us to ride on to marlborough and alert john marshal he and lord miles will join us there and then swoop down upon wilton without warning gilbert smiled grimly god willing he said it will be another lincoln wilton was situated at the conflux of the rivers nadder and wylye it had a prestigious past for it had once been a royal borough of the saxon princes it was still an important town with a thriving market the wealthy and renowned abbey of st mary which regularly drew pilgrims to its shrine of st edith and the hospital of st giles founded by a queen the old kings adeliza but stephens arrival had shattered the security and threatened the prosperity of its citizens the market had attracted customers from all the neighboring villages but no more for few were willing to visit a town occupied by soldiers the local tradesmen suffered too and their shops remained shuttered the towns jews had been the first to flee for they knew from bitter experience that they were the most vulnerable in times of upheaval some of the citizensthose with daughters or young wiveshad sent their families to the greater safety of salisbury the dispossessed nuns had found shelter at the nearby nunnery in amesbury most of the townspeople though had nowhere to go and so they kept indoors as much as possible watched the slow progress of stephens castle and prayed that once it was done he and his men would ride off and leave them in peace but as soured as their luck seemed to them that june it was about to get far worse the first day of july got off to a bumpy start for stephen he had an uncomfortable audience with the abbess of st marys abbey and his charm and promises had not placated her in the least then one of their scouts reported that armed riders had been spotted to the north since the three closest castles in that directionludgershall marlborough and devizeswere all hostile stephen dispatched the earl of northampton and a contingent of ypress flemings to investigate and engage the enemy if need be he was just sitting down to dinner with his brother the bishop in the abbeys great hall when a bleeding youth burst in breathlessly gasping out his bad news as he stumbled toward them the earl of northampton had run into trouble for the force was larger than theyd expected theyd skirmished with the enemy and were attempting to retreat back toward the town but they needed help and fast by then chairs were being shoved back trenchers pushed aside within moments the hall had been emptied of all save the bishop his clerics and servants the other men were already out the door shouting for their horses galloping out of the abbey precincts stephen led his men up east street and onto the road north it was a hot day the sun at its zenith for it was almost noon and their horses kicked up clouds of dry choking dust stephen could feel sweat trickling down his ribs and even before the town receded into the distance his head had begun to throb under the weight of his helmet fighting in the heat of high summer was almost as debilitating as a winter campaign but he was usually impervious to the discomforts of weather and he wondered if he was beginning to feel the aches and woes of age after all he was fortyseven now and his youth was long gone im getting too old for all this excitement he said wryly to william de ypres but the fleming who seemed as ageless to stephen as wiltshires eternal oaks merely glanced over at him with a bemused frown his every thought already focused upon the coming conflict and then they heard it the clamor of fighting up ahead spurring their horses they charged forward they came upon a scene of chaos and impending catastrophe northampton and his men were in retreat with their foes in close pursuit holy christ stephen breathed for he knew at once what he was seeing this was no foray into hostile territory no scouting expedition to test wiltons defenses he was facing an enemy army and even before he saw it he knew whose banner they were flying only one man could have assembled a large fighting force with such deadly speed and accuracyjust as hed done at lincoln ypres had come to the same appalled conclusion god smite him he swore it is that misbegotten hellspawn gloucester stephen hastily unsheathed his sword by now northamptons men were almost upon them within moments theyd been sucked into the battle there was so much confusion that men struck down their own comrades by mistake for it was no easy task identifying the enemy in the midst of a maelstrom dust clogged their throats stung their eyes and the glare of the sun on the metal of chain mail and swords was blinding horses reared up savaged one another as they collided and when they fell dragged their riders down with them stephen was soon splattered with blood so far none of it was hisyet but they were outnumbered off balance and if defeat was still inconceivable it was also inevitable my liege youve got to get away whilst you still can william martel had fought his way to stephens side you cannot let them take younot again he is right although ypres was close enough to grab stephens arm he had to shout to make himself heard knowing stephens stubborn streak was apt to surface at the most inconvenient times he was already anticipating opposition and rapidly assessing the arguments most likely to convince scorning appeals to common sense or safety he chose to remind stephen instead that you promised your queen you vowed no more lincolns stephen realized the truth in their entreaties but flight was an alien instinct for his code of chivalry had always been long on gallantry short on realism his hesitation was almost fatal a shout went up one of recognition jesu the king there on the roan stallion ypres seemed almost ready to snatch at his reins and the other mans urgency prevailed over stephens own doubts swinging his destrier about he gave the command to retreat as stephen raced his qualms and his enemies back toward wilton his steward flung himself into the breach fighting a desperate rearguard action to save his king from capture just as robert had done for maude at the le strete crossing because of william martels courageous doomed stand stephen and ypres and the others were able to reach wilton by the time robert had fought his way into the town it was too late wilton was afire and stephen was gone robert refused to believe it at his urging his men fanned out through wiltons narrow streets and lanes forcing their way into homes shops and churches they concentrated their search upon the commandeered nunnery and soon flushed out fugitives from the battle they dragged out sanctuary seekers from the towns eight churches infuriating the parish priests and they discovered coffers and chests for the plundering at the abbey belongings left behind by stephen and his men but they could only confirm the worst of roberts fears that stephen had indeed escaped at the guildhall robert was timidly accosted by wiltons leading merchants seeking to deter him from taking out his anger upon their town in case he was so inclined they were much relieved to find that he was not although the damage donedeliberate or notwas already considerable a number of the houses were in flames and his soldiers had engaged in some selective looting even as they pursued the hunt for stephen the merchants eager to curry favor with their new conqueror were able to provide eyewitness accounts of stephens flight he had ridden into the town at a flatout gallop they reported pausing only to warn the bishop of his peril he and the fleming and the earl of northampton had then raced off down the road to the south with the bishop and his retainers not far behind they were not sparing their horses could not long maintain such a killing pace they predicted but robert spurned their crumbs of comfort for he knew stephens brother had a castle less than ten miles away at downton where they could obtain fresh mounts he went through the motions sending john marshall off in pursuit but it was an empty gesture and he knew it stephen had only to avoid the main roads then circle back and head for safety at winchester hed had his chance and it had come to nothing in time hed accept the loss with grudging gracebut not now not yet miles was herding prisoners into the marketplace arguing all the while with several indignant priests at sight of robert the bolder of the two strode over to lodge a complaint against this breach of sanctuary robert responded for once not as a diplomat but as a hunter robbed of his prey and he rebuffed the priest with a brusque reminder that not all churches could claim the right of sanctuary the priest retreated but his banner was snatched up then by a new adversary no less determined my lord earl a word with you the voice was educated peremptory female and furious bearing down upon him was a tall stately nun garbed in the stark black of the benedictine order coming at such a brisk pace that her flowing garments and wimple caught the wind giving him the incongruous image of a ship under full sail he knew without being told that this was the abbess a woman with a legitimate grievance but he was in no mood to hear her out and he started to turn away leaving ranulf to mollify her if he could hed taken but a few steps though before he heard his name echoing across the square and this was a voice so familiar that he spun around in astonishment hed not noticed the second nun as ranulf deftly intercepted the abbess her companion cried out again robert wait he did for she was family hawise fitz hamon his wifes younger sister what are you doing here he demanded we heard all the nuns had been moved to the convent at amesbury i came back with the abbess hoping to shame the king into returning our abbey to us what we got for our pains though were smiles and fair words and nowwith your men swarming over the nunnery like bees at a hive i shudder to think what we will find we need to fight the fires you started if the town and abbey are not to burn to the ground it is being done he said and she turned saw that ranulf was indeed responding to the abbesss demand but she did not seem satisfied continuing to glare at her brotherinlaw arms akimbo chin jutting out looking eerily like amabel camouflaged for some unlikely reason as a nun it will take our nunnery years to recover from this outrage she said angrily and he reminded her no less sharply that the abbeys adversity was stephens doing for he was the one whod seized it for his own purposes of course stephen is at fault she snapped but what does that matter now with our town in flames and the abbey plundered look around you robert at what you and stephen have brought to wilton what did we do to deserve this misery you think that burnedout wainright cares whether the crown goes to stephen or maude i assure you his only worry is how he is going to feed his family now that his shop has been gutted ask the draper in frog lane his shelves plucked bare and every scrap of cloth stolen ask my sisters in christ forced to take refuge in amesbury whilst gods acre is turned into a killing ground hawise enough innocents suffer in war you think i do not know that i sympathize but sympathy makes a poor gruel robert fills no empty stomachs just tell me this in all honesty how much longer is this accursed war to continue i thought he said bitterly to end it here and nowat wilton suppose you answer a question for me sister hawise tell me why the almighty chose to let stephen escape to let the war go on she looked at him in silence having no answer for him but hed not expected one as hot and dry as july was august was even more parched and scorching a people usually starved for sun now had too much of it and the crops began to wither in the fields to a troubled lawless land came new woes in this eighth year of stephens reigna fear of famine matilda was walking across the garth toward westminsters abbey church accompanied by cecily and her confessor christian the subject was one dear to her heart the distribution of alms to christs poor but she found herself increasingly distracted for eustace and constance were quarreling again they had the sense to keep their voices low but matilda could still hear more than she wanted to constances usual weapon was silence a tactical retreat into an inner fortress where eustace could not follow but this afternoon she was speaking up insisting stubbornly i did not yes you did eustace countered with the certainty he brought to all issues and matilda shot them a warning glance over her shoulder she did not seek though to learn the nature of their quarrel for she well knew they disagreed over trifles their arguments were superficial their differences so deep they burned to the bone eustace was thirteen now constance a year older and they were getting dangerously close to the day she dreaded the day when they were old enough to share a bed as man and wife she already knew the marriage was a mistake consummation would be throwing clods of dirt upon the coffin eustace there was so much alarm in constances cry that matilda spun around half fearful of what she would see but for once eustace was not the cause of his young wifes dismay she was staring across the garth at the men just emerging into the sunlight her blonde fairness fading into an ashen greyish pallor eustace pulled her in behind him at once protective and defiant for in this alone were they utterly united in their shared loathing for geoffrey de mandeville mandeville never even noticed them he was carrying on an intense angry conversation with william de warenne but he broke off at sight of matilda and strode toward her i am glad you are here madame mayhap you can talk some sense into the king matildas reply was icy enough to defy the oppressive august heat it is not my place to question the judgment of the kings grace my lord earl mandeville did not have the sort of incendiary temper that started so many fires for the earl of chester but it burned deep if not hot and matilda suspected that he stored away grievances for kindling his dark eyes narrowing he said with lethal courtesy correct me if my theology is flawed madame but i was taught that infallibility is an attribute of the pope not the king of england the temptation to lash back was a strong one but matilda had never lacked for control she could wait her pressing need now was to learn the cause of his anger fortunately a more reliable source was approaching and she hastened to intercept william de ypres so they could speak together in private with the candor queens were rarely allowed ypres was no less provoked than geoffrey de mandeville and he did not keep matilda in suspense we finally heard from robert of gloucester damn his soul he has offered to ransom william martelfor sherborne castle oh no he nodded bleakly without sherborne we cannot hope to challenge gloucesters hold upon the western shires it is too great a price to pay for any one man but your husband god save him means to pay it and i doubt that even you madame can talk him out of it i am not sure matilda confessed that i would want to try we owe william martel so much willem if not for him stephen would have been captured for certes how can we turn our backs on him now a king owes other debts too madameto his supporters to the men whove fought and bled for him and to the subjects he rules ill not pretend that i care tuppence for the english people but i know that you and the king do and yielding sherborne castle will prolong the war even stephen admits as much what would you have him do willem abandon the man who sacrificed himself so he could escape you know stephen could never do that yes i do knowand so does gloucester but why does the cup always have to be brimming over or empty why will half measures never suffice offer a lesser ransom for martel one we can afford to lose and in time gloucester will let him go a year or two in confinement against the loss of sherborneid say that was a fair bargain but youd not have to pay it willem if you were the one being held in a bristol dungeon can you honestly say youd not want stephen to offer the sun and moon for your release of course i would he said impatiently but i am not the king of englandam i it seems to me madame that we had this same conversation once before in a guildford chapel more than two years ago not much has changed since then has it that hawk still will not hunt matilda found stephen in the church standing before the tomb of the sainted confessor the last but one of the saxon kings hed just lit a candle but at sound of her familiar footsteps he turned so abruptly that the flame guttered out when she was almost close enough to touch he said softly i have to do this tilda i cannot let will barter his freedom for mine i know do you think i am wrong she was silent for some moments considering as your wife i would gladly give a dozen sherbornes to gain wills release as your queen i have doubts it is a difficult decision stephen and i am glad it is not mine to make stephen reached out to her then entwined her fingers in his it was not difficult for me you must understand that for me it was an easy choice for it was the only choice i know she said again and coming into his arms she clung tightly resting her cheek against his chest as she sought to comprehend the ultimate irony she who had no irony at all in her soul that the qualities she most loved in stephen were the very ones that were crippling his kingship tower of london october geoffrey de mandeville had lost track of time could not be sure how long hed been held as a prisoner in the stronghold that had so recently been his on those rare occasions when his rage receded enough for calculation he thought it must be nigh on a fortnight for it had been michaelmas week when hed arrived at st albans for the kings council unsuspecting that he was riding into an ambush he still felt a sense of disbelief remembering that moment when the king had turned upon him without warning ordering his arrest hed not even been able to resist for stephen had managed to separate him from his men before springing the trap of course stephen was now in trouble with the church for the arrest had taken place within the abbey grounds and the outraged abbot had viewed this as sacrilege but he could take little consolation from that for hed been dragged off to london in chains forced to order his garrison at the tower to submit and then thrown into one of his own dungeons and now he waited alone in the darkness for the king to decree his fate his world in ruins and nothing to sustain him but his hatred when he was brought before them dirty and unkempt blinking like a barn owl in the sudden surge of sunlight matilda was taken aback could this pitiful wretch of a prisoner and the elegant prideful earl of essex be one and the same what shocked her even more than how far hed fallen was the joy she took in it moving to her husbands side she stared coldly at geoffrey de mandeville as he was shoved to his knees before them stephen was experiencing the same unfamiliar emotion satisfaction in an enemys suffering you do not look as if youve enjoyed your stay here at the tower my lord earl but then i doubt that my daughterinlaw enjoyed her stay either mandevilles eyes were gradually adjusting to the light and when he blinked now it was in surprise is that what all this is aboutthe little french lass no harm came to her i saw to that so i imposed my hospitality upon her for a whilewhat of it that seems a minor sin indeed when compared to some of the other betrayals youve forgiven including those of your own brother youd need a tally stick to keep count of all the times he has switched sides stephen scowled and so did matilda and william martel but the gibe did find an appreciative audience of one a laugh floated from the window seat where william de ypres was comfortably sprawled whittling upon a stick of white beech his amusement seemed genuine but his blade flashed all the while paring the wood down to splinters had you betrayed only me stephen said i might have forgiven you but you wronged my wife and constance and there can be no forgiveness for that geoffrey de mandeville said nothing merely glanced toward matilda and then away but that look brief as it was was chilling in its intensity its malevolence for until that moment matilda had not known what it was like to be an object of hatred if i pleased myself id keep you caged here at the tower till you rotted but you are luckier than you deserve stephen said coolly for a number of your fellow barons have argued for clemency and so i have decided to offer you a choice if you cooperate i will set you free mandeville shifted awkwardly for stephen had not given him permission to rise and his calf muscles were cramping and what will thiscooperation of mine cost youve already yielded the tower surrender as well your castles at pleshy and saffron walden and ill give you your freedom mandeville took time to think it over as if seeking to convince someoneif only himselfthat there was an actual decision to be made when he nodded stephen gestured and the guards jerked him to his feet ive a word of warning for you he said and youd best take it to heart youll be getting no second chances mandeville paused at the door balking when the guards would have pushed him through you may be sure he said to stephen that i will remember once mandeville was gone stephen took matildas hand and steered her toward the settle a pity henry was not here to see that he said surprising them all for he did not often express a yearning for his brothers company but the bishop had made possible geoffrey de mandevilles downfall and stephen was grateful in a maneuver as guileful as it was adroit henry had contrived to have the hostile bishop of ely charged with church irregularities thus compelling him to journey to rome to defend himself with the bishop of ely absent from england stephen no longer needed mandeville to keep peace in bishop nigels fenlands and hed at last been able to punish the earl as he deserved the reckoning had been no less gratifying for being so belated and stephen knew his brother would have enjoyed it immensely but henry too was now on the way to rome seeking to persuade the new pope to reappoint him as a papal legate an even more unlikely source now echoed stephens regrets i wish the bishop were here too william de ypres said for id wager that hed have agreed with methat geoffrey de mandeville ought not to have seen the light of day again in this lifetime are you still fretting about that will i am my liege i know you think youve pulled his fangs by taking the tower and his strongholds away from him but a defanged snake is still a snake and my experience says you kill it when you can you do not let it slither away just because all the other snakes are pleading for mercy stephen slanted an amused glance in the flemings direction i do not think my barons would like your calling them snakes willscales and forked tongues notwithstanding i am not jesting my lord king why do you think hugh bigod and the others were so keen to speak up for mandeville you think any of that lot would truly care if you hanged him higher than haman they do not want you to punish mandeville too harshly because they fear that the next time it might be one of them whose doubledealing comes to light your view of mankind is bleak enough to disturb even the devil stephen joked i am not denying that there is some truth in what you say even mandevilles vere and clare kindred do not seem overly fond of him and ill not deny either that they get downright disquieted at the prospect of one of their own being treated like any other felon or brigand but no man ever died from the bite of a toothless snake will what trouble could he stir up now he cannot go crawling off to maude not after his betrayal at winchester that lady is far less forgiving than i am and all of christendom well knows it i cannot argue with anything youve said ypres admitted i can only tell you that when i first learned to hunt i was taught that if you go after dangerous preylike wild boaryou never strike unless you are sure your blow can kill sometimes it is enough matilda interjected for a blow to maim willem and the fleming did not demur but neither was he convinced and because they knew that the disgraced earls presence seemed to linger on in their midst long after hed been returned to his prison cell nature that year was unrelenting an arid sweltering summer had brought a poor harvest to a land already ravaged by four years of war and to add to the miseries of the english people winter came early even for november the weather was unusually wretched day after day of icy downpours gusting winds and sleet by early december the first snow of the season had blanketed half the country and annora was thankful when the walls of lincoln at last came into view for there a hot meal a soft bed and a lovers embrace awaited her ranulf had been awake since dawn cocooned in coverlets blissfully content to lie abed on this frigid december morn watching the young woman asleep in his arms it was easy to pretend they were snowbound that the world beyond the boundaries of his chamber did not exist easy to convince himself that their love affair was a secret from even the castle servants for annoras bed was in mauds chamber and who but maud would know where she really slept it was always easy to hold on to his hopes while holding on to annora too it was even possible to forget the living breathing impediment to their union annoras husbandalmost annora stirred eventually giving him a sleepy smile i love waking up with you she murmured leaning over to claim a kiss but i almost did not get to come for gervase was uneasy about my being out on the roads even with mauds escort ranulf frowned any mention of her husband however fleeting or casual was sure to sour his mood because of geoffrey de mandevilles arrest he asked and when she nodded he drew her in against him propping pillows behind their heads it is passing strange annora stephen reached manhood at my fathers court had ample opportunities to learn the lessons of kingship from a master whatever his other failings papa understood the uses and perceptions of power and his mistakes were few indeed he knew how to handle men whereas stephenwith the best will in the world he just lurches from one blunder to another because he arrested mandeville at his court the way he did with the bishops of ely salisbury and lincoln i grant you that does make him a dubious host annora teased but why is that so damaging to his kingship because it makes men think he cannot be trusted because it makes him look weak be fair ranulf no onenot even your sistercould fault stephens courage nor do i i said men think him a weak king not a cowardly one i am not saying that mandeville did not deserve to be arrested but there was something sly about the way it was done that might not matter if men respected stephen as they did my father but they do not annora for they do not fear himand fear and respect are horns on the same goat annora was rapidly regretting ever having brought the topic up for she had no interest in hearing ranulf hold forth upon the flaws in stephens kingship she got enough of that from her husband who was increasingly disillusioned with his kings failure to end the war can we not talk of something besides politics i would much rather hear about the doings in winchester for she added hopefully was there not some sort of scandal involved the recent calamity in winchester was a sore subject with all of maudes partisans but ranulf knew how much annora loved gossip and so he overcame his reluctance told her the rather sad and sordid story of william pont de larche his young fickle wife and the flemish mercenary robert fitz hildebrand the former castellan of winchesters royal castle had taken advantage of the wilton debacle to regain control of the stronghold and then appealed to maude and robert for aid theyd dispatched hildebrandto their eternal regretfor welcomed as an ally by william pont de larche hed promptly set about seducing the latters wife and with her connivance his men overpowered the castle garrison cast the cuckolded husband into his own dungeon and then struck a deal with the bishop and stephen all in all it was a sorry tale a deplorable commentary upon the way this war was unraveling the countrys moral fabric and annora found it highly entertaining how do you know this robert fitz hildebrand seduced the castellans wife mayhap she was the one seduced him she suggested impishly and then demonstrated that she was not lacking in seduction skills herself they kissed and rolled laughing to the very edge of the bed where they kissed again but then annora bolted upright and let out a piercing scream a rat ranulf a rat bit my hair as he started to look she grabbed his arm waitget your sword first she insisted and then indignantly ranulf why are you laughing because he said youre about to meet a rare norse rat and she peered cautiously over the edge of the bed frowning at sight of the dog looking gravely back at her i knew no rat would dare venture into the chamber with loth here hes the best hunter of shadows sons i once saw him take down a deer all by himself ranulf bragged reaching out to ruffle the dyrehunds thick fur when your hair swung down he probably thought you were playing with him tell him please that i was playing with you and three are not wanted in this game annora frowned again she liked dogs but there was something unnerving about this ones unblinking stare what did you call himloth wherever did you get an outlandish name like that she was at once sorry shed asked for shed unwittingly given ranulf an opportunity to expound upon one of his more peculiar passionshis love of reading it was called the history of the kings of britain he informed her written by an augustinian canon named geoffrey of monmouth and dedicated to robert the book was the most remarkable one hed ever read tracing english history back through the ages hed especially fancied the story of arthur king of the britons the people known today as the welsh hed gotten loths name from the book he explained loth was arthurs brotherinlaw and with arthurs help hed become king of norway so what better name for a norwegian dyrehund annora agreed politely that loth was indeed an inspired choice only half listening for she neither shared nor understood ranulfs enthusiasm for books her brothers had been taught to read and writeagainst their willfor her father had an almost monkish respect for education when shed wanted to learn too jealously intent upon following in her brothers footsteps hed indulged her as always even though their priest had insisted that women had no need for worldly knowledge shed soon lost interest would not have persevered had ranulf not come into her life when he did ranulf who truly took pride in being able to wield a pen like a common clerk now of course annora was thankful for her education scanty as it was for her rudimentary skills enabled her to write to ranulf and to read his letters but as he continued to extol the virtues of this geoffrey of monmouths book with its oddly named heroesbrutus arthur merlin lothher eyes glazed over and her jaw began to ache from the yawns she was suppressing not wanting ranulf to know he was boring her she took diversionary measures with such success that they soon attracted loths attention puzzled and protective the big dog rose to his feet head cocked to the side as he tried to make sense of the strange noises coming from the bed not moving away until he had satisfied himself that all this sudden thrashing about did not put his master in peril ranulf and annoras idyllic stay at lincoln castle came to an abrupt end the next day with the unexpected arrival of mauds husband their unease was soon dissipated though for it was apparent that chester had no recollection of ever having met annora before ranulf of course he did remember greeting the younger man with a caustic you here again it is well that you are mauds uncle or else i might start wondering why you seem to be underfoot all the time but the insult was offhand he had weightier matters on his mind than baiting ranulf set the servants to packing what you need he instructed his wife for i am taking you back to cheshire and i want to depart on the morrow ranulf and annora were dismayed maud irked why she demanded and chester scowled it ought to be enough for you that i say so his complaint was perfunctory though for he was in suspiciously high spirits maud regarded him warily knowing from past experience that he was never so cheerful as when contemplating the troubles of others and indeed his black eyes were agleam with the perverse pleasure that people so often take in being the bearer of bad news like ancient egypt we have a plague loosed upon us he declared dramatically geoffrey de mandeville has rebelled his revelation was fully as explosive as hed hoped and he found himself fending off questions faster than arrows if youll all stop talking at once he protested ill tell you what i know mandeville took advantage of bishop nigels absence to seize the isle of ely and capture aldreth castle he then advanced upon ramsey drove the monks out and took over their abbey do you truly think hed dare to lay siege to lincoln castle randolph maud asked skeptically and he shook his head not likely but until stephen tracks the whoreson down therell be a lot of bodies found floating in the fens it is an outlaws eden a murky deadly maze of salt marshes and quagmires and bogs if stephen goes in after mandeville hell never come out chester predicted and smiled at the thought well i am flattered maud murmured half mockingly half flirtatiously that you were so concerned about my safety no one takes what is mine he said be it a lamb a wife a sack of flour from my mill a felled tree from my woods let mandeville steal and plunder all he pleases on his way to hell but if he makes me his enemy he is an even greater fool than stephen no lass better you should keep to cheshire and away from the fens until mandevilles body is rotting on a gallows for all to see what befalls rebels there will be no peace in these parts nothing but blood and tears and the wailing of widows it was a phrase that seemed to echo out of scriptures trailing a whiff of fire and brimstone but what startled ranulf was not that chester was prophesying ruin and perdition it was that he appeared to relish the prospect ranulf felt repelled when he realized why that the earl of chester saw geoffrey de mandevilles mad doomed rebellion as an opportunity in bloody guise a chance to set his own snares and pursue his own prey while stephen hunted in the fens the next day chester and the women departed at first light with a formidable armed escort but ranulf was not among them for a messenger had arrived soon after chester did bearing urgent word for annora her husband had heard too of mandevilles rebellion and lincoln was too close to the fenlands for his peace of mind if the countess of chester would be good enough to provide annora with an escort again gervase would meet her along the route maud dispatched a courier to let gervase fitz clement know that she and annora would be heading west in the earls company suggesting that they rendezvous at coventry gervases letter vexed ranulf even more than his disappointment at having their tryst cut so short it was as if the man had reached across the miles to claim annora as his own and he had to stand aside and let it happen nor could he accompany them on their westward journey for he dared not risk gervases learning that hed been in annoras company even the most complacent trusting husband would not accept happenchance as the explanation upon finding his wife with the man shed been pledged to wed annora and maud were both uneasy about his striking out on his own but ranulf had a more potent armor than his chainmail hauberkthe invincibility of youthand hed assured them that hed keep to the main roads take no needless risks and send word straightaway upon his safe arrival at devizes he set out the day after their departure taking the fosse way toward newark there he would follow the road south to grantham where he would swing off onto the crosscountry road that would take him through leicester coventry and on to gloucester the roads were even worse than hed expected for temperatures had plunged and treacherous ice patches were not always noticeable until it was too late it had taken ranulf a full day to travel the fourteen miles to newark and as he left the town behind the following morning the sky was overcast as leaden and bleak as his mood more snow seemed in the offing but he hoped hed be able to reach grantham before the weather turned truly foul even in winter there should have been travelers on the road but it was virtually deserted he covered more than five miles without seeing another soul loth had ranged off into the bushes having caught an enticing scent and ranulf halted his palfrey giving it a rest until the dog returned gazing at the empty stretch of road he found himself worrying just how serious this rebellion of geoffrey de mandevilles was fear was clearly on the prowl he was not sure at first what hed heard and he tilted his head listening intently it came again and this time he had no doubtsit was a scream turning his stallion about he followed the sound into a copse of trees off to the side of the road he came out onto a frozen meadow where a hunt was on the quarry though was not deer or rabbit two men were trying to run down a young girl there was a second child too but the men had no interest in him and when he slipped on the ice and fell they veered around him continuing their pursuit of the girl shed been attempting to reach the woods but the snow was hampering her flight and they were gaining on her with every stride when she risked a glance over her shoulder she dodged suddenly making a desperate detour out onto the ice of a small pond the men halted at the edge cursing for the ice would never support their weight as light as the girl was the surface was creaking ominously under her feet the men swore again for by the time they circled the pond she would have gotten into the woods where it would not be so easy to find her at first glimpse one of the men bore a superficial resemblance to gilbert for he was a redhead too and tall enough to look down upon most men his partner in crime was lean and spare and dark lacking either the redheads brawn or his conspicuous coloring but he was the dominant of the two as the redhead continued to stand at the ponds edge thwarted and fuming he swung back toward the boy the child was just getting to his feet pouncing upon him before he could scramble out of reach the man stopped his struggles with a blow across the face and then crooked his arm around the boys throat shouting youd best come back girl or ill snap the whelps neck in two by god i will the girl looked back and froze on the ice steps away from safety the boy squirmed bit the hand clamped over his mouth and cried run jennet he paid a price in pain for that kicked futilely as he was snatched off his feet and then gagged as the pressure on his windpipe increased the girls face was contorted in horror she seemed unable to move and the man grinned sensing victory if you care about the cub he warned you get over here now jerking his head toward his partner he said go around the pond so you can head her off if she runs for the woods the redhead was accustomed to taking orders and was starting to obey when he caught movement from the corner of his eye he turned and his jaw dropped open he wasted several precious seconds staring eyes wide and mouth ajar as ranulfs stallion raced toward them before blurting out holy jesus ned behind you the man called ned was of a different mettle than the befuddled redhead the shock of seeing an armed knight bearing down upon him must have been considerable but his reaction was instantaneous without hesitation he threw the child into the path of the oncoming stallion ranulf yanked on the reins and the palfrey swerved with not a foot to spare but the horses sudden plunge carried it onto a glaze of icedover snow it skidded started to slide sideways and went down ranulf flung himself from the saddle and was fortunate enough to land in a snowdrift for a heartstopping moment he could not see where his sword had fallen then spotted it ensnared in a hawthorn hedge the prickly spines inflicted deep scratches upon his wrist and hand as he snatched it out but that was the least of his problems for the men were almost upon him he was surprised at their boldness for hed had a few encounters with brigands of their ilk and they invariably backed off from any confrontation with a knight preferring easier prey they may have been enraged over the loss of the girl for both children had seized their chance to flee or they may have been hungry enough for ranulfs horse and trappings to forget caution whatever their motivation they were closing in fast and he got a second nasty surprise for they were betterarmed than hed expected the big redhead had a roughhewn wooden club studded with nails and ned had a sword an unusual weapon for one of these outcast masterless men it was a basic tenet of faith with men of ranulfs class that a knight trained in the ways of war since boyhood could easily vanquish lesser foes as much a belief in the superiority of blood and breeding as in the benefits of battle lore and killing competence ranulf had accepted this comforting conviction too but no one seemed to have told his assailants that they were inferior adversaries the thrust he aimed at ned should have been lethal it never connected though for ned parried the blow with startling skill whatever he was now hed once been a soldier for no man handled a sword like that by chance moreover they understood the concept of teamwork and only ranulfs quick reflexes saved him when they bore in again fending off ned he whirled just as the redhead swung his club unlike them he had the protection of chain mail but had that blow landed it would have broken bones instead he was the one to draw blood not a mortal wound but the redhead yelped and sprang backward so hastily that he nearly fell ranulf could not take advantage of it though for the other man was circling ready to strike theyd taken his measure too were more wary now the redhead in particular seemed leery of getting within range of ranulfs blade they backed off a bit talking strategy not realizing that ranulf understood them for unlike many of normanfrench descent he spoke englishnot well but enough to get by while they were planning their next move he retreated slowly toward the closest tree he was ready for them when they attacked again and they were forced to pull back cursing and bleeding but he was bleeding too and his fall had done more damage than hed first thought for his knee was stiffening up slowing him down panting his sword poised for their next assault he realized that he was in the fight of his life and the odds were not in his favor the children were nowhere to be seen probably long goneif they were wise his horse was not in view either and the distant road was still desertednot that any passersby were likely to have intervened but he saw then that there was one about to join the fray for loth had backtracked to find him and was coming now at a run a dark streak against the snow silent and swift hackles up as fearful and blessed a sight as ever filled ranulfs eyes the dog made no sound but alerted by instinct perhaps the redhead started to turn just as loth launched his attack the man yelled but had no time to react for the dyrehund was already upon him as the animal leapt at him he recoiled slipped on the ice and went over backward his next scream was one of pain for loth had clamped his powerful jaws upon the redheads thigh shaking the mans body to and fro as if he were prey as ranulf had seen him attack deer when the redhead shrieked ned whirled in his direction it was a natural reaction but one that doomed him for in the brief moment that he was distracted by the dog ranulf lunged burying his blade in the other mans back neds knees buckled ranulfs second thrust all but decapitated him and blood spurted out like a crimson fountain splattering ranulf with gore swinging his sword up ranulf turned then to aid loth but the dog had no need of assistance the redheads screams were mingling now with the dyrehunds fierce guttural growling hed dropped his club when hed fallen and had tried then to kick the dog away loth released his hold upon the mans mangled thigh and seizing an ankle began a promising effort to cripple his quarry unable to break free of those ravening jaws and razor teeth the man was writhing in pain as he desperately tried to reach his club which lay tantalizingly close but just beyond his groping fingers ranulf kicked the club into the bushes then reached down and dragged loth off it took the man a moment to realize he was no longer under attack and he continued to claw the snow for his club kicking feebly at a dog who was no longer there ranulf was having trouble restraining loth even when he pulled the dyrehund up onto his hind legs the dog did not desist his struggles choking and snarling as he fought to get back to his kill the redhead had now scrabbled to his hands and knees his breath coming in wheezing gasping sobs somehow he lurched to his feet screaming anew as pain jolted through his crushed ankle hobbling stumbling weaving like a drunkard he fled in terror leaving a blotched and bloody trail across the snow hed not get far ranulf had seen the terrible gaping wound the shredded flesh of the mans thigh reaction now set in and ranulf started to shake still clutching loths collar he sank to his knees blood was everywhere splashed across the front of his hauberk caking his boots the churnedup snow was bright red and loths silver muzzle seemed to have been dipped in scarlet so had his chest the dyrehund was trembling too he whimpered and nuzzled ranulf smearing blood across ranulfs cheek and into his beard ranulf pulled the dog closer wrapped his arms around loths heaving sides and held tight when loth growled ranulf raised his head automatically reaching again for his sword hilt the boy was standing ten feet away poised to take flight ranulf guessed he was about nine or so but small for his age reedthin and meagre he seemed all eyes they dominated the pinched little face a striking shade of bluegreen glassy with shock he looked at the body swallowed and asked is he dead yes and the otherthe one the dog bit most likely hell bleed to death ranulf said honestly the boy was quiet for a moment staring at loth good he said and then recoiled when ranulf seemed about to rise he did not go far though backing off a few more prudent feet are you bad hurt no not bad ranuld said and waited feeling as if he were trying to tame some wild woodland creature ready to bolt at any moment why the child asked suddenly why did you help us ranulf considered several different answers and then twitched a shoulder in a halfshrug i had nothing better to do the boys eyes widened even further but he seemed to take reassurance from the joke for he slowly edged closer i am simon he said solemnly and after ranulf introduced himself and loth with equal gravity simon held out a small fist for the dyrehund to sniff in view of what the child had watched the dog do ranulf thought that was a commendable act of courage simon peered intently into ranulfs face then glanced back at loth we know where your horse is he said unexpectedly it ran into the woods and its reins snagged on a bush my sister found it ranulf wondered why they hadnt tried to catch the stallion for themselves and then realized that to these children a horse would be as exotic an animal as an elephant he still did not know why they were out here alone but did not doubt that he was looking at the sort of poverty hed rarely encountered simons clothes were so ragged they showed glimpses of skin and his worn leather shoes were held together with cord getting stiffly to his feet ranulf said can you take me to the horse the child nodded but hesitated no longer meeting ranulfs gaze he asked do you have any food adding quickly not for me for jennet yes i do ranulf said as matteroffactly as he could manage and with the child hovering just out of reach he limped across the meadow toward the woods even if hed had a shovel the ground was too hard to dig a grave so he left the body of the outlaw where it had fallen simon seemed to share his view that the man did not deserve a christian burial for the boy did not glance back either simons sister looked so like him that they might have been twins if not for the age difference she had the same vivid bluegreen eyes the same light hair of an indeterminate shade that was either a pale ashbrown or a dirtdarkened blonde and like him she bore the signs of malnourishment ranulf imagined she was about thirteen yet she was smaller than his nephew henry so frail and wan that he ached for her more than the boy she comprehended the full horror of what theyd been spared and he was impressed by the bravery shed shown in staying to watch the outcome of the battle he had bread and cheese in his saddlebag and they fell upon it ravenously with a hunger hed never known he waited until theyd devoured every crumb before asking what they were doing by themselves on the newarkgrantham road and got an answer that dismayed him they were on their way simon confided to their uncle jonas in cantebrigge god almighty you cannot be serious not only is cantebrigge at least eighty miles from here but it is less than twenty miles from ramsey abbey which has been seized by rebels you cannot go to cantebrigge anxiety had given his voice an angry edge and the children reacted with immediate fear backing away we are going to cantebrigge jennet cried we must and we will we will go ranulf hastily changed his tack i did not mean to shout he said soothingly while rapidly reviewing his options there was another ten miles or more to grantham newark was less than five speaking for myself ive never felt so battered or boneweary luckily i know an inn in newark where we can get a decent meal and mayhap even a bone for loth they conferred together speaking too swiftly for him to catch their words his grasp of english did not allow for nuances or even slurred speech when they turned back simon came forward until he was close enough to be grabbed it was ranulf recognized a declaration of trust weve nothing better to do he said with what was almost a smile ranulf had already attracted attention at the inn the preceding night a lone knight and a dog the likes of which none had seen before when he and the wolfdog returned drenched in gore and with two beggar children in tow he created a sensation but their curiosity was to remain unsatisfied for he offered no explanations and all that blood somehow discouraged prying the innkeeper was as amazed by ranulfs request for two rooms as he was by his alarming appearance a private room was an almost unheardof luxury except for the highborn it was usual for strangers to share not only a chamber but a bed and it seemed utterly bizarre to him that ranulf should want to squander a room upon bedraggled urchins who ought to be bedding down out in the stables with the lords fine palfrey he confined himself though to a timid protest which ranulf ignored for he thought jennet would be fearful sharing a room with anyone but her brother so soon after the thwarted rape as much as he needed a bath ranulf knew better than to ask for one not in a small shabby inn in the midst of winter the innkeeper was able to scrounge up some soft soap of mutton fat and wood ash and he washed himself as best he could with cold water and a burlap towel when the children crept downstairs to join him in front of the fire they were still filthy but so unselfconscious that he realized bathing was for them done only in summer if at all theyd shared their lives with him by now offered up in hesitant bits and pieces as theyd made the slow trek back to newark and the more theyd told him the less hed wanted to know simon and jennet were children of the fens having lived all of their brief years in the bleak isolation of the lincolnshire salt marshes more cloistered than in any convent their mother was long dead and jennet had insisted so vehemently that their father was a free man that ranulf knew he must have been a runaway villein a serf bound to the land their world had been a wattleanddaub hut out in the fens all they could say was that it had been north of sleaford there theyd dwelled just this side of starvation their father fishing for eels and sometimes taking water reeds into sleaford to sell for roof thatching but hed not taken them until ranulf had shepherded them through newarks streets theyd never seen a town as far as he could tell the only people they ever saw were other fishermen and their families mayhap an occasional peddleruntil the day the outlaws came they took turns relating the horrors of that day with the detached composure of emotional exhaustion how their father had sensed danger and sent them off into the marsh to hide how theyd waited out in the windripped bogs for their father to fetch them huddling together for warmth as gulls shrieked overhead and night came on how theyd seen the smoke and when they dared to venture back they found their home in flames and their fathers body sprawled by the hen roost the hens were gone of course as was the pig that was their prized possession and every scrap of food that jennet had salted away and stored for winter and whatever the brigands hadnt carried off had been burned in the fire they did not seem to know how long theyd lingered in the ruins and ranulf did not press them better such memories were mercifully blurred theyd buried their father and eventually hunger had driven them to undertake this lunatic quest of theirsto seek out their only kinsman their fathers younger brother jonas plying his trade as a tanner in the distant town of cantebrigge stretching his legs toward the fire ranulf massaged his aching knee and watched the children as they ate their fill probably for the first time in their lives it was a wednesday fast day but hed made a conscious decision to violate the prohibition against eating flesh he could always do penance once he got back to his own world now it seemed more important to feed simon and jennet the best meal he could and the innkeeper had served up heaping portions of salted pork a thick pottage of peas and beans and hot flat cakes of newly baked bread marked with christs cross to ranulf it was poor fare and he ended up sharing most of it with loth but simon and jennet savored every mouthful scorning spoons and scooping the food up with their fingers as if expecting to have their trenchers snatched away at any moment and ranulf learned more that night about hunger and need than in all of his twentyfive years what would become of them how could they hope to reach cantebrigge and if by gods grace they somehow did what if this uncle of theirs was not there theyd never seen the man knew only what their father had told them that soon after simons birth a peddler had brought them a message from jonas saying hed settled in cantebrigge that confirmed ranulfs suspicions two brothers fleeing serfdom one hiding out in the fens the other taking the bolder way for an escaped villein could claim his freedom if he lived in a chartered borough for a year and a day it was a pitiful family history an unwanted glimpse into a world almost as alien to ranulf as cathay but like it or not he was caught up now in this hopeless odyssey of abel the eelmans children in an unusually morose and pessimistic mood he wondered how many simons and jennets would be lost to the furies unleashed by geoffrey de mandevilles rebellion that was mere speculation though these ragged halfstarved orphans were all too real fleshandblood burdens weighing ever more heavily upon his peace of mind all through supper hed been silently debating his conscience seeking to convince himself that hed done what he could that he was not responsible for them but when the meal was done he heard himself saying reluctantly if you are truly set upon going to cantebrigge ill take you ranulf had been surprised and vexed that the children had not shown more enthusiasm for his offer it was no small sacrifice he was making after all for he had more to fear than mandevilles brigands cantebrigge was the kings borough and so were most of the towns theyd be passing through on their way south but the childrens acceptance had been subdued even wary and hed gone off to bed in a thoroughly bad humor in the morning though hed awakened to find simon and jennet asleep on the floor by his bed this journey was likely to be as expensive as it was dangerous it was already draining his purse he might have to stop at wallingford on his way west and borrow money from brien for hed had to buy a mule for the children and mantles too for their cloaks might better serve as kitchen rags hed already decided that ifgod willinghe ever got home again this cantebrigge detour was a secret hed share only with loth for he well knew that his misguided chivalry would make him a laughingstock who would ever understand why hed gone to so much trouble for the children of a runaway serf their pilgrimage was an excruciatingly slow one the children were fearful at first of riding the mule and even though they were traveling along the great north road it was rough going pitted and rutted by the winter weather moreover daylight hours were dwindling away dusk infiltrating now by late afternoon and in every town or village they ran into rumors of mandevilles depredations raiding throughout cambridgeshire up into lincolnshire he was spreading terror and laying waste to shires already suffering from famine hed gathered together a motley army his own vassals and tenants unemployed menatarms bandits lured to his banner by his promises of money and livestock and women all for the taking ranulf heard stories of pilgrims ambushed merchants robbed villages plundered and burned how much of it was true and how much was hearsay he had no way of knowing at grantham they were forced to stay over an extra day waiting out a freezing rainstorm when they finally reached stanford they were delayed again this time to find a barber for simon the boys jaw had begun to swell for he had a rotted tooth which should have been pulled months ago he bore the pain in good spirits though and carefully tucked away his yanked tooth as a keepsake in truth both children were starting to enjoy their first foray into the world beyond the fens they did not realize their danger so utterly had they come to trust in ranulfs protection and they were fascinated by the castle at stanford the timbered town houses of two stories their first market every day brought new and strange sights and each night an inn awaited them where thered be a warm fire and all the food they could eat and then a safe nights sleep on pallets in ranulfs chamber ranulf marveled at first that it took so little to content them until he realized that those whod had nothing expected nothing and he began to worry that he was unwittingly teaching them an unfair lessonto hunger for more than they could ever hope to get by their second week on the road they were in cambridgeshire and much too close to ramseys captured abbey for ranulfs comfort but at huntingdon they had a stroke of luck for they were able to join a caravan of merchants bound for london to sell their wares men whod banded together for protection against mandevilles cutthroats and their own fears they were more than happy to have ranulf ride with them the sword at his hip guaranteed his welcome they parted company at caxton the merchants continuing south ranulf and the children turning off onto the cantebrigge road there were fewer than ten miles to go now and his relief was considerable for hed heard a very disturbing tale from some of the londonbound merchantsthat mandeville had raided the town of st ives ranulf found that hard to believe for st ives was a prosperous borough site of a famed fair surely mandeville did not have enough men or enough nerve to attack a town rumor or not though it was unsettling and he was grateful that hed soon be able to turn his young charges over to their proper guardian what he would do if the uncle could not be found he did not know for that was a dilemma hed resolutely refused to address preferring to fall back upon his innate optimism but as those last few miles began to ebb away so did ranulfs confidence and he found himself struggling with a sudden sense of foreboding wondering what they would find in cantebrigge yet he never expected what awaited them around a bend in the road a sky full of smoke ordering the children to hide themselves until he returned he began a cautious investigation it was almost dusk but to the east the sky glowed and within a mile he knew whythe city of cantebrigge was afire the first structure to come into sight were the stone walls of the castle and then the rippling grey surface of the river granta the town lay just beyond wreathed in smoke ranulf had been in cantebrigge before during his fathers reign and as he looked now upon the charred and blackened shell off to his right he knew it had once been a church even remembered the name all saints by the castle reining in his stallion he stared at the ruins in shocked silence all saints was well away from the town flames could not have spread that far to have burned the church must have been deliberately torched he was close enough now to see people wandering about and it was like being back in the smoldering streets of winchester watching as dazed survivors stumbled about aimlessly in the wreckage of their lives loth growled softly looking up at ranulf with anxious eyes for the scent of death was in the air but it was then that ranulf noticed the castle portcullis was up and the gates ajar so it was over the dying was done the grieving only just begun ranulf did not want to go any farther to see any more there would be bodies in the rubble of those smoking houses and looted shops there would be bloodstains in the streets but no screaming or wailing not yet when grief came so suddenly the bereft were silent too stunned for tears hed been at lincoln at winchester at oxford he knew what hed find a slight stooped figure was trudging up the street toward the castle his priests cassock befouled with blood he seemed unaware of his surroundings but as he passed ranulf his step slowed and his aged eyes focused upon the younger mans face recognition was mutual and as dangerous as it might be ranulf did not deny it instead he swung from the saddle to stand in the street beside the old man chaplain for more years than he could remember at his fathers royal castle of cantebrigge father osmond he said are you injured the blood is not mine if the priest was surprised to encounter the old kings son in a town under stephens dominion he gave no sign of it i never thought he said to see such suffering to see the innocents struck down in gods sight there was killing even in the churches where people had fled for refuge he was far more feeble than ranulf remembered and he reached out put a steadying hand on the priests elbow when did this happen last night they came in the night like thieves but they came to kill some of the people were able to get into the castle but the othersthe ones caught in their houses their beds his mouth trembled he had a priests familiarity with death but not like this i looked upon evil lord ranulf we saw the devils work they showed no mercy forced householders to divulge where their valuables were hidden then cut their throats they plundered st radegunds nunnery and raped honest women in front of their husbands they deliberately burned churches and stole from god they spared neither the young nor the old nor the weak and their killing was wanton done for the sport of it and when they rode off they took all our livestock and they loaded carts with their plunder and they carried off women even some of the nuns i know war and this was not war not even the infidel saracens could be so cruel so deserving of damnation ranulf too had thought he knew war but never had he seen the sort of savagery the priest had just described an outlaw army composed of brigands and felons the very dregs of the gutter led by one who feared neither man nor god and if hed taken a different road he and jennet and simon might have run right into them who was it he said already knowing what the priest would say the devils spawn that son of perdition geoffrey de mandeville devizes castle england january the drawbridge was lowered at once for ranulf and by the time hed dismounted his squire was racing across the inner bailey where have you been my lord wed given up all hope of ever seeing you again i had my own doubts too luke but how did you know i was in trouble i did not tell my sister when id be returning the empress had a letter from the countess of chester lady maud was uneasy not having heard from you as promised and when you missed christmas we knew something was wrong the empress wanted to send men out to search for you but we did not know where to begin my lordmay i speak freely i do not know why you go off on these mysterious journeys of yours and it is obvious that you do not want meor anyone elseto know but i would take your secret to the grave that i pledge upon my honour and hopes of salvation in stephens england life has become too cheap for a man to venture out alone ranulf was touched and gave the younger man a quick smile although he avoided making luke any promises if youll take our mounts into the stable he said ill get the children inside where they can thaw out at that luke abandoned his polite pretense of ignoring his lords unlikely traveling companions but ranulf deflected his curiosity with a murmured ill tell you about it once ive seen my sister he led them toward the great hall simon and jennet keeping so close to ranulf that they were in danger of treading upon his heels theyd almost reached the door when his nephew came bursting through it i knew youd come back safe but mama has been fretting night and day over you uncle ranulf and shell likely scorch your ears for scaring us so of course if it was me id have gotten my rump blistered so youll be getting off easy ranulf laughed and ushered all three children into the hall over to the hearth he directed before adding harry i want you to look after simon and jennet whilst i seek out your mother hed become oddly protective of these orphans of the fens but he had no qualms now about entrusting them to henry his nephew had his share of swagger and was not one for backing down when challenged in bristol he and miless youngest son mahel had gone from being rivals to outright enemies after a roughandtumble game of hot cockles but as much as henry liked his own way he did not take unfair advantage of his privileged position as young as he was he seemed to understand that it was no more sporting to bully a servant than it would be to shoot a nesting bird and ranulf had concluded that a child was indeed more than the sum of his parents for he did not associate a sense of fair play with geoffrey nor with his sister either for all that he loved her you be on your best behavior with them harry for theyve never been in a castle before nor do they speak any french it is lucky then that ive learned a little bit of english ranulf was not deceived by the boys offhand mannerhe could recognize bragging in reverse when he saw itand he made sure that his nephew got the praise he was craving turning then to simon and jennet he switched over to stilted english this is my nephew the lord harry hell stay with you till i get back they could not hide their dismay at being separated from him even briefly but he knew theyd do as he bade them they were as trusting as loth and far more obedient there was no need though to hunt for maude she was already rushing into the hall a mantle hastily flung over her shoulders ranulf thank god i thought you were dead too a quick convulsive hug he could feel her trembling her tension she looked exhausted her skin stretched as taut as her nerves so pallid she might have just risen from a sickbed stepping back she still held on to his arm her fingers gripping hard enough to hurt why were you visiting maud in secret and why in gods name did you go off on your own like that where have you been cantebrigge he said simply and she went even paler before she could speak he drew her toward the hearth appropriating a couple of chairs i know weve much to say to each other and i am indeed sorry for worrying you but first there is a story i must tell you one id hoped to keep to myself i brought back companythose two scared fledglings harry has taken under his wing as concisely as possible he related then his adventures since encountering simon and jennet on the newarkgrantham road we finally reached cantebrigge he concluded on the day after mandevilles raid the town was still smoldering it was winchester all over again and i could find no one whod even heard of jonas the tanner if hed ever been there he was long gone he grimaced in remembered frustration soi took them back with me what else could i do maude they could never fend for themselves would soon starveif worse did not befall them and the people of cantebrigge had nothing to spare the last thing the town needed was more orphans he was talking faster than usual partly from embarrassment and partly to keep maude from interrupting until he was done so far shed listened in silence although shed occasionally shaken her head at the risks hed taken i thought he said that we could ask the priests in devizes and bristol for help they might know of a family willing to take simon and jennet in mayhap one whod lost a son he stopped in surprise as maude jumped to her feet i cannot talk about this she said sharply not now and before ranulf could react she spun away from him exiting the hall so rapidly that it was almost as if she were fleeing ranulf was nonplussed hed been braced for gibes and raillery knowing full well that few would understand his compassion for a runaway serfs children but hed counted upon maude to be more indulgent if only because women were taught to be tolerant of male folly the rebuff stung all the more then for being unexpected staring after maude ranulf started at the sound of uncle ranulf for hed not noticed as henry edged unobtrusively within eavesdropping range the boy looked unhappy much too mature for his years mama is not angry with you he said she has been grieving ever since we heard and jesu ranulf breathed for his sisters words had suddenly come back to him taking on a new and sinister significance i thought shed cried you were dead too ranulf started to speak had to swallow first who he asked hoarsely who died lad the earl of hereford miles ranulf sank back in the chair hed just vacated how i did not know he was ailing he was not he was slain on christmas eveby mischance hed gone hunting in dean forest and one of his companions misfired an arrow it hit him in the chest and he died there in the woods what a meaningless way to die it occurred to ranulf then that most deaths seemed meaningless these days for what greater good had the citizens of cantebrigge died may god forgive his earthly sins ranulf said softly hed never shared maudes fondness for miles but the political ramifications of his death were farreaching and dangerous hed been one of maudes most powerful and steadfast supporters one she could not afford to lose uncle ranulf there is more mama got a letter yesterday from my father he wants me to come back home ranulf sat upright and she agreed he asked too surprised for discretion not at first not until ii told her that i wanted to go henrys lashes swept down like shields but not in time and ranulf felt a wrenching pang of pity for the boy he wanted to assure henry that missing his father was no cause for guilt but he knew it was futile in this war of tangled and torn loyalties henrys conflicted battlefield was his heart simon and jennet had trailed timidly after henry and ranulf summoned them over you will be staying here for now he said and they nodded solemnly for they never asked questions their faith even stronger than their fear no one had ever shown such utter confidence in him it was both a great compliment and a great burden leaving them with henry he started to go after maude he stopped though before he reached the door he knew now what had sent her fleeing from the hallhis careless talk of losing a son shed not thank him for following her she was as shy of showing her pain in public as her tenyearold son but harry would outgrow his emotional skittishness for his sister it was too late stephen hastily gathered an army to put down geoffrey de mandevilles rebellion but mandeville refused to do battle and retreated deeper into the fens stephen set about erecting castles in an attempt to contain the bloodshed he then marched north in the hopes of catching the earl of chesters garrison off guard at lincoln castle for most of england it was neither a happy nor a peaceful spring maudes partisans were still mourning miles stephens supporters were troubled by his failure to bring geoffrey de mandeville to swift summary justice in yorkshire the earl of chester was pillaging the lands of the rival earl of york and in the fens the killing continued by may the royal gardens at westminster palace were in bloom and constance was able to pick an armful of primroses and daisies and violets intending to surprise her motherinlaw with the first bouquet of the season but she was the one who got the surprise for she found matilda in tears constance froze jolted by fear eustace had gone north with stephen to lincoln castle having persuaded his father that he was old enough at fourteen to witness his first siege but it never even occurred to constance that he might be in peril dropping the flowers she ran toward the bed maman what is wrong nothing has happened to papa stephen matilda sat up wiping away tears no child no the last i heard from stephen he and eustace were quite well although sorely vexed because the siege was going so poorly constance sighed with relief she might loathe her husband but she adored her inlaws felt far closer to them than to her own parents shed been just eight when her father died she remembered only a gross mountain of flesh a man grown so corpulent that he could no longer ride a horse or fit onto a throne known to the more irreverent of his subjects as louis le gros her mother had been a remote detached figure seldom seen and soon gone after quarreling with her lively and willful young daughterinlaw the dowager queen had conceded the field to eleanor withdrawing to her own dower estates and wedding again in unseemly haste while constance was fond of her brother the french king and dazzled by the siren hed married shed been on the periphery of their hectic whirlwind lives shed not learned what it was like to belong until shed come as a child bride to this alien land of england perching on the foot of the bed she asked shyly why then are you so sad i had bad news this morn the castle at rouen surrendered to geoffrey of anjou on the rd of april constance did not know what to say for surely matilda must have expected this the city itself had yielded back in january and all knew the castle would eventually fall too i suppose she ventured this means lord geoffrey will claim the duchy for himself he has already done so constanceand with the blessing and full consent of the french crown my brother has agreed to recognize him as duke butbut why because geoffrey agreed in his turn to cede gizors and the vexin to louis matilda said truthfully but tactlessly she at once regretted her candor for constance blushed deeply as if she were the one shamed by her brothers diplomatic doubledealing ii am so sorry maman she stammered and matilda hastily reached for her hand giving it a reassuring pat you have nothing to be sorry for child i am the one being foolish for i knew this day was coming i ought not to have let it disquiet me so but this bodes ill for england for any faltering hopes of peace even if stephen were able to drive maude and all her kith and kin into the sea that would not end the warnot now too many of stephens barons have holdings in normandy she did not elaborate nor did she need to constance understood with england and normandy now severed the english barons were confronted with a hard choice if they recognized geoffrey as their liege lord in normandy they risked having their english estates confiscated by stephen but if they balked at acknowledging geoffrey that would place their normandy lands in jeopardy loyalty to stephen kept matilda from admitting it but constance knew what she fearedthat men would conclude it was more dangerous to antagonize geoffrey than stephen do not fret maman papa stephen will win his war for surely the almighty must favor him over that shrewish woman and her accursed angevin husband back in paris all knew the angevin counts sprang from the devils loins papa stephen will prevail youll see hell have a long and peaceful reign andand by the time eustace follows him to the throne no one will even remember maudes name shed meant to offer comfort but matilda frowned and looked away and constance caught her breath stunned by what shed seen for an unguarded moment in her motherinlaws eyes she detested eustace and matilda loved him but they shared the same secret unease the same unspoken doubts about what kind of king eustace would be maude had seen little of robert and ranulf that summer theyd spent most of it in the saddle chasing after stephen after some skirmishing around malmesbury stephen had moved on to lay siege to the nearby castle at tetbury robert and miless eldest son roger had then swooped down upon tetbury but stephens outnumbered barons had refused to fight and hed broken off the siege once again thwarting roberts hopes of forcing a resolution upon the field of battle after the disappointment at tetbury they returned to gloucester and maude joined them there during the last week in september as glad as she was to be reunited with her brothers she found it strange to be at gloucester castle without miles this was her first visit since roger had inherited his fathers earldom of hereford and he entertained maude far more lavishly than miles had ever done which only underscored the differences between the brusque frugal pragmatic father and his extravagant impulsive funloving son roger was as quicktempered as miles and like his father he was fearless on the battlefield he had inherited the same russet coloring too although he was handsomer than the roughhewn freckled miles but he lacked his fathers mettle the flinty force of character that had made miles such a formidable ally a man to be reckoned with the better maude got to know roger the more she liked himand the more she missed miles she also missed rainald and brien for shed seen neither one for months rainald was still in cornwall fighting a dogged lonely battle to defend his imperiled earldom and brien was equally hard pressed for since the fall of oxford wallingford had become a beleaguered island in a hostile sea a target for frequent attacks and sporadic sieges by the kings men so far brien was grimly holding on but his tenants could no longer till their fields or harvest their crops and he staved off utter ruin only by seizing the provisions he needed to keep wallingford going his loyalty was costing him dearly and maude wanted to help him so badly that it was like a hollow empty ache but there was little she could do after supper the conversation focused upon the continuing depredations by geoffrey de mandeville and his lawless band the men had news that maude had not yet learned mandeville had been wounded in late august while besieging burwell one of the castles stephen had thrown up to keep him in the fens it was a hot day and when he rashly removed his helmet hed been struck by an arrow but once again hed had lucifers own luck robert reported for theyd heard the wound was not serious mandeville would soon be on the prowl again unless stephen took more aggressive action to bring him to bay they were in agreement though that stephen would not do so maude put it most trenchantly stephen ought never to have let mandeville elude him in the fens blockading the marshes with castles was the easy wayever stephens way but my father would have followed mandeville into the very bowels of hell if need be she paused then her eyes coming to rest upon her brother so would you robert she said and he smiled in surprise you are right about our father he agreed hed never have allowed a rebel to escape his wrath no matter how long it took to track him down but stephen has the attention span of a summer dragonfly he alights begins a siege loses interest and flits away in search of a new target only twice has he mustered up enough patience to flush out his preywhen he lay siege to baldwin de redverss castle at exeter and then at oxford when he thought he had you trapped maude i suppose we ought to be thankful though that he is so easily distracted else wallingfordand mayhap even my castle at bristolmight have fallen to him by now in the past ranulf would have defended stephen even if hed not spoken up hed have wanted to but that was before hed ridden into the smoking ruins of cantebrigge rising abruptly he glanced about for loth found the dog scratching in the floor rushes under the table hoping to unearth a dropped morsel or discarded bone whistling for the dyrehund ranulf let him out into the castle bailey when he returned to the hall the gathering had broken up into smaller groups amabel was conversing with rogers young wife cecily and sybil miless widow robert and maude were talking with gilbert foliot the abbot of gloucesters great monastery of st peters across the hall roger was sharing a joke with hugh de plucknet or so ranulf assumed for they were laughing closer at hand gilbert fitz john had begun a game of tables with alexander de bohun and ranulf wandered over to watch his friend play it was not long though before hugh was beckoning to him how would you fancy a foray into the town hugh asked as soon as he and ranulf were alone in the window seat earl roger says there is a new bawdyhouse on here lane just beyond the north gate you want to come with us after the women and abbot gilbert go up to bed ranulf raised an eyebrow for he believed a husband owed his wife discretion if not fidelity and chasing after whores within shouting distance of rogers own castle seemed a foolproof way to set the entire town gossiping gossip sure to find its way back to cecilys ears he could not help glancing across the hall at cecily a plump pretty girl with a throaty giggle not yet twenty and already six years a wife although ranulf would never shame annora like this once they were finally able to wed he decided that roger was old enoughat twentyoneto master his own conscience why not he said and when he next caught rogers eye he nodded to convey his interest in taking a tour of gloucesters best whorehouse roger grinned and began to drop such heavyhanded hints about the lateness of the hour that ranulf and hugh dared not look at each other lest they burst out laughing fortunately indications were pointing to an early evening robert had begun to yawn and once amabel noticed shed shepherd her sleepy husband up to bed cecily was still much too brighteyed and chipper but maude was more promising for a messenger had just arrived from devizes bearing a letter she seemed so pleased that ranulf knew the letter must be from her son or brien and as she excused herself to read it he signaled to roger and hugh that theyd soon be on their way and indeed sybil was already bidding her family and guests goodnight robert and amabel were starting to follow when maude cried out turning all heads in her direction do not go robert not yet ive news you must hear maude glanced again at the letter in her hand geoffrey de mandeville is dead as they all crowded in close to hear she told them what brien had written brien says that either mandevilles wound was more serious then he claimed or it festered whichever that was an arrow directed by god for he died a fortnight ago there was a somber silence after that for damnation was much more fearful than death even when the man deserved it as much as geoffrey de mandeville did hed died excommunicate and even a deathbed repentance was denied him for the bishop of winchester had decreed in his waning days as a papal legate that only the pope could absolve a man guilty of crimes against the church they all knew of course that an excommunicate could sometimes escape his dreadful fate for miles had he too had died accursed by the church cast out after a bitter clash with the bishop of hereford but hed had a powerful advocate in his cousin gilbert foliot and after he was struck down on that illfated christmas eve hunt the monks of gloucester had quarreled with the canons of llanthony priory over which house would have the honour of burying him but they all knew too that there would be no such reprieve for geoffrey de mandeville no priest would speak up for him none would offer prayers for his salvation his body would lie unclaimed unable to be buried in consecrated ground his title and lands would be forfeit his family shamed his name would be anathema a curse to frighten children and his soul would be forever lost to god damned to the hottest flames of perdition no one spoke for a time it was left to ranulf to pronounce geoffrey de mandevilles epitaph none of them had ever heard him sound as he did now implacable and unforgiving even if mandeville burns in hell for all eternity he said that would not be long enough to atone for his sins chester england june the benedictine abbey of st werbergh held a threeday fair every year upon the nativity of st john the baptist it was not a gainful time for the merchants of chester they were not allowed to sell their wares for the duration of the fair but the monks profited handsomely from the rental of the booths and stalls set up in front of the abbeys great gate and people flocked to the fair from all over cheshire the earl of chester was not present to open the fair but his countess acted in his stead and was warmly welcomed by the monks for the earl was a generous benefactor to the religious houses in his domains his enemies jeered that chester knew his only hope of ever getting to heaven was to buy his way in but whatever his motives the monks were appreciative of his bounty and lavished enough courtesy upon maud to satisfy a queen maud reveled in the attention chatting with the merchants making an occasional purchase as she wandered among the booths scattering alms to the beggars and children following in her wake and appearing not to notice as ranulf and annora lagged farther and farther behind they were attracting stares too for ranulf was trailed by his canine bodyguard and annora was proudly showing off her new pet pausing to allow two small boys to admire the silverygrey puppy she gave loth a bite of her meat pie shed become the dyrehunds biggest fan since learning how hed come to ranulfs rescue on the newarkgrantham road after explaining to the curious children that the pup was loths son she picked the little dog up laughing as he licked her cheek ive thought of a name for him she announced since you gave him to me on the feast of st john the baptist i shall call him john ranulf made a face that is no fitting name for a dog this from the man who burdened one of gods beasts with a name like loth annora gave the dyrehund the rest of her pie and slipped her arm through ranulfs where did your squire go hes over there watching that bout with the quarterstaff although shed voiced no objections to lukes presence ranulf felt compelled to add i finally had to promise maude that id not go off on my own again she knows about us annora or at least suspects you might say weve entered into an unspoken pact she does not ask what shed rather not know for certes and i agree to take luke with me he shrugged apologetically but annora surprised him you think i mind i only wish you had a dozen lukes to keep you out of trouble or better yet a dozen loths if not for him i shudder to think what might have befallen you and those poor waifs were you ever able to find a home for them i thought i had a southampton merchant heard about them whilst in bristol to buy wine and offered to take them in he seemed worthy and had a heartrending story about a stillborn baby and a grieving wife but it was all lies he was no vintner annora he ran a bawdyhouse on the southampton docks and he meant to sell jennets maidenhead to the highest bidder then force her to whore for him whilst he put simon out on the street to beg hed probably have crippled the lad first since a lame beggar makes more jesu ranulf they did not no praise god but only because the man was careless thinking the children were asleep in the back of his cart he talked freely to his servant about what awaited them in southampton jennet heard and she and simon fled at their first chance fortunately theyd not gone far and they were able to get safely back to devizes scared out of their wits and who can blame them he shook his head grimly after that i was wary of trusting to the kind hearts of strangers but roberts chaplain eventually found a brewer and his wife who had no children and since he spoke well of them i agreed but you do not sound like a man relating good news annora said and he shook his head again i was in bristol a few weeks later and i stopped by to see how they were getting along they were toiling away in the brewery like galley slaves free labor for the good brewer he could not understand why i was so wroth surely i had not expected him to treat a villeins children like his own blood so you took them back to devizes annora was frowning in thought surely there must be something we can do what if you offered a corrody for the lass almost at once though she saw the flaw in that but then no nunnery would accept a villeins daughter would it no not likely besides they ought not to be separated all they have is each other and you annora pointed out how long ere they start calling you papa ranulf called her a brat but he did not mind her teasing for it was just thatteasing annora was one of the few people who not only understood but approved of his efforts on the orphans behalf to others the fact of the childrens low birth was all that counted but to annora what mattered was their youth and their need ranulf had never known anyone so protective of children as she she was not indiscriminate she had met children shed not liked but shed never met a child she would not help i wish i could take them she said and sighed regretfully i know i could find a place for them on our shropshire manor but we cannot risk it all wed need would be for my husband to hear them chattering about the heroic lord ranulf who catches arrows in his teeth and walks on water the joke went awry though the word husband dragging it down like an anchor ranulf said nothing but his silence spoke volumes annora at once realized her mistake and set about remedying it once shed coaxed him into a better humor he told her the rest back at devizes the children were safe and earning their keep jennet in the laundry and simon in the stables he had hopes though that better lay ahead one of the grooms seemed smitten with jennet and since she was nigh on fifteen now annora smiled seeing where he was heading he would provide a marriage portion for jennet shed wed the stable groom simon would go to live with them and all would be well it was just like ranulf she thought with him a happy ending was always a foregone conclusion but such was the power of his faith that when she was with him she found herself believing in happy endings too at her urging ranulf bought them both cups of apple cider and they wandered over to watch a man entertaining the fairgoers with a trained monkey annora was more interested in ranulfs gossip though than the monkeys antics of course i remember john marshal she said that madman who trapped poor gilbert in the burning church belfry why what has he been up to now for the past year he has been feuding with a neighbor patrick fitz walter the sheriff of wiltshire it was a mismatch for patrick was much more powerful especially after gaining the earldom of salisbury so john decided it would be prudent to make peace and to prove his good faith he offered to wed patricks sister i thought marshal had a wife not for long he is getting his marriage annulled having discovered that he and his wife are related within the prohibited degree and have thus been living in sin for the past fifteen years you mean he is casting his wife aside like a wornout pair of boots annora exclaimed and was indignant when ranulf laughed i was laughing he defended himself because those were maudes very words shed taken a liking to johns wife andannora did you hear someone call out my name even as she shook her head the cry came again urgently lord ranulf one of mauds ladiesinwaiting was gesturing frantically the countess has been taken ill shouldering his way roughly through the crowd ranulf found his niece clinging for support to a drapers booth surrounded by alarmed attendants flustered monks and curious onlookers her face was waxwhite her skin damp with sweat and her eyes glazed with fear take me home she gasped and when he lifted her up in his arms he saw the blood staining her skirt ranulf knew as soon as annora came slowly down the stairs from mauds bedchamber she lost the baby he said and she nodded reaching out to him for comfort he held her close for a time until her trembling stopped i did not even know he confessed that maud was with child i do not think even her husband knew yet shed missed only two of her fluxes can i see her the midwife is still up there when annora raised her face to his it was wet with tears he was touched that she should be grieving so for mauds loss but then she said almost inaudibly you cannot imagine what it is like ranulf no man can her baby was dying inside her womb where he should have been safe she could feel him slipping away and she knew when it happened for she suddenly felt so empty and afterwardafterward she will blame herself no matter how hard she tried to hold on to him she ought to have tried harder ranulf was too shaken for speech this was no past pain she was describing it was so recent that it was still raw annoradid you miscarry again yes she whispered a fortnight before christmas jesus godand you never told me what good would it have done ranulf could you have come to comfort me could we have mourned together she met his eyes levelly almost accusingly as for the question you cannot bring yourself to ask i do not know if it was yours and do not look at me like that i did not betray you by sleeping with my husband you may lay claim to my dreams but i live in the real worldwith him shed often had cause to regret her intemperate tongue but never more so than now she could not deny what shed said though for shed spoken nothing less than the truth i ought to go back up to maud she mumbled remorsefully and was turning toward the stairs when he caught her arm annora wait you do not believe well ever be able to weddo you he sounded angry but she did not need to see blood to know shed inflicted a heart wound tears filled her eyes sometimes she said softly sometimes i do the summer was hot and dry and discouraging for those who believed in maudes cause geoffrey was faced with a rebellion in anjou led by his own brother in england robert suffered a political defeat and a personal calamity when faringdon castle fell to stephen robert had built faringdon strategically situated on the londonbristol road at the behest of his son philip who hoped to cut communications between stephens garrisons at malmesbury and oxford but that july stephen laid bloody siege to faringdon and when robert was unable to come to the beleaguered strongholds aid philip was so enraged that he defected to stephen despite such setbacksor perhaps because of themmaude kept a particularly lavish christmas court that year the great hall of devizes castle was ablaze with candlelight and swirling color for another carol was beginning standing on the steps of the dais ranulf watched the dancers whirl by familiar faces the stars in maudes firmament rainald and beatrice had come from cornwall and were harvesting a crop of congratulations for beatrice had given birth that summer to their first child rainald had confided to ranulf his disappointment that it was a lass and not a son but hed wasted no time suggesting to baldwin de redvers that his infant daughter would make an ideal bride for baldwins young heir rainald was now dancing with such exuberant verve that ranulf assumed baldwin had been amenable to the proposal beatrice was not in the carol circle but ranulf had seen her earlier that evening drifting about in the shadows motherhood had not anchored her to reality any more than marriage he thought sadly for she seemed as unsubstantial to him as a puff of smoke robert and amabel were not dancing they were sitting together in a window seat more like spectators than participants in the christmas revelries although all were taking great care to make no mention of philip he was the uninvited guest at dinner the unwelcome intruder in their midst his betrayal the unspoken topic of conversation none might ask robert outright but people still wondered and speculated even those like ranulf who knew of philips troubled relationship with his father did not understand what had driven him to an act so desperate and so despicable ranulf doubted that robert understood either when the carol ended the dancers continued to mill about awaiting the next one patrick fitz walter and john marshal were nearby exchanging mordant banter marriage may have made them allies but not friends john marshals new wife stood beside them smiling placidly at their verbal sparring she was not as handsome as marshals discarded wife but she was undoubtedly fertile marshal had been bragging to one and all that his bride was already pregnant ranulf wondered if the lady sybils complacency was due to that early pregnancy if so she must be conveniently forgetting that the castoff adelina had borne marshal two sons but then sybil was an earls sister and just as that fact explained her marriage it also guaranteed its survival while marshals new marriage had made him an object of curiosity brien fitz count was the one attracting the most attention the heartiest congratulations and the most lavishif puzzledpraise brien had just proved that he could wield a pen as well as a sword on maudes behalf he had written a political treatise in support of her quest for the crown marshaling arguments like armies as he sought to discredit stephens kingship he was of course preaching to the converted but his efforts had been well received even by men of scholarly bent such as gilbert foliot the erudite abbot of gloucesters great abbey the others were impressed but bemused too by briens foray into such alien territory with the exception of robert and himself ranulf doubted if there was a man in the hall whod even read a book in its entirety certainly not for pleasure tonight though they were all claiming to have read briens counting upon his good manners to keep him from putting them to the test watching as brien shrugged off compliments with selfdeprecating humor ranulf felt sympathy stirring for he knew only one opinion mattered to brien his book may have been offered to the world but it was meant for maude she had already thanked him circumspectly for his wife had accompanied him to devizes and never strayed far from his side it occurred to ranulf that briens renowned courtesy was camouflage for a profoundly unhappy man there had always been a streak of melancholy in his nature even in the best of times how must it be for him nowa man of honour forced outside the law to feed his people an idealist with no faith in his fellow men ruining himself for a woman he could never have and a cause that however worthy was soaking england in blood ranulf drew in his breath sharply looking into the depths of briens soul hed looked too into his own he at once repudiated the vision it was true that smoldering images of cantebrigge had not faded from his memory but as much as he lamented the suffering of the english people he still believed maudes cause was just her war could be won and he and annora would not be like brien and maude lovers left with nothing but regrets for what might have been no by god that would not be their fate too he would not let himself lose hope not like annora ranulf could not deny though that his mood was far from festive sometimes he could feel his faith slipping away from him and he feared the day when he could not hold on it was no coincidence that he framed his thoughts in annoras words six months afterward he was still haunted by her confession her miscarriage and the realization that she had wanted the childeven if it were not his looking around for a wine bearer he took refuge instead in the happiness of a friend hastening over to join gilbert fitz john and his wife even a stranger could have guessed that gilbert and ella were newly wedded for the glow had yet to fade often a landless knight was never able to wed unable to provide for a family but gilberts marriage had been made possible by ranulfs persuasive tongue and maudes generosity unable to bestow an earldom upon her youngest brother she had compensated as best she could by giving him lands under her control in wiltshire when hed asked for a manor on gilberts behalf she had agreed and gilbert and ella were wed in november just before advent gilberts bride was so like him that they could have been siblings ella was as goodnatured and practical and easily satisfied as her new husband and they were mirror imagesmale and femaleof each other both of them fairskinned freckled redheads tall and sturdy and perfectly matched why so downhearted gilbert asked before ranulf even opened his mouth hed always been able to read ranulf with ease the news from anjou is not bad not at all geoffrey swiftly put down the rebellion and hes now giving his rebel barons reasons aplenty to rue their folly apparently helie thought hed be able to talk his way out of trouble but geoffrey has never been one for forgiveness he cast helie into a dungeon at tours and is likely to keep him there until helie goes grey he seemed to lose track of his thoughts and his sentence trailed off following his gaze gilbert saw that he was staring at a newcomer to the hall you know that man ranulf yes i do he is in my nieces service gilbert was astute about shaded meanings you are saying he is loyal to her not chester ranulf nodded maud has her own attendants most of whom came with her from roberts household at the time of her marriage they are utterly devoted to her none more so than nicholas im surprised that shed give him so simple a task as delivering a letter to her parents he always seemed the sort ranulf joked to be skulking around at midnight on lifeordeath missions as they watched nicholas was ushered toward robert and amabel within moments it was obvious that something was wrong when robert started toward maude ranulf hastened to intercept him but before ranulf could speak robert said in an urgent undertone not now lad meet me in my chamber after the guests have gone to bed and till then say nothing that was hardly reassuring ranulf watched uneasily as robert drew maude aside for a brief colloquy one that left her looking tense and preoccupied when he sought her out he got only a whispered not here ranulflater after that ranulf could only wait and worry ranulf was puzzled by the composition of the afterhours council robert and amabel maude rainald and brien if roberts news was a family matter why include brien and if it was political why were baldwin de redvers and john marshal and roger fitz miles excluded robert was leaning back against a trestle table amabel at his side i know my behavior must have seemed odd tonight but what i have to tell you cannot leave this chamber until it is common knowledge we can say nothing lest my daughter be put at risk she has sent us a secret warning after the christmas revelries the earl of chester and his brother are journeying to the town of stanford there to make their peace with stephen rainald swore explosively brien was close enough for ranulf to hear him suck in his breath but he said nothing keeping his eyes upon robert and maude ranulf was astounded for he knew if any man did how much chester scorned stephen why why now maud says that after faringdon castle fell chester concluded that stephen cannot be overthrown he decided to make the best deal he could whilst stephen still needed him as an ally roberts shoulders had slumped his face looked pinched and grey in the subdued light my son philip acted as the gobetween he said heavily and no one spoke after that not knowing what to say the silence was full of foreboding they all knew what this unholy alliance could mean chesters holdings rivaled the crowns nigh on a third of england lay within his domains ranulf rose and began to prowl the chamber his sister was standing utterly still in the shadows so none could see her inner turmoil ranulf glanced toward her and then away with chester as an active ally stephen seemed likely to prevail henry would not be left with nothing for even if maude did fail geoffrey had not the duchy of normandy would one day be henrys but ranulf knew that would not be enough for maude not ever enough her own dreams were dead ranulf did not think she could bear to see henrys dream die too chester castle england june after opening st werberghs fair on her husbands behalf maud and her guests returned to the castle for dinner when coaxed by the women ranulf agreed to escort them back to the fair once the meal was done but it was hard to muster up much enthusiasm for fairgoing not when he kept remembering that a year had passed since the last fair another year lost how could he blame annora if her faith sometimes faltered servants were ladling venison stew onto their trenchers breaking off a chunk of bread ranulf glanced over at his niece sohow is the grand alliance going while that still sounded faintly sarcastic it was considerably more tactful than his usual description of chester and stephens peaceas a devils deal maud smiled into her napkin before saying demurely as befitting a dutiful wife my poor randolphhe has exerted himself tirelessly to prove his good faithfirst taking bedford castle for stephen and then assisting stephen and ypres to build a stockade at crowmarsh so they could cut off supplies to wallingford but even after all hes done he says that stephens barons are still wary and suspicious i wonder why ranulf said dryly but his humor was hollow he did not find anything amusing in chester and stephens accord it was far too dangerous to be laughed away as brien could testify after a harrowing spring under siege have you heard about philips latest outrage mauds lip curled contemptuously philip who she said coolly your blacksheep brother seems bound and determined to dishonour himself beyond redemption im sure you know that maude and robert offered to negotiate with stephen we hoped we might be able to take some of the pressure off briento no avail stephen granted rainald a safeconduct to come to his court that was the only concession he was willing to make though but philip saw a chance to wreak more havoc and ambushed rainald on his way to bristol took him prisoner and brought him back to stephens court in chains how treacherous annora interrupted and how shameful stephen agreed with you he was infuriated that philip should have dared to defy his safeconduct and he released rainald at once rainald returned home in high dudgeon vowing vengeance upon philip if it takes a lifetime and philipi suppose he went off to sulk maud shook her head scornfully my brother will always claimed philip was a changeling and more and more i do believe him this i can tell you for certes ranulfthat god might one day forgive philip for the pain he has inflicted upon our family but i never shall ranulf and maud lapsed into a morose silence after that and annora hastily cast about for a new topic one distracting enough to keep them from dwelling upon philips betrayal is it true that the church is preaching a new crusade ranulfs attention was immediately caught and he nodded vigorously on easter sunday at vezeley in burgundy the abbot of clairvaux read a papal bull urging all christians to rescue the holy land from the infidel thousands thronged to hear him speak and the french king was amongst the first to take the cross a pity stephen was not stricken too with crusading fever maud said wryly in truth i can think of any number of lords whose souls would benefit from a sojourn in the holy land i am surprised though that louis is so keen to go the last time randolphs brother was in paris he said louis could not bear to have eleanor out of his sight how will he cope once a thousand miles stretch between them fortunately for louis ranulf said with a grin his beautiful queen has taken the cross too maud was startled but not astounded for women had participated in the first crusade some had been loyal wives others less reputable for even gods army had attracted its share of camp followers as a girl maud had loved to hear tales of these female pilgrims women braving hardships and danger for the same mixed motives that drew men to the holy landthe curious and the devout the daring and the pious the wanton and the faithful seeking gods grace or gold salvation or adventure maud could not say which of these categories eleanor of aquitaine fit into she knew only that she felt a sharp surge of envy a hunger to leave the familiar behind to strike out boldly toward the unknown as the young french queen meant to do annoras reaction was far different disbelief and then painful disappointment shed long idealized eleanor the only woman who seemed able to hold her own in a mans world they were almost of an ageeleanor just two years youngerand shed reveled in eleanors triumphs admired her independent spirit and when faced with difficult decisions shed silently ask herself what eleanor would have done this was the first time that her idol had let her down and she frowned at her cooling stew her appetite gone but queen eleanor just had a baby last year she pointed out plaintively half hoping the reminder would prod ranulf into admitting this was another of his dubious jests her lover gave her a questioning smile and she saw her point had eluded him her baby she repeated more forcefully eleanor has an infant daughter now i would not think shed want to leave her babe so soon not after so many years of a barren marriage this elicited only a shrug more male incomprehension nor did maud seem to understand either for she laughed when ranulf quipped that he doubted eleanor could find the nursery without a map annora knew of course that queens were not expected to be doting mothers circumstance and protocol and practicality all conspired to distance a royal mother from her child the babe would be suckled by a wet nurse swaddled and comforted and cuddled by servants a royal pawn to play in the marriage game for daughters were often betrothed before they could walk bred to be brides for foreign princes annora supposed it was possible that a queen might prefer not to get too attached to a child she was soon to lose but shed still expected more from eleanor the same devotion she would have given to a babe of her own neither ranulf nor maud noticed her preoccupation and were soon talking about the bishop of winchesters latest feud this one with no less a personage than the archbishop of canterbury bishop henry blamed the latter for the popes refusal to reappoint him as a papal legate annora spooned her stew listlessly paying the conversation no mind until she heard her own name a servant was nearing their table announcing that a man had just ridden in asking to see lady fitz clement as her eyes met mauds annora nodded but she felt a sudden unease for only her husband knew she was at chester and shed been gone less than a week not long enough for him to be writing to hernot unless something was wrong borrowing some of ranulfs optimism she sought to convince herself that all was well with her father brothers stepchildren husband and dog in the endless interval before the servant ushered the new arrival into the hall maud was signaling for the final course of fruitfilled tarts as she caught her first glimpse of annoras visitor one glimpse was all she needed so strong was the family resemblance even before she heard annoras strangled cry of ancel shed realized that this enraged swarthy stranger was annoras brother and she hastily sought nicholass eye sending him a surreptitious message to be on the alert for trouble ranulf and annora sat frozen in their seats as ancel strode toward the high table after one burning glance at ranulf ancel aimed his accusing gaze at his sister ignoring maud and the others in the hall he said abruptly i had business in shrewsbury for my lord earl and thought to surprise you i was the one who got the surprise though for your husband informed me that you were off visiting your dear girlhood friend the countess of chester i found that puzzling for as far as i knew youd never even laid eyes upon the woman but as i was sitting there listening to that poor fool gervase boast that you and the countess were closer than sisters one of your stepsons came running into the hall chased by a norwegian dyrehund ancels eyes flicked then to ranulf did you think id forgotten about those accursed dyrehunds of yours outside of norway that is a beast as rare as the unicorn but i still fought against facing the truth all the way to chester i kept trying to convince myself that i was wrong that my suspicions were unjustified in my heart i knew i was befooling myself but i his mouth twisted he took a great gulp of air and then lashed out i did not want to believe that my little sister was a whore ancel enough ranulf pushed his chair back coming swiftly around the table toward the other man we need to talk he said but not here lets find some privacy he got no further it was then that ancel lunged at him caught off balance ranulf reeled backward crashing into the table he would later figure out that he hit his head upon one of the trestle legs now dazed and bleeding he knew only that he was thrashing about in the floor rushes trying to keep ancel from throttling him the table had gone over spilling food into the laps of the startled diners setting off so much screaming and swearing that the entire hall reverberated with angry clamor loth had been scavenging under the table for scraps with a muffled roar he fought his way clear of the tablecloths smothering folds fortunately for ancel though maud had enough presence of mind to grab the dogs collar as he erupted from the wreckage annora had been splashed with hot gravy but she did not yet realize shed been burned so intent was she upon reaching ranulf and ancel by the time she did it was over nicholas and several of mauds household knights had pounced upon ancel pried his fingers from ranulfs throat and dragged him away annora gasped at her first sight of ranulf for he was bleeding profusely snatching up a napkin she pressed it to his gashed forehead by now luke was there too and between the two of them they helped ranulf to his feet are you bad hurt maud paused only long enough to assure herself that ranulfs cut was superficial before launching her assault upon ancel how dare you force your way into my home and attack my kinsman just who do you think you arean avenging angel from hell this is none of your concern my sister is shaming our family but what would you know of dishonour no decent woman would make herself an accomplice to adultery only another slut would ancel never saw the blow coming nicholas moved in quick as any cat burying his fist in ancels midsection as ancel groaned and doubled over nicholas brought his knee up with lethal aim it was as brief and efficient and brutal a beating as ranulf had ever seen over before he could react before many in the hall even knew what was happening it confirmed all of ranulfs suspicions about nicholas made him wonder what such a man was doing in his nieces service but as ranulf turned toward maud he found her quite unmoved by the violence she was watching with grim satisfaction as ancel sank to his knees choking for breath and ranulf saw her for the first time as chesters wife not roberts daughter you may be thankful that i am forgiving of the halfwitted she said scathingly else your folly would have cost you your tongue ancels beating had unbalanced annoras loyalties and she flew to his defense now glaring at maud and nicholas as she warned do not threaten him when she tried to help him up though he shoved her away ignoring ancels cursing ranulf reached down and jerked him to his feet you are such a fool ancel you know i love your sister if youd given me a chance id have told you that i mean to make her my wife ancel spat out a mouthful of blood then called ranulf a misbegotten bastard a foul judas a false friend but what chilled ranulf was seeing in ancels eyes such utter implacable hatred ancel swung away starting unsteadily for the door when annoras protest went unheeded she hurried after him as ranulf started to follow maud caught his arm he is in no mood to listen to you she said he knew she was right but as soon as she was done daubing away his blood he hastened from the hall he found annora standing alone out in the bailey watching as her brother rode away without looking back when ranulf reached her she turned with a sob buried her face in his shoulder and wept he comforted her as best he could reassuring her that he loved herwhich was trueand that ancel would calm down and see reason which was not hell never forgive me she wept never he said so said my disgrace would break our fathers heartand he is right ranulf it would she sobbed again then shuddered what if he tells my husband what if he tells gervase ranulf did not know what to say hed just lost a lifelong friend had seen a twentyyear friendship die in the span of seconds but he feared now that he was losing far more northampton england august what sort of knavery is chester up to now stephen had just come from a lengthy private audience with the earl but he had to admit i do not know henrynot yet i can tell you what he has asked of methat i accompany him on an expedition against the welshbut i am not sure if he has something more nefarious in mind if stephen had doubts about chesters intentions the others had none at all you cannot go into wales with that evil man matilda cried at the same time the bishop protested utter madness and william de ypres blistered the air with flemish obscenities should i interpret that as two nays and one undecided stephen asked smiling faintly but he was the only one who found the joke funny i did not agree he said defensively i said that id have to think about it and before they could object again he told them of chesters proposal the earls lands had been coming under attack by the welsh and he wanted stephens aid in restoring peace to the marches if stephen would agree hed provide the men and supplies insisting that the kings presence would be enough to intimidate the welsh ypres snorted from what ive heard the only king likely to overawe those welsh lunatics would be the king of heavennot england for once stephens brother was in full accord with the fleming if chester is having welsh troubles let him sort them out with his new kinsman henry said skeptically hes just betrothed his niece to that renegade welsh prince who marched with him against lincoln so let him turn to cadwaladr for help assuming he really needs itwhich i doubt you are not seriously considering it stephen matilda moved to her husbands side gazing up anxiously into his face relying upon chesters honour would be like taking the devil on faith you cannot do that stephen you dare not sweetheart do not distress yourself so whilst i do not think i ought to dismiss his request out of hand i have no intention of riding into an ambush with nothing to protect me but chesters goodwill it gladdens my heart to hear you say that matilda confided i know we must do what we can to keep chester content but not at the risk of your safety if he wants your help in wales he must be willing to do his part let him agree to provide hostagesmen whose lives matter to himand mayhap then ill believe this welsh campaign of his is an honest endeavor not some sort of treacherous snare the bishop nodded approvingly although he still felt matilda exercised undue influence over his easygoing brother he was willing to admit that she was more sensible than most of her sex let him yield lincoln castle too he said as he ought to have done months ago as stephen glanced toward william de ypres the mercenary shrugged i doubt that id trust chester even if the archangel gabriel himself vouched for the man but it cannot hurt to put him to the test i agree with madame queen and the bishop let chester offer up proof of his good faith and then well see stephen nodded heartened by such unanimous agreement it is settled then he said well tell chester our terms on the morrow after that it is up to him as the earl of chester strode into the castle hall the following morning bennet de malpas and several members of his entourage hastened to intercept him he was walking into a lions den they warned northampton was aswarm with his enemies and they were stirring up the hive by ranting about the dangers of his welsh expedition for word had gotten out that he wanted the king to go into wales as he listened to bennet and ivo the castellan of his castle at coventry chester was surveying the hall they had not exaggerated it was thronged with men whod thank god fasting for a chance to do him harm the earl of york whose lands hed repeatedly ravaged gilbert de gant whod been forced to wed his niece after being captured at lincoln william peverel lord of nottingham and cousin to stephen a man with a temper to rival that of his fiery royal grandsire william the bastard that poisonous fleming ypres friends of the absent earl of richmond whod starved in one of chesters dungeons until he agreed to yield galclint castle the earl of northampton dragging his disapproval around like an anchor even robert beaumont whod been rarely at stephens court since his twin came to terms with maude and geoffrey diehard foes the lot of them only one of the barons was likely to offer any support the earl of hertford his sisters son most men would have been daunted by such odds not chester though he relished turmoil thrived on controversy and he was looking forward to imposing his will upon these men who hated him so it is getting on toward noon why are we delaying dinner and where is the meddlesome little bitch he had no need to be more specific they knew he meant matilda for every man in his service was aware of the grudge he bore stephens queen he was not one to forgive a public humiliation especially at the hands of a woman they explained now that matilda had been called away when one of her ladies was taken ill the pale shy lass bennet disclosed the one who had fits but chester was no longer listening his interest in the cecilys of this world was nonexistent beckoning them to follow he headed for the dais where he offered stephen a perfunctory obeisance i understand we are holding dinner for the queen we have time then to discuss our welsh expedition how soon can your grace be ready to go the sooner the better for wales turns into a quagmire once the autumn rains begin stephen frowned he could hear troubled murmurings from those within earshot and he wanted to assure them that it was not so it nettled his pride that anyone should thinkeven brieflythat he might be chesters dupe but theyd all agreed that the confrontation should be private for chester was too volatile to be trusted in a public setting his brother was already nudging him silently mouthing the warning words not now annoyed by the reminder stephen said brusquely we have much to talk about but i prefer to wait until a time of my choosing why wait we can settle it right quickly chester insisted just tell me when and ill take care of the rest as i told you ill provide the men the mutterings were louder now and distinctly alarmed men were pressing in around them chesters enemies in the forefront the king would not accompany you across the hall much less let you lure him into wales so you could ambush him few would have dared to accuse chester so openly but william peverel had never lacked for nerve seeing that some thought hed overstepped himself he said angrily why not say it it is what we are all thinking why should i care what you think chester sneered your opinion is not important enough to matter to anyone least of all to me and as usual youre wrong for the king is coming into wales tell them your grace he demanded swinging around on stephen let them hear it from you if they doubt me what would you have me say i did not agree to go merely to talk further you did agree by god you did indeed i did not both men sounded equally indignant equally sincere most simply assumed that chester was a convincing liar but the bishop suspected it was more complicated than that for he knew how hard it was for stephen to turn people down even with one he disliked as heartily as he did chester hed still temporize hear the applicant out with the affable courtesy he denied to no man be he baron or blacksmith hed left the door ajar whether he meant to or not the bishop would wager any amount on it and for a man like chester who tended to hear only what he wanted to that cracked door would beckon wider than heavens gate wed best discuss this in private henry said hastily but it was already too late fueled by grievances and fanned by suspicions stephen and chesters accord was going up in flames this was exactly what stephen had hoped to avoid and he was furious with himself for letting chester force the issuewhich made him even more furious with chester i told you that i would think about your request no more than that after due consideration i have decided that i am willing to join you in walesprovided that certain conditions are met chester was silent for a moment cursing himself for not putting an end to stephens kingship when hed had the chance at lincoln if only his aim had been truer what conditions bluntly put your history does not inspire trust i do not think it unreasonable to expect a show of good faith on your part i want lincoln castle back and hostagesof our choosing i think that is a fair fair it is outrageous i come seeking your aidthe aid you owe me as your liegemanand what happens you lie to me and then spit in my face i did not lie to you nor do i see why you object to these conditions if you have been honest with me why not provide hostages what risk to themas long as you are true to your word it is insulting an affront to my honour to chesters fury that evoked a burst of derisive laughter from most of the men stephen smiled scornfully and chester tensed ready to lunge for his throat but others were now joining in the fray bennet de malpas put a restraining hand on chesters arm for they were hopelessly outnumbered william de ypres had shouldered his way to stephens side i never knew you had such a droll wit my lord earl he gibed surely that was a jestyour complaint about affronted honour that prompted more laughter which stilled though when william peverel at last made himself heard above the uproar treason he shouted he meant to betray the king and that stark cry of treason was quickly taken up by others until the entire hall seemed to echo with this deadly denunciation the one accusation no king could ever ignore you fools chester raged i did nothing wrong prove it then stephen challenged accept my terms rot in hell faced with such defiance stephen had no choice arrest him he ordered resistance would have been futile and possibly fatal but no one had expected chester to realize that too he surprised them all and disappointed more than a few by an unwonted display of common sensehe let himself be taken afterward there was jubilation among chesters enemies but others were more ambivalent asking themselves if suspicions alone were enough to justify a charge of treason even some who rejoiced in chesters downfall were still troubled by the way hed fallen if so great and powerful a lord as chester could be arrested without proof of wrongdoing who amongst them was safe maude and ranulf arrived at bristol castle in midafternoon the summer sky was just starting to darken when nicholas rode in his unexpected appearance jarred ranulf barely two months had passed since his confrontation with ancel and the memory was still raw for a moment he let himself hope that nicholas might be bringing a letter from annora routed through maud but he knew better knew that nicholas was here on a far more urgent mission than the delivery of a clandestine love letter and his suspicions were soon confirmed summoned hastily to the privacy of the castle solar he and maude and rainald and amabel listened in astonishment as robert read aloud his daughters letter a laconic account of her husbands arrest at northampton there was an amazed silence once he was done has the man gone daft rainald said at last how could even stephen blunder this badly just be thankful rainald that he has robert said earnestly we need not fear any more sheep straying from our fold now not after the way chester was sheared there will be no more defections for certes maude agreed i do not understand why stephen keeps making the same mistakes does he not realize how weak and sly it makes him appearbreaching the kings peace to arrest men at his own court first the bishops then mandeville now chester if he keeps on like this hell have to send out his sheriffs to fetch his dinner guests come and dine with the king get to see the royal dungeons too rainald was always one to laugh at his own jokes the others were too preoccupied for levity i wonder maude said thoughtfully if chester was guilty they all did it was easy enough to agree upon the obviousthat chesters refusal meant nothing for even if hed been as innocent as one of gods own angels hed have balked at a public submission but beyond that they could only speculate none disputed ranulf though when he observed wryly that a man could rarely go wrong suspecting the worst of chester i find it difficult to give him the benefit of any doubt too robert admitted my daughter seems to think he was not plotting evilfor once of course hed not be likely to confide in her if he was setting a snare but he is having trouble with the welsh that was no lie i suppose he could be innocent ranulf conceded grudgingly and if so it would be the ultimate ironythat hed be punished for the one sin he did not commit there was laughter and then maude surprised them with a comment that showed just how far shed traveled down the road toward selfawareness no ranulf she said the ultimate irony is thisthat for all the harm stephen and i have tried to do each other our worst wounds always seem to be selfinflicted an autumn rain was making life miserable for any londoners who had to be out in it within the palace at westminster it was drier but the mood was as dreary as the weather stephen had been closeted all morning with his wife his brother and william de ypres gloomily assessing their options they agreed that they had but two choices neither of them palatable if they kept chester in confinement they risked a rebellion by his vassals and tenants whod reacted with outrage to their liege lords arrest moreover chester was garnering support from unexpected quarters the cheshire church was speaking out strongly on behalf of so generous a patron naturally his brother was among the most vocal of his defenders as was his nephew the earl of hertford but others were arguing for his release too respected lords like the earls of derby and pembroke it had not helped either when the welsh took advantage of chesters disgrace to raid into cheshire as unlikely as it seemed chester was becoming a figure of sympathy the longer chester was imprisoned the more problems he posed but if he was set free they well knew what to expect hed never forgive stephen for this never even if he was as guilty as cain hed still see himself as the one wronged when ypres pointed this out no one disputed him and he took the opportunity to argue further against chesters release if you snared a wolf would you let it go just because the rest of the pack was on the prowl spare me your hunting homilies the bishop said brusquely they do not address the issue at hand i like the thought of freeing chester no more than you do but i see no other way how do you expect the controversy to abate as long as we keep him in the tower nor can we bring him to trial matilda said for we have no proof to offer of his treachery so in all fairness willem how can we continue to hold him kill him then let him have a convenient mishap fall down a flight of stairs or catch a fatal fever matilda wanted to believe this was one of ypress unseemly jests but as she met his eyes she was chilled to see that he was in deadly earnest shed always known that he was lawless at heart a man whod passed most of his adult life perilously close to the dark side of damnation shed convinced herself that hed pulled back from the brink that salvation might still be within his grasp but in recent months hed begun showing flashes of an erratic temper his humor had soured and he was either drinking more or not holding it as well she did not know what was troubling him was not even sure she wanted to know for she suspected that she was not equipped to deal with his demons but she was worried nonetheless stephen and the bishop had been offended by ypress cynical suggestion and they were taking turns berating him for his murderous advice he listened in silence not looking in the least contrite as soon as she could interrupt the castigating flow matilda urged them to let it be willem erred you were understandably affronted and told him so now can we get back to the problem at hand i agree with henry i think we must set chester free there was an unusual asperity to her tone and all three men looked at her in surprise stephen felt remorse stirring anew she may have been far more tactful than his acidtongued brother but he knew how dismayed shed been by chesters arrest hed repeatedly tried to explain that it was not his fault and shed professed to believe him but he still fretted that she blamed him for the debacle sometimes so did he usually late at night as he sought to convince himself that chester was the one at fault it was then that he heard the insidious inner voices insisting that his uncle the old king would never have gotten himself into such a bind these voices sounded depressingly like his brothers for henry was still reproaching him for not taking command of the situation before it got out of control he never tired of pointing out that a private confrontation would have posed few risks if chester had balked at proving his good faith stephen need only have refused to go into wales and that would have been the end of it now there seemed no end in sight but how could he admit that hed blundered when he did not know what he could have done differently even if he were given a chance to relive that scene in northamptons great hall the outcome would likely be the same and that realization was the most troubling of all i botched it he said abruptly i know that chester will bear me a lifelong grudge i know that too but i cannot change what is already done i can put a high price on chesters freedom though high enough to make him think twice about incurring the wrath of the crown again he sounded as if he truly believed what he said that it was possible to intimidate chester into submission for his sake matilda tried to believe it too even the bishop held his peace ypres reached for his wine cup and drained it in an unspoken sardonic salute to the phantom presence in their midst the man they were at such pains not to mention the late unlamented lord and rebel geoffrey de mandeville by the time the negotiations for chesters release were completed winter was upon them it had not yet snowed but the fields were bleak and the ground frozen as chester and his brother rode west william de roumare had brought chesters favorite white palfrey and an impressive armed escort so that he could return to cheshire in the style befitting an earl but he knew it would take more than resplendent trappings to blot out the memories of the past few months roumare kept glancing uneasily at his brothers profile as hard and unyielding as the barren countryside around them chester had been publicly shamed clapped in irons treated like a common felon to gain his freedom hed been forced to swear a holy oath that hed not bear arms against the king hed had to offer up a number of highborn hostages as pledges for his future loyalty among them his nephew gilbert de clare earl of hertford and most galling of all hed had to surrender his castles at lincoln and coventry roumare had expected chester to be wild afire with homicidal intent the brother he knew ought to have been raging and raving and cursing making threats and vowing vengeance with every breath he drew that sort of frenzied fury would not have disturbed him unduly it was just chesters way and he was prepared for it instead hed encountered a stony silence so unlike chester that he was becoming genuinely alarmed like william de ypres he too was haunted by memories of geoffrey de mandeville the rebel earl whod died an outlaw accursed by all looking again at chester roumare shifted in the saddle he was not a fanciful man but he seemed to feel the rage radiating from his brother hot enough to scorch hot enough too to consume all common sense was randolph so hatemaddened that hed follow mandevilles bloody road to his doom randolph he cleared his throat nudged his stallion closer to his brothers mount you must tell me he urged what you mean to do chesters eyes flicked toward him opaque and unblinking and blacker than pitch i mean to do all in my power he said to gain the throne for maudes son stephen celebrated christmas that year in his newly recovered castle at lincoln the citizens freed from six years under chesters yoke welcomed stephen joyfully as their liberator and he rewarded them with lavish pageantries festivities that heralded his victory over chester as much as they did the nativity of the christ child the people were so bedazzled by the royal revelries that they accepted with aplomb stephens decision to defy local superstition and wear his crown within the city even though that was traditionally held to be bad luck the high point of the christmas court was the elaborate ceremony in which stephen knighted his eldest son and invested him as count of boulogne eustace would be seventeen in the spring and he made a favorable impression upon lincoln for he was as tall and tawnyhaired as stephen and looked like a fine young king in the makingfrom a distance that heretical thought was matildas it had come unbidden casting a shadow over the pleasure shed been taking in the evening it was an unbearably lonely feeling for she could not confide her qualms to another living soul how could she ever admit that she harbored such doubts about her own son the christmas fete had been over for hours but matilda was still clad in her elegant court gown with its long hanging sleeves and decorative silk belt that reached below her knees a furtrimmed mantle trailed from her shoulders shielding her from the cold as she made her way to the small chapel in the east tower of the keep shed promised stephen that shed not be long but she needed time alone with the almighty needed the peace of mind that could come only from entrusting her troubles to a higher power the chapel was in the upper story of the tower wall sconces still burned and the scent of incense lingered on the air she was not expecting to find anyone there for the priest had retired for the night but a man was standing before the altar he spun around at sound of her footsteps almost as if he were fearing an ambush and she saw that it was william de ypres willem i suppose i am the last man you thought to find here well she did not know how to answer for he was right but to admit that seemed insulting you never speak ill of people if you can help it do you we both know that if i turned up missing youd mount a search in the towns alehouses taverns and whorehouses youd expect he said to find me in the gutter not in church his words were slurred his eyes swollen and she shivered realizing that he was drunk but he was also in pain your need brought you to church tonight she said softly he is there for all of us willem he loves the sinner as much as he hates the sin to her consternation he laughed a harsh grating sound that caused her to shiver again if that is a suggestion that i mend my ways he said i have already started down that road i got as far as boxley too for all the good it did me matilda was not comfortable being alone with him in this dimly lit chapel for she was timid around drunkards they tended to be loud and often quarrelsome and alarmingly unpredictable his last words were so garbled that she was not sure shed heard him correctly boxley she echoed uncertainly forcing a smile when he did not respond she repeated boxley where is that willem in kent he moved toward her steady on his feet but with a telltale stiffness in his carriage the rigid posture of a man concentrating carefully upon the commands his brain was sending his body i just founded a cistercian abbey there he said and laughed again mirthlessly at her dumbfounded expression matildas initial amazement gave way almost at once to delight she and stephen had rewarded ypres lavishly for his loyalty he had been given such vast holdings in kent that his enemies complained he was its earl in all but name even so founding an abbey was an incredibly generous gesture one which went well beyond the usual largesse bestowed upon the church by its more pious or repentant sons willem how wonderful you seem soso worldly sometimes that i feared youd not given sufficient thought to your immortal soul this is a worthy thing youve done and i admire you for do not at her startled recoil he said again more calmly this time do not my lady there is nothing admirable about a bribe especially one that failed matilda blinked i do not understand it is simple enough i sought to make a deal with god id give him a house for his monks if he would give me back he bit off the rest of his words would have turned away had she not caught his arm give you back what willem tell me give you back what he looked at her for a moment that seemed endless before saying hoarsely my sight i am going blind sweet jesus matilda breathed i did not know i did not want you to know his voice was flat almost hostile i did not want your pity it is not pity willemwillem listen to me i know it seems like meagre comfort but the almighty does not give us burdens too heavy to bear let him help you carry it and let us stephen and i will do all we can will you his mouth contorted in a bitter parody of a smile even after im of no more use to you matilda understood then the true source of his fear it was rooted in his turbulent and bloody past his father had been the count of ypres his grandsire count of flanders but he was tainted by the bar sinister not his fathers heir just his bastard hed been unwilling to accept so limited a destiny though had fought for flanders lost and been forced into english exile at fiftysix years old all that he had hed won by the sword by his ruthless will and superior skills as a battle commander no wonder he was so afraid now she thought it was not death he dreaded not even the loss of light it was being helpless unable to defend himself in a world that had never been anything but hostile you are a wealthy man willem surely you did not fear that your estates would be forfeit if you were no longer able to fight for stephen she said although she well knew that was precisely what hed feared youve earned whatever weve given you speaking for myself i could lavish royal favors upon you from now till judgment day and i would still be in your debt you gave me back my husband as she spoke hed retreated into the shadows no longer able to see his face she reached out took his hand between her own and held tight but later that night she lay awake and fretful in stephens bed her husband slept peacefully beside her snoring slightly for hed turned onto his back shed told him nothing of her conversation with ypres the fleming was not yet ready to reveal his secret even to one as sure to be sympathetic as stephen matilda tucked the covers more securely about stephens chest then gently smoothed his hair it was well streaked with silver her own hair was beginning to go grey too for she was fortyone now tonight though she felt as if she were much older burdened with more troubles than she could even count lying next to stephen she closed her eyes tightly but the images would not go away ypres in the chapel eustace as he knelt to receive knighthood his face upturned and eager and chester a dark presence in the shadows malevolent and unforgiving surely chester could not be indifferent to the fate of his hostages one of them his own kinsman would he truly risk his nephews life by rebelling stephen insisted that not even chester could be so reckless so ruthless but what if he was as soon as stephen withdrew the earl of chester launched a fierce attack upon the city of lincoln but stephen had left a strong garrison behind and with the help of the citizens they were able to beat back the earls assault thwarted at lincoln chester then attempted to recapture coventry stephen hastened to break the siege was wounded in the fighting that followed and had to withdraw but he soon returned and put chester to flight the earl narrowly escaping with his life although hard pressed by stephen chester continued his rebellion and was accused by the chronicle gesta stephani of exercising the tyranny of a herod and the savagery of a nero devizes england may stephen gave chesters chief hostage a choice gain his freedom by surrendering his castles the earl of hertford reluctantly yielded the strongholds and once free joined his uncles rebellion chester was the young mans maternal uncle his paternal uncle the earl of pembroke argued that his nephews forfeit castles should have gone to him when his claim was denied he withdrew from court and made plans to seize the disputed castles stephen struck faster than the disaffected earl captured his castles at leeds and tonbridge then laid siege to the earl himself in his seacoast fortress at pevensey once again stephen had demonstrated his abilities as a soldier but his political skills were less impressive by alienating the influential clare family he threw more logs onto the fires set by chester chesters rebellion was to have farreaching consequences for a number of people ranulf and annora among them now that chester was an outright enemy of the king annoras husband refused to allow her to continue her visits to the countess maud ranulf and annora were still able to use maud as a conduit for their letters but there were no more trysts that well had dried up they would need to find another reliable go between so far though ranulfs ruminations had yielded no candidates when rainald asked for his help in cornwall he was quite willing to join his brothers cornish campaign if only to take his mind off his trouble with annora he was gone more than two months would have remained longer but a messenger caught up with him after easter bearing an urgent summons from his sister maude needed him back at devizes as soon as possibleif not sooner as ranulf dismounted in the inner bailey of devizes castle hugh de plucknet hurried out to greet him thank god youve come the empress has been as fretful as a wet cat awaiting your return in all the years ive known her never have i seen her so disquieted not even when we were trapped at oxford what has stephen done not stephenlady maudes son maude hugh had some cockandbull story about harry coming over here to fight stephen surely that cannot be true i would to god it were not maude said fervently but alas it is henry got it into his head that it was time for him to play a more active part in our efforts to overthrow stephen so he found a few young norman and angevin lords eager for adventure hired some breton mercenaries and set sail for england geoffrey let him do this ranulf interrupted incredulously and maude shook her head geoffrey knew nothing of it no more than robert or i did no this mad escapade was henrys doing and his alone he landed at wareham sent a messenger to devizes with his greetings and then began his war good god almighty ranulf murmured his nephew was all of fourteen they attacked cricklade first were easily driven off they then tried to lay siege to a castle at purton again failed it was only to be expected a raw lad not enough men no siege weapons but it quickly got worse for hed paid his soldiers with promises and they were growing impatient what money he had was soon spent and he had no choice but to appeal to robert and me for aid it was then that i fear i made a greivous mistake ranulf why what did you do we ordered henry to cease this foolishness and return to normandy that affronted his newfound manhood and he balked like a mule flatly refusing to go home robert was furious and persuaded me that we dared not indulge him that he must be brought to heel straightaway we would not give him so much as a farthing but instead of bringing him to his senses we only goaded him into further defiance off he went in a prideful rage and there was nothing i could do to stop him i could not very well hold him prisoner here hed never have forgiven me no probably not ranulf agreed what happened then that is just it ranulfi do not know what is happening we heard that henrys men had begun to abandon him that his mercenaries were clamoring for payment what if they all forsake him or even worse if he is betrayed and turned over to stephen what if maude stop scaring yourself this serves for naught you and robert did only what you thought was best for the lad what would get him safely back to normandy and with most fourteenyearolds it would have worked honesty compelling him to add of course most fourteenyearolds would not be out hiring mercenaries or assaulting castles i assume you want me to go after him she swallowed nodded then swallowed again he found it astonishing that a woman so indifferent to her own safety whose bravery had so often bordered upon recklessness was coming undone now at the mere thought of danger to her son do you know where he is he went back to wareham he has always been fond of you ranulf i think hell listen to youhe must tell him that i will get the money he needs to pay off his men but he must sail for normandy straightaway ill leave at first light he promised now you must stop blaming yourself maude you were just trying to teach the lad a lesson one he badly needed to learn i know she said softly but what if the lesson proves fatal true to his word ranulf departed at dawn the next morning with an armed escort large enough for safety not large enough to slow him down it was close to fifty miles to wareham and the roads were muddy for it had been a rainy spring they still made good time not stopping for the night until theyd reached gilbert fitz johns manor on the dorsetshire border when they left on the morrow gilbert rode with them sunsettinted clouds were trailing the sun as it started its slow descent toward the western horizon they were almost upon wareham the wind was sharper and damper now as they neared the sea riding at ranulfs side gilbert glanced curiously at his friends profile what sort of response he asked do you expect to get from henry im not sure ranulf admitted most likely hell be defensive even defiant nothing is more tender than youthful male pride remember us at fourteen you me and ancelthe unholy trinity annora liked to call us not that our tomfoolery could hold a candle to young henrys undertaking not once did we ever think of invading england although it sounded as if gilbert were just rambling on ranulf knew he had deliberately forced ancels name into the conversation he kept his eyes on the road saying nothing but gilbert was not discouraged by his silence surely youll be able to patch things up with ancel he insisted the fact that he has not revealed what he knowsdo you not think that is a hopeful sign ranulf hell not forgive me gib nor will he be forgiving annora and of all her brothers he was her favorite ranulf said no more and this time gilbert took the hint let the matter dropfor now he was not about to give up though meant to make peace between his friends no matter how long it took have you figured out another way to meet with annora a pity chester had such a wretched sense of timing if not for his falling out with stephen his wifes pregnancy would have been a perfect excuse for annora to stay with her awhile pregnancy ranulf swung around in the saddle maud is with child again you did not hear ah but youve been off in cornwall i forgot lady maud wrote to earl robert and lady amabel last month the babe is due in september i believe he grinned suddenly so we know how chester celebrated his release under his breath ranulf called chester a foul name it might not be logical but he found himself bearing a very personal grudge against the earl whose rebellion had played such havoc with his love affair may the almighty bless maud with an easy birth and a healthy child he said and then raised his hand to halt his men for wareham lay just ahead may the almighty favor me too gib in my coming talk with my nephew god willing ill be able to coax him into sailing with the tide for normandy ranulf was pleased but surprised too by the warmth of henrys welcome hed been expecting to find a youngster despondent and possibly defiant in need of some facesaving comfort but as improbable as it seemed his nephew appeared to be in high spirits genuinely glad to see him and apparently unperturbed to be stranded in enemy territory he insisted upon personally ushering ranulf and gilbert and their men into the hall very much the young lord of the manor as he directed the castle cooks to prepare a meal for these new arrivals servants were stoking the fire for wareham was near the sea and the spring evenings were still chilly settling ranulf and himself before the hearth with wine and wafers henry regarded his uncle over the rim of his wine cup so he said mama sent you ranulf nodded your mother is the most courageous woman i know harry but youve managed to accomplish what stephen and all the might of the english crown could never doyouve scared her half to death that was not my intent henry protested although without heat he seemed older to ranulf than fourteen for better or worse he was growing up fastand in a hurry to hasten the process along ranulfs own world had not changed dramatically or drastically in the three years since hed last seen his nephew he was still living on hope but those three years had wrought significant changes in henry it was too early to tell if he was going to inherit geoffreys height but he was already sprouting up almost as tall as ranulf and obviously proud of his new stature he was still in that awkward stage the perilous nomansland of adolescence the curve of his cheek was smooth and beardless but his voice had steadied and he seemed to have outgrown the coltish clumsiness so common to boys his age how ranulf wondered was he to deal with this stubborn manchild too clever for his own good too young to let loose too old to rein in henry took the initiative i suppose he said that you think ive gone stark mad noit is understandable and commendable that youd want to do your own fighting but scriptures say that for everything there is a season a time for every purpose under heavenand it was not yet your time lad i know henry conceded with disarming cheerful candor i botched it badly andand you are not troubled by that henry shrugged next time he said ill do better ranulf was very relieved that the boy was being so reasonable and yet something was not quite right about this harry was being too reasonable too complacent in defeat there was a piece missing from this puzzle but how to find it your mother is now willing to give you the money you owe your menprovided that you agree to end this campaign and return to normandy that is kind of mama but i no longer need her help ive already paid my men ranulf stiffened where did you get the money harryyou did not turn outlaw of course not uncle ranulf how could i hope to win the hearts of my english subjects by stealing their purses then i repeatwhere did you get the money lad henrys amusement was unmistakable now silvery glints of laughter swam in the depths of seagrey eyes you need not fret he said for i kept it a family matter after mama and uncle robert refused to help me i turned to my other kinsman i got the money from stephen ranulf inhaled his wine choked and began to cough struggling for breath he managed to croak out notjoking henry grinned i am quite serious i sent a messenger to cousin stephen explaining that i was out of funds and asking for a loan to get back to normandy my man said that he read my letter laughed until he was blinking back tears and then agreed to give me the money provided that i not overstay my welcome henry laughed soundlessly eyes alight with both triumph and mischief but then he took another look at his uncle and became solicitous youre still red as a beet and youve spilled all your wine you sit and catch your breath uncle ranulf whilst i fetch some more as soon as henry went off in search of a servant gilbert hastened over ranulf what is going on you look poleaxed what did he tell you ranulf was still coughing youll never believe who is financing this expedition of harrysnone other than the man he was attempting to overthrow gilberts jaw dropped stephen ranulf nodded and coughed again ive always thought of harry as maudes son but for a moment there it was as if id been given a glimpse of geoffrey at fourteen for certes the lad did not get his sense of humor from my sister shell be appalled when she hears about this for it is not in her nature to understand it nor will robert but i daresay geoffrey will find it hilarious he shook his head but the corners of his mouth were already twitching and he was soon laughing himself gilbert could not help laughing too remember that old jokethe one about the lad who killed his parents and then asked the kings court to show him mercy because he was an orphan but whatever possessed stephen to agree other men suffer from recurring ailments like the ague fever or toothache or boils with stephen it is always these fits of misguided chivalry ranulf grinned ill admit that stephen would be beguiled by the sheer audacity of the lads request but i suspect that he sees his generosity as common sense not chivalry so far harry has been more of a nuisance than a real threat and stephen may have considered the money well spent just to get rid of him hes not a man to take a fourteenyearold foe very seriously or to wish the boy harmnot until he grows up some so he probably alerted by gilberts expression ranulf broke off but not in time henry had heard sorry harry no offense meant none taken henry said equably i know stephen gave me the money to get rid of me i was relying upon that and you are going home henry nodded it would not be fair to take the mans money and then renege upon our bargain i am returning to normandy as soon as ive bade my mother farewell his pause was deliberate for as young as he was he was already developing a sense of timing but he said i will be back sharon kay penman when christ and his saints slept devizes england july the foal was the color of cider wispy mane and tail as fair as flax it tottered about the stall like a landlubber just getting its sea legs and the men laughed at its endearing clumsiness while marveling too for they knew that in a few fleeting hours this hobbled little colt would be able to gallop after its mother as if it had been born with wings the foal had finally found what it had been instinctively seeking nosing its mothers udder it began to suckle reaching over ranulf clapped one of the grooms on the shoulder good work godric the empress will be very pleased with you for she sets quite a store by this mare of hers godric smiled bashfully and mumbled something they couldnt catch his shyness always came as a surprise for people assumed that anyone so big would be aggressive too but his rawboned hefty appearance was deceptive burly camouflage for a gentle soul he never shrank from the dirty jobs was generous in offering his help to those who needed it whistled softly to himself as he worked about the stables and ranulf had concluded he was that rarity a man utterly content with his lot in life the most persuasive testimony to godrics genial nature was the reaction of the other grooms they might well have been jealous to see him thrust into royal favor instead they were lavish now with their praise telling ranulf and hugh enthusiastically how the foal had been stillborn limp as an empty sack until godric had somehow brought it back to life kneading the little fellow like he was a lump of bread dough and then blowing air into his nostrils till he began to breathe on his own it was they all agreed a sight to behold ranulf and hugh thought so too and heaped more plaudits upon godric until he was squirming with pleased embarrassment he continued to insist that hed done nothing out of the ordinary but he became even more flustered when ranulf seemed about to go my lordwait ii need to talk to you he stammered you know that my wife is with child ranulf nodded encouragingly then waited patiently for godric to find his tongue my lordit is like this jennet and me we talked it over andand if the babe be a son we want to name him after you butbut if you think wed be getting above ourselves you just say so hugh was snickering ignoring him ranulf smiled at the groom if you and jennet are sure he said i would be pleased to share my name with your son godric beamed and ranulf warned hugh off with a sideways shake of his head hugh shrugged and followed him from the stables both men flinched as they stepped out into the sunscorched bailey it was only midmorning but the temperature was already soaring the air was as heavy as it was hot and breathing it was like inhaling steam jesu hugh gasped we might as well climb into the kitchens oven and get it over with a man could drown out here in his own sweat sowill you be offering yourself up as godfather to the grooms whelp hed meant it as a joke and was taken aback when ranulf snarled just let it lie ranulf was not usually so thinskinned it was this accursed heat hugh decided and magnanimously forbore to take offense ranulfs continuing involvement in the lives of these lowborn saxons was a puzzle for certes but one he was not likely to solve one puzzle led to another putting him in mind of an odd rumor circulating that summer you were recently at bristol ranulf is all the talk true about earl roberts doubledealing son has he taken the cross to atone for his sins ranulf nodded philip was stricken with a mysterious malady at easter and nearly died he vowed to make a pilgrimage if god would spare him and sailed for normandy as soon as he got his strength back the french kings army started for the holy land after whitsuntide and i suppose philip hopes to catch up with them it is well and good to honor the almighty but i think it a pity he did not see fit to make peace with his father ere he left i daresay philip was too shamed to face the earl and if he was not by god he ought to be sothe french king is on his way to jerusalem and he truly did take his queen with him talk about inviting the snake into eden i suppose though that if she were mine id not want to leave her behind either you think shes why so many men are clamoring to take the cross the last i heard waleran beaumont william de warenne and william peverel amongst others had all vowed to join the crusade what about you ranulf are you not tempted to go soldiering for christ too the temptation was greater than ranulf was willing to admitto leave england and this bloody unending civil war and his own troubles behind in the dust and join a bright shining quest for god offering adventure and salvation and a chance to see the holy city of jerusalem he was spared the need to answer by a sudden shout up on the battlements riders were being admitted hughs curiosity had shriveled in the heat and he continued on toward the hall only to stop once he realized ranulf wasnt following ranulf you know these men one of them ranulf said warily why would ancel be seeking him out by now ancel had seen him too halting his men he dismounted swiftly ranulf started toward him and they met in the middle of the bailey ancel why are you here annora is not ailing is she no she is quite well ranulf could think of only one other reason for ancel to be at devizes to make peace between them there was nothing conciliatory about his demeanor but apologies had always gone down hard with ancel ranulf was willing though to take that first significant step i am glad youve come ancel lets get out of the sun and find a quiet place to talk i am not staying ranulf i came only to give you this holding out a sealed parchment it is a farewell letter from annora ranulf made no move to take the letter i do not believe you as i recall you did not want to believe me either when i told you shed wed fitz clement but you need not take my word read it for yourself this time when he thrust the letter forward ranulf reached for it the seal was annoras and unbroken what did you do ancel did you threaten to go to her husband it is not my doing i would that it were but she turned a deaf ear to me did not come to her senses until she got with child ranulf was stunned annora is pregnant yes and she has promised god that shell sin no more she may have been willing to risk her immortal soul for you but not this babe ancel paused glanced at ranulfs stricken face and then away when he spoke again his voice no longer held such a hard hostile edge annora insisted that she was as much to blame as you and i daresay it is true fools the both of you but id not see her hurt or you either he added grudgingly fortunately annoras husband and our family know nothing of her infidelity and god willing they never will be thankful for that much that this dangerous passion of yours wrecked no lives ranulf said nothing the bailey was shimmering in heat the sky a bleached bonewhite the color of his face ancel started to turn away then stopped if you love her ranulf he warned you let her be annoras letter was not as brutally blunt as ancel had been but the gist of her message was the same she told ranulf that she was with child the babe due in november at martinmas reminding himneedlesslythat theyd not lain together since ancel caught them last summer at chester shed not let herself hope at first she wrote so afraid shed miscarry again but she was into her fifth month now she could feel the baby moving within her womb and she did not think god would take this child too not if she repented shed promised the almighty and ancel that shed not see him again and she meant to keep that vow she wanted ranulf to know that shed truly loved him but it was not meant to be shed long known that suspected that he had too he must try to understand she wished him well and asked him to burn this letter once hed read it ranulf did not burn her letter not at first instead he tormented himself by reading it over and over until her words were embedded so deeply into his memory that hed never be able to get them out how could annora give up like this if she loved him how could she just walk away what of the baby though how could he expect her to abandon her child and if she could somehow keep the babe would he be willing to accept gervase fitz clements child as his own but what if she miscarried again an ugly thought one that shamed him when it kept coming back he remembered a conversation hed once had with a soldier wounded at the battle of lincoln the mans arm had been so badly mangled that the doctors had been forced to amputate it and hed told ranulf that his arm had continued to ache even after it was gone and after another sleepless night of phantom pain ranulf knew what he must do he had to see annora they had to talk what that would accomplish he could not say even to himself he knew only that it could not end like this it was very early a few stars still glimmering in the dawn sky ranulf had saddled his horse himself for the grooms were not yet up and about the bailey was deserted save for the guards up on the battlements he had hoped to be long gone by the time the castle was stirring for the day but as he swung up into the saddle he heard his name being called luke was running across the bailey my lord wait coming to a halt in front of ranulfs stallion blocking the way you cannot go off on your own like this he insisted i know what you mean to do you are seeking out your lady i saw him the other dayher brother i was in the town when he rode by after leaving the castle and since then youve been like a man with a wound thatll not stop bleeding i am not prying in truth i am not it is your safety i care about you know you can trust me take me with you ill need but a few moments to saddle up no ranulf said this i must do alone my lord forgive me for saying so but that is madness the risk is too great let me come ranulf turned his horse circled around luke then spurred it forward luke could only watch defeated as the stallion cantered across the bailey at least take loth with you he shouted but he could not be sure if ranulf even heard him for he did not look back lukes fears proved unfounded for ranulf reached shrewsbury without incident the town was crowded with fairgoers but he was able to persuade the hospitaller at st peters to find him a place in the abbey guest hall just as hed done during his last visit to shrewsbury fair seven years ago the next morning he rose early and headed for the fairground the august sun was hot upon his face the abbey foregate thronged with cheerful laughing people eager for the pleasures of the fair ranulf soon inhaled the aromas of hot meat pies and freshly baked bread he could not even remember the last time hed eaten all sorts of activity swirled around him a knot of children were shrieking at the antics of a trained monkey the sheriffs men were dragging off a pickpocket caught in the act merchants were calling out their wares but for ranulf it was a scene haunted by memories blighted hopes and regrets as he moved between the booths he kept catching glimpses of annora not the woman he hoped to find today but a carefree reckless girl clad in scarlet a ghost from a bygone fair living on in memories hed take to his grave as soon as hed remembered that st peters fair was imminent hed had to come knowing hed have no better chance to encounter annora it had worked once why not again but hed not anticipated how painful it would berevisiting his past he saw the dog first annoras pup had grown into a handsome greyblack animal not as large as loth who was uncommonly big for a dyrehund but very like his sire in all other particulars the reason why ranulf had dared not bring loth with him a dog that looked so much like the fitz clement dyrehund would have been dangerously conspicuous annora was accompanied by a giggling young girl about thirteen or so when annora called her lucette ranulf realized this was her stepdaughter seeing her with annora gave ranulf a jolt for the first time she was real to him his eyes were drawn irresistibly now to annoras skirts she was already starting to show and basking in the benevolent approving smiles people reserved for expectant mothers she was wearing an applegreen gown a shade hed never seen on her before it suited her for she looked at ease quite contentuntil she glanced over saw ranulf standing by the silversmiths booth ten feet or so separated them but ranulf could still see how fast the blood drained from annoras face lucette also noticed and plucked at annoras sleeve mama that too came as a shock to ranulf but then he realized that annoranigh on eleven years wedwas probably the only mother lucette remembered mama are you ailing youre so pale papa mama is sick a man at one of the nearby stalls turned made haste to rejoin them ranulf had never seen annoras husband before he was not at all the horned demon of ranulfs jealous imaginings just a compact ruddyfaced man in his forties with enough laugh lines to attest to an agreeable nature hair shorter than was fashionable a neatly trimmed beard showing signs of grey nan you do look ill of a sudden is it the babe annora swallowed ii am well truly gervase i am it is just so hot she managed a feeble smile all the while keeping her gaze riveted upon ranulf gervase and lucette were fussing over her insisting she move into the shade signaling for a vendor to bring her a cider drink as ranulf watched her it seemed to him as if the distance were widening between them although neither one had moved color was slowly coming back into annoras face she no longer looked so terrified but her eyes were wide and dark filled with mute entreaty ranulf took a backward step then turned and walked away ranulf left shrewsbury that same day he had no set destination in mind wanting only to put as many miles as he could between himself and gervases nan lucettes mama he was not ready to go home though and rode in the opposite direction taking the road that led north it had not been a conscious choice and he was halfway to chester before he realized where he was heading he was to be disappointed for maud was not at chester castle she and her lord husband were awaiting the birth of her child upon one of his welsh manors the earls servants reported and only then did ranulf remember that his niece was less than a month away from her lyingin he could have continued on into wales but he was done with acting upon impulse without thinking first for where had it ever gotten him he was not going to burden maud with his troubles at a time when she ought to be thinking only of her baby he lingered a few more days at chester and then slowly reluctantly started back toward devizes the borderlands were lawless in even the best of times but once again ranulf rode unscathed over some of the most perilous roads in stephens realm it may have been that indifference was the most formidable armor of all that bandits somehow sensed the danger in attacking a man who felt he had nothing left to lose it may have been no more than happenchance sheer good fortune whatever the explanation ranulf reached devizes safely in early september bonetired and disheveled and heartsick night had long since fallen by the time ranulf dismounted in the bailey of devizes castle he was handing the reins to a stable groom when hugh de plucknet came hastening out of the hall a swaying lantern held aloft is that you ranulf good god man where have you been wed begun to despair of ever seeing you alive again do youdo you know know what ranulf asked but without interest whatever your news hugh hold it till the morrow tonight i want only to get myself up to bed it was not to be that easy however for a womans figure was framed in the open doorway of the hall familiar even in shadow ranulf heaved a weary sigh cursed his wretched sense of timing and moved to meet his sister maude i know you are furious with me for going off as i did he said abruptly hoping to delay her lecture i promise ill hear you out offer you all the apologies you want but not now not tonight maude looked as exhausted as ranulf felt her dark eyes ringed with sleepless shadows but he could find no traces of anger in their depths i am not going to reproach you she said but i must talk to you ranulf and it cannot wait whatever she had to tell him he did not want to hear not more bad news not tonight but maude would not be denied once they were alone in her dimly lit solar she seemed in no hurry to unburden herself instead fretting about the flickering candles insisting upon pouring wine for them both until he lost all patience and demanded to know what could not wait till the morrow maude turned slowly to face him i have grievous news for you she said haltingly the day after you rode away on your own your friend gilbert fitz john arrived stopping over on his way to bristol when he learned that youd gone off alone he was so dismayed that he insisted upon going after you he sent a message to robert that he would be delayed and then he and luke and their escort set out after you i do not understand ranulf said uneasily why they did not overtake me then for i tarried along the way but i did not see them at shrewsbury nor on the road they never got there ranulf theyd ridden less than ten miles when a fox chased a rabbit out onto the road spooking their horses the others were able to get their mounts back under control but gilbert was not so lucky and hehe was thrown ranulfs mouth was suddenly dry was he bad hurt i am so sorry she whispered so very sorry he broke his neck in the fall ranulf he is dead devizes england october ranulf maude hesitated unsure how to proceed her every instinct urged against trespassing across emotional boundaries for she respected the privacy of pain as few others did but shed begun to feel as if she were witnessing a drowning and her greatest fear now was that her lifeline would fall short ranulfyou know that a wound can fester if it is not tended spreading its poison throughout the entire body grief can fester like that too my chaplain says that you refused to talk to him again i had nothing to say to him you have nothing to say to anyone these days that is what worries me she waited soon saw he was not going to respond hed picked up the fire tongs and was prodding the hearth back to life his face hidden all she could see was a thatch of fair hair gilded by firelight maude watched him in silence for several moments and then said purposefully luke thinks that you blame him for gilberts death as shed hoped that got his attention that is not so he said hotly i do not blame luke i know she said you blame yourself she closed the space between them reaching for his arm ranulf listen to me it was not your fault how could you know that gilbert would follow you to shrewsbury what befell him was tragic but it was an accident it could as easily have happened on the bristol road but it did not the words were wrenched from ranulf against his will he at once repudiated them saying huskily maude just let it be she studied his face and then reluctantly loosed her hold upon his arm i want you to go to bristol she said i want you to find out how roberts plans are progressing for our new offensive against stephen he frowned why me why not send hugh or alexander because she insisted i want to send you at the door she paused glancing back over her shoulder if you cannot talk to me she said mayhap you can talk to robert maude was wrong robert was the last one ranulf could have confided in what could he say that because of his adulterous affair with another mans wife his best friend was dead even if he no longer deserved it he could not lose roberts respect he despised himself though for his moral cowardice hed not been able to bring himself to face gilberts widow ella and now he could not bear for robert to know the truth about him what was that if not the worst sort of cowardice but ranulfs shattered spirits flickered and the ache in his chest eased somewhat as the walls of bristol came into view even if he could not unburden himself to his brother just being with robert would be a comfort he could cling to roberts abiding calm like a shipwrecked sailor like so many others in need robert was always there for them all a refuge for the lost and the disheartened and the damned mayhap maude had known what she was about after all in sending him to bristol the east gate of the castle swung open as soon as ranulf identified himself he and his men dismounted in the bailey and he handed the reins of his stallion to luke if youll unsaddle him for me lad ill seek out my brother and see about getting us all fed that sounded good to his tired and hungry men and they headed for the stables eager to get this final task over with luke nodded and followed cheered by ranulfs smile hed not seen it for weeks the bailey was oddly empty no servants in sight but ranulf knew the layout of bristol castle well enough to find his way blindfolded for the past eight years it had been his second home the stone tower of the keep rose up against the western sky crested by sunset clouds the most likely place to find his brother he was halfway there when a familiar figure appeared in the doorway cried out his name and then started toward him at a run puzzled ranulf quickened his pace will by the time roberts firstborn reached him he was flushed and panting badly winded by even so short a sprint for he was as indulgent in his habits as his father was sparing and hed begun to develop a paunch while still in his twenties he was in his thirties now several years ranulfs senior cheerful and gregarious but not redoubtable a sapling stunted by his sires formidable shadow ranulf had rarely seen him so flustered for hed inherited roberts equable temperament if not his capacity for command how did you get here so fast he demanded we just sent a man out this morn where is aunt maude she did come with you christ jesus surely she understood understood what will youre raving start overat the beginning will gulped in a great lungful of air there was an autumn chill in the bailey but beads of sweat had broken out upon his forehead you got no message then no of course you did not what was i thinking of no man could get to devizes and back in but a day will name of god man what is wrong it is my father it came upon him without warning a sudden fever wills mouth trembled and he struggled to blink back tears christ pity us all ranulf for the fool doctorsthey say papa is dying ranulf was slumped in a window seat of his brothers bedchamber his muscles cramped and stiff from so many hours of immobility hed lost track of the days could not have said how long hed been at bristol he measured time differently now nothing mattered but the dwindling number of roberts labored breaths night had fallen again but the chamber was still crowded men whod come to bid their dying lord farewell lingered as long as possible loath to let go baldwin de redvers stumbled away from the bed blowing his nose in a napkin william fitz alan was the next to go head down face wet each day brought more of them roberts friends and vassals robert had insisted that longtime servants be admitted too and menatarms whod bled for him and would have died for him now if given the chance the men usually withdrew at sunset that was the familys time ranulf knew the priests would not go far thoughjust in case few kings had so many clerics at their deathbeds but robert had been one of the churchs most generous benefactors hed founded a benedictine priory in bristol established a cistercian abbey at margam in south wales and hed shown particular favor to the abbeys of tewkesbury and gloucester and neath gilbert foliot and abbot roger of tewkesbury were in daily attendance praying first for roberts recovery and then when the doctors could not bring down his fever for his immortal soul ranulf had seen fever scramble a mans wits but so far robert remained conscious and coherent after hed been shriven of his earthly sins hed made his will provided for alms to the poor asked to be buried at his bristol priory and sought promises from his liegemen that theyd be as loyal to his son as theyd been to him he was dying ranulf thought as hed lived competently and quietly and with dignity and holy god above what would they do without him amabel was sitting on the bed beside her husband his hand clasped in hers when she was not bending over to whisper private endearments or encouragements she was watching his heaving chest almost as if she were willing his every breath she was younger than robert whod celebrated his fiftyseventh birthday that summer but she seemed to have aged years in a matter of days ranulf could not look long upon her face so naked was her grief maude was standing by the bed silent tears were spilling over again she made no attempt to wipe them away did not even seem to notice roberts children were clustered at the foot of the bed as if afraid to stray too far rogers pallor was accentuated by his dark priestly garb but it was the son not the priest who occasionally choked back a sob hamons eyes were redrimmed his shoulders hunched and fists knotted in a futile defiance of death and will sat frozen upon a coffer hed dragged near the bed he was about to come into his own into great wealth and power but he looked dazed like a man soon to be cast adrift with no land in sight there were missing faces in the circle loved ones whose absence grew more ominous as roberts strength waned brien was under siege again at wallingford roberts second son richard was in normandy rainald in cornwall maud was on her way from wales and they all took great care not to mention philip the room was shuttered against the cooling evening air but ranulf could still hear a muffled pealing in the distance the churches of bristol were tolling passing bells for their stricken lord on this all hallows eve getting wearily to his feet he approached the bed robert had been sleeping for much of the day ranulf knew he should be glad for roberts sake that they were so close to the end but he also knew hed have done whatever he could to gain robert more time even if it prolonged his suffering his brothers face was gaunt burning with false feverish color his hair soaked in sweat a thin white scar angled up into his hairline passing strange but ranulf could not remember ever noticing it before how could he have missed it now hed never know how robert had gotten it why that should matter so much he could not explain but suddenly it didenormously reaching over he gently touched amabels shoulder as their eyes met she drew a shuddering breath and covered his hand with her own her skin was hot and her fingers had a perceptible tremor when they looked back toward the bed roberts eyes were open are you thirsty love it was not so much a question as entreaty so great was amabels need to do something for him when he nodded maude turned swiftly toward the table poured hastily and thrust a dripping cup into amabels hand ranulf watched as amabel helped robert to drink tears filling his eyes robert saw and when his whisper drew ranulf closer he said faintly but distinctly notnot just my little brother the others may not have understood but ranulf did and his throat closed up robert was saying what theyd both always known that the bond between them was more than brotherly he could have been one of roberts own sons and he would mourn robert all his days as hed never mourned his father swallowing tears he sought in vain to steady his voice enough to respond roberts eyelids were drooping again and when maude whispered wretchedly ranulf were losing him he could only nod wordlessly it was then that the door burst open a mantled hooded figure flew toward the bed papa papa its me jerking back her hood maud turned a white anguished face toward her mother for the love of god mama tell me im not too late she sank to her knees by the bed as roberts lashes flickered searching for his hand midst the coverlets he no longer had the strength to talk but his eyes sent her the only message that matteredone of recognition maud sobbed in relief then cried out sharply randolph hurry that turned all heads toward the door so intent were they upon the bedside drama theyd not noticed that the earl of chester had followed his wife into the chamber dressed in somber colors his demeanor no less decorous he greeted amabel gravely then stepped forward to pay his respects to his dying fatherinlaw his courtesy was flawless and so rarely seen that his audience could not help marveling at it for he was not a man to care about propriety ranulf and maude exchanged speculative glances never doubting that his wifes grief was not enough motivation to get him to join in roberts deathbed vigil there had to be more to it and when he turned then toward maude kissing her hand with ostentatious deference they knew what it was this was chesters dramatic declaration of good faith public proof that he was now dedicated to the angevin cause an ally to be trusted in the war against stephen maud tore herself away from the bed to embrace her mother randolph she repeated urgently where is she still playing the role of the attentive husband he jerked the door open and a moment later ushered a young woman from the stairwell maud reached out and when the wet nurse placed a small swaddled bundle into her arms she swung back toward the bed look papa she pleaded look at your first grandson robert did and even as she saw the light dimming in his eyes maud was sure that hed understood and died trying to smile at her son november swept october away in a deluge of earlywinter rain which did not slacken as the week wore on london began to resemble a city under siege by nature its citizens ventured outofdoors only when they had no choice the streets soon looked like deserted swamps and the rainswollen thames became the enemy in their midst threatening to flood with each high tide a fire roared in the hearth of the kings chamber in the uppermost story of the tower keep but it could not banish the damp only held it briefly at bay although it was midafternoon the sky was smothered in so many rainclouds that the days dull light was already ebbing away and stephen his wife and william de ypres had pulled their chairs close to the fire i took care to mention no names will but ive been consulting physicians about your stephen paused tactfully your problem no need for such delicacy my liege say it straight out that im fast going blind ypres smiled as he spoke but it was a smile to make both stephen and matilda wince but that is just it will stephen said earnestly there might be hope for you according to the doctors there is a means of treating your sort of eye ailment youre losing your sight because a film is forming over your eyes like a cloud passing across the sun by taking a needlepreferably a gold oneand sticking it into the white part of the eyeball on the edge of what they call thethe cornea it is possible to pierce the film and once the pupil becomes black again youll regain your sight stephen had carefully memorized what the doctors had told him so that he might properly explain it to ypres but he saw now that his efforts had been wasted matilda could not repress a squeamish shudder and ypres was shaking his head with another of those ghastly grimacing smiles ive heard about that procedure he said it is usually performed by traveling doctors who go from town to town offering their services to those in need of miracles sometimes it even seems to work and the patient can see againat least long enough for the doctor to collect his fee and move on no my liege it was good of you to bother on my behalf but id have to be crazed as well as blind ere id let any man plunge a needle into my eye ill admit it sounds stomachchurning will but i wish youd at least talk to the doctors we could send to arundel for adelizas physician a man named serlo said to be as good a healer as youll find in all of england or there is robert beaumonts physician known as peter the clerk no even then stephen would have persevered had he not caught matildas eye as you wish he said reluctantly there is just one more thing i want to say and then well speak no more on it i value your counsel will no less than your swordarm there is probably not a man alive who knows more than you do about battle lore and siege warfare when you first revealed your ailment you said you might go back to flanders i would hope that youll stay here where you are so needed it was one of the few times theyd seen the fleming with his defenses down reacting without the jaded cynicism that served so well as his shield he cleared his throat faked a cough and muttered gruffly that hed stay then matilda rose let her hand rest lightly on his shoulder for a moment smiling over his head at her husband the door banged open without warning so loudly that they all jumped ive been looking all over the tower for you papa eustace we thought you were staying in winchester for another week lad i was but eustace youre soaked clean through come over to the fire and dry off eustace frowned impatiently but allowed his mother to steer him toward the hearth when she insisted then that he remove his wet mantle stephen intervened with a grin i think the lad has something to tell us tilda for he looks about to burst go on eustace give us your news did you hear about robert fitz roy that he is ailing stephen nodded yes we heard but he is dead eustace interrupted unable to wait any longer papa he is dead they did not react as hed hoped instead of being jubilant they seemed dubious are you sure lad stephen asked slowly when i was stricken with that fever at northampton rumor had me dead and buried about twice a day till i recovered and this is no rumor uncle henry sent a spy to bristol to find out if his malady was lifethreatening and he wellnigh rode his horse to death getting back with his news robert died on friday last the st of october soon after compline the entire town is in mourning people weeping in the streets and grieving as if theyd lost their holy saviourthe fools ill be damned ypres murmured he and robert were of an age and the sudden death of his old adversary was an unwelcome reminder of his own mortality shaking it off he forced a laugh and it was not even my birthday eustace laughed too ill get us wine he offered so we can celebrate in proper fashion on balance he was disappointed by their tepid response to such momentous news his mother was making the sign of the cross and his father had yet to say a word eustace glanced gratefully at ypres at least he understood raising his cup he said lets drink to robert fitz royand his speedy descent into the hottest depths of hell robert is not likely to go to hell lad stephen said for all our differences he was a man of honour honour eustace echoed indignantly what honour is there in trying to steal our throne jesu papa do you never speak ill of anyone i suppose youd even find some good to say of the devil stephen lowered his wine cup to stare at his son id hardly equate robert fitz roy with the devil he objected sounding more hurt than angry a man can be our enemy eustace and still be a decent sort eustaces lip twitched he seemed about to retort when ypres said coolly fitz roy was a worthy foe we can be glad that he is dead without making a monster of him eustace flushed and gulped the rest of his drink matilda could not help noticing that he was stung by ypress rebuke not stephens and she sighed softly that poor woman she said and her son looked at her in disgusted disbelief not you too mama jesus god how can you muster up even a shred of pity for maude after all she watch your tone when you speak to your mother matilda reached over putting her hand on her husbands arm i do not think eustace realized how rude he soundeddid you eustace she said evenly waiting until he gave a shamefaced shake of his head as it happens i was not speaking of maude i was thinking of roberts widow after forty years as the mans wife she must be utterly bereft a strained silence filled the room stephen glanced from one to the other not liking what he found his wife looked very pensive a sure sign she was troubled ypres was deliberately noncommittal and eustace was sullen stephens eyes lingered on his son without meaning to theyd let the lad down hed come hellforleather from winchester with his news thinking he was bringing them a wonderful gift only to have them not even bother to unwrap it this is a day well always remember he said as heartily as he could your news changes everything lad chesters defection no longer matters now for maude is burying the one man she could not afford to lose her claim to the english crown breathed its last when robert did it is over at long last it is over devizes england january so it is overjust like that no regrets no looking back sail off into the sunsetwhat a simple way to end a war a pity we did not think of this ere so many men died for you but better late than ranulf enough maude was livid i did not say it was over it will never be over not as long as i draw breath and you of all men ought to know that but we can no longer remain in england and you ought to know that too dear god ranulf do you think i want to go back to normandy back to geoffrey what more proof can you have of my resolve than thisthat i am forcing myself to do something so repugnant this is a strategic retreat not an abdication you can talk all you want about continuing the fight from normandy but that is what it isjust talk if we flee england we are conceding defeat conceding the crown to stephen that is not so i would never abandon my son never harry has geoffrey to fight for him in normandy he needs you to fight for him in england but youve grown weary of war tired of the struggle no then why are you using roberts death as an excuse to give up to run away if you do that then what has it been forthe sacrifices and the battles and the dyingall for what maude was stunned by the attack shed never seen him like this all nerve ends and raw rage you are not being fair ranulf whether you want to admit it or not roberts death changed everything mayhap for you but not for me when she would have argued further he flung up his hand there is nothing more to be said if you are set upon deserting those who fought and bled for you i cannot stop you but do not expect me to follow you and do not expect me to forgive you she stared after him in shock too angry and hurt to call him back rainald was still groggy for hed not slept well the night before maude youre not making sense you say he is gone gone where if i knew that she said impatiently id not need your help after you went up to bed last night ranulf and i had a terrible argument i told him that i dared not remain in england now that robert was dead the dangers are so obvious it never occurred to me that he might not understand but he flared up in a wild rage accused me of betrayal and cowardice and god knows what else and then slammed out of the room as if it were on fire rainald blinked sleepily youre still not making sense ranulf has always had a good head on his shoulders surely he sees how precarious your position has become i like will well enough but he could no more fill roberts shoes than he could get himself elected pope brien has a plateful of his own troubles and that whelp of miless is too green to be much help in fending off stephen ranulf knows all that not being a fool so why is he balking ranulfis in a lot of pain maude said reluctantly she did not feel she had the right to give away ranulfs secrets rainald nodded knowingly he always did think robert could walk with the angels but why are you so distraught about all this so you quarreled and he went off in a sulk hell be back once his temper cools and then no maude interrupted i do not think he is coming back he said nary a word to me he just rode away at first light was long gone by the time i sought him out to make our peace what makes you think he is not coming back he gave his dogs away rainald sat up abruptly are you sure about that maude he gave his breeding pair to hugh de plucknet and his young bitch to luke he took only loth and rode away without a backward glance now you tell me rainald does that sound like a man whos just gone off to sulk no he admitted no it does not wellwhat we must do is figure out where he is likely to have gone you gave him several manors here in wiltshire so we ought to send a man there first what about that friend of his gilbert fitzwhatever ah no he was killed i forgot waiti have it ill wager that well find him at chester with maud and if he is what then i go and bring him back of course after a moment to reflect though rainald realized how impractical that would be i guess i cannot drag him back by the scruff of the neck he conceded sowhat do you want to do there is not much i can do rainald if we can find him i can write and entreat him to return otherwise i can only hope hell come back of his own accord you dare not wait too long maude i know she said i know maude stood on the battlements of arundel castle watching as rainald rode away a grey february fog had rolled in from the sea and he and his men were soon swallowed up in it maude did not move though until adeliza tugged at her arm urging her back inside maude had chosen to sail from arundel so she might bid adeliza farewell it was also a closing of the circle a means of punishing herself for her failure ending up where she had begun adeliza was embroidering as they talked her needle flashing in the firelight maude had offered to help but now her own sewing lay forgotten in her lap the more she studied adeliza the less she liked what she saw the other woman was pale even for february and alarmingly thin always inclining toward the voluptuous she seemed almost gaunt now maudes first reaction was to ascribe these troubling changes to the travails of the birthing chamber in the eleven years since shed wed william daubigny shed been almost constantly pregnant giving birth to seven surviving children and two stillborn you are not with child again are you maude asked uneasily for at adelizas ageher own fortysixchildbed was all too often a womans deathbed too adeliza cast her an oddly secretive sideways look then shook her head but you are ailing maude persisted and this time she got no denial adeliza sewed in silence for several moments while maude waited to see if more information would be forthcoming when it was not she reached over and touched the other womans wrist ill not pry she promised but whatever you choose to tell me will never leave this chamber adeliza continued to stitch but color had risen in her cheeks they were speaking german the language of their youth and the words themselves called up memories of an old intimacy did i ever tell you maude about the flemish monastery founded by my lord father it is at affligham near alost has a house for monks and one for nuns my brother has written to me that he is thinking of taking holy vows there it is my heartfelt wish to do the same maude was speechless so great was her surprise it was not at all uncommon for widows to retire to a convent to end their days but adeliza was a wife and a happily wedded one or so maude had thought and if she renounced the world shed be renouncing her children too the youngest still a babe in her cradle the oldest not yet nine maude could easily understand a womans urge to abandon the marital bed so too could she comprehend the appeal of the cloister so orderly and serene and reassuring in its very simplicity but she could never have turned her back upon her childrennot even for god floundering for words she said hesitantly what does will think of this adeliza you would have to get his permission ere the church could accept you would you not yes adeliza kept her eyes upon her work a cushion adorned with delicately drawn roses he thinks it is a foolish female whim one that will pass but it will not are you truly sure this is what you want adeliza you seemed so contented with will maude paused but adeliza ignored the hint maude watched her in bafflement then tried again and what of your children they are so young little more than babies i am a queen not a cotters wife there are more than enough hands to tend to their needs to see that they want for nothing do not make it sound as if i am forsaking my family maude i have been as good a wife and mother as i know how i did no less for your father as his consort and his queen and i was a dutiful daughter marrying as my father bade me i have always done what was expected of me nowin the time remaining to mei would follow my own heart i was right then you are ill yes adeliza said calmly but you must not grieve for me maude death is just the door to life everlasting maude frowned struggling with her pain and her rebellious instincts she knew nothing of surrender you are very dear to me she said at last and you must let me help you her mind was racing although not fast enough to outrun her grief a doctorshe would find adeliza the best doctor in all of christendom but almost at once she remembered master serlo adelizas personal physician if he could not help her no mortal healer could do you want me to talk with will mayhap i could persuade him to let you take the veil adeliza concealed a smile for maude had hardly endeared herself to will would probably be the last one hed be likely to heed it helps she said to know that you understand and then raised her head inquiringly for a servant was hovering in the doorway there is a visitor he said deferentially for the empress and maudes lacerated heart took a sudden joyful jump ranulf but the man eventually ushered into the chamber was brien fitz count it was the first time that theyd been alone in a long while maude wished that shed had some warning wished that shed had time to prepare herself wished that she were not wearing this drab dark gown you got my letter then she asked and at once felt foolish for why else would he have come to arundel yes i did he said just as needlessly did ranulf come back no and we had no luck in finding him rainald and maud have promised to let me know if they hear from him id be grateful if you would too of course i will he looked tired and sounded dispirited i do not understand about this fallingout with ranulf it does not seem like him at all ranulf gave up a great deal to support my claims to the english crown and nownow he fears it was all for nothing no he said it was not for nothing removing his mantle he moved toward her you saw maud he said and rainald and youve come to arundel to bid adeliza farewell but you were going to leave without seeing me maude swallowed she could feel her face getting hot but she owed him the truththis once i could not brien it would have been too painful are you sorry then that i came no she said softly no i have something for you reaching into his tunic he drew out a soft pouch it was finely stitched in her favorite shade of green with silken drawstrings nestled within was a small coin threaded upon a delicate gold chain maudes eyes misted as she gazed down at the keepsake a silver penny minted at bristol in her image with her name and title engraved in latin around the rim lady of the english the queen who might have been thank you she whispered thank you brien he hesitated and then gave her one last gifthis jealousy are you going back to geoffrey she did not pretend to misunderstand not if i can help it her fingers clenched around the silver coin i have no choice brien but to go when robert died it all started to crumble it was only a matter of time until id have fallen into stephens hands and what good could i do henry from an english prison i was even in danger of losing devizes wed seized it from stephen but hed taken it from the bishop of salisbury and the new bishop is now demanding its return to the church ranulf accused me of losing heart but i did not i swear i did not i am not giving up i know that so does ranulf you are doing what you mustfor your sons sake there is nothing youd not sacrifice for henry the corner of his mouth curved in a melancholy smile who would understand that better than me maude shook her head do not make me sound heroic brien there is nothing heroic in defeat nothing admirable in failure you did not fail maude no then why am i fleeing this accursed country like a thief in the night more than eight years and god alone knows how many deaths and what have i to show for it all normandy he said succinctly and do not tell me that was geoffreys doing for you made it possible you kept stephen so busy defending himself that you gave geoffrey the time he needed to win normandy that was as much your triumph as it was geoffreys do not let him tell you otherwise she summoned up an unconvincing smile i was never one for listening to geoffrey she said thank youfor your abiding friendship and your faith in me your faith in henry he is not old enough not yet but he will come back hell lay claim to our crown and he will prevail i never doubted that he said for what son of yours could ever lack courage or fortitude hell be back for certes but you will notwill you no she admitted i will not england may not have broken my spirit brien but it did break my heart it was a feeble attempt at a joke holding too much truth for humor and to her dismay she found she could no longer blink back her tears when he reached for her she did not pull away and they stood for a long time in a wordless embrace while the fire burned down and the shadows advanced for night was coming on sleet was pelting the beach and the ship rocked from side to side as adelizas men pushed it out of the shallows then splashed hastily back to shore maude clung to the gunwale with a whitefaced minna standing resolutely at her side alexander de bohun william marshal and the others were already heading for the canvas tent and maude now insisted that minna seek shelter too go on she urged it looks like a rough crossing waves were starting to break over the bow back on the beach the wind was blowing sand about and buffeting the onlookers most of them servants from the castle and curious villagers they soon were in retreat until only three hardy souls remained brien and adeliza and hugh de plucknet whod wed an english heiress but insisted upon seeing maude safely to arundel she would miss hugh so many she would miss so many she mourned the sky was as grey as the sea splattered with clouds the sleet stung her face and her eyes blurred as the shore started to recede adeliza and hugh were trudging toward their horses but brien still stood at the waters edge staring after the ship maude was trembling with the cold but she stayed there on the pitching deck until the blue of briens mantle was no longer visible and england began to fade into the distance canterbury england march matilda knelt before the high altar in the cathedral church of the holy trinity and prayed for peace the choir was chilled and damp but she stayed on her knees until her back began to ache she should have been happy for fortune seemed to be favoring stephen at last there were rumors as yet unconfirmed that maude was preparing to leave england matilda herself was fulfilling a longcherished desire shed acquired thirteen acres of land from the canons of holy trinity aldgate so that she could establish a hospital to treat londons poor and pray for the souls of her dead children and she and stephen had finally been able to go ahead with their plans to found a cluniac abbey at faversham but her satisfaction was shadowed by stephens continuing quarrel with the archbishop of canterbury a clash of will made all the more ominous by the new popes obvious sympathy for the angevin cause archbishop theobalds intransigence was all the more infuriating to stephen because he saw it as rank ingratitude he and matilda had done their utmost to secure the see of canterbury for him at stephens brother henrys expense stephen had long insisted that theobald was much too quick to acknowledge maude after the battle of lincoln and hed soon convinced himself that theobald was a secret angevin partisan theobald was after all once the abbot of bec the monastery that maude favored above all others and when theobald had hastened over to paris last may to meet with the pope geoffrey of anjou had just happened to be there too coincidence or conspiracy stephen was sure he knew the answer matilda had been less suspicious loath to think ill of so pious and godly a churchman but she was no longer so willing to give the archbishop the benefit of every doubt not since the furor over the york see the pope had deposed the current archbishop of york stephens nephew and then chose his own candidate who thus became the first english archbishop ever to be consecrated without the consent of the king to stephen it was a slap in the faceand theobald had delivered it for hed supported the pope wholeheartedly exercising his considerable influence on behalf of the popes man stephen had been provoked into taking drastic action of his own urged on by his brother who blamed theobald for thwarting his reappointment as papal legate when the pope summoned englands bishops and abbots to a church council at rheims in march stephen forbade the clerics to attend warned that theobald meant to defy the ban stephen had then taken his court to canterbury and put his ports under guard but theobald managed to slip through the royal net accompanied only by one of his young clerks thomas becket hed arranged to board a small fishing boat in a secluded cove and survived a perilous channel crossing to be accorded a heros welcome by the pope and his fellow clerics matilda sympathized with stephens indignation but she was troubled by this widening breach with the church no good could come of it making the sign of the cross she rose wearily to her feet she tired more easily these days than she was willing to admit even to cecily who awaited her now in the nave she should have said a prayer for cecily too for all her attempts to find the other woman a worthy husband had come to naught most men were leery of cecilys falling sickness her fits scared them more than her marriage portion tempted them the only ones who seemed willing to take advantage of matildas generosity were not the sort of men likely to make cecily content and matildas disappointment was tainted by guilt for in a small selfish corner of her soul she was glad that cecily remained unwed so deeply had she come to rely upon the younger womans loyalty and devotion as they left the church it began to rain and they quickened their steps a sheltered passage led from the cloisters to the archbishop of canterburys great hall sparing them the worst of the weather shaking moisture from their mantles they hastened into the hall and then stopped in surprise for a raucous celebration seemed to be in progress trailed by a puzzled cecily matilda made her way toward the dais just hours earlier the atmosphere in the hall had been as cheerless as the rain for theyd learned only that morning of the archbishops daring escape what matilda wondered could have happened to dispel all the gloom as she tried to catch stephens eye she was grabbed from behind and found herself enveloped in a breathstealing bear hug her son was grinning down at her at eighteen he was already as tall as his father and towered over the diminutive matilda she is gone mama he laughed the bitch is gone are you sure eustace he nodded and steered her protectively toward the dais she sailed for normandy a fortnight ago we ought to have heard ere this too often papa is poorly served but all that matters now is that maude is no longer a threat my only regret is that she never had to answer for her sins i doubt that she came away unscathed from this war eustace no one did matilda said and held out her hand to her husband reaching down he swung her up onto the dais as jubilant as their son for the passing years had tempered neither his capacity for exuberant rejoicing nor his faith in happy endings it took us more than eight years tilda to drive maude from our shores but she has finally gone back where she belongsto geoffreyand i am not sure which of them i pity the more i am so glad she avowed so very glad that it is finally over but honesty compelled her to add a realistic qualifier at least until maudes son is old enough to renew the war her men regarded her indulgently she would always remain earthbound as they soared up toward the heavens and whilst they pitied her lack of wings they could not teach her to fly i may have to borrow money occasionally stephen joked but i flatout refuse to borrow trouble maudes son is but a raw lad not worth losing sleep over you worry too much mama how much danger can maudes meagre whelp be eustace scoffed with men as with horses breeding always tells indeed it does stephen agreed smiling fondly at his prideful heir hed long wanted to follow the continental practice have eustace crowned in his lifetime what better way to please his son and secure the succession and what better time than now with maude in exile and her supporters in disarray matilda smiled at them both it would be so wonderful she said wistfully to have peace at last henry is royal manor at quevilly a suburb of rouen was adjacent to notredamedupre a priory of the great benedictine abbey of bec upon her arrival in normandy maude chose to lodge in guest quarters at the priory rather than at her fathers palace or in rouens formidable castle and it was here that she was reunited with her husband after a separation of more then eight years they were alone minna had reluctantly withdrawn giving geoffrey a baleful glance that catapulted him back in time a time he did not want to remember much less relive reaching for a wine flagon he offered maude wine and a sardonic smile i see the english climate has not mellowed your minna any maude accepted the wine ignored the sarcasm outwardly composed inwardly she felt hollow so tense it actually hurt to breathe much of it was nervous anticipation at seeing her sons again but it was geoffrey too just the sight of him brought back too many ugly memories churned up old emotions that had been stagnant becalmed during her years in england why could this man disquiet her so why did she let him there was no longer a need for pretense for the polite conversation theyd exchanged in front of the prior and minna queries about health condolences over roberts death those little courtesies that society expected of a man and woman nigh on twenty years wed geoffrey sat down in a highbacked chair stretching long legs toward the hearth it surprised her that he still looked so young but why not he was only thirtyfour she felt so much older decades older geoffrey was regarding her over the rim of his wine cup an old trick of his one that invariably made her shift selfconsciously since you chose to stay with the monks at the priory rather than with me at the castle he said dryly i suppose that is your subtle way of hinting that you are not overeager to sleep in our marriage bed maude sipped her wine i can assure you geoffrey that i want to be in your bed just as much as you want to have me there an eyebrow shot up another familiar mannerism a jestfrom you you have changed dear heart jesu i hope so she said with such intensity that he stopped in the act of pouring more wine and stared at her i do not want to go back to the battlefield that was our marriage and i cannot believe that you do either geoffrey i do not want to be held hostage to memories anymore or to keep paying for past mistakes i want she faltered then for what did she want of this man her husband her intimate enemy poisoner of her peace but how long ago it all seemed what had happened to that wronged young wife so choked with helpless hatred england had happened can it be he said that you are offering to make peace maude she swallowed a sharp retort and if i am you ask too much but he was smiling faintly suppose we start with a trucesee how many days that lasts his humor still held its buried barbs they did not sting as much though as she remembered ill try if you will geoffrey setting her wine cup down she leaned forward tell me of our sons they are good lads for the most part geoff has a temper and will is somewhat lazy has to be prodded as for harrys flawswell i need only remind you of last year when he decided that invading england would be a marvelous way to get through the boredom of lent but why not judge for yourself maude stiffened they are here you brought them the younger lads harry had gone off into town but i left him word that youd arrived rising he looked down at her and she realized that some things would never change she still had no idea what he was thinking but when he smiled it caught unexpectedly at her heart for it was so like henrys smile what of her younger sons would their smiles be familiar too would they know her for so long shed yearned for this reunion so why did she feel so nervous he was holding out his hand i am ready she lied and let him help her to her feet what shocked maude the most was that she would not have recognized her own son when shed last seen will he was a chubbycheeked child of three and that was the image shed kept in her mind for the past eight and a half years but that little boy was forever lost to her replaced by a russethaired stripling in his twelfth year as skittish as a young colt geoffreyor geoff as hed brusquely corrected herwas no less unfamiliar for great was the gap too between a fiveyearold and one not far off from fourteen geoff had the same fair coloring as his brothers bright curly hair a sprinkling of freckles and wideset grey eyes no matter how troubled her marriage had been not even maudes most virulent enemies could ever have challenged geoffreys paternity geoff had some of his fathers swagger too he was leaning against the wall arms folded eyes guarded for maude had yet to recover from her initial misstep when shed remarked before she could think better of it that he bore a strong resemblance to henry geoffrey was also leaning against the wall their poses too similar for coincidence it was obvious to maude that her sons sought to emulate him in all particulars and that was not a comforting thought this was not going well not at all the boys were wary not readily tamed and conversation was painfully stilted they were just shy maude told herself and that would pass i almost forgot she said with forced cheer i brought you back presents from england putting henrys gift aside an ivory and ebony chess set she gave will his gift first a rare lodestone that acted as a magnet will seemed pleased but her present for geoff was not as successful it was a book handsomely bound in red leather the song of roland shed remembered ranulfs saying how much hed enjoyed rolands adventures as a boy geoff thanked her politely enough but then added snidely harry is the only one who likes to read and the only one with manners too geoffrey observed although hed spoken with a smile it was clearly meant as a reprimand and geoff mumbled an apology but it was geoffrey he wanted to placate not her they were strangers these sons of hers beloved strangers blessed lady mary was it not enough that shed lost her crown was she to lose her children too geoffrey was not surprised by the awkwardness of this meeting nor that will seemed so diffident geoff so sullen hed expected as much for will had no surviving memories of his mother and geoff resented what he saw as favoritism to his elder brother but what geoffrey had not expected was that he should actually feel a prickling of pity for maude laboring to bridge an eightandahalfyear gap in the space of a single afternoon they were all relieved by a sudden commotion in the outer chamber welcoming the distraction a moment later the door flew open and maudes firstborn burst in upon them mama it had been almost a year since shed seen henry last and hed taken several consequential steps toward manhood in those intervening months had he not been her own shed have guessed him to be older than fifteen for his shoulders were beginning to broaden his voice had deepened and he had none of the uncertainty the gangling awkwardness of a boy growing into a mans body he seemed to have bypassed that stage altogether but he still looked blessedly familiar and blessedly at ease with her as he demonstrated now by striding forward eagerly and giving her a hearty welcoming hug with henry there conversation no longer flickered like a spent candle it flared brightly feeding upon his enthusiasm his obvious pleasure in having his mother home during the next hour the talk ranged far afield touching upon a variety of topics maudes voyage from arundel memories of robert archbishop theobalds dramatic arrival at rheims henrys new stallion the latest news from the holy land a bloody massacre of german crusaders by the infidel turks the popes proposed elevation of their ally abbot gilbert foliot to the bishopric of hereford an action sure to outrage stephen for it always came back to that to stephen and a stolen crown id hoped to hold out for a few more years until you were old enough to confront stephen yourself maude told her son and geoffrey could only marvel for implicit in her apology was an admission of failure he almost made a gibe about her newfound humility remembered their tenuous truce just in time henry had turned aside to let will show him how the magnet worked but at his mothers regretful words he glanced up with a quick smile youve nothing to reproach yourself for mama without uncle robert how could you have continued the war but what you began i will finish maude had assumed that years must pass before henry could mount a serious challenge to stephens sovereignty looking now at her son though she realized that shed not long keep him in normandy he was already racing headlong toward manhood and his destiny to be decided upon an english battlefield it seemed such a cruel irony that shed finally gotten him back only to have to let him go much too soon picking up geoffs discarded book henry began to leaf through it and the book immediately became a gift of great value to his brother he tried to snatch it back and a brief scuffle ensued which revealed to maude that henry liked to tease and that geoffs jealousy was a banked fire ready to flare up at the least provocation theirs was a bond much in need of mending if it was not already too late geoffrey ought to have taught them better but then what did he and helie know of brotherly love it saddened her that her sons should be rivals not the steadfast allies her own brothers had been almost as if hed read her thoughts henry said suddenly where is uncle ranulf i assumed uncle rainald would stay behind in cornwall but surely uncle ranulf came back with you nohe did not henrys disappointment was keen for ranulf was his favorite uncle why not i do not understand mama where is he then i do not know lad maude admitted unhappily i do not know cheshire england march ranulf was not sure where he wassomewhere along the cheshireshropshire borderbut it did not really matter since he did not care where he ended up like a ship that had snapped its moorings he just went wherever the wind blew him when hed ridden away from devizes castle in such a rage hed wanted only to put as many miles between himself and his past as possible but he could outrun neither his grief nor his guilt and after a fortnight of aimless wandering hed realized what he needed to do if he was ever to have any peace of mind again it was what he ought to have done as soon as he learned of gilberts death he had to face gilberts widow and ask her forgiveness it had taken him a week to gird himself for it and then another week to find her for shed returned to her fathers manor near hereford but if hed hoped for absolution hed come to the wrong woman ellas widowhood was too new to allow for perspective too wretched to allow for mercy anger was easier than acceptance and she blamed ranulf gilbert had confided in her about ranulfs clandestine affair with annora fitz clement and she reasoned that if not for his illfated passion for another mans wife her husband would not have died and ranulf could not argue with her for he believed that too afterward he truly was a lost soul hed slowly drifted toward the north indifferent to direction or destination rousing himself only enough to make a wide detour as he neared shrewsbury eventually he would run out of money although robert had bequeathed him a generous legacy and he still held the wiltshire manors maude had given him he would have to return to claim them and that he was not yet able to do and so he continued his erratic odyssey through a countryside blighted by war no longer even sure what he was fleeing sure only that he could not go back on this blustery march monday in lent hed covered less than ten miles for the night before he had drunk too much picked up a prostitute and tried to blot out his pain with cheap red wine and bought caresses all it gained him was a miserable morningafter the worst headache of his life and an ugly scene with the girl whod sought to steal his purse while he slept hours later he still felt queasy and shaken his head was throbbing hed not been able to tolerate the weight of his hauberk and for most of the day the mere thought of food was repellant by midafternoon hed begun looking for lodgings but the few villages he passed through were no more than hamlets and chester was at least fifteen miles away if not more he was beginning to think hed have to bed down out in the open when he encountered an elderly shepherd tending a handful of scrawny sheep the man was fearful at first for strangers were suspect in these parts the border shires had never known much peace but the fact that ranulf spoke english reassured the shepherd somewhat and after hed stopped loth from chasing off the mans mangy dog he got the directions he needed ahead lay the hamlet of broxton where a narrow lane forked off from the chester road toward the west if he followed it for a few miles hed reach the village of farndon and the priest there would put him up for the night it was a relief to know there would be a bed at the end of his journey for the wind was rising and dusk settling in ranulf kept a wary eye on the sky as he rode getting rained upon would be the final indignity of this utterly dismal day off to the side of the road he caught sight of a grove of alder trees and he guided his stallion toward them for alder trees were usually found near water after dismounting he led his horse forward waiting while it drank its fill loth had ranged on but ranulf didnt worry knowing the dyrehund would not go far kneeling by the pond he splashed water onto his face and then cupped his hands so he could drink too a watering hole just off a main road was a bandits dream come true an ideal place to ambush thirsty travelersand ranulf should have known that he did know that but his hangover had dulled his caution as well as his senses oblivious of his surroundings he did not notice as the men emerged stealthily from hiding only when his stallion snorted in alarm did he look up and by then it was too late they were almost upon him and before he could get to his feet one of them lunged forward an upraised cudgel poised to strike ranulf flung himself sideways and the cudgel missed by inches so close that he felt a rush of air on his face as it plunged downward kicking out he was lucky enough to rip the other mans leg with his spur and the man jumped backward with a startled oath that gave ranulf enough time to regain his feet but not to draw his sword it was only halfway out of the scabbard when the second bandit struck the blow was hard enough to stagger him but he felt no pain and did not realize at first that hed been stabbed not until he saw the bloodied blade of the outlaws dagger there were three of them and they knew what they were about one grabbed for the reins of ranulfs horse the other two closed in on ranulf he yelled for loth then grappled with the man brandishing the cudgel a deadly sort of dance ensued in which he struggled with one assailant while trying at the same time to keep the mans body between him and the knifewielder for a few frenzied moments he actually managed it immobilizing the one man in a bear hug fending off the others thrusting dagger the third man was still trying to stop the frightened stallion from bolting but hed soon join the fray too desperation had lent ranulf strength but there was blood on both men his blood and he was being forced away from the pond exposing his back to the knife the second bandit saw his chance and moved in for the kill the light was fading and ranulf did not see what happened next the man seemed to trip for suddenly he was not there anymore ranulf heard a scream snarling and then the sounds of a wild struggle as the outlaw and loth thrashed about in the shadows but ranulfs reprieve was brief he was weakening fast and when his boot slipped in the mud he went over backward into the pond his assailant landed on top of him hed lost his cudgel in the fall but wasted no time groping for it in the shallows instead he grabbed ranulfs hair and shoved his head under the water ranulf fought frantically to get free but each time he gulped a lungful of air he was pushed under again the water was rapidly turning red and then black and he was spiraling down into that darkness unable to break his fall he was almost unconscious when the killers grip slackened but his body fought to survive even as his brain clouded and he battled his way back to the surface back to life gasping for breath he had no strength to resist when he was seized again as easy to drown as a newborn kitten he choked and sputtered and sucked in as much air as he could in the moments he had left but he was not being pushed down into the ponds depths another bandit had waded into the water was dragging him toward the shore it made no sense to him in his minds eye he saw himself rolling clear scrambling to his feet getting away instead he vomited weakly into the wet grass bracing for the bite of steel as the outlaws blade found his throat easy man easy the voice was friendly the words french hed heard his attackers as they sought to subdue him their speech guttural and oathladen and unmistakably english making an enormous effort ranulf turned over onto his back the bandits were gone in the deepening dusk he could make out the blurred outlines of a peddlers cart blocking the road a muscular youth stood several feet away a hefty club in one hand a chain in the other at the end of the chain was one of the most fearsome dogs ranulf had ever seen as broadchested as a mastiff as black as the darkening sky a second stranger was kneeling by ranulfs side as their eyes met he repeated easy now youve swallowed half the pond and youre bleeding badly but the danger is past those craven knaves took off like rabbits id like to think the mere sight of my brother and me was enough to strike fear into their evil souls but i suspect it was cain there who put them to flight he chuckled and then gave an exclamation of dismay what are you doing just lie still get your breath back ranulf ignored him my dogwhere is my dog the youth in the shadows moved forward as ranulf struggled to sit up over there he said pointing off toward his right there is naught you can do for him though hes dead no ranulf exclaimed no unable to rise he crawled over to his dog loth lay on his side tongue protruding the fur on his chest matted and dark with blood ranulfs rescuers had followed were urging him away from the body ranulf never heard them cradling loths head in his lap he buried his face in the dogs ruffled fur and wept ranulf awoke to pain and a wrenching sense of loss he remembered at once the ambush by the pond his panic as his lungs filled with water bursting for air loths death but that was his last memory holding the dyrehunds limp lifeless body in his arms after that nothing opening his eyes he squinted up into midday sunlight he was outdoors wrapped in blankets before a smoking fire wrapped too in makeshift bandages the pain had begun to recede but never had he felt so weak he willed himself to move again propping up on his elbow so he could look around his movement attracted immediate attention a low growl disturbingly close at hand a quick down cain and then josce hes awake last nights good samaritan was bending over him he looked to be about ranulfs own age in his late twenties with a pleasant bluff face thick sandcolored hair and uncommonly green eyes well youre back with us at last how are you feeling never mind foolish question you look puzzled do you not remember what happened only some of it did ipass out his benefactor nodded you were set upon burying your dog even if you bled to death doing it we tried to talk some sense into you for you were hardly in any condition to be digging graves and there was always the chance those swine might come back but ill say this for you once you get an idea into your head you plough that furrow no matter what fortunately you then swooned dead awaybad choice of wordsere we had to bury you with the poor beast so we bundled you into the cart stopped your bleeding as best we could and set up camp once wed gone far enough to feel safe from pursuit raising his voice he beckoned to his brother josce fetch the man some of our dinner you need to eat even if you have to force it down ah i almost forgotwe found your horse andand i did bury the dog for you you set such store by him he paused sounding the way men often did when caught out in a kindnesssomewhat embarrassed i thought you might want this he said holding up loths leather collar ranulf took it squeezing back tears when he looked up again the youth called josce was offering a wineskin ranulf swallowed and discovered it held a pungent tart cider josce watched him drink then said from what we saw your dog chewed up that wretch something fierce ere he got stabbed that onell be limping off to hell and feeling those teeth ripping into him every time he hears a dog howl loth saved my life ranulf said and so did you id have drowned for certes if you had not come to my aid i thank almighty god for you both may he bless you with his bounty for the rest of your days josce smiled oddly as if at a private joke ranulf could not be expected to understand he was the younger of the two brothers no more than twenty and none would have taken them for kin he was taller leaner far more intense as taut as a notched bow and as ready to fire i wonder he said if the memory of your blessing will soon catch in your throat like a fish bone gagging you whenever you remember making it ranulf frowned why should it i owe you both my life how could i not be grateful josce shrugged youd best give credit where due to my softhearted brother if it had been up to me i might well have ridden by keeping my eyes on the road no you would not his brother contradicted never in this lifetime josce shrugged again mayhap not he conceded kill a weasel and every mans chickens sleep safer at night i might even have fished you out of that pond but after that id have left you to fend for yourself it was my brothers foolhardy notion to load you into our cart to tend your wounds as if you were our own kin so if thanks are owed you pay them to him not me i see ranulf said although he did not josce seemed to be going out of his way to be belligerent why josces brother was no longer smiling josce feared that if you died of your wound and were found in our cart men would blame us for your death he explained somberly but ranulf still did not understand why would you be blamed because you arepeddlers josce smiled without humor nobecause we are jews he said and laughed bitterly then at ranulfs involuntary recoil from your look of horror i assume youve never been in the company ofwhat do you gentiles like to call us the devils minions servants of satan he was not far wrong for ranulf had never had any dealings with jews he knew of them of course theyd come over to england from normandy after the conquest most were moneylenders for they were not permitted to join the craft guilds they were often accused of usury of coinclipping and sometimes suspected of profaning the eucharist stabbing the host till it bled four years ago in norwich an even more unspeakable accusation had been made that they had crucified a christian child in an unholy mockery of the passion of christ the norwich sheriff had not believed the charge taking the towns jews into the castle to shelter them from a mobs fury but his skepticism had not stopped people from flocking to the church where the boy was buried or from proclaiming him a sainted innocent a martyr to the true faith ranulf had not believed the norwich accusation either hed never shared the view so many did that the jews were christs enemies in their midst doing the devils bidding to corrupt unwary christians for if they were truly so evil he reasoned his father would not have protected them and the old king had granting them a charter which gave them the right to live freely in england to hold land to have recourse to royal justice if his father a man so quick to suspect the worst had not feared the jews why should he and yetand yet they were still aliens and infidels they might look like their christian neighbors speak french as well as any norman baron but the fact remained that they were dangerously different they rejected the concept of original sin they did not believe in the holy trinity they denied the divinity of our lord christ they faced the horror of eternal damnation without flinching without fear for their immortal souls for an unnerving moment ranulf felt an instinctive unease he was after all utterly at their mercy but then common sense reasserted itself these men had saved his life they had chased after his horse bandaged his wound even buried his dog what more proof did he demand of their goodwill i have my vices he said but ingratitude is not amongst them i admit i was taken aback merely because ive never known any jews but if it did not matter last night it ought not to matter today he smiled wryly i do not remember your asking if i was a jew ere you came to my aid i am deeply grateful to you both owe you a debt i can never repay the elder of the brothers smiled too ill settle for a name i am aaron of bristol josce as you know is my brother what do men call you ranulfranulf fitz henry ranulfs new identity was not assumed for their benefit hed stopped calling himself the kings son the day he rode away from devizes aaron and his brother were indeed peddlers as ranulf had guessed filling their cart with woolens imported from france with needles and thread and metal mirrors they routinely made the perilous journey from bristol up to chester they were on their way back to bristol when theyd stumbled onto the ambush and aaron insisted that ranulf ride with them till he recovered his strength theyd cleansed his wound with honey applied a plantain poultice to stop his bleeding they were of necessity knowledgeable in the healing arts and well supplied with lifesaving medicinal herbs but he still needed a doctors care aaron stressed for the danger of infection was always hovering close at hand fortunately the knife blade seemed to have missed any vital organs ranulf had been amazingly lucky aaron concluded and ranulf heartily concurred ranulf slept through most of the day and the night that followed the next morning they made him as comfortable in their cart as they could and headed for home they were both bristolborn andraised and very thankful that bristol had so far been spared the suffering of winchester and oxford and lincoln and the other english cities caught up in this accursed civil war aaron had a wife and young son awaiting him at home and he cheerfully passed the time extolling the virtues of his belaset and their twoyearold samuel josce walked alongside the wagon brusquely declining ranulfs offer to ride his stallion leaving it to his brother to carry the conversational burden aaron was happy to oblige and ranulf found himself being given a rare glimpse into a hitherto hidden world what surprised him the most was that it was in so many ways a familiar world too aarons concerns were those of any bristol citizen pride in his son worry over the war anxiety lest the new earl of gloucester not prove himself to be the man his father was for bristols continuing safety depended upon his strength slowly though distinctly jewish details began to emerge ranulf learned that jews did not eat pork which was considered unclean the jewish sabbath was not sunday as in the christian faith but sundown to sundown friday to saturday and dogs were not often found in jewish households their formidable cain was an object of curiosity back in the bristol jewry although aaron didnt say so ranulf was sure that the dogs name had come from josce a sardonic swipe at those who claimed all jews bore the mark of cain ranulf had never ridden in a cart before it was an experience he could have done without so jolting and rough a ride that he soon scrambled out to walk beside josce fearing that the constant jouncing might break his wound open after that aaron insisted upon pausing frequently ostensibly to rest their horse and ranulf gained new appreciation for his tact as they grew more comfortable with ranulf the brothers began to talk more frankly of politics aaron praised the old king for keeping the peace and putting his jewish brethren under the protection of the crown josce pointed out though that the king profited handsomely from the presence of the jews in his realm think of us he said sarcastically as a herd of milch cows which the king alone has the right to milk aarons opinion of stephen was one ranulf had often heard voiced in the christian community too that he was goodhearted but as easily swayed as a weather vane on the whole he said stephen was favorably disposed toward the jews but he could be most unfair when his pride was pricked by the lady empress his foe and he told ranulf of the experience of the oxford jews when the empress held the city shed imposed a levy upon the jews there and when stephen recaptured oxford he demanded that they pay three and a half times the amount of her levy as punishment for obeying her unlawful command ranulf remembered when maude had decided to impose that levy it had seemed a good way to raise muchneeded money hed never given a moments thought to oxfords hardpressed jews listening now to aaron he wished that he had they did not debate theology that was too inflammatory a subject aaron said only that jews and christians shared a belief in the same god the god of israel and by unspoken consent they ventured no further but as josce slowly thawed toward ranulf he could not resist regaling him with facts sure to startle it was eyeopening to ranulf to learn that jews were by their own laws forbidden to break bread or drink wine with gentiles obviously this was not strictly enforced for the brothers had been sharing their meals with him for two days now but it was disconcerting nonetheless he was surprised too by josces revelation that english jews no matter where they lived could be buried only in the jewish cemetery in london he had to admit that seemed like an undue burden to impose upon people already mourning a loved one what ranulf found most astonishing though was josces mischievous description of the rite of abraham which involved snipping away the foreskin from the most vulnerable part of the male anatomy by now hed discovered that josces humor was as perverse and unpredictable as geoffrey of anjous and he half suspected that he was being teased until aaron confirmed that they did indeed circumcise their young sons it was ranulf decided one more reason to be thankful hed been born into the true faith but he did not let himself pursue that line of thought he did not want to think of aaron and josce as jews for he did not want to think of them as doomed forever lost to gods grace it was a strange interlude for ranulf the first time in two months that hed formed any bond with another human being other than an occasional tumble in a harlots bed it did not seem real somehow that so much could have happenedhave changedin such a brief time that hed come so close to death that hed lost loth that a good christian could look upon jews with respect even friendship the respite ended that night though as they made ready to bed down by the fire it was then that aaron mumbled sleepily that with luck they might be able to reach shrewsbury on the morrow ranulf jerked upright brought back to reality with a jolt i cannot go to shrewsbury they sat up too regarding him curiously in the flickering firelight ranulf ive told you from the first that you need to have that wound tended by a doctor there is one in shrewsbury also a monk at their abbey said to be skilled in the use of healing herbs but well not find another one till we reach hereford or gloucester and it would not be wise to wait that long i cannot go to shrewsbury aaron wise or not i cannot why not ranulf hesitated he could not tell them about annora the unforgivable botch hed made of his life but he owed them more than evasion or rebuff i was not completely truthful with you ere this what a surprise josce murmured dryly and his brother scowled in his direction not now josce what did you lie about ranulf it was not a lie more like aa sin of omission did jews know about such things now was not the time however to elaborate upon the finer points of christian doctrine when i called myself ranulf fitz henry that was indeed my fathers given name what i omitted was his titlefitz roy there was a brief silence as they absorbed this josce whistled softly and aaron said carefully you are saying then that you are one of the old kingsnatural sons one of his bastards ranulf said bluntly no need for delicacy aaron but you see now why i cannot go into shrewsbury the town and castle are held by stephen and ive been fighting for my sister i cannot risk being recognized that had never kept him away from shrewsbury in the past an inner voice jeered but aaron and josce could not hear it and they took his excuse at face value no i suppose you cannot aaron agreed sounding worried the problem is that we have business dealings in shrewsbury mayhap if we let you off ere we reached the town and then came back for you afterward that is a right generous offer but id not impose further upon your goodwill youve a wife eager to welcome you home aaron it would be ill done on my part if i repaid your kindness by making her fret over your safe return aaron could not deny that he was impatient to get back to bristol and belaset i will not feel easy in my mind watching you go off by yourself there is a doctor in chester but that is too long and dangerous a ride on your own have you no friends or kindred closer at hand ranulf shook his head but he knew aaron was right it would indeed be foolhardy to ride all the way to chester as weak as he was and without loth to watch over him pain rippled toward the surface he resolutely pushed it back into the depths in any event he had no intention of going to chester he was not yet ready to deal with mauds curiosity orworseher pity after some reflection he had the answer william fitz alan he said triumphantly he used to be castellan of shrewsbury castle until stephen chased him out but he still holds a castle at blancminster on the welsh border id be sure of a welcome there and if he does not have a doctor in his household hell send for one best of all thered be no awkward questions no prying no pity for fitz alan was an ally not a friend as you will aaron agreed dubiously a wounded man going off into the marches alonenot a reassuring prospect but it was not his choice it was ranulfs rolling over into his blankets he comforted himself with the thought that come morning ranulf might change his mind ranulf did not though he arose determined to seek out fitz alan at blancminster and after a hurried breakfast he stood beside them in the road not sure how to say farewell how could he just ride off but he knew theyd have been insulted had he offered them money there must be something he could do for themand then he smiled for he knew what it was thanking you seems a meagre response indeed for giving me back my life i will remember you aaron and josce of bristol and wish you well all your days and ifgod forbidyou ever find yourself in trouble on one of your trips to chester get word to the countess of chester and she will come to your aid for i will let her know what you did for me she makes a good ally does my niece he said and his smile twisted awry too good an ally how selfish hed been to entangle her in his adultery but surely god would forgive her when his sin was so much greater that is most generous aaron said and josce made a jest about friends in high places but he looked pleased too it was no small boon ranulf was offering to be a jew was to ride always along the cliffs edge and in chester where no jews dwelled there would have been none to speak up for them aaron came forward josce following and they helped ranulf up into the saddle he smiled again wished them godspeed back to bristol and then turned his stallion toward the west toward wales the brothers stood in the road watching him ride away he looked back once waved and aaron waved too somewhat to his surprise so did josce i ought to have wished him good luck aaron said suddenly i wish id remembered josce nodded hell need it the welsh marches march ranulf had been to blancminster once before with robert and he remembered that it was sixteen miles northwest of shrewsbury that would make it by his reckoning fourteen or fifteen miles due west even if he kept his mount to a slow canter and stopped often he should still be able to reach fitz alans stronghold before dark he soon realized though that this would be the longest fifteenmile ride of his life he had to halt and rest frequently and each time it became more difficult to get back into the saddle by noon he was already wondering why hed been such a fool and if hed had it to do over again hed have elected to ride into shrewsbury with aaron and josce and let annora and his overblown pride and stephens sheriff be damned but that was a regret four hours and five miles too late all he could do now was to make the best of a bad bargain with that in mind he resolved to seek the first shelter he could find no matter how shabby or meagre but the narrow road was deserted the land uninhabited he passed no hamlets not even an occasional secluded cottage villages did not thrive in the shadow of the border for this was bloody disputed ground english today welsh yesterday who knows on the morrow ranulf felt as if he were riding through a ghost country watched by unseen eyes and his unease increased apace with his exhaustion he plodded on telling himself that he must be almost there that the castle was likely to come into view at any time just around the next bend in the road but what he encountered was a river swollen with the spring thaw he drew rein staring in dismay at the expanse of muddy brown water the river dee snaked its way south from chester twisting and doubling back on itself like a fugitive seeking to throw off pursuit could this be the dee if so he was miles to the north of where hed hoped to be how could he have gone so far astray oddly enough his very fatigue enabled him to slough off his despair he was just too tired to be truly alarmed he would he decided camp there by the river for the night come morning he could decide whether to retrace his path back to the chester road or follow the river south toward blancminster hed been accustomed from boyhood to caring for horses but never had such simple tasks exacted such a toll by the time hed unsaddled and watered his stallion and tethered it to graze the sun was retreating west into wales making a fire was an even more laborious effort for first he had to gather and shred birch bark and dry moss to use as tinder and then find a hard stone to strike sparks against his dagger once he finally got a fire going he forced himself to eat some of the bread and salted fish hed gotten from aaron it troubled him that he had so little appetite he knew that was not a good sign it was not yet dark but he laid out his blankets by the fire wincing as he pulled his hauberk over his head the interlocking metal links weighed more than twenty pounds and seemed to have gotten heavier as the day dragged on but if hed been wearing it on the chester road it might have deflected that outlaws dagger rolling up his tunic he slowly unwound the bandage aaron had fashioned from a shirt fearing what he would find red streaks radiated outward from the wound like spokes on a wagon wheel pus oozed around the edges of the plantain poultice and the lightest touch of his fingers caused pain aaron had prophesied true when hed argued the need for a doctors care well god willing hed find one on the morrow ranulf awoke with a start the sky was still dark speckled with stars above his head the air held a damp chill but hed flung the blankets off in his sleep and when he touched his face now his skin felt as if it were afire trying not to panic he lay back upon the blanket a fever was not always fatal he was ill there was no denying that but he might be better by morning if not then hed spend another day here recovering his strength there was no need to fear not yet he kept telling himself that until he finally fell asleep again he slept fitfully for the next few hours but as the fire burned down his temperature soared sweating and shivering by turns he drifted in and out of a feverish sleep his dreams were suffused with heat and hectic color full of confusion and vague unspecified menace and when he was prodded awake in midmorning he still seemed to be in that world of shadows and sinister foreboding for two men were standing over him and one of them had a lance leveled at his throat bandits that was his first guess followed almost immediately byno welshfor their faces were cleanshaven mustached there was no comfort in that realization though for the welsh were just as likely to slay hima normanfrench knightas outlaws would he swallowed dryly taking care not to move not flinching even as the spear dipped lower hovering scant inches now from his chest they were regarding him impassively did they understand french and even if they did what could he say to keep that spear from continuing its downward thrust i am a kings son he said hoarsely and worth more alive than dead not even a flicker crossed those inscrutable faces he repeated himself in english this time again no response and that spear never wavered powys lay across the river but the name of its ruler eluded him the man had fought with them at the battle of lincoln why could he not remember seizing upon the one name he did recall cadwaladrs brother the king of gwynedd he said hastily owain gwynedd at last he got a reaction at least owains name meant something i was seeking lord owain out he improvised with a message from the english king lord owain will want to hear it did they understand impossible to tell he lay very still watching the spear as they conversed briefly in welsh he could taste sweat on his upper lip hoped they knew it was from fever not fear why it should matter what they thought of him he could not have explained but it did if only because these enigmatic welshmen might well be the last men hed ever see they seemed to have reached a decision the spear was shifting being withdrawn ranulfs sword had already been claimed while he slept reaching down one of the men drew ranulfs dagger from its sheath then produced a thin leather thong which he used to lash ranulfs wrists together and ranulf expelled a shaken breath knowing now that he had gained himself some time how much time was still very much in doubt they followed the river upstream to a ford splashed across into wales and then headed north the road narrowed until it became little more than a deer track they were in hill country now the woods had not yet begun to show spring buds and wherever ranulf looked he saw bare wintry branches rising up stabbing at the sky each time he swayed in the saddle he grabbed the pommel somehow managed to hold on he was soon drenched in sweat though his ears were echoing with the labored rasping sound of his own breathing and by afternoon a dark stain was spreading across his tunic when one of the welshmen noticed the bleeding he gestured toward the road ahead and then held up five fingers ranulf interpreted that to mean they had only five more miles to go he clung to that hope as tightly as the saddle pommel five miles was not so very far he could endure another five miles in the past few months life had lost its sweetness and hed lost his way but no longer death was once again the enemy his indifference and apathy drowned in a cheshire pond and as his captors led him deeper into wales he clutched at thathis will to liveas his armor his shield against whatever awaited him in this alien land the sun vanished with surprising swiftness and the sky was soon the color of smoke a hill loomed out of the twilight dusk encircled by a timber palisade as they rode toward it it slowly took on a familiar shape materializing into an englishstyle castle but it was garrisoned by welsh mustached faces were peering over the palisade as the gate swung open to admit them ranulf suddenly knew where he wasat mold the welsh stronghold of robert de montalt steward to the earl of chester he remembered hearing of its fall captured by owain gwynedd after a fierce threemonth siege castles were not native to wales unknown until marcher lords such as montalt began to encroach across its borders buttressing their claims with fortresses of timber and stone so this must be mold ranulf reasoned owain gwynedds conquered castle but as they rode across the deep ditch that separated the inner and outer baileys ranulf had another flash of memory mold had more than one name according to william fitz alan the welsh called it yr wyddgrugthe burial mound ranulf had to be assisted from the saddle once he was on his feet his bonds were cut leaning heavily upon his guards arm he was taken into the great hall a number of men were standing by a huge open hearth and he knew at once which one was owain gwynedd he needed neither throne nor crown to proclaim his rank the man himself was impressive enough to require no external trappings of authority it helped that he was tall and tawnyhaired for his were a people more commonly dark and slightly built but ranulf knew his impact could not be explained away as easily as that god had granted stephen a handsome face and athletic body too but not a kings presence whereas his own fatherstout and bowlegged and baldinghad been able to dominate any gathering to awe and intimidate by the sheer force of his royal will when ranulf was brought forward and forced to kneel before owain gwynedd the welshman regarded him thoughtfully there was no message from the english king was there he said in accented but understandable french when ranulf shook his head he smiled slightly and are you truly a kings son so they did understand me enough to get you here what happens next remains to be seen owain had darkgrey eyes a direct incisive gaze who are you and more to the point whod want to ransom you i can afford to ransom myself did his voice sound as odd to owain as it did to him slurred and strangely muffled as if coming from a great distance i am what i claimed to bethe son of an english king and a free woman of wales owain smiled again this time with ironic amusement welsh blood how convenient but true my mother was angharad ferch rhys she lived in your domainsthe conwy valleyand my uncle dwells there still rhodri ap rhys ranulf had just expended the last of his family lore but what little he knew was apparently enough for the welsh king no longer looked so skeptical rhodri ap rhys is your uncle a good man i know him well he gestured then giving ranulf permission to rise ranulf made a game try lurching to his feet but then the ground seemed to fall away and the room began to tilt alarmingly the next that he knew he was on a bench choking on a mouthful of mead he sputtered waved away the wineskin and owain leaned over him holding up his hand the palm smeared with red how were you hurtand when cheshire bandits four days agoi think surely it was longer than that he was being urged backward now onto the bench and he was quite willing to obey mayhap if he closed his eyes the hall would stop spinning owain stepped aside beckoning to one of his men fetch a doctor straightaway glancing back at ranulfs chalky pallor he added prudently and a priest ranulf knew he was very ill but he was too weak to worry about it he wanted only to sleep yet people would not leave him alone when they were not changing his bandage they insisted upon piling wet compresses onto his forehead and chest or spooning hot liquids into his mouth hed protest peevishly yet they paid him no heed they were patient and persistent and engulfed him in a sea of welsh not a word of which he understood sooner or later though they would go away allowing him to slide gratefully back into oblivion ranulf had lost all sense of time he could not have said whether it was hours or days later when he opened his eyes saw owain gwynedd standing by the bed ii am not doing so well am i he whispered and the welshman shook his head the doctor says your wound has festered am i going to die you are in gods hands lad as are we all ranulf pondered that evasive answer i think he said that id best see a priest owain nodded ive sent to basingwerk abbey for one who speaks french ranulf seemed to be trying to speak again and he leaned closer so he could hear ifif i die will you let the countess of chester know owain nodded again ive sent word to your uncle rhodri too he said and ranulf lay back too weak to talk further but oddly comforted by owains assurance that if he did die his kin would be told ranulfs dreams trapped him in a feverinduced world of darkness and loss sometimes he was in familiar surroundings back at devizes or bristol more often he was under siege again at oxford watching winchester go up in flames thrashing about in a murky cheshire pond and alwaysthere was trouble maude was in danger and he could not protect her annora was lost and he could not find her he kept hearing her cry his name but she was always out of sight out of reach gilbert was trapped in that burning church and he could do nothing again and again those he loved needed his help again and again he failed them his father was there too a remote figure never quite in focus robert keeping his distance looking sad and disappointed and a gentle ghost more than twenty years dead angharad his mother hed not dreamed of her for years and her face was indistinct shadowy but he knew it was she he recognized the bright hair the lowpitched voice the soothing sounds of her welsh unlike the other apparitions in these terrible dreams she did not disappear when he reached out to her instead she took his hand and held tight he held tight too and she stayed with him through the worst of the delirium and fever and pain he could sense her presence a beacon in the dark guiding him home the room was shuttered but even the dim rushlight hurt ranulfs eyes he was wondering where he was and why he felt so weak when a woman bent over the bed she held a basin of water dipped a cloth into it and laid it upon his forehead her touch was sure her fingers cool against his skin he studied her through his lashes she seemed somehow familiar and yet he could not remember seeing her before whoare you the sound of his own voice startled him for his words emerged as a croak she was even more startled she gasped and her hand jerked spilling water onto the bed coverlets when she spoke her voice sounded strangely familiar too but he did not understand what she was trying to tell him i am sorry he mumbled i speak no welsh more welsh rang out but this voice was male joining the woman at ranulfs bedside a greying burly stranger beamed down at him wed about given up on you lad this ranulf understood and it puzzled him for a moment before he realized that the man was now speaking french turning away the man switched briefly back to welsh and another figure emerged from the shadows this one a young girl no more than fourteen or fifteen ranulfmen do call you ranulf no do not try to talk for more days than i can count we were sure each breath you drew was like to be your last you do not know me the query followed by a hearty booming laugh how could you i am rhodri ap rhys your uncle and these are your cousins rhiannon and eleri youryour daughters my lord kings message said that you were in a bad way i thought it best to bring my lasses along so that at least theyd have a chance to bid you farewell and glad i am that i did im not sure youd have made it if not for rhiannon here rhiannon murmured in welsh and her father patted her on the arm before turning back to ranulf she speaks no french but she still suspects that im bragging on her im just speaking gods truth though even after the doctor gave up my girl did not she never left your bedside if she could help it she prayed for you and talked to you and held your hand so youd know she said that you were not alone tell her ranulf whispered that i did know his young cousin had squeezed between rhodri and rhiannon so that she could get a better look at ranulf papa his eyes are closed hehe is not dead is he no child he is sleeping again that is all rhiannon leaned over brushing her fingers lightly against ranulfs cheek he feels cooler she said papa do you truly think he will recover yes lass i do but i did not he admitted until now ranulf would have few memories of the days that followed mostly he slept owain gwynedd was gone back to his royal manor at abergwyngregyn the monkpriest had returned to his brethren at basingwerk declaring that ranulf no longer needed his care the doctor too departed but each time ranulf awoke his uncle and cousins were there he came to rely upon it that theyd be close at hand whenever he needed them rhodri straddled a chair by the bed translating french into welsh and back again demanding that ranulf eat all the food he brought over from the castle kitchen putting ranulf in mind of a shepherd hovering over a lamb long given up for lost when the boredom of the sickroom became too much for eleri she slipped out to explore the castle grounds and flirt with the garrison but she volunteered to wash ranulfs hair tried to talk him into letting her shave off his beard so he would look properly welsh and borrowed a lute to play for him at night before he fell asleep and he was convinced that in all of christendom he could not have found a more devoted nurse than rhiannon unlike eleri rhiannon never seemed to tire of her vigil during the day she was always within the sound of ranulfs voice and after dark she slept on a pallet by his bed so that she could hear him if he needed her in the night it did not matter that he could not understand what she said he lay still listening to the ebb and flow of her softspoken welsh as lulling as the familiar patter of rain upon a roof and he knew that he would not die in this alien place called yr wyddgrug the burial mound his cousin rhiannon would not allow it when rhodri opened the shutters spring sunlight flooded the chamber after a fortnight in the semigloom of a sickroom ranulf was dazzled by this sudden blaze of brightness another week in here he told rhodri and id have been blinder than any bat rhodri swung around to glare at him do not joke about thatnot ever ranulf blinked what did i say amiss his bewilderment was not feigned too sincere to doubt you truly do not know ranulf know what that rhiannon is blind nothat cannot be she has been taking care of me bringing me food even pouring me winei saw her do it you sound just like all the others rhodri said impatiently those who believe that to be blind is to be utterly helpless do not deny it ranulf when you think of a blind man or woman you think of a beggar seeking alms by the roadside it is not that ranulf insisted not altogether truthfully you just took me by surprise it never occurred to me thatthat she could not see she did not stumble or bump into things orand i am proving your point he said and rhodri nodded youll learn lad he said tolerantly but do not start treating her any differently now that you know my girl cannot abide pity moving toward the bed he looked down pensively at ranulf ive a question to put to you youre on the mend for certes but do you think youre strong enough yet to travel i think youd do well enough in a horse litter but if youd rather wait a few more days we can it is up to you where would we be going why home lad back to the conwy valley to trefriw youll stay with us whilst you regain your strength youve grown up in your fathers world now it is time you got to know your mothers world too i do not understand ranulf confessed i am a stranger to you the son of your enemy why have you opened your hearts to me like this rhodri was puzzled for the answer was so obvious because he said you are my sisters son gwynedd wales may for ranulf wales was one surprise after another hed known it was very unlike england a land of deep trackless forests jagged mountain peaks skyhigh icy lakes barren moorlands and no towns or cities he had not known though that it was so beautiful a country of untamed grandeur and lofty soaring vistas and for the first time he understood why his mother had never stopped looking back he was surprised by how well his welsh kin lived wales was a much poorer country than england but even by english standards rhodri ap rhys had a comfortable home in the hills overlooking the conwy valley where his cattle grazedfor the welsh were hunters and herdsmen not farmers as in england the great hall was the heart of the manor the kitchen and private quarters were set apart but otherwise the layout of a welsh manor house was not drastically different from its english counterpart reassured by the familiarity of his new surroundings ranulf hoped to make a quick recovery and learn a little welsh in the process his convalescence was to last far longer than hed anticipated hed assumedunrealisticallythat hed be up and about in a matter of days but he soon realized that it was going to take weeks to regain his strength a frustrating outlook for a man whod never been gravely ill before he had better luck with welsh picking it up with what appeared to be impressive ease and remarkable speed he let himself bask in the admiration of his newfound kin for a while and then confessed that his mastery of welsh was not as amazing as it seemed for hed spoken the language in childhood hed thought it had disappeared into the darkest depths of his memory after his mother died he admitted but all hed needed was to fall into a welsh well his own forgotten welsh had to bob up to the surface if he had any hope of keeping afloat he laughed and when his cousins and uncle laughed too he felt inordinately pleased and not just because hed made his first successful joke in welsh their approval was already beginning to matter to him that was the greatest surprise of allhow fast hed become so fond of this hitherto unknown family of his it went well beyond the natural gratitude he might have expected to feel memories of his mother had come flooding back along with his bygone welsh and that was part of it but not all he liked them enormously as simple as that he remembered that his uncle was two years younger than angharad which put rhodri in his midforties his hair was short and already so grey that it was impossible to tell if hed once been flaxenhaired like angharad he was not tall but he had a powerful wrestlers build and it was no surprise when he boasted that in his youth hed excelled in the sport equally popular on both sides of the border he was one of the most affable men ranulf had ever met cheerful and expansive with a serene good humor that ranulf found truly remarkable once he learned about his uncles past other men if they were lucky had merely a passing acquaintance with tragedy but rhodri had a long and intimate relationship he was the sole survivor of four siblings having lost his sister to the english king his two elder brothers to untimely deaths he and his wife nesta had been blessed with six children but three had died in childhood and his last son cadell had died in a fall from his horse two days before his twentieth birthday cadell had outlived his mother though by then nesta was already six years dead and rhodri wed again to a neighbors widow enid was a classic welsh beauty dark and sultry and it was obvious that rhodri adored this voluptuous young wife of his too much ever to put her asideeven though she had been unable to give him a son a man whod buried so many loved ones a man with a barren wife no male heir and a blind daughtersuch a man might well have despaired of his lot but rhodri bore his losses with the patience of job and ranulf could only marvel at his uncles faith and fortitude and lifeaffirming optimism a bed had been set up for ranulf in the great hall screened in at night so he could sleep he liked this arrangement for it enabled him to observe comings and goings in the hall practice his welsh on all who came within range of his bed and get to know the three very disparate women of his uncles household enid was a pleasure to watch gliding gracefully about like a sleek dark swan indolent incurious accommodating as long as it did not inconvenience her too much as placid and lovely to look upon as a welsh mountain lake she was the mistress of the manor but she seemed quite content to delegate her responsibilities to her stepdaughters she was not the wife ranulf would have wanted for himself but he did envy rhodri the way her eyes sparkled as soon as her husband walked through the doorway and he could not help wondering if annora smiled so sweetly for gervase fitz clement fourteenyearold eleri won ranulf over at once for she seemed like a younger welsh version of his favorite niece like maud eleri was lively and playful with a penchant for practical jokes and a taste for mischief she was a pretty girl with dimples dark eyes and a heartshaped face framed by pale ashbrown hair that looked shot through with silver in bright sunlight she was her fathers pet and was not above taking advantage of that when it suited her purposes she treated enid with an amused indulgence that few fourteenyearolds could have carried off doted upon her father signified her approval of her new kinsman ranulf by teasing him unmercifully and was utterly and fiercely devoted to her elder sister rhiannon did not resemble eleri in either appearance or temperament but she returned the younger girls devotion in full measure ranulf guessed her to be in her midtwenties she was taller than eleri slim and straightbacked her hair was her most striking feature a rich russet shade of chestnut and like eleri shed gotten their mothers brown eyes if enid was a swan and eleri a frisky kitten rhiannon put ranulf in mind of a young doe wary and elegant and as careful as her younger sister was carefree she was deliberate in all that she did but whether that had always been her nature or was the result of her affliction ranulf couldnt tell he prided himself upon being a good judge of character but rhiannon eluded him at every turn for he kept colliding with his own presumptions about the blind ranulf had been told about his cousins accident shed been struck in the eye by an iceencrusted snowball and within a year the sight in her other eye had begun to fail too that was often true the doctors had explained to rhodri but they could not explain why it was so all he knew was that at the age of eight his daughter had gone blind ranulf could imagine few crosses heavier to bear than that of blindness and it followed then that those so stricken would be lost souls drowning in darkness tragic and pathetic and helpless he still thought rhiannons plight was tragic but she was certainly not pathetic nor was she helpless she startled him with occasional flashes of wry humor for humor and blindness seemed utterly incompatible to him she puzzled him by her stubborn insistence upon doing things for herself when it would have been so much easier to let others help she made him feel selfconscious for he had to keep censoring himself lest he inadvertently say something she might find hurtful or offensive and again and again she amazed him by her eerie ability to act as if she were sighted blindness was not an uncommon affliction in their world but ranulf had no firsthand experience of the malady those fortunate enough to have families to care for them rarely ventured out on their own the only blind people hed ever seen were beggars for that was the brutal choice they faced begging or starving who after all would hire a blind man what could he do nothing of course ranulf would once have answered that question in the negative too but no longer not after watching his cousin at trefriw rhiannon assisted her sister and servants in running rhodris household she crossed the hall with sure steps detouring around the center hearth without hesitation she invariably recognized her father even before he called out to her and when neighbors began to drop by eager to get a glimpse of rhodris longlost english nephew she greeted them by name she mended clothes and while she needed to have her needle threaded for her she then reached into her sewing basket and selected the proper spool of thread she changed ranulfs bandage without fumbling poured him wine without spilling it and whenever he spoke to her she turned and looked toward him so attentively that he found it hard to believe those wideset dark eyes could be sightless and so he studied rhiannon in mystified fascination awed by what he could not understand but his bafflement was a barrier between themuntil the evening when she checked upon him before retiring crossed to the table by his bed and exclaimed your candle has gone out and as he watched in amazement she carried the candle over to the hearth returning a moment later with her hand cupped protectively around the flickering flame this was too much for ranulf how in hellfire did you do that he blurted out how could you know the candle was no longer lit have you never heard of second sight she murmured so earnestly that it was a moment before he realized he was being teased when he laughed she did too and then she explained that the quenched candle gave off no heat at the time he was amused by her wordplay relieved that hed not affronted her and intrigued by the simple logic of her answer later though he would look back upon this incident as a turning point for them both having discovered that rhiannon was so matteroffact about her blindness ranulf felt free to satisfy his curiosity sure now that it would not be at her expense she readily revealed her secrets trefriw was the only home shed ever known was it so surprising that she should know it so well as long as the household members took care not to shift furniture around she could move about with confidence nor was there anything magical about her ability to recognize others she knew the sound of their footsteps as she knew the sound of their voices she did not overfill a wine cup because she crooked her finger over the rim and poured until she felt the liquid at her fingertip her sewing spools were notched so that she could tell if the thread was white or black she sewed tags into her clothes so that she would not make the mistake of wearing a garment inside out she knew that venison was being served for dinner by the smell of roasted meat she needed her fingers and ears to play her harp not her eyes there was no sleightofhand she insisted none of the tricks of the trade practiced by traveling jongleurs it was just a matter of learning to heed her other senses to rely upon memory and to be patient shed made it seem so easy and yet ranulf knew it was not he no longer saw her achievements as uncanny even miraculous but once he understood just how hardwon her victories were he felt such admiration for her courage and perseverence that pity was crowded out he thought of her now as cousin rhiannon who is blind not as blind rhiannon and so began what was to be one of the most rewarding and significant friendships of his life it took ranulf a month to recover and another month until he began to feel like his old self again each time that he broached the subject of his return to england his uncle and cousins raised such strenuous objections that he let the matter drop it was easy enough to do for he did not know where he wanted to go once he left trefriw he was content to let the days slide by and before he knew it the summer was slipping by too there was much about welsh law that caused ranulf to marvel for this small mountainous land was a crucible of political heresy of all the states in christendom in wales alone did secular law take precedence over canon law and the welsh diverged from their churchs teachings on a number of controversial issues the welsh took the provocative view that a failed marriage was a mistake to be remedied and offered generous grounds for dissolution even more remarkably women were given the same right as men to walk away from an unhappy marriage maude would have loved wales ranulf thought for welsh women could not be forced into marriage against their will nor did the husband invariably get custody of the children when a marriage did end as was always the case elsewhere of particular interest to ranulf were the laws regarding illegitimacy here too the welsh were breaking new ground in wales unlike the rest of christendom if a bastardborn child was acknowledged by the father that child then enjoyed equal status with those children born within wedlock this staggered ranulf robert could have claimed the crown if england had such an enlightened law and how much suffering they all could have been spared if only that had been so but he was thankful that another welsh law was not in force across the border for in wales a youth reached his legal majority at age fourteen lord help them all if his nephew harry could have claimed to be lawfully on his own at fourteen it was this latter law which explained the presence in rhodris household of several boisterous teenage boys a welsh youngster might legally reach manhood at fourteen but he still had a lot to learn and so it was the welsh practice to place him in a local lords service to receive his training in arms similar to the english squires apprenticeship sixteenyearold padarn had been with rhodri only a fortnight and was still settling in ranulf could not help noticing how uncomfortable the youth was in rhiannons presence and when his cousins wanted to show him their favorite spot for an outdoor meal he picked padarn to accompany them hoping that time spent with rhiannon would allay the boys qualms padarn and eleri had raced their horses ahead leaving ranulf and rhiannon to follow at a more sedate pace rhiannon was riding pillion behind ranulf and she soon announced that they were nearing the waterfall the sound of rushing water came clearly to ranulfs ears too but he could not resist teasing her about her second sight for that had become a running joke between them rhiannon agreed that second sight was indeed a useful skill especially for those who lacked first sight and he reined in his stallion to look upon this waterfall his cousins so loved rhaeadr ewynnol it was called the foaming fall and well worthy of the name on this midaugust friday for the river was running high after a fortnight of steady rain the dropoff was not steep but spectacular in the sunlight as churning white water spilled over mossy green rocks down into a dark emerald pool below ranulf thought it a sight to behold and felt a pang of regret that rhiannon could see it only in memory helping her to dismount he tethered his mount to an overhanging branch and then cried out in alarm rhiannon stop to his surprise both his cousins laughed what did you fear rhiannon asked that i would walk right over the cliff i can tell as i approach the edge by the movement of the air shed long since established her credibility with ranulf but padarn looked skeptical and eleri saw that go on rhiannon she urged show them how you can sense things they can only see as ranulf and padarn looked on in puzzlement eleri led her sister away from the bluff and then gently spun her around they watched as she started to cross the clearing but when she headed toward a large oak tree only eleris vehement gesture kept ranulf from calling out a warning it was not needed for rhiannon stopped just in time there is something ahead of me she said and after reaching out and encountering the scratchy feel of bark she grinned suddenly triumphantly but she could not explain to them how shed known of the trees presence able to say only that shed sensed an obstacle looming before her she called it her inner vision and whilst it was not always reliable she admitted especially with objects close to the ground it had spared her many a bruising fall for certes padarn was so captivated by this mysterious skill of rhiannons that he had to try to master it too and keeping his eyes tightly shut he lurched around the clearing crashing into trees and stumbling into thickets like a stag in rut he was of course showing off for eleri but he got more than he bargained for when he tumbled headfirst into a blackthorn bush once she stopped laughing though eleri was so solicitous that ranulf suspected the boy counted his scratches well earned spreading their blanket under rhiannons oak they unpacked their basket eleri had wheedled their cook into yielding up roast chicken thick chunks of goat cheese ripe plums and cider there was even a round loaf of newly baked bread primarily for ranulfs sake for the welsh did not eat nearly as much bread as their english neighbors borrowing ranulfs dagger to dig a thorn out of padarns thumb eleri began teasing him about his lamentable lack of inner vision padarn bridled pointing out that inner vision was a poor trade indeed for the loss of sight and then flushed deeply glancing toward rhiannon and then away when he began to stammer apologies rhiannon insisted it was not necessary you did but speak the truth lad for none would choose darkness over light the choice is to live in that darkness with some measure of grace and contentmentor not i am more fortunate than many for i can take comfort in the love of my family in my faith in gods mercy and in the knowledge that at least my blindness has spared me the need to learn embroidery padarn sputtered choking on his cider eleri poured him another cup adding that rhiannon never had to weed their garden either and ranulf chimed in with a reminder of all the money rhiannon saved her father on candles when padarn joined somewhat sheepishly in their laughter ranulf knew hed been right about the boy he was worth the extra effort padarn was studying rhiannon intently as if seeing her truly for the first time may i ask you a questiona serious one what is the worst of being blind ranulf had wondered that himself he expected rhiannon to need time to think it over but she answered immediately other people it would be much easier to accept my blindness if only they could accept it too but they shy away as if it were contagious or else they assume that since i cannot see i cannot hear either and they shout as if i were quite deaf or they do not speak to her at all eleri said indignantly rhiannon will be standing right at my side but ill be the one they ask has she always been blind god above but the world is full of fools and in the clearing by rhaeadr ewynnol there was none to dispute her later after the food had been eaten eleri and padarn set off to hunt for wild blackberries ranulf found a hedgerow of blooming honeysuckle and collected a handful of the fragrant blossoms for rhiannon what else he asked quietly and she understood at once waking up and not knowing if it is day or night even now i find that disquieting i miss seeing smiles for they are conversational clues are they not i also miss seeing things which cannot be touched like butterflies or a night sky but i think the dreams were the most troubling ranulf the ones in which i was able to see again theyd seem so real so very real full of color and light but then id awaken and i was still blind i had dreams like that after my mother died ranulf said waking up was like losing her all over again mourning dreams rhiannon said pensively id never thought of it that way but you are right i was mourning my lost sight as you mourned your mother it occurred to ranulf that theyd been about the same age too you mentioned color in those early dreams rhiannon can you remember it then i think so she said but she amended that then to well i remember red but the other colors have faded papa tries to prod my memory but he cannot seem to describe color in terms that are notcolorful she smiled so swiftly that ranulf almost missed it he talks about bright and dark and pale which is not very helpful ranulf watched her breathe in the scent of honeysuckle how to explain color give me your hand he said once they were on their feet he led her away from the tree out into a patch of summer sunlight tilt your face up he said and tell me what you feel the sun she said promptly i feel its warmth what you are feeling he said is yellow green is the sound the wind makes rustling through the trees if we walked down to the riverbank and you put your hand in the water youd feel the cool color blue to remember red you need only stand in front of the hearth and a winter snowfall silent and cold and purethat is white rhiannon was delighted do not stop now she entreated what of purple silver next youll be asking after plaid ranulf joked but once they were settled back on the blanket he did his best to oblige her do you know what a sable pelt feels likesoft and lush well that is purple silver issilk brown is a steady dependable colorlike dogs rhiannon laughed and clapped her hands let me she cried if dogs are brown then cats aregreen ranulf laughed too and they expanded the game deciding that harp music was green too that anger was red and pride blue ranulf did not know whether hed actually helped rhiannon to form a mental image of these colors but he was sure hed given her something shed had too little offun sharing the last of the cider with him she shared too memories of her childhood her mother would have fetched for her protected her coddled her but rhodri would not allow it he had encouraged her to defy the dark to get up when she fell to find out for herself what was possible and what was not hed taught her to ride to play the harp to turn her head in the direction of voices when she was spoken to as a sighted child would have done hed taught her that she could be blind and selfreliant and proud the great pity ranulf thought was that he could not teach the rest of the world that too over these past few months hed told her of his own childhood of stephen and maude and robert and the war but hed told her nothing of his grieving or his guilt and so he was taken utterly aback when she asked suddenly ranulf who is annora the silence lasted so long that she grew uneasy i did not mean to pry she apologized and he reached across the blanket patted her hand you just took me by surprise lass how do you know about annora i know only that you cried out her name when your fever burned so high even if id spoken french i could not have made sense of your mumblings but the name i did hearoften enough to remember i can tell though that some wounds heal more slowly than others we need not speak of her no he said i will tell you cousin rhiannon after all that you and your family have done for me you have the right to know and as if that secluded riverside clearing were a confessional he told her about annora sparing himself nothing she listened in silence her thoughts hidden from him for hed kept his eyes upon the surging power of rhaeadr ewynnol until he was done he waited then for her response as an accused man might await a jurys verdict steeling himself for her disappointment her condemnation even revulsion when he looked into her face though he saw only sadness i am sorry she said at last for your friends death i am sorry too that you blame yourself for it i was such a fool rhiannon i truly believed that annora would be able to divorce her husband and marry me that wanting was enough to make it so i never considered the consequences not until it was too late i do not pretend to know much of such matters she said slowly but i would guess that most menand womenshare that same failing she hesitated annorado you still love her he nodded remembered such a gesture meant nothing to her and said with some reluctance yesi do rhiannon was quiet for a time and if you had it to do all over again would you this time his answer was immediateand explosive good god no well then rhiannon said there is hope for you yet ranulf stared at her and then gave a startled and rueful laugh who would have guessed he said that a butterfly could bite this one can she said tartly what would you have me say that id want you to go on lusting after a married woman the lord god will forgive any sin if it is truly repented but people who keep repeating the same sins must try his patience for certes ranulf forgot and nodded again i do repent my sins rhiannon and i mean to learn from my mistakes i owe that to gilbert i think learning from past mistakes would be a fine thing she said softly and then she tilted her head listening eleri and padarnthey are coming back ranulf heard the voices now too the playful bickering that passed for flirtation among the very young you have just enough time he said to bless me and tell me to go forth and sin no more she turned her face toward him with a smile that offered its own sort of absolution and he reached for her hand come on cousin he said lets go home chester castle england september maud the earl of chester plunged through the doorway of his bedchamber where are you girl striding over to the bed he jerked the hangings back then glanced about in puzzlement maud a moment later his wife emerged from the corner privy chamber she was fully dressed her hair neatly braided but she looked so pale and drawn that even her unobservant husband noticed queasy again eh he said and she regarded him balefully no i spend so much time crouching over the privy hole because i like the view chester scowled but held his peace reminding himself that a woman had to be humored whilst she was breeding well ive news sure to cheer you youve a visitor im not up to seeing anyone maud said settling herself gingerly upon the bed unless it is my mother or his holiness the pope tell them to come back later this is one visitor youll want to see chester insisted and before maud could stop him he opened the door shouting into the stairwell come on up randolph maud was furious but it was too late already she could hear footsteps on the stairs reluctantly swinging her legs over the side of the bed she pushed her husbands arm aside when he offered his help you never listen she scolded softly neverjesu her morning sickness forgotten she shot off the bed ranulf chester watched with a smile as his wife and her uncle embraced i told you he said smugly that youd want to see him an autumn rainstorm was drenching the conwy valley each time the door to the great hall was opened damp drafts blew in guttering the candles but flickering candles were no inconvenience to rhiannon and she continued to sew eleri had pinned a strip of flat wood to the material to guide her stitches but even so it was slow laborious going how does it look she asked as eleris steps drew near do i have to rip out this row too tell me the truth it does not have to be perfect eleri chided moving closer to see yes rhiannon said it does once her sister assured her that the stitches were even she bent over her handiwork again concentrating so diligently that she did not at first notice her stepmothers approach what are you making rhiannon a belt for ranulf he told papa that his birthday is in november why not let me make it for you i could do it much faster i am sure you could enid rhiannon said evenly but i want to do it myself are you so sure he is coming back of course he is he promised he would it might be better if he does not rhiannon stopped sewing i thought you liked ranulf she said in surprise i do like him we all dotoo much i fear i do not understand we welcomed him into our home our hearts it was easy enough to do for he is very likable he filled an empty place at our tablecadells place but he is not cadell and this is not his world sooner or later he will choose to return to the world he knows that need not be so rhiannon protested he seems happy here he could decide to stay ah lambkinyou are fooling yourself that was rhodris pet name for rhiannon she never liked her stepmother to use it especially in such solicitous sympathetic tones theirs was an awkward relationship not friends no longer enemiesalthough that had not been true in the beginning rhiannon had by her own admission reacted badly to her fathers decision to remarry her mother was just dead a year and rhiannon was not ready to accept another woman in nestas place nor had enid known how to deal with a blind stepdaughter her kindnesses seemed condescending her good intentions invariably went astray and her patience hovered on the border between sainthood and martyrdom only her bafflement rang true looking back upon those first troubled months rhiannon could admit now that enid was unfairly cast as the wicked stepmother guilty of missteps and gaffes not mortal sins but she wasquite unknowinglyserving as a scapegoat for that was the year that rhiannon collided with reality the brutal reality that men feared blindness only a little less than they feared leprosy she was old enough by then for marriage and motherhood her father could find no suitable husband for her though a blind wife was a contradiction in terms a bizarre joke a curse besotted men might fling at one another in an alehouse brawl at eighteen rhiannon had finally understood just how barren her future was to be and shed taken out much of her heartbroken rage and frustration upon her beautiful wellmeaning obtuse stepmother seven years had passed since then and theyd long ago made their peace for whatever their differences they both loved rhodri but rhiannon would never have chosen enid for her confidante and she resented enid now for voicing her own secret fear she knew that enid was right that ranulf was unlikely to stay in wales saying it aloud though gave her a superstitious shiver hoping that her silence would communicate her unwillingness to discuss it further she bent over her sewing again but enid was never one for taking hints it is only a matter of time until ranulf goes back to englandfor good the longer he lives with us the more it will hurt when he does leave that is why i said it might be better if he stayed in chester better for my rhodri and eleriand above all for you rhiannon rhiannon felt heat rising in her face she wanted to demand that enid explain herself but she did not dare for she was suddenly afraid of what enid might answer was it possible that her stepmother could somehow have seen into her heart you are wrong enid she said tautly ranulf will come back he promised during his six months in gwynedd ranulf had been as secluded as any hermit but maud soon brought him up to date on the happenings in the world beyond wales her most startling news was of the intensifying feud between stephen and the archbishop of canterbury upon theobalds return from the council of rheims a furious stephen had punished his defiance by expelling him from england he had settled in flanders at matildas urgings as she and an unlikely peacemaker william de ypres sought in vain to reconcile this rift between stephen and the church on september th the archbishops patience wore out and he placed england under interdict this was the churchs ultimate weapon but this time it misfired the interdict was ignored throughout england observed only in theobalds own diocese of canterbury as to what would happen next none could say but it was a blessing indeed for the angevin cause maud and ranulf agreed that stephen should have estranged himself from the most powerful churchman in his realm maud had other news as well for ranulf she confirmed that his sister was now living in rouen with her sons she informed him that matilda had spent much of the year in canterbury supervising the building of faversham the abbey she and stephen were founding rumor had it that she was in poor health she told him that the bishop of winchester had been suspended by the pope for supporting stephen over the archbishop she shared another rumor that william de ypress sight was clouding over she had the latest stories from the holy land where the french king was blundering badly lurching from one mistake to another nearly losing his life in a turkish ambush but the most shocking gossip concerned his queen during their stay in antioch eleanor had announced that she wanted to end their troubled marriage louis refused to let her go and when they resumed their trek toward jerusalem eleanor was taken by force from the city compelled to accompany them this was high scandal indeed but ranulf was even more astonished by what maud revealed about brien fitz count brien had turned wallingford castle over to his kinsman william boterel and he and his wife had both taken holy vows renouncing the world and their marriage and pledging the remainder of their lives to the service of almighty god maud bent over her sons cradle satisfying herself that he slept are you still set upon leaving on the morrow ranulf a fortnight is not a very long visit not after vanishing into smoke for nigh on eight months i promised my welsh kin that id be back by the first frost ranulf explained adding with a grin but ill come to see that new babe of yours lass believe it or not your husband actually invited me back once the babe is born and how could i resist such an unlikely invitation maud returned his grin with one of her own who would have guessed she said that hating stephen would have such a beneficial effect upon randolphs manners it seems hell go to any lengths to bring stephen down even if that means being polite to my kinfolk ranulf joined her at the cradle gazing at her sleeping little son i think he looks like robert he said and maud agreed readily for she wanted to believe that too well if you must go at least take nicholas and some of our men with you they dare go no farther than the abbey at basingwerk though are you sure you and padarn can get safely back on your own to your uncles lands when ranulf nodded maud sighed only half convinced remember to talk to the abbot about the letters if we are generous in our almsgiving he ought to be willing to send one of his monks to trefriw with letters for you and they can also take letters of yours to me here at chester even in these accursed times monks are rarely attackedif only because they have so little to steal you have a very practical turn of mind maud ranulf said fondly diolch yn fawr hed taught her that was welsh for thank you can you really speak welsh all that well she asked curiously randolph has not mastered a word of it for all the time he has spent in wales i doubt that he tried very hard since i used to speak it as a lad i had a head start but your uncle knows french does he not yesfrom what i gather most of the men attending owain gwynedds court speak some french whether a man knows any french depends upon how much contact he has with england as for their women most speak only welsh what of your cousins ive begun teaching them frenchor trying to eleri loses interest too easily but rhiannon is a better pupil most likely because her memory is honed sharper than my best blade it has to be for she must carry a mental map in her head in order to do the most simple task even crossing the hall can be fraught with peril if you cannot see where you are going you think highly of her maud said and he smiled i always thought maude was the bravest woman id ever known rhiannon has a quieter kind of courage but in its way it is even more impressive for rhiannons war will last until her dying breath whenever i passed a blind beggar on the road maud confessed i would throw a coin and then hurry on by averting my eyes i did not know what life must be like for the blind did not want to know i asked rhiannon once what it was like to be blind she said i do not know i can only tell you what it is like to be me she sounds maud said like a remarkable woman i hope i have not made her seem too good to be true a saint she is not she can be vexingly stubborn and she has the same sort of prickly pride as maude does why does that surprise you for them both pride is a defense the only shield available to them we all do what we can with what we have ranulf maud bent over and brushed a soft kiss against her sons dark hair say something for me in welsh she asked something poetic or profound ranulf was quiet considering rhag pob clwyf eli amser he said for every wound the ointment of time their eyes met i thought you might quote me the welsh equivalent of that latin saying you always fancied carpe diem seize the day shaking his head he said softly i like this one better yes she agreed so do i leaning over she kissed him on the cheek as gently as shed kissed her son wales has been good for you uncle the next time you come bring those welsh cousins with you i should like to meet them nowwhere are the letters you have for me they are over here on the table they are done but not sealed yet reaching for the first on the pile he held it up this goes to the priory in bristol where they are keeping roberts bequest for me ive instructed them to reimburse you for the money youve lent to me the next two letters go to the stewards of my manors in wiltshire this one is for hugh de plucknet and these two go to cornwallto rainald and luke ive written too to brien and will be grateful if youll see that he gets it he gazed down at briens letter still marveling at his friends decision to become a monk how little he thought do we know of the hearts of others he wondered if briens wife had truly wanted to be a nun or if shed sought to find in god what shed lost in brien he wondered too what maudes reaction had been above all he wished brien well hoped fervently that brien might find what he sought in the austere discipline and cloistered world of the benedictines inner peace and salvation picking up another letter he said this is for your mother in bristol lastly these are to be dispatched to normandy to maude and young harry i also wrote down the names of the jewish peddlers who came to my aid on the chester road i hoped you might let your brother in bristol know about them that i owe them a great favor indeed ill tell him but i cannot see wills bestirring himself on behalf of jews even ones who saved your life ranulf did not disagree he knew his nephew passing strange that the best of roberts manhood lived on in his daughter folding the letters one by one he reached then for the sealing wax remind me to repay you for the cost of all thisyoull be sending out couriers to the four winds she dismissed the expense with a wave of her hand you know i like nothing better than spending randolphs money but is that all no other letters ranulf pressed his seal into the soft wax on the last of his letters what did you expectthat there would be one for annora the thought did cross my mind he slowly shook his head watching as she poured wine for them both holding out a cup she said i heard from herfrom annora she wrote to me this past spring she had her baby a girl born last november they named her matilda after the queen ranulf drank in silence for several moments i am glad for her he said resolutely sheshe did seem happy maud yesfor now she wondered if she ought to warn him annora was still caught up in the newfound joy of motherhood but in a year or two the novelty of it might well begin to wane and she might crave excitement again once more yearn for risk and romance and ranulf it was not a good sign that shed asked so very casually if ranulf had returned to normandy with the empress maud said nothing though for each man must find his own way if ranulfs way led back to annora she would be sorely grieved but the choice was his for now he echoed sounding surprised you do not think her happiness will last she shrugged and he leaned back in his chair studying her pensively i thought you liked annora she shrugged again you loved the woman to distraction what was i supposed to saythat i thought you could do better he started to protest then let it go she saw the sadness shadowing his face and she knew annora was still in the room with them the ghostly unseen presence of a lost love much in need of exorcism aunt maude will want you to join her in normandy she said abruptly uncle rainald is sure to urge you to come to cornwall your welsh kindred want you to return to gwynedd but there is a voice missing from this debateyours what of you ranulf what do you want to do he was quiet for a few moments and then gave her a crooked rueful smile that is the trouble maud i would to god that i knew ranulf and padarn had a blessedly uneventful journey and reached trefriw safely in midoctober ranulf had spent lavishly in chester and their saddlebags were crammed full of gifts a slenderbladed dagger for rhodri a polished metal mirror for enid an ivory comb for eleri a vial of mauds favorite perfume for rhiannon bolts of fine linen and wool they were all delighted with their presents and made much ado over his generosity and extravagance but he had the comforting certainty that he would have been welcomed just as warmly as if hed come back emptyhanded he knew they were planning to celebrate his birthday and so he had to stay at least through november it seemed heartless then to leave so close to christmas and by then it would be foolhardy indeed to consider departing in the midst of a welsh winter and so the weeks passed into months december into january on into february and then march of gods year the fourteenth of stephens reign and ranulf was still in wales continually telling himself he ought to go and always finding reasons to stay as much as ranulf had come to value his mothers homeland he regretted its isolation cut off from england by mountains and milesfor it was well over two hundred miles from trefriw to londonwales seemed as remote at times as the island kingdom of ireland stephen and the archbishop of canterbury had been coaxed by stephens queen into making their peace in november but word did not reach owain gwynedds court until december and it did not filter south to trefriw for yet another month it had begun to trouble ranulf that he knew so little of what was occurring in the rest of christendom and he sensed that he would soon be ready to return to the other world his fathers worldand his own the seclusion that ranulf found so vexing was a source of reassurance to rhiannon to her trefriw was a refuge cloistered and sheltered by the cloudkissed mountain peaks the welsh called eryrihaunt of eagles it was easy enough to forget there was another world beyond the river conwy and easy too to believe that because ranulf seemed content with them he would always be so the only times she feared were when the letters came ranulf had told them of an ancient greek legend of mythical creatures half woman and half bird who lured sailors to their doom with their seductively sweet songs it seemed to rhiannon that these letters were siren songs too trying to beguile ranulf back across the border back to his former life there had been three of these letters so far forwarded by the countess of chester to the white monks at basingwerk the first had come from ranulfs sister in normandy the next from his brother the earl of cornwall and the third from the countess herself just a fortnight ago sharing with ranulf her joy over the birth of her second son each time one of these letters came rhiannon had waited anxiously to find out if the siren songs would prevail each time her relief had been overwhelming when they did not but on this raindark day in late march her peace was threatened once again by the arrival of a cistercian brother from basingwerk the white monk was welcomed heartily and offered a bed for the night to the welsh hospitality was the eleventh of the lords commandments they gathered around ranulf then as he read his letters rhiannon tensed when he announced that they were from his sister and nephew in normandy for she knew that the empress was her greatest foe ranulf read rapidly exclaiming occasionally to himself in surprise when he was done he glanced up saying my nephew harry is returning to england so that he may be knighted by the scots king it was obvious to them that this was a pretext if knighthood were all that henry craved his father could easily have knighted him in normandy how old is the lad now sixteen rhodri asked and when ranulf nodded he said it might have been better if hed waited another year or two but was there ever a sixteenyearold who was not eager to play a mans part especially harry ranulf said and smiled he was eager to do that at age nine what amazes me is not his boldness nor that maude has reluctantly consented to this rash venture of his for i daresay he gave her no choice noit is that the earl of chester has agreed to meet harry at carlisle and there make his peace with his old enemy the scots king that is not only astounding it is downright miraculous i can only assume that as much as chester loathes king david he now hates stephen even more ranulf began then to tell them of chesters bitter feud with the scots king but rhiannon was no longer listening chesters feuding meant nothing to her she waited mutely to hear all that did matterwhether or not ranulf would be leaving them she could not bring herself to ask outright but her father soon did and will you be joining young harry at carlisle yes ranulf said i must uncle my sister entreats me to look after harry as best i can if i stood aside and evil befell the lad id never forgive myself rhiannon caught her breath then deliberately dug her nails into the palm of her hand until she could be sure shed not cry aloud in protest or pleading but her sister had less restraint you cannot go ranulf we need you here as much as harry does for were your family too ranulf looked unhappily at his young cousin not sure what to say but his uncle said it for him you are not being fair eleri ranulf has to go for it is a matter of duty and honour what would you have him do entrust his nephews safety to a knave like chester eleri was more than willing to let henry fend for himself but she eventually subsided on the verge of tears only then did rhiannon reach out and touch ranulfs arm when she asked uneasily will you be coming back she had her answer in ranulfs prolonged hesitation i do not know rhiannon he admitted i just do not know ranulf found it more difficult than hed expected to bid farewell to his welsh family theyd followed him to the gateway to see him off and were doing their best to be cheerful and matteroffact about his departure but only padarns enthusiasm was real for hed talked his father and rhodri into letting him accompany ranulf for the others ranulfs leavetaking was a painful one and he well knew it for rhodri hed been a substitute son a bandage for the wound caused by cadells death for eleri hed been a big brother and a window to the world able to give her intriguing glimpses of foreign lands and great cities and for rhiannon hed been what she needed mosta friend when he rode away hed be leaving a jagged hole in their household one that would not be easy to mend spring had come to the conwy valley and the hills were green with new growth and gold with wild gorse the first butterflies of the season were fluttering about like flying flower petals and high overhead ranulf heard the shrill cry of a kestrel a soaring shadow against the halo cast by the sun never had wales looked so beautiful so deceptively peaceful so hard to leave i want to thank you all he said for the best year of my life he was embraced then by rhodri a vigorous bonebruising hug that squeezed the air out of his lungs enid gave him a languidly lovely smile a decorous kiss on the cheek and eleri hurled herself into his arms making a feeble joke about englishmen and their bristly beards it was she complained tearfully like nuzzling a hedgehog from rhiannon he got a brief heartfelt embrace delicately scented with a fragrance of the welsh meadows it suited her better he thought than mauds more exotic perfume god keep you all safe he said huskily until we are together again padarn was already mounted impatiently eager to be off swinging up into the saddle ranulf sent his stallion cantering toward the gate he waved once but after that he did not dare to look back again yorkshire england july on whitsunday may nd the king of scotland knighted his nephew henry and roger fitz miles the earl of hereford david then made a public peace with his old enemy the earl of chester chester agreed to acknowledge david as lord of carlisle and for that concession he was given the honour of lancaster by david they propped up their precarious alliance with a sacrament the proposed marriage of one of chesters infant sons to one of davids young granddaughters they were then ready to strike at stephen after some discussion they decided to launch a surprise attack upon york for they hoped the fall of englands secondlargest city would deliver a crippling blow to stephens embattled kingship by the end of the second week in july they were within striking distance of york it began to rain as they set up camp for the night but the men didnt mind a summer soaking after a hot dusty day on the road by the time hed made certain though that the sentries had been posted ranulf was drenched he shared a tent with henry and roger fitz miles but the scots king his son and the earl of chester had their own tents and it was toward the former that ranulf headed as he expected he found them all in davids tent discussing plans for the morrows attack ranulf had pessimistically predicted that chester and david would soon be at each others throats much to his surprise the tenuous truce seemed to be holding due in large measure to the youth who was davids grandnephew and chesters first cousin by marriage henry showed a deft touch for defusing tension a skill ranulf suspected hed learned in normandy caught in the crossfire of his parents marital warfare no one noticed ranulfs entrance for they were gathered around the earl of chester as he drew for them a map of yorks defenses the city was protected by two rivers the ouse and the fosse and high earthen banks erected over the ancient roman walls there were four main gates all of stone and two motteandbailey castles shielded behind timber palisades and deep ditches capturing york sounded like a formidable undertaking to henry and he kept interrupting with questions all of which chester answered with uncharacteristic patience ranulf listened in amusement who would have guessed that chester of all men would have relished the role of tutor but henry had disarmed them all with his unabashed eager curiosity hed so far shown none of the defensive bravado that infected so many sixteenyearolds he did not bluster if he did not know something he asked he asked often listened and learned and hed soon won over not only his scots uncle and cousin but even the notoriously irascible chester ranulf whod always been extremely fond of henry now found himself feeling proud of his nephew too so much so that hed begun to wonder if hed judged geoffrey too harshly as far back as he could remember hed loathed his brotherinlaw detesting him for the misery hed caused maude but during henrys formative years hed been in geoffreys care not maudes if geoffrey could raise a son like harry ranulf reasoned he could not be such a worthless wretch after all whatever grief the man had given maude he deserved credit for harry a fine young king in the making god willing ranulf added hastily for hed learned at bitter cost that only fools took victory for granted in a world so fraught with peril the talk had now shifted from yorks defenses to its populace when chester and david both agreed that its citizens were almost as loyal to stephen as the steadfast londoners were henry wanted to know why chester shrugged he had no more interest in what motivated other people than he did in the history of the druids david was more politically astute one of the reasons why his had been such a successful kingship for scotland and he said promptly if somewhat pedantically stephen has always had support in the towns for they think he favors trade he has been generous in granting them charters and he courts their guilds quite shamelessly and then too york has prospered under stephens reign for it has been spared the turmoil and lawlessness that have so troubled the southern parts in contrast to shires like oxford and wiltshire and the godforsaken fens yorkshire has seen little bloodshed not since cowton moor anyway chester muttered unable to resist this snide mention of the scots kings calamitous defeat by the english eleven years ago david gave him a cool glance of dismissal more insulting in its way than outright anger would have been moreover he continued stephen has made several visits to york and each time he was openhanded with royal boons when the hospital of st peters burned down in the great fire of stephen and matilda paid for its repairs and then founded a leper hospital outside the city these are the sort of goodwill gestures that people remember lad henry nodded thoughtfully ranulf teased him occasionally that he seemed to be storing away information like a squirrel hoarding acorns and he always laughed but it was more than a joke and they both knew it this was a great adventure for him but it was also an education he was well aware that he lacked seasoning and he was even willing to admit itto a select fewfor he had no false pride but it was a lack he was eager to remedy and besieging york would make a good beginning there was a sudden commotion outside and a few moments later bennet de malpas was escorted into the tent he was soaked to the skin splattered with mud and stumbling with fatigue as he hastened forward to greet his lord and the scots king but what riveted all eyes upon him was not his haggard disheveled appearance it was that he was supposed to be in york spying for the earl when he knelt before chester the earl said tensely you look like a man on the way to his own hanging go on spit it out bennet what do you have to tell us that well not want to hear there will be no surprise attack on york my lord earl they are expecting us i do not know if we were betrayed or they just got lucky but they somehow learned that we were marching on the city the men exchanged grim looks and bennet braced himself to reveal the rest the worst my lords there is more the citizens sent an urgent plea to stephen seeking his aid hes on his way to york with a large force of his flemish mercenaries and he moved with such speed that hes no more than a day away two at most afterward slogging through the mud back to their tent henry was still stunned that their ambitious plans had come to such an abrupt end the men had raged and cursed and fumed but none of them not even the volatile fearless chester objected to davids morose conclusionthat their campaign was over even before it began henry was dismayed that they were letting stephen chase them off but he took his cues from his elders and held his peace these men were all experienced soldiers men of proven bravery he would not insult them by questioning their courage but his disappointment was too sharp to hide at least from ranulf i know you are unhappy about this harry we all are but it would be foolhardy to continue on we were relying upon surprise to carry the day now our foes are not only forewarned but theyll outnumber us remember what i told you about stephenthat he may not know how to rule but he knows full well how to fight henry nodded glumly it seemed to him that there were three stephens so contradictory were the stories circulating about him there was stephen the man goodhearted and well meaning and generous there was stephen the king inept and easily led astray with no political sense whatsoever and there was stephen the battle commander toughminded and fastacting and dangerous the men in henrys world grudgingly liked the first stephen and scorned the second but they all respected the soldier how did stephen assemble an army so rapidly he asked and ranulf explained that by calling upon his flemish mercenaries rather than his vassals stephen was able to respond with lethal speed for he need not send out a summons to his barons and then wait for them to gather their own men it was costly to keep an armed force always on hand ranulf conceded but they were ready to march at the kings command this was an interesting argument that hired soldiers were a more effective way of fighting than the traditional reliance upon the kings vassals and ordinarily henry would have been intrigued eager to explore it further now though he asked no more questions trudging on in silence the rain was still pelting the camp and so many men and horses had soon churned the soaked grassy ground into a muddy quagmire until the storm passed fires could not be lit and the soldiers were sheltering themselves as best they could for supper theyd had to content themselves with dried beef and bread for beds they had soggy blankets the moors were often chilly after dark even in high summer and if the rain kept on they faced a shivery night in wet clammy clothes and all for nothing henry thought for on the morrow they would turn tail and retreat never having gotten within sight of yorks walls uncle ranulf ive a question for you i want to know if there is another reason for our retreat are you all seeking to protect me ill not lie to you harry that was a consideration ranulf admitted and henry came to a sudden stop i knew it he accused i am not a child uncle ranulf and i will not abide being treated like one i did not come to england to be coddled if your parents wanted to coddle you lad theyd have kept you in normandy of course we care for your safety you are englands future should evil befall you what hope would we have of overthrowing stephen yes you have brothers but you are the one who has been groomed for the throne you are the one whom men know so we are not going to let you come to harm if we can help it plainly put a kings life is worth more than the lives of other men henry was quiet after that i just want to do my fair share he said unhappily i am not afraid to take risks and i need to show men that to prove to them that i would be a king worth fighting for you will lad your very presence here is sending a message that you do not lack for courage show men that you have common sense too and they will rally to you as they never did to your mother but there is one thing you must understand harry for your life might well depend upon it what is it henry asked impressed by his uncles sudden gravity stephen did not take you seriously two years ago but from now on he will lad if you fall into his hands this time he will not be paying for your return to normandy they broke camp at dawn the next day the scots king and his son made for carlisle chester for cheshire and henry and ranulf and roger fitz miles for bristol upon his arrival in york stephen was welcomed enthusiastically by its reprieved citizens he was furious though to find the enemy gone and sent men off in pursuit but he realized they did not have much chance of overtaking their quarry and a fastriding courier was soon racing for oxford with an urgent message for stephens nineteenyearold son eustace was to stop henry from reaching bristol ranulf and henry rode fast to outdistance pursuit but once they reached hereford in safety they eased their pace and their vigilance from hereford they continued on to rogers stronghold in gloucester they were only two days now from bristol and henry was irked when roger insisted upon accompanying them south for he was still sensitive about their overprotectiveness especially now that he was sure the danger was past his confidence was confirmed when they rode into dursley castle without incident the following afternoon roger de berkeley was dursleys castellan and he made them welcome but without much enthusiasm ranulf did not take it personally for he doubted that roger de berkeley would show enthusiasm even if he were being seduced by eleanor of aquitaine he was the most melancholy man ranulf had ever met even when he smiled no one could tell anyone so doleful was not good company and henry roger and hugh de plucknet had soon found reasons to excuse themselves ranulf remained for he felt sorry for berkeley whod been ruined by a war not of his making hed not really cared who was king but hed had the bad luck to hold a very strategic stronghold berkeley castle which controlled the gloucesterbristol road a few years ago hed been lured into an ambush by roger fitz miless ruthless younger brother walter and threatened with hanging if he did not yield berkeley castle walter had gone so far as to string berkeley up and cut him down just in time but berkeley had refused to turn over the castle gambling on his kinship to the fitz miles family to save his life in the end it had but hed still lost berkeley castle for hed had to renounce his allegiance to stephen to gain his freedom and stephen then seized the castle for himself berkeley was miserly with words and left it for ranulf to keep the conversation going ranulf soon ran out of topics to talk about and suggested a chess game until he could politely make his escape but theyd just set up the board when the castle steward announced that a man was pleading to see sir roger straightaway berkeley seemed to be a man without normal curiosity for he was inclining toward a refusal when the steward said i recognized him my lord it is malcolm from the berkeley garrison the man was thin and balding and obviously agitated kneeling before roger de berkeley he stammered itit is me sir rogermalcolm i had to warn you for you were right good to me whilst you held the castle we got word today from the kings son lord eustace found out that the empresss son would be staying the night at dursley and he means to see that lord henry never reaches bristol hell be here by dawn mayhap sooner and he wants our garrison to lay ambushes on the bristol road just in case lord henry gets away from him at dursley roger fitz miles and hugh de plucknet had been drawn by the noise returning in time to hear the last of malcolms warning as roger de berkeley rewarded malcolm ranulf and the other two men huddled together for a quick conference they agreed with ranulfs conclusion that dursley was not likely to withstand a siege and roger volunteered to fetch henry revealing his concern by the alacrity with which he started for the stairwell ranulf sent hugh off to the stables to order their horses saddled i know this part of the country fairly well he told berkeley but not well enough we need a man who knows every lane and byway and trail betwixt here and bristol for well have to avoid the main roads do you have a man like that sir roger berkeley assured ranulf that he did with much more animation than he usually showed ranulf could well imagine his relief at not being caught up in a dangerous siege one that would have imperiled the only castle he had left hed do whatever he could to make sure they were long gone by the time eustace got here and ranulf couldnt blame him a bit but it was then that roger fitz miles came hastening back into the hall harry is gone he panted i cannot find him anywhere when a search of the castle grounds turned up no traces of henry the mens anxiety rapidly gave way to outright alarm at a loss they regrouped in the great hall to decide what to do next and it was then that ranulf remembered how friendly his nephew had become with his squire it had not surprised him that henry should seek out seventeenyearold padarns company for he was rarely allowed the privilege of acting his age even in childhood hed been expected to show a maturity beyond his years and he rarely disappointed but ranulf had come to realize that there must be times when his nephew just wanted to have fun padarn he said abruptly he may know where harry has gone that welsh squire of yours roger sounded as dubious as hugh and berkeley looked but they were willing to grasp at any straw and followed nervously after ranulf as he went off in search of his squire they found padarn in the stables he was a wiry lean youngster very welsh in appearance it had taken ranulf a while not to think of anceland annoraeach time he glanced at padarns raven hair and black eyes padarn looked so guilty now that ranulf knew his suspicions were correct where is harry he demanded brushing aside the boys unconvincing attempts at denial padarn we have no time for games harrys life could be forfeit if you do not speak up eustace is riding for dursley and if we do not get away soon well not get away at all padarn had a welshmans innate suspicion of authority but in the past year hed learned to trust ranulfs judgment harry slipped out the postern gate at dusk and went into the town what to the welsh youth was a town was to the men barely more than a hamlet a church and a handful of cottages clustered in the protective shelter of the castle that makes no sense roger insisted there is not even an alehouse ranulf was remembering though what it was like to be sixteen a girl padarn nodded we saw her by the church as we rode in she had hair the color of moonlight and she gave harry a come back smile you ought not to blame him my lords he added bravely had he known about eustace he would not have gone the welsh were notorious for not knowing their place and at another time padarn was likely to have earned himself a reprimand for that familiar use of harry but now the men had no time for breaches of protocol they were hurrying to catch up with ranulf as he headed back out into the bailey once there ranulf snatched a lantern from a passing servant let me try to find him first he said eustace could have men watching the village for all we know if a crowd goes chasing out into the street raising the hue and cry that will be a sure sign that something is amiss they agreed reluctantly and roger promised to have them mounted and ready to ride as soon as ranulf and henry returned no one mentioned their secret shared fear that if eustace did have spies about henry might well have been found alreadyby the wrong men the village was half hidden in the haze of a deepening turquoise twilight but its inhabitants were still up and about both apprehensive and excited by henrys presence in their midst dogs were barking somewhere a child was wailing aware of eyes following him as he moved down the dusty street ranulf was trying to think like a sixteenyearold again what would a youth most want after finding himself a lass with a come back smile privacy of course there was a small pond beyond the church screened by yew trees and white willows what better place for a tryst weaving his way between the mosscovered tombstones behind the church he heard soft smothered laughter as he approached the pond merriment so quickly cut off that he knew theyd either heard him or spotted his lanterns glow harry he said quietly into the silence youd best come out for i am not going away there was a rustling sound the willows cascading silvery camouflage parted and his nephew emerged from the shadows the girl stayed where she was ranulf caught only a fleeting glimpse of disheveled bright hair as henry stepped forward into the light cast by ranulfs lantern how did you know where to look for me he sounded both defiant and defensive i was not lost uncle ranulf am quite capable of finding my way back to the castle by myself ranulfs relief found expression in anger youre lucky i did find you he snapped instead of an irate father or a jealous husband youre my uncle not my confessor henry snapped back though you are suddenly acting more like a gaoler than a kinsmanand i like it not i do not need a wet nurse no ranulf agreed but you do need a bodyguard lad youre going to have to learn to live with that harry kings cannot wander off as they please that is the price they pay for the power they wield there is always a price i just thank god and his saints that you did not pay it tonight in blood henry was still frowning but he was more uneasy now than angry for ranulf was not given to hyperbole is something wrong he asked warily sensing that this was the question he should have asked first well eustace is about to attack dursley the berkeley garrison is busy laying ambushes for us in the unlikely event we escape whilst we pass the time playing hideandseek with you instead of riding for our lives even in the flickering lantern light ranulf could see the color crimsoning across his nephews cheekbones i am sorry henry said i did not know it is not too late is it henrys heartfelt apology only made ranulf regret his sarcasm all the more no lad we still have time he assured the boy quickly my nerves are on the raw thats all we feared you see that eustace might have an assassin or two on the prowl henrys eyes widened for this had never occurred to him stephen would not do that he said his tone nowhere near as certain as his words eustace would ranulf said flatly never doubt that harry not if you want to live to make old bones nowi suggest you bid your lass farewell for we have a long hard ride ahead of us the girl had ventured out from beneath the sheltering willow padarn had been right her hair did have a silvery sheen she would have been very pretty indeed if not for her pout arms akimbo little chin jutting out she was clearly losing patience fast but then henry came swiftly back to her side took her in his arms and kissed her with a boys exuberance and a mans passion when he finally released her she looked dazed kissing her hand gallantly he said someday sweetheart youll be able to tell your children that you once kissed a king eustace and god willing ranulf said dryly amused in spite of himself and henry grinned i hope you are not suggesting that the almighty and eustace are allies id not presume to answer for our lord god but im willing to wager that i can hold my own against eustace his cockiness was contagious and ranulf grinned too i do believe lad that you will noware you ready for the ride of your life henry nodded i say we race the devil and eustace to bristol winner take all eustace and his men arrived in dursley before daybreak but they were too late enraged that his prey had eluded him eustace set out in hellbent pursuit but henry evaded the ambushes outran eustace and managed to reach bristol safely eustace chased him almost to the gates of bristol he did not have enough men though to besiege the city and reluctantly withdrew laying waste to the countryside as he retreated back to oxford stephen had been forced to remain in yorkshire that summer for as long as the scots king was at carlisle york was not safe he put up several countercastles and did all he could to encourage his supporters and dishearten his foes but it was not until september that he was able to return to london he soon joined his son at oxford and eustace set about convincing him that henry had presented them with an opportunity that might not come again was it not better he argued to put an end to this accursed war once and for all so persistent and persuasive was he that stephen overcame his misgivings and reluctantly agreed to wage war with such ferocity that their enemies would be compelled to surrenderor starve even the prostephen chronicle gesta stephani was shocked by the campaign conducted that autumn by the english king and his son they took and plundered everything they came upon set fire to houses and churches and what was a more cruel and brutal sight fired the crops that had been reaped and stacked all over the fields consumed and brought to nothing everything edible they found they raged with this bestial cruelty especially round marlborough they showed it also very terribly round devizes and they had in mind to do the same to their adversaries all over england the day had begun with trouble and it got steadily worse in midmorning a messenger from john marshal had reached devizes with disturbing news marshal reported that he was being hard pressed by the king and eustace they had launched several lightning raids upon the town and castle doing considerable damage before they were driven off theyd laid waste to the nearby farms and manors and when marshal had attempted to bring in a supply convoy theyd ambushed it and burned what they did not take away with them john marshal was the least likely man to panic as ranulf well knew for him to admit that he did not know how he was going to feed his people through the winter he had to be in dire straits indeed ranulf and henry had gotten similar complaints from marshals brotherinlaw patrick fitz walter earl of salisbury and from the castellan of trowbridge even roger fitz miles had been harassed at gloucester ghost villages were springing up all over wiltshire and gloucestershire as terrified families fled to the towns for safety salisbury and gloucester and even bristol were flooded with refugees people with nowhere to go and no money to buy food charred ruins were becoming commonplace throughout the desolated countryside an acrid burning smell was carried for miles on the october wind and what had once been fertile farmlands were now scorched blackened earth oddly enough never had the roads been so free of bandits though for even the outlaws had fled from stephens marauding army devizes had not been spared either some of the royal armys worst depredations had taken place in and about devizes the town had been raided a fortnight ago and the castle subjected to several hitandrun attacks it was a rare day when henry and ranulf could not see smoke from the castle battlements and their own provisions were dwindling dangerously it reminded ranulf of the sieges of winchester and oxford only now england itself seemed under siege the day was coming to a dismal end when refugees arrived from calne a small village five miles to the north they huddled together in the great hall the most pitiful wretches henry had ever seen their clothes shredded and ripped in their flight through the woods scratched and bruised and still shaking with fright but they were the lucky ones the ones whod gotten away the tale they told was as deplorable as it wasby nowfamiliar the lord eustace had raided calne they reported his men had killed those few whod dared to resist setting fire to their church and then to their fields theyd watched from hiding as their crops went up in flames and they wept again as they spoke of it for there would be no food to feed the village once winter came their houses could be rebuilt but what could they eat how would they survive until spring they asked henry these questions calling him young lord and pleading for his help he wasnt sure if they knew who he was they might have been told of his presence at devizes or they might be assuming that he must be someone of importance since he was well dressed and well fed and lived in a castle he was not even sure that his name would mean anything to them this war had been ravaging england for ten years did these people truly care who ruled over them as long as they were left in peace he did not know what to say to them he did not know how to help them he ordered them fed and he yearned to assure them that the danger was past but he feared that would have been a lie he stood it as long as he could but his pity and anger finally got the best of him and he bolted the hall retreating up to the solar with a flagon of wine and a head full of unanswered questions he was not alone for long ranulf soon followed he was relieved to see the flagon was untouched for hed known too many men who turned to wine when they needed a crutch and sixteen was a vulnerable age for learning bad habits henry was straddling a chair resting his chin on his arms as he stared into the fire he didnt stir not even after ranulf pulled a chair up beside him ranulf was content to wait and they sat in silence for a while listening to the flames crackle in the hearth i do not understand henry said at last why they do not just lay siege to devizes i am the one they want why do they not try to take me ive thought about that too first of all they cannot be sure that you are at devizes what if they besiege devizes and it turns out you were at bristol or gloucester or marlborough all the while none of those castles could be easily taken devizes or marlborough could hold out for months and bristol till judgment day and whilst they were laying siege theyd be vulnerable to attack themselves that is what happened to stephen at wilton by striking fast and riding on he avoids becoming a target by surprise raids he spreads fear over the entire countryside for no one knows where he will attack next and by burning the crops he takes the food from our table too empties our larder but the others will starve ere we do henry pointed out castles always have food stored away the villagers and villeins will go hungry first and theyll die first too are they willing to do that ranulf to let so many die for no sin of their own i would have said no ranulf said had i not seen this suffering for myself and yet you claim stephen is a good man henry sounded hostile but ranulf understood that he was not the real target of the boys anger he even welcomed this rage as proof that his nephew no longer saw all this as a game he remembered how it was to be that young to feel invulnerable even their wild ride for bristol had been as exciting as it was urgent at least to henry but this was different this was war at its ugliest and no man could look upon it and be unchanged not if he was of any worth and so he was sorry for his nephews pain but glad of it too for this was a lesson henry had to learn that they would resort to such drastic measures tells me that they see you as a very real threat harry so much so that they are willing to wade through blood to eliminate you now whilst they still can this savage campaign is an admission that they dare not let you reach full manhood it also shows us that eustace is the most dangerous sort of battle commander the kind who cares not how many die as long as he has the victory henry looked skeptical why are you so sure this is eustaces doing because this campaign of theirs is both brilliant and brutalfar too brutal for stephen to stomach on his own one of stephens worst flaws is that he invariably listens to the wrong people god help england if he is now listening to eustace if they keep on like this henry said somberly theyll end up ruling over a graveyard do they truly think they can starve us into submission ranulf nodded grimly or else force us into doing battle hopelessly outnumbered thank you no uncle i like not those odds id just as soon not starve either henry added strivingwith limited successfor flippancy damn them he cried suddenly fiercely damn them for killing and not caring my mother would never have permitted a slaughter like this never his hair short and unruly gleamed in the firelight like a bright burnished cap and his fair skin darkened now with a surge of hot blood he looked angry and shaken young and resolute all at the same time what can we do to stop this uncle ranulf nothing ranulf admitted reluctantly we can only wait see what happens we are going to have to depend upon the almighty and our allies for our deliverance lad for this is one trap we cannot escape on our own our allies henry echoed and the same thought was in both their minds john marshal and the earl of salisbury and roger fitz miles and roberts son will were all in the same sorry plight rainald was still in cornwall baldwin de redvers was said to be ailing and henrys parents were in normandy unaware of their sons peril robert and miles were dead brien living as a monk that narrowed the field to two but by the time the scots king could muster an army and march into england to their rescue it would be too late so allies came down to one powerful selfserving unpredictable man randolph de gernons earl of chester after a few moments of heavy silence henry laughed softly at ranulfs look of surprise he said with a wry smile i was just thinkingwhen my mother got herself into a tight corner she could always rely upon uncle robert to rescue her and who do i getthe earl of chester he laughed again and this time so did ranulf when put that way what else was there to do but laugh chester castle england october the letter came at noon and chester and his brother retired to his bedchamber to read it maud was standing by that door now unable to wait any longer she knew chester would not like her intrusion but she pushed the door open and entered anyway william de roumare and bennet de malpas and ivo de coventry all glanced up in surprise her husband was nowhere in sight the letter lay open upon the table and she moved forward picked it up and read rapidly her brotherinlaw frowned his own wife would not have dared to meddle like that he left it to chester to reprimand her however he would not have admitted it even to himself but he was never fully at ease with chesters highspirited strongwilled wife maud put the letter down glancing toward the corner privy chamber and then back at her husbands men the rumors are true then she said my cousin harry is in grave peril when they nodded she cried impatiently and what are you going to do about it you do mean to go to his aid do you not bennet de malpas and ivo de coventry were more than willing to defer to chesters brother william de roumare was irked by this abrupt female interrogation but he found himself answering as if shed willed it of course we want to help him maud and indeed we will if only we can find a way we cannot meet stephen on the field though for we lack enough men for a pitched battle then stir up trouble for stephen elsewhere and take the pressure off harry and marshal and the others under attack you must draw stephen away from wiltshire ere it is too late i assure you weve already thought of that william de roumare said stiffly but it will not work of course it will remember how baldwin de redvers attacked corfe to lure stephen west whilst my aunt and my father landed at arundel and then there was you are forgetting oxford when stephen had maude trapped in the castle there not even the lord christ could have drawn him away for nothing was more important than capturing his enemy the empress you may be sure that he wants her son no less badly and hell let england go up in flames ere he lets the lad get away maud stared at him in dismay he was as cautious as chester was reckless the anchor to chesters sails but his argument held the ring of truth at that moment her husband emerged from the privy chamber i thought i heard your voice he said let me guessyou want me to swear a blood oath that ill rescue your cousin and uncle preferably by nightfall i cannot jest about this randolph not when the danger is so great will says nothing can be done but surely you can come up with a plan if you keep on trying i already have that got the mens attention too what mean you to do randolph his brother asked sounding perplexed if we cannot chase stephen away and cannot lure him away what in gods name is left but we can lure him away chester insisted it is just a matter of finding the right bait he seemed so pleased with himself that maud knew this was no empty boast what was he up to whatever it was she did not doubt hed benefit by it too for that was ever his way and after a moments reflection she knew what he had in mind a stratagem at once ruthless and vengeful and sure to succeed the look she gave him then was one shed rarely bestowed upon any man but her father and never before upon her husbandone of awed admiration lincoln she breathed and chester grinned raffishly just so he said lincoln men were gathering outside stephens command tent eavesdropping upon the quarrel raging within a newcomer jostled the man next to him wanting to know what was going on that hellspawn chester has attacked lincoln and the townspeople are pleading with the king to come and save them ere the city falls the king wants to set out straightaway and the lord eustace is trying to talk him out of it if you come closer and keep still you can hear for yourself stephen hated to argue and eustace was often able to use that to his advantage but not this time his father remained adamant determined to come to the aid of the besieged lincolners and nothing eustace could say would sway him those people suffered dreadfully after the battle of lincoln eustace hundreds drowned when they tried to flee the city and their boats overturned in the flooded river and countless others were slaughtered by that whoreson chester through it all they stayed loyal to me how can you expect me to ignore their plea for help catching henry is more important papa if we can get rid of maudes whelp weve won our war and we can deal then with chester why can you not see that because by then it would be too late for the people of lincoln so what eustace was being deliberately brutally blunt he prided himself upon his candor upon daring to say what other men would not and he hoped that a dose of unsparing honesty might bring his father back to his senses so what he repeated people die all the time papa why are the lincolners more important than the wiltshire villagers wholl starve this winter we agreed to do whatever we must to end this war even if it meant innocent people would die for englands greater good we agreed for a peaceful land if that was true yesterday it is still true today let the men of lincoln fend for themselves stephen slowly shook his head i cannot do that eustace they trusted me once before and i let them down i could not help them then but i can now ill not turn away from them in their hour of need eustaces frustration served now as fuel for his anger blazing beyond his control it is your pride you want to save not the lincolners ever since your defeat there you and chester have been snarling over that wretched city like two dogs over a bone go ahead then abandon our campaign and race north to their rescue but it will avail you naught men will still remember how badly you were beaten at lincoln eustace had meant to wound and yet he felt an odd pang of remorse when he saw the hurt on his fathers face he did not know how to make it right though for an apology would be an admission of weakness stephen looked at his son saying nothing eustace could feel his face getting warm just when he thought he could endure it no longer his father brushed past him and lifted the tent flap make ready to depart at first light he commanded someone beyond the range of eustaces vision i will be riding for lincoln on the morrow the citizens of lincoln put up such a desperate defense that they were able to stave off chesters attack until stephen came to the rescue chester withdrew his forces but he did not go far and the battle shifted from the city to the shire lincolnshire became a bloody ground as the king and his mightiest subject fought a series of inconclusive skirmishes ambushes and raids in the words of the chronicler of the gesta stephani they alternated betwen success and disaster never without the greatest injury to the county never without loss and harm to its people stephens failure to subdue the rebel earl was observed in other quarters and the erratic hugh bigod was emboldened enough to stir up trouble again in east anglia this was his third uprising but this time he got more than he bargained for chester was keeping stephen busy in lincolnshire and the task of dealing with bigod fell to eustace he raced north and soon had bigod in full retreat henry and his allies were quick enough to take advantage of all this chaos and unrest he and ranulf joined the earls of hereford and gloucester and raided deep into devon and dorset they set about making life as miserable as possible for henry de tracy stephens chief supporter in the west country with some success tracy prudently refused to do battle though withdrawing behind the fortified defenses of his castle at barnstaple but henry then bloodied his sword for the first time in the capture of the town and castle at bridgport nature showed the southwest of england more mercy that year than man did and november usually the least welcome of visitors was blessedly mildmannered but the reprieve was brief for the homeless and the hungry and by middecember winter was stalking the warravaged shires in earnest in the mornings the ground was glazed with a killing black frost the winds soon stripped the trees bare and ponds and lakes began to ice over the more weatherwise of henrys men were keeping a wary eye upon the gathering clouds for a mottled mackerel sky was a harbinger of rain or snow they were riding fast heading back toward devizes having gotten word that eustace was once again on the prowl in wiltshire a second warning from john marshal had alarmed henry enough to send an advance guard ahead to reinforce the castle garrison roger and will had thought he was being overly cautious but henry had insisted and ranulf had backed him up reminding them that robert had always been one for taking extra precautions too in supporting one nephew ranulf inadvertently offended the other for will had become very thinskinned since his fathers death twisting any praise of robert into an implied criticism of himself roger ought to have understood wills insecurities if any man could for miles had also cast a smothering shadow but hed so far shown little patience with wills defensive outbursts and henry was too young and too confident to comprehend such crippling selfdoubts so it fell to ranulf to act as peacemaker he did not mind for he truly did feel sorry for will he knew that men were indeed thinking what will feared that the son would never measure up to the sire the wind had picked up as the day wore on gusting from the northeast another sign of unsettled weather on the way theyd halted to give their horses a rest but it was too cold for the men to enjoy the respite themselves ranulf joined henry in the shelter of a massive gnarled oak are you still uneasy about devizes lad you could not have picked a better man to leave in command than hugh de plucknet he was utterly fearless during our escape through the snow at oxford ive told you about that have i not repeatedly henry said then ducked laughing out of range when ranulf tried to elbow him in the ribs you read me all too well uncle ranulf i was thinking of devizesand of war and why some men are so much better at it than others what makes a good battle commander courage alone is not enough roger is so reckless that it is downright scary at times but he does not seem to have a grasp of strategy so what is it then if hed not been born an earls son chester would likely have been hanged as a bandit but men say he is a right able battle commander and my uncle david is very good indeed at governing but not as good at fighting is it not possible to be good at both ranulf nodded your uncle robert was such a man lad he was a brilliant battle commander but he would also have made an excellent king but with one flaw henry glanced around to make sure his cousin was not within earshot will would have been his heir that had never occurred to ranulf god save england he said with feeling and they both laughed but then ranulf stiffened moving away from the tree with a startled oath for the sky to the north was streaking with smoke dusk came early in december and the fading light slowed them down they forged ahead though sure that the smoke was coming from devizes and soon had confirmation of their fears a lone rider was galloping south at a reckless speed he shouted at sight of them yanking his lathered stallion to a shuddering halt scant feet from henry devizes is under attack my lord eustace burned the town and then laid siege to the castle by the time we got there theyd breached the outer defenses and had driven the garrison into the keep when we rode in sir hugh and his men sallied forth on the attack again i suppose they thought the whole of your army had arrived of course we then went to their aid but were outnumbered my lord you must get there fast or youll lose the men the town and the castle too riding into devizes was like riding into hell orange flames were shooting up into the darkening sky black suffocating smoke was everywhere and bodies were stacked like firewood in the narrow streets but the bloody fighting was done eustace and his men were in retreat having broken off the battle once they heard the sounds of an approaching army hugh de plucknet was limping toward them blood was running down his leg his face was begrimed with smoke and one eye was squinting half closed by a rapidly swelling bruise but he was grinning broadly your timing was wellnigh perfect my lord he told henry gleefully we were being hammered right bad but they turned tail once they realized you were coming up upon them say what you will of eustace hes got brains as well as ballocks for he knew when he was beaten and to give the devil his due he can fight with the best of them hugh sounded almost admiring that would have perplexed henry at one time but he was learning that for some men courage was the true coin of the realm and as long as a man had it to spend he could earn himself unlimited credit whatever his political debts but while henry was coming to understand this point of view he did not share it and he found it hard to muster up any respect for eustace whose only demonstrable talent seemed to be for killing roger was all for pursuing the enemy but ranulf and will thought it a waste of time and henry agreed the men would just scatter in the darkness for now it was enough that hed driven eustace off and saved devizes from all hed heard of his rival this would fester with eustace like a running sore that hed been put to flight by the whelp the stripling the foe hed so openly scorned henry felt triumphant tired and angry by turns dismounting hastily he set men to fighting the fires people had begun to creep out of hiding and cries and lamenting soon filled the air as the survivors discovered the bodies of loved ones embers lit the night like winter fireflies and when snow began to fall the scene took on an air of eerie unreality to henry a weird juxtaposition of fire and ice heat and cold grief and joy he watched as a church was given up to the flames as slateroofed cottages were saved and thatched ones doomed as horses were blindfolded and led to safety from the blazing stables all around him men were shivering and sweating slipping in the snow only to be singed in the smoldering ruins people were celebrating their deliverance and mourning their dead even as the fires continued to burn and the snow to drift down into their midst and as he walked through the wreckage of this prosperous market town he heard himself proclaimed as its saviour ranulf eventually found henry in a churchyard watching somberly as a weeping man and woman crouched over the body of their fouryearold son trampled by the horses of eustaces fleeing soldiers the fires are almost out come on back to the castle harry you must be half frozen by now henry nodded then flinched when the woman began a high keening wail i am thankful that we got here in time he said i am beholden to god and to hugh de plucknet for not giving up i know we won a victory here this night but i am beginning to see uncle that victories in this war are not what they seem for what have we truly won the chance to do it all again on the morrow ranulf could not argue for hed come to realize that too a bitter lesson learned at grievous cost in the past two years he did not know whether to be sorry or glad that his nephew was learning it so young the winter weather put a temporary halt to campaigning henry paid a prudent courtesy call upon the bishop of salisbury who was still pressing the churchs claim to devizes he visited john marshal who was just fourteen miles away at marlborough and he and ranulf passed a quiet christmas at devizes castle january was cold and blustery and ranulf and henry were surprised in midmonth by the unexpected arrival of john marshal and the earls of hereford gloucester and salisbury after a hearty meal of roast goose and pork pie they withdrew to the solar where the men soon revealed why they were at devizesto convince henry that he ought to go back to normandy although they phrased it as tactfully as possible the gist of their message was unmistakable henry had become a liability he stiffened in shock but did not interrupt hearing them out in silence only then did he say coolly it sounds as if you want to get rid of me roger and will and the earl of salisbury at once made vociferous denials john marshal sat back in his seat arms folded across his chest looking like a bored pirate chieftain when henry glanced his way he drained his wine cup set it down with a thud and then said candidly you are right we do want you out of england at least for a while the other men protested even more vehemently but henry paid them no heed go on he told marshal explain yourself it is a matter of survival ours and yours you do not have enough of an army to force another battle of lincoln upon stephen not yet but as long as you remain on english soil youll be a target for stephen and eustace you saw what they did to these shires last autumn well it will happen all over again come spring and it will keep on happening until you get safely beyond their reachback to normandy what are you saying that i should just give up the older man shook his head impatiently good christ no we want the crown for you almost as much as you want it yourself but this is not the way to win your war youve acquitted yourself well this past year he said and henry flushed with pleasure for he knew marshal was not a man to pay polite compliments what we need now though is some time to heal our wounds and plant our crops and strengthen our defenses you can give us that timebut not if you stay in england they all watched henry intently once marshal was done speaking but he gave them no clue as to what he meant to do i shall think upon what youve told me he said and they had to be content with that for theyd learned that like his mother hed balk if pushed ranulf thought marshals argument made sense but he was not sure if henry had been ready to hear it it was only natural that hed long for a decisive victory to end his first campaign ranulf did not want his nephews pride to put him at needless risk but neither did he want the youth to return to normandy thinking that hed failed an unclenephew talk was in order he decided he was groping his way up the spiral stairwell toward henrys bedchamber when he collided with someone coming down his initial contact was enough to tell him hed bumped into a female and his first guess was that she was a maidservant for she was carrying a tray and wine flagon but then he caught a whiff of jasmine perfume too expensive for a servinggirl and realized that this was henrys bedmate lora there was a wall sconce several feet above them casting a feeble light upon the stairs and before she ducked her head he saw the tear tracks on her cheek what is wrong lass he asked wondering why she should be weeping alone out in the stairwell this could be no lovers quarrel for her tryst with henry was a business transaction hed met lora upon his visit to salisbury and had taken a fancy to the young prostitute coaxing her into coming back with him to devizes ranulf had approved of his nephews taste for she was fair of face and lush of body and seemed quite worldly for her years just eighteen or thereabouts what is it lass he asked again gently why do you weep she startled him then with a flare of temper for until now shed always appeared cheerful and accommodating did you think whores had no tears she snapped if we do not often weep it is only because we learn early on that it avails us naught beneath the sarcasm was a genuine hurt and he took no offense can i help he asked and she shook her head swiping at her wet cheek with the back of her hand a gesture he found plaintively childlike i did not mean to bite your head off she said youve always been right good to me lord ranulf and deserve better than that i was crying because lord harry told me he is leaving i see ranulf said for he did her tears made perfect sense now of course she would be sorry to see their liaison end for shed achieved the pinnacle of success for one in her precarious profession shed found herself a highborn protector one who was young and personable in the bargain little wonder he thought that the lass dreaded going back to her old life in salisbury lora could not read books but shed learned of necessity to read men ill not deny she said that i shall miss the comforts of a castle servants and a feather bed and a roof that does not leak and no lack of candles or firewoodwho would willingly give up such ease but whether you believe me or not it is lord harry i shall miss the most he never made me feel like a whore not once she added defiantly as if to fend off his disbelief is that so uncommon lora he asked and she nodded marveling that a lord like ranulf could ask so innocent a question she did not doubt that henry even at sixteen already understood more than his uncle about mankinds propensity for careless cruelties very uncommon my lord she said bleakly but lord harry has a good heart moreover he truly likes women most men do lass ranulf pointed out in amusement and was surprised when she shook her head again no my lord she contradicted him with an odd smile one that was both cynical and sad most men like to lay with women ranulf felt pity stirring and he hoped it did not show upon his face harry truly has no choice lora he must return to normandybut not for good hell be back the smile she gave him now was polite and practiced and far too knowing for her years yes she said but not for me i ran into lora in the stairwell she said youve decided to go for what it is worth harry i think you made a wise choice henry shrugged wellmy father always said that if you want to get invited back youd best know when to go home ranulf was not fooled by the levity it sounds to me he said as if youre uneasy in your own mind about this henry shrugged again it is just that if i go now ranulf all my efforts will have been soso damned inconclusive youre going home alive harry what is inconclusive about that for nigh on a year stephen and eustace did their accursed best to hunt you down but to no avail you think that went unnoticed all over england there are men thinking to themselves if they could not bring the empresss son to ruination at sixteen how are they going to fare against him once he reaches nineteen or twenty no lad this campaign of yours was a rousing success for you opened the door wide for your next foray and youve got a powerful ally on your sidetime ive a better ally than that ive got eustace too henry said and smiled at ranulfs surprise fortunes wheel has turned with a vengeance uncle why was it so easy for stephen to steal my mothers crown the country was not full of men afire to put stephen on the throne they just did not want the empress geoffrey of anjous wife and nownow none of them can be utterly sure that ill make a good king his smile flashed again sudden and sardonic but theres hardly a soul in england he said who doubts that eustace would make a bad one ranulf accompanied henry to wareham and promised to join him and maude in normandy after he paid a farewell visit to his welsh kin he and padarn then started off on their long journey back to gwynedd henry sailed with the tide for barfleur henry received a joyous welcome from his parents and partisans in normandy geoffrey was pleased enough with his firstborns prowess to declare henry legally of age he then did something which greatly gratified his wife horrified stephen alarmed the french kingnewly back from the holy landand astonished most of christendom hed always contended that he was holding normandy for henry but hed won the duchy by his own efforts and in their world men rarely yielded up power of their own free will that was what geoffrey now did though relinquishing his rights to normandy in his sons favor while still a month shy of his seventeenth birthday henry became duke of normandy trefriw north wales february it was a typical february afternoonraw and grey selwyn one of the youths honing his skills of manhood in rhodris service had built a fire in the open hearth burying a log in wood ash so it would burn slowly and steadily bechan the servingmaid was dipping candles in sheeps tallow for only the very wealthy and the very extravagant burned wax candles for everyday use olwen who attended rhiannon and eleri had positioned a spindle close to the hearth so she could spin flax in comparative comfort and rhiannon had brought a mortar and pestle to the table where she set about crushing wood betony the cook had been ailing she explained to the curious selwyn and when mixed with honey powdered betony leaves eased coughing and shortness of breath selwyn was never satisfied with a simple answer and he wanted to know all about the other uses of betony rhiannon answered patiently as he flung question after question her way for she liked the boy but she was glad nonetheless when he fetched a whetstone and began to sharpen his sword he was touchingly proud of the weaponhis firstfor he was only fourteen and he was soon so intent upon his task that rhiannon and herbal remedies were forgotten rhiannon welcomed the silence for shed awakened that morning with a headache that was so far resisting both sage and pennyroyal shed been able though to use the headache to escape accompanying enid and eleri on a courtesy call to a neighbor whod recently given birth to her first child enid and eleri had not objected for the woman invariably fluttered around rhiannon like a deranged moth so acutely uncomfortable with rhiannons blindness that she made everyone else equally uncomfortable with her rhiannon had anothersecretreason for not wanting to visit blodwen she agreed heartily with eleris caustic assessment of blodwen as a woman who has feathers where her brains ought to be she could bear blodwens twittering and fidgety hospitalityif she had to what she could not endure was that the almighty had seen fit to give foolish shallow blodwen what rhiannon would never have herself a newborn son snatching up his mantle selwyn muttered something about an errand rhiannon suspected he was off to the kitchen for he seemed to spend half of his time there trying to inveigle cider and honeyed wafers from the cook hed been gone only a few moments when the door opened again and a familiar voice bellowed out an unnecessary proclamation of his arrival rhiannon was delighted her father had been at aber for the past week attending his king owain gwynedd papa youre back early pushing her chair away from the table she started toward the sound of his voice the warning was not in time her father cried out her name but by then shed already stumbled over something out in the middle of the floor something hard and heavy something that should not have been there as she fell she felt a sudden surge of heat and she twisted desperately away from it she avoided the open hearth but hit the ground hard enough to drive all the air out of her lungs momentarily stunned she lay still until her father reached her with olwen just a step behind i am not hurt papa she insisted and after shed repeated it for the fourth time he finally believed her he was assisting her to her feet when selwyn came back into the hall rhodri glanced from the boy to the offending whetstone and then erupted ranulf had once told rhiannon and eleri about a legendary mountain called vesuvius said to belch forth fire and smoke rhiannon thought her fathers temper was like that volcano usually so inert and sluggish that his rare explosions were terrifying there was no doubt that selwyn was thoroughly cowed reduced to incoherent stammerings as rhodri berated him furiously for his carelessness the day i took you into my household i warned you that you were never to leave things strewn about or to move furniture did i not you swore upon your very soul that you would be heedfuland so what happens my daughter nearly fell into the fire because you did not put your whetstone away rhiannon eventually managed to reassure her father assuage his anger and spare selwyn the worst of his wrath by then she was exhausted for shed been more shaken by her fall than she was willing to admit as soon as she could she withdrew to the bedchamber she shared with eleri and lay down fully clothed upon the bed her cheek was stinging and would likely bruise but the bruises that troubled her were the ones on her memory it would be a while before she could forget her terror as she felt the flames what frightened her just as much was the reminder of how fragile the defenses of her world were all it took was one misplaced whetstone to reveal how vulnerable she truly was when she finally fell asleep it wasnt peaceful she was dreaming of ranulf but there was no joy in it just unease and shadows and an ominous sense of foreboding for theyd not gotten a letter from him in months and rhiannon had no proof that he was even still alive she tossed and turned restlessly and was glad to be awakened by the opening door it was a mans footstep too light for rhodri too heavy for selwyn rhiannon sat up puzzled and listened again who else could it be but papa or the lad and then she caught her breath ranulf she whispered half afraid to let herself hope and was rewarded with a sound sweeter to her than the heavenly harps of the almightys own angelsranulfs laughter you are truly amazing lass how is it that you can remember the sound of my step after so many months she could have told him it was because shed heard those footsteps echoing through her dreams almost every night since hed gone away but of course nothing short of torture would have gotten that out of her i am so glad youve come back ranulf she said instead and added a silent prayer that this time he would stay the fortnight that followed was the happiest of rhiannons life she knew it couldnt last that sooner or later ranulf would ride off again hed said as much that hed agreed to join henry in normandy but she resolutely refused to think about that he could always change his mind for the moment it was enough that he was safe and well and home ranulf had returned in high spirits bringing gifts and gossip from the world that lay beyond the mountains of eryri he enthralled them with dramatic accounts of the escape from dursely and the triumph at devizes he horrified them with stories of the suffering stephen had loosed upon his own subjects and he fascinated them with reports of the scandal that had trailed the french monarchs all the way from palestine rhiannon and eleri did not find eleanors thwarted attempt to escape her marital bonds as surprising as ranulf had welsh women enjoyed liberties unheardof in the rest of christendom one of them being the right to walk away from a miserable marriage they sympathized instinctively with the spirited french queen were indignant that she should have been forced to accompany her husband from antioch and listened spellbound when ranulf revealed the unexpected twist to this sad tale on their way home from the holy land he related theyd passed some days in italy as guests of the pope and the elderly pontiff had set himself a herculean task mending the rift between these utterly mismatched souls he had even gone so far ranulf divulged as to escort them to bed and urge them to make their peace between the sheets the popes blessing seemed to have paid off for eleanor was now pregnant for only the third time in thirteen years the child was due that summer and the french kings subjects were waiting anxiously to see if after a miscarriage and a daughter she would at last bear him a son each morning rhiannon awakened with the same subversive thought one she quickly disavowed would this be the day that ranulf announced hed soon be leaving but it was not ranulf who brought this interlude to an abrupt end it was her father a damp darkness had fallen by the time rhiannon started out to the stables with a jug of milk meant for the stable cat and her kittens cats were rarely kept as pets except in nunneries but rhiannon was enchanted by them for she did not need sight to appreciate their sleek lines and soft fur and lulling purr she had just reached their well when rhodri rode in hastily dismounting he sent his horse off to the stables with selwyn and hurried toward his daughter is ranulf within i must talk to him straightaway lass ive come up with a way to keep him in wales here with us where he belongs rhiannons heartbeat picked up a quicker rhythm truly papa how rhodri reached out and gripped her by the elbows she could tell by the tone of his voice that he was smiling i am going to name him as my heir and convince him to take eleri as his wife he heard her gasp and enveloped her in an expansive hug she found her face pressed against the wet wool of his mantle the feel scratchy and smothering it is the ideal solution rhiannon where could i hope to find a better brotherinlaw for you and ranulf and eleri will have a good marriage whilst making their home and raising their children on our land i tell you lambkin it is wellnigh perfect rhiannon was too stunned to respond but rhodri was too jubilant to notice youd best go feed those fleabitten cats ere i decide to drown the sorry lot he teased but do not tarry longer than need be with the mangy beasts for well have much to celebrate this night rhiannon caught the edge of the well enclosure held on so tightly that the stones left imprints in the palms of her hands she needed the physical contact a way of reassuring herself that there was still something in her world that was familiar safe shed sometimes wondered what it must be like to be drunk to have all her senses blurred by mead nowshe knew reality as shed known it had fled forever as soon as her father had begun speaking gradually some of the shock faded and her numbed brain started to function again she could not let this happen she must stop her father ere it was too late shed dropped the milk jug tripped over it now as she moved away from the well but managed to keep her footing shed gotten herself turned around though and when she started for the house she was actually going in the opposite direction it was not until she caught the smell of hay and horses that she realized her mistake spinning away from the stable she began to retrace her steps nearly weeping with frustration and fear that shed not be in time when she heard her name called behind her she grabbed selwyns arm as he came up beside her take me to the hall she demanded quickly selwyn was surprised for rhiannon could be as prickly as a hedgehog when her independence was concerned but he did as she bade and led her back across the bailey doing his best to avoid the worst patches of mud rhiannon would not have noticed had he steered her into a swamp and she forgot to thank him when they at last reached the hall papa she cried papa where are you whatever is the man up to rhiannon never have i seen rhodri look so full of himself like a lad whod discovered where his birthday present was hidden away the voice was enids amused and fondly indulgent he said nary a word did not even shed his mantle ere he dragged ranulf off to our bedchamber do you know what rhiannon heard no more turning away she plunged through the doorway back out into the blackness of the bailey it was all she could think to do for she could not go to her bedchamber eleri was there and would need one look at her face to know something was dreadfully wrong she could not deal with eleri or enid now she had to have some time alone time to decide what to do the afternoon drizzle had stopped and the air was dry but very cold she stepped unheedingly into the puddles getting her feet wet and her skirts muddied she was shivering and when she tasted salt on her tongue she realized she was crying too but for the moment all that mattered was reaching the stables the only sanctuary she had left stumbling into the stables she called out repeatedly until she was sure she was alone and then sank down upon a bale of hay she heard nickering and snorting as horses craned their necks over their stall doors hoping shed brought treats again and once the cats discovered her the kittens began to pounce on her ankles and climb up her skirts she felt leaden with fatigue not moving even when they dug their needlesharp little claws into her leg she could not let this marriage come to pass blessed lady mary hear your servant rhiannons plea it must not happen she would have to tell her father shed fought so hard to keep her secret mayhap enid suspected but no one else did shed made sure of that all for naught now and once she spoke upwhat then shed break her fathers heart by thwarting this marriage and what of eleri what if she truly wanted to marry ranulf ranulf hed have to be told too and nothing would ever be the same between them after that their friendshipall shed dared hope to have from himwould be spoiled poisoned by his pity and then hed go away again and this time he would not be back she shivered again as much from the anticipated humiliation as from the cold how could she bear to do this casting aside her pride would be worse than being stripped naked but how could she keep silent how could she live under the same roof with ranulf and eleri once they were wed bidding them goodnight at the door of their bedchamber hearing the new intimacy in their laughter lying awake at night unwillingly imagining their lovemaking awaiting eleris announcement that she was with child how could she ever endure it how could she not give herself away a hundred times a day what then was she to do papas house was her only refuge she had nowhere else to go no other kin even if shed wanted to pledge the rest of her life to god no convent would accept a blind nun she could feel the stirrings of an old enemy one shed thought shed long ago vanquished but panic could never truly be defeated the best she could hope for was to keep it caged under control now though she could hear it rattling the latch seeking a way out she forced herself to draw several deep bracing breaths willing the cage bars to hold why had she been so quick to conclude that her father would prevail ranulf might well refuse for an instant hope flickered but what man would not want to wed eleri she was pretty lively cleverwhole in the years since her sight faded many of rhiannons visual images had faded too but shed loved the sea and she could still summon up vivid memories of foaming waves churning shoreward breaking upon the beach and then retreating leaving a trail of white spume across the wet sand the jealousy that engulfed her now was like one of those powerful surging waves crashing down upon her without warning and receding just as quickly leaving her shaken by the impact and horrified by the realization that she could feel such intense resentment toward eleri whod done nothing to deserve it it was not fair to blame eleri for not being blind but neither was it fair that she should be punished for a love that shed have taken quietly to her grave how could the almighty ask so much more of her was it not enough that she must live out her days in darkness shocked that she could harbor such a blasphemous rage against god she hastily crossed herself and then began to weep muffling her sobs in her mantle so that no one passing by could hear well ranulf asked leaning back in his seat with a curious smile what would you say to me uncle it is much too important to discuss sober lad help yourself to some mead whilst i decide how best to begin ranulf obligingly took several swallows although hed not yet developed a taste for the welsh beverage this gets to me faster than wine he warned two flagons and im likely to start telling you secrets not even my confessor ought to hear rhodri laughed then reached across the table and gripped his nephews arm ive never been one for tact or diplomacy so im just going to blurt it out ere i do though there is something you need to know were you aware that under welsh law women cannot inherit land ranulf was startled no i was not that surprises me very much for it was my understanding that welsh law was uncommonly kind to women the restriction was not meant to punish our womenfolk it is a matter of practicality you see lad land is a sacred trust to us passed down from father to son a man cannot sell his sons birthright he but holds the land for his heirs and because we know mankind is by nature as predatory as the wolf no one can inherit who is not able to defend his lands from attack our laws exclude men crippled or deaf or blind or stricken with leprosy as well as women what happens if a man has no male heirs when he dies his lands escheat to the king ranulf sipped his mead slowly grappling with the implications of what hed just been told jesu but youre in the same plight as my father was after the white ship sank when you lost your last son cadell you lost your lands too then rhodri nodded or so i thoughtuntil god sent you back to us ranulf me im only half welsh half is enough our law allows the sons of welsh women to inherit even if the father is an alltud a foreigner butbut i am illegitimate surely youve not forgotten that a son need not be born in wedlock to claim his birthright not in wales it is enough if he is recognized by his fatheror in your case by your closest male kinme ranulf gaped at the older man dumbfounded are you saying that you want to name me as your heir i want to do more than that ranulf i want you as my heirand soninlaw i know ive taken you by surprise he added hastily but just wait lad hear me out eleri will be sixteen next month old enough to be wed shed make you a good wife ive no doubt of it she is pretty and spirited and i know youre right fond of her of course i am but we are first cousins wed have to seek a dispensation from the church ere we could wed and it is not likely wed get one rhodri grinned triumphantly youd not need one not in wales we wed our cousins all the time marry in the kin we say and fight the feud with the stranger ii do not know what to say uncle in truth i never thought of eleri as a wife i know ive caught you off balance lad suppose we back up give you a chance to catch your breath lets start with wales could you be happy living here ranulf was silent for some moments yes he said at last sounding surprised i believe i could rhodri nodded emphatically of course you could it was meant to be ranulf you think it was mere chance that brought you into wales indeed not i prayed to the almighty for aid and he heard my plea if only angharad could have known that her son would be restored to us and once you wed eleri ranulf gave an abrupt overwhelmed laugh whoa youre going too fast for me uncle youre offering me so muchyour lands and your daughter it does not seem like a fair bargain what do you get in return youd be giving me a gift beyond price peace of mind this land was my fathers and his fathers before him i do not want our family to lose it and if you stay in wales we will not and of equal importance to me i know youd do right by my daughters id not want to count all the nights ive lain awake fearing what might happen to rhiannon after i died she will be dependent upon the goodwill of eleris husband once i am gone so in choosing a husband for eleri i must choose for them both with you i could be sure that my rhiannon would always have a home that she would want for nothing rhiannon ranulf said thoughtfully yes i am beginning to see rhodri started to speak but then stopped hed said enough now it was up to his nephew he must not push ranulf had to want this for it to work but forbearance did not come easily to him hed always been one for acting even if it was ill advised and he was soon squirming impatiently i do not mean to rush you ranulf take as much time as you need he offered with an utter lack of conviction ranulf reached for his mead cup regarding his uncle with affectionate understanding youd not be able to wait for your own salvation uncle i was tempted to tell you id need a week to make up my mind but youd be sore crazed by midnight fortunately for your nerves i can give you my answer now i cannot marry eleri but i will marry rhiannonif shell have me ranulf got the reaction hed expected his uncles jaw dropped and his eyes opened wide but hed thought that surprise would give way to elation instead rhodri looked wary rhiannon holds my heart in the palm of her hand rhodri said choosing his words with conspicuous care after she lost her sight i swore by our own st davydd that shed lose nothing else not as long as i drew breath when she reached womanhood i tried mightily to find her a husband for i wanted her to have all that other women did she may not be as fair to look upon as eleri but she is still a handsome lass and kind and quickwitted in the bargain but she could have been as beautiful as this french queen i hear so much talk about and as saintly as the blessed virgin mary and it would still have availed her naught i could find no man willing to take a blind wife why then would you be willing ranulf i am not asking for a blind wife i am asking for rhiannon but it is a fair question uncle two years ago i would not have been willing either but i lived under the same roof with rhiannon for nigh on a year ive seen her light candles and mend tablecloths and do any number of chores that i would not have believed a blind person could do she taught me that blind was not another word for helpless and i came to admire her courage and value her integrity your daughter is a remarkable woman the men who were so quick to reject rhiannon just never got a chance to find that out that is an honest answer i can see the sense in what you say but tell me this ranulf why rhiannon and not eleri why choose the harder road if you were to start hunting a husband for eleri youd have no trouble finding a hundred men willingnay eagerto take her to wife eleri does not need me rhiannon does i can give her what no one else will what other women take for granteda home and children are you sure ladtruly sure this is what you want when ranulf nodded rhodri bounded out of his chair raced around the table and grabbed his nephew in a loving chokehold youve won me over he chortled now go win my rhiannon ranulf eventually found rhiannon in the stables seated on a bale of hay a sleeping kitten in her lap there you are lass why are you sitting out here in the dark hearing his own words he laughed ruefully hellfire im still doing it wellat least youve stopped flinching every time you use the word see in my hearing try as rhiannon might to keep her voice level it sounded suspiciously husky and strained to her ear most sighted people were not as sensitive to tones though and she hoped hed not notice shed known that sooner or later someone would come looking for her but shed not expected it to be ranulf and she stiffened as he moved toward her across the straw she was not ready for this nowhere near ready ranulf hung his lantern on an overhead hook and sat down beside her on the bale i had the most astounding talk tonight with your father it is as if my whole life was turned upside down in a matter of momentsjust like an hourglass he laughed again and rhiannon discovered that she couldnt swallow there was an excited edge to his laughter that shed never heard before he did not sound to her like a man whod just rejected a marriage proposal she could think of nothing to say that would not betray her and listened in growing despair as he said id not realized until tonight how much i wanted to stay in wales when i came back it was like coming home passing strange that i could not see that for myself that i needed to have it pointed out to me i know rhiannon said faintly aboutyour talk papa confided in me beforehand her words seemed to come of their own volition and she felt a sudden dizziness as if she were teetering on the edge of an abyss but she was less afraid of falling then of prolonging this torment thenyou accepted papas offer noi could not rhiannon sat very still as if one false move could send her plummeting off into space why because he offered me the wrong daughter rhiannon shed not dared to move now she dared not speak either had she misunderstood if only god would restore her sight if just for a moment long enough for her to see his face and judge for herself if shed heard him right rhiannonyou did hear what i said i am making a botch of this i know mayhap id best say it straight out i want to marry you her heart was pounding so loudly that she was sure he could hear at the touch of his fingers on her cheek her pulse jumped why she whispered why me and not eleri that is what your father asked too i could tell you that its because eleri is not yet sixteen and im thirtyone and i want to marry a wife not raise one or i could tell you that whilst i am very fond of eleri my feelings for you run much deeper and it would all be true rhiannon but what matters more than any of that is the way i felt when rhodri offered me eleri there was no need to choose i just knew you were the one i wanted hed taken her hand as he spoke and now he pressed a kiss into her palm do you need time to think about it rhiannon i realize this took you as much by surprise as it did me but noi do not need time my answer is yes i would be honoured to be your wife even then it did not seem real to her though not until he tilted her face up and kissed her gently first on her cheek and then on her mouth rhiannon awoke the next morning with an irrational fear that she might have dreamed it all eleri olwen getting no response she slid out of bed but for the first time in years shed forgotten to lay out her clothes for the next day retrieving her chemise she pulled it over her head and moved to their washing laver shivering as she splashed cold water onto her face shed begun to brush her hair by the time eleri returned i fetched you some buttermilk rhiannon im putting it on the table in the right corner thank you eleridid anything out of the ordinary happen yesterday nothing that comes to mind it was a day like any other as far as i recall one of the goats strayed off selwyns tooth was hurting him ranulf asked you to marry him and we had that wretched salted herring again for dinner turning she saw that rhiannon had sat down abruptly on the edge of the bed you are not going to tell me girl that you forgot of course not rhiannon bit her lip i was just so afraid she confessed that it had all been a dream when eleri sat down on the bed too rhiannon gave her a quick hug eleri knew that ranulf had chosen rhiannon over her for in his exhilaration rhodri had not thought to keep that to himself shed seemed genuinely joyful about the marriage but rhiannon could not bear for her sisters pride to have gotten even the slightest scratch and she needed to be sure that no shadows lurked in the corners of eleris certainty eleriare you truly content with this content that is such a tame bland word to describe what im feeling unlessyou did not really think i would ever have married ranulf do you by corpus you did she sounded suddenly and highly indignant how could you have believed that of me rhiannon i would never have betrayed you like that never youyou knew that you were utterly daft about the man of course i did eleri snatched up a pillow and smacked her sister with it that is for being such a prideful fool and this is for not confiding in me another whack with the pillow not that i needed to hear you admit it for you melted every time you said his name of course i knew did you forget which of us is the blind one she needled and rhiannon grabbed for the pillow they engaged briefly in a tugofwar but then eleri let go unexpectedly and rhiannon went over backwards onto the floor rushes eleri tried to catch her only to lose her own balance and go tumbling off the bed too it had been a long while since theyd had a pillow fight and sprawled now in the floor rushes her mouth full of feathers rhiannon remembered why shed given it up im too old for this sort of tomfoolery she complained goodnaturedly i landed right on my tailbone you brat and where are all these feathers coming from usually from ducks eleri drawled getting up on her knees to retrieve the torn pillow and loosing another flurry of escaping feathers rhiannon inhaled a few sputtered and then began to laugh so did eleri and they clung together laughing until their cheeks were streaked with tears and the air was so featherfilled that it seemed to be snowing and enid was standing in the doorway gazing down at them in consternation what in heavens name is going on here look at you rolling about on the floor like a couple of puppies andand the room is full of feathers i guess the duck died eleri quipped and that nonsensical answer set the sisters off again while enid looked on in disapproving bafflement rhiannon was still giggling when eleri called out cheerfully come on in ranulf youre missing all the fun rhiannon didnt really believe ranulf was in the doorway that was the sort of prank eleri loved to pull but then enid gave a dismayed cry ranulf do not look it is not fitting that you should see rhiannon in her chemise why ever not eleri held out her hand so her stepmother could help her up once theyre wed hell see her in her skin will he not she managed to get enid out by the simple expedient of refusing to let go of the older womans arm by then rhiannon had been able to scramble to her feet and was brushing ineffectually at the feathers clinging to her chemise it was not until she heard ranulf say her name that she was sure he was still in the room rhiannon was slightly embarrassed ranulf was the last person shed have wanted to catch her playing the fool but she had a far more pressing concern than her dignity and the only way she knew to dispel it was to confront it head on good morrow she said although she thought such formality sounded silly coming from a woman with feathers in her hair there is something i must ask you ranulf now that it is the morning after have you had any second thoughts it was an awkward question for ranulf and one that showed him just how well she knew him for upon awakening that morning his first thought had indeed been what have i done it was not so much that he regretted his marriage proposal as that in the cold light of day he fully comprehended the magnitude of what hed be undertaking his earlier joke about an upended hourglass no longer seemed funny for that was exactly what hed doneturned his life upside down marriage was one of gods sacraments a lifelong commitment and marriage to rhiannon would have its own unique pitfalls because her vulnerability was so much greater so much greater too would be his sense of obligation to her she deserved all that he had to give but what if it was not enough he still felt that what hed done was right but it could not have hurt if hed taken a little more time to think it through if god let him reach his biblical three score years and ten would he still be jumping off cliffs without ever looking to see where hed land his hesitation stirred up rhiannons anxiety into outright alarm you must tell me if it is so she entreated if you have misgivings better that we talk about them nowere it is too late no it is nothing like that lass stepping toward her he reached for her hand i am not sure how best to explain this until i walked through that door and saw you thrashing about in the floor rushes i admit i was feeling some unease fear that i would let you down or cause you hurt i was thinking of our marriage in sobering termsresponsibility and commitment and duty what i should have remembered though is that i am still getting to know youand you are constantly surprising me rhiannon tilted her head listening as much to his intonation as to his words he did not sound as if he were weighed down with regrets but mayhap she was hearing only what she wanted to hear i am not following you there seem to be so many rhiannons first there was the nurse striving to save my life then my cousin who soon became my companion and confidante even my confessor he said and for a moment they both remembered that summer afternoon by the rushing waters of rhaeadr ewynnol but nowwell now i am seeing you in an altogether different light he could not help smiling then for he saw she still did not understand but she did not realize how she lookedbarefoot in her chemise russet hair in beguiling dishevelment down her back wispy white feathers kissing her cheek her throat the curve of her bosom half waif he thought and half wanton a woman to cleave unto as scriptures said what i mean he said is that i am of a sudden seeing you as a bedmate rhiannon he could see a blush tinting the whiteness of her throat and cheeks but there was nothing shy in the smile she gave him well then she said happily wed best be married as soon as possible they were much to enids chagrin she argued in vain that such a hasty wedding would be sure to give rise to scandal but her protests fell upon deaf ears rhodri did not believe that anyone could think ill of his rhiannon eleri took the opposite tack pointing out with cynical but accurate insight that the marriage was bound to cause gossip in any event and rhiannon and ranulf cared only about getting married before the start of lent when marriages were prohibited they settled upon shrove tuesday beating the lenten deadline by one day placating the indignant enid by agreeing to have a lavish celebration after easter then upsetting her anew by not bothering to post the banns they were wed in a simple ceremony at llanrhychwyn a small stone chapel in the hills above trefriw it was nothing like the great cathedrals where ranulf had witnessed the weddings of his normanfrench kin but it was newly whitewashed with lime aglow with candles fragrant with scented floor rushes and in the secluded stillness they could hear the rustling of yew trees in the wind the clarion cry of a soaring hawk even the distant howling of a welsh wolf afterward they had a quiet wedding dinner back at rhodris manor attended only by the members of his household a meal of roast goose and baked trout and mead and harp music instead of the usual raucous beddingdown revelries rhiannons sister and stepmother then accompanied her up to the wedding chamber where they made her ready for ranulf while he enjoyed a final flagon with the man who was now both his uncle and fatherinlaw as a kings son ranulf had witnessed more than his share of weddings and he knew from experience how bawdy and boisterous the beddingdown revelries could get the humor both explicit and uninhibited a carnal and often crude celebration of life and lust and the anticipated pleasures of the marriage bed but ranulf felt sure that their beddingdown revelries would have been dreadfully different they would have been subdued and decorous and seemly enough to have satisfied the most pious of priests for the wedding guests would not have known how to deal with a blind bride theyd have been painfully polite offering rhiannon their pity instead of their lewd mockery and ranulf was very glad shed been spared that she already knew full well that others viewed her as an oddity tonight he hoped to show her that she was a desirable woman to the only man who mattered the one shed married that proved to be very easy to do for once they were lying together in their marriage bed she soon discovered incontrovertible proof of his passion and he discovered in his turn that her other senses were functioning perfectly she was eager to touch what she could not see eager to please him and afterward he felt confident that her deflowering had been as satisfying for her as it had been for him i did not hurt you too much did i he asked drowsily surprised to realize how much that mattered to him she shook her head tickling his chest with a long strand of her hair and then trailing it still lower across his belly ranulfdo we have to wait till morning ere we can do it again shameless wanton he murmured and there was such tenderness in his voice that she found herself blinking back tears ranulfi want you to know that i understand divided loyalties you chose me and wales but that does not mean you repudiated your past life england will always exert a powerful pull upon you and whenever you feel the need you must follow it you may return to england as often as you wish and ill not objectjust as long as you keep coming back i do have other loyalties he admitted but from now on my first loyalty will be to you that i promise you rhiannon she wondered if that was an oblique reference to the woman hed loved so deeply and disastrously but she dared not ask dared not summon up annoras restless spirit to haunt their marriage bed instead she settled back in his arms shifting so she could hear his heart beating against her cheek until she fell asleep rouen normandy august maude could have lodged in rouens great castle as geoffrey did whenever he was in the city or she could have moved into the royal residence adjacent to the priory of notredamedupre instead she chose to live among the monks dwelling in the guest quarters of the priory an austere and surprisingly stark milieu for a woman whod once reigned over an imperial court on the first sunday in august ranulf and his niece the countess of chester arrived at the priory they were both a long way from home but they were bringing maude wounding news not the sort of grief to be delivered in a letter maud had gone to the church ostensibly to light a candle and offer up prayers actually to give her aunt the only solace she couldsome private time to grieve blinking in the glare of shimmering white sunlight maud paused in the doorway waiting for minna to catch up with her the german widow was showing her age moving stiffly and slowly even on warm summer afternoons out in the garth ranulf was carrying on an animated conversation with a new arrival the man was a stranger to maud and yet there was something vaguely familiar about him enough to kindle her curiosity he looked to be in his early twenties with very vivid coloringcurly coppergold hair fair ruddy skin dusted with freckles silvergrey eyes like ranulf he was a little above average height but he seemed taller for he was powerfully built with a deep chest and broad shoulders that she was eyeing appreciatively when minnas startled mein gott echoed behind her it is lord harry harry maud was astonished my cousin harry not having seen henry on either of his last two trips to england her memories were of a precocious tenyearold but what surprised her more than his maturity was how unlike his parents he was he might have been a foundling she marveled so little did he resemble her aunt or geoffrey he did have geoffreys coloring but the freckles were all his own and so was the brawn he had none of his fathers flash none of his mothers aloof elegance and when she went to greet him she discovered that his personality waslike his appearancevery much his own too for maudes son he showed a remarkable indifference to protocol and ceremony and his humor held none of geoffreys darker undertones he charmed maud at once for he was playful and irreverent and quite sure of himself the rapport was mutual like recognizing like and with a fine feel for teamwork they soon pounced on ranulf for his impulsive and hasty and unforeseen marriage was too tempting a target to resist and so there i was henry grumbled haunting all the ports in normandy waiting for reliable uncle ranulf to arrive as hed promised i spent so much time hanging around barfleur that two of the fishing boats offered to take me on as a crew member and just where was ranulf whilst i was turning down a chance to catch cod off in the welsh wilderness taking advantage of a trusting damsel in distress one who was unable to see what she was getting maud chimed in although i know many wives who would count that as a blessing minna went hot with embarrassment that ranulf should have chosen a handicapped wife was a mystery she could not begin to fathom the only thing more incomprehensible to her was that others would joke about it she frowned at henry and maud baffled and indignant that they could salt ranulfs wounds like this there is a lot to be said for having a blind wife ranulf protested she is sure to overlook my flaws is she not nor will she care when i get grey and wrinkled but even if she had keener sight than an eagle rhiannon would still turn a blind eye to my failings i only hope you can find a wife as merciful harry for from what ive heard youll need all the forgiveness you can get jesu it is worse than we feared maud henry was grinning damn me if else but the man has gone and fallen in love with his own wife that got a laugh from all but the thoroughly mystified minna ranulf had the last word though keep it up he warned and ill name the pair of you as godparents which would necessitate a long and arduous winter journey into wales for the christening maud was slow on the uptake for once and yielded with a feigned gasp of horror henry was quicker are we talking about a theoretical child he queried one likely to come in gods own time or a fleshandblood babe with a definite due date november ranulf said nonchalantly and then gave himself away with a radiant smile rhiannon is vowing to deliver on my birthday and at that point he found himself fending off his niece who was scolding him for not telling her while smearing his face with haphazard kisses henry offered his congratulations too plus a tongueincheek suggestion that the baby be named after him ranulf agreed gravely that he would provided it was a girl and minna gave up any pretense of understanding male humor why are you here lord harry she asked as soon as she could get a word in we thought you and lord geoffrey were guarding the border against the french we have a truce in effect for the french king has taken to his sickbed what of you ranulf what brought you and cousin maud to rouen bad news i fear a friend of your mothers has died it has been a sad season for mama henry said regretfully in april adeliza died at a nunnery in flanders i suppose you heard what of this latest death is it anyone i know yes it is the lord of wallingford castle brien fitz count henry was quiet for a moment thinking of his christmas reunion with his mother at wallingford she took shelter with brien he said after her escape from oxford he was a man worth mourning briens shadow seemed to follow them back across the garth to maudes chambers at sight of her son maudes face lit up henry could not remember ever having seen his mother cry but he noticed now that her eyes were suspiciously redrimmed the lids swollen and tender i know about brien fitz counts death i am sorry mama he was a good friend to us a good man maude swallowed yes she said softly he was it does not seem fair uncle robert and brien sacrificed so much for us of all men they ought to have lived to see us triumph maude nodded somberly although she was gazing into his face henry had the odd feeling that she was not really seeing him the greatest regrets she said are always for what might have been although the french king had grudgingly recognized geoffrey as duke of normandy relations between the two men had always been strained and deteriorated rapidly when they clashed over the fate of giraud berlai berlai was the seneschal of poitou a man who stood high in the french kings favor but if he was a loyal vassal to louis to geoffrey he was merely a rebel one of the ringleaders of an abortive rising of angevin barons geoffrey had quelled the rebellion without difficulty but berlai had retreated to his castle at montreuilbellay and begun to harass the countryside after hed harried monks from st aubins geoffrey lost all patience and vowed to bring the man down no matter how long it took when he lay siege to montreuil berlai was defiant contemptuously confident that the castle could withstand any assault hed underestimated geoffreys resolve though the siege had lasted three full years but the fortress was now in ruins and berlai in an angers prison the french king was enraged by geoffreys harsh treatment of his vassal and dismayed by geoffreys unforeseen decision to turn normandy over to henry it was in frances interests to make sure that normandy and england were not united again and louis was not willing therefore to see normandy ruled by a man with such a strong claim to the english crown hed refused to recognize henrys title revitalized his alliance with stephen and invited eustace to join his campaign the past year had been one of sporadic and inconclusive warfare henry had been besieging a rebellious lord at torigny when hed learned that the french king and eustace were advancing upon arques he swiftly gathered a mixed force of normans angevins and bretons and confronted the french but louis chose to withdraw and battle was averted geoffrey then seized a castle at la nue belonging to louiss brother and the french retaliated by burning the town of seez there were a few months of relative peace after that but then in midsummer the french began massing troops along the river seine between meulan and mantes and geoffrey and henry hastened to protect their borders from this new threat war seemed to be inevitableuntil the french king was stricken with a fever necessitating his return to paris it was possible that he would now heed the advice of frances premier churchman the venerable abbot bernard of clairvaux whod long been urging peace but it was just as likely that hed resume hostilities once he recovered henry and geoffrey could only wait and see henry dominated the conversation at supper that night thanking his mother for her continuing efforts to make the french king see reason giving ranulf and maud an insiders account of the political and military maneuvering that had occupied so much of his time this past year telling them of the skirmishes and raids and geoffreys prolonged siege of montreuilbellay berlai bragged that the castle could never be taken with a keep high enough to scrape the sky and double walls encircled by a deep natural chasm called the judas valley it kept my father from getting close enough to use his siege engines so do you know what he did he moved the yearly fair from saumur to montreuil and paid the fairgoers to assist his soldiers in filling up the ditch henry laughed and pushed his chair back ranulf glanced toward maude for it could not be easy for her to hear henry speak so glowingly of geoffrey but she showed no overt displeasure he supposed shed had to accept it that her son and his father would always be close hed noticed though that she no longer spoke of geoffrey with such searing bitterness mayhap what hed heard was true that theyd finally made their peace a pity they could not have done so twenty years ago why was it he wondered that whatever came to his sister always came too late was that how geoffrey took the castle henry shook his head no cousin maud even though his mangonels were then able to do considerable damage berlai still held out whenever breaches were made in the walls they repaired the damage with oaken beams and berlai boasted from the battlements that hed never surrender but hed reckoned without vegetius a roman sage whod written a classic treatise on siege warfare papa got an idea from his writings and he filled an iron vessel with greek fire then used a mangonel to hurl it at the castle walls it ignited on impact and the wooden beams caught fire greek fire is very hard to put out and they could not keep the flames from spreading greek fire ranulf echoed thoughtfully crusaders brought back tales from the holy land of greek fire but id not heard of its being used in the west ere this papa was the first henry said proudly when his father went off to wed the queen of jerusalem he learned the ingredients and shared the secret in a letter to papa im not sure what he mixednaphtha and lime and tar and sulphurbut whatever it worked in no time at all berlai and his men cameas papa put itslithering out like snakes is it true that the french king got abbot bernard to excommunicate geoffrey for refusing to set berlai free henry looked over at his uncle and nodded it seems the church has a third category of sin in addition to mortal and venal there is also political his mouth quirked at the corners in just the suggestion of a smile fortunately he said papa appears to be bearing up rather well i expect he would maude said dryly for the counts of anjou had always taken excommunication in stride one of geoffreys more infamous forebears had sinned on such a grand scale that hed made no less than three pilgrimages of atonement to the holy land how long do you think this truce will last henry as always he smiled at her use of henry shed made a goodfaith attempt to switch over to harry in order to please him but she was so obviously uncomfortable with the informality that hed soon taken pity and urged her to revert back to his given name now she alone called him henry and shed come to relish the exclusivity of it he was still as restless as hed been as a boy never able to sit still for long and hed begun pacing as he considered her question she felt a great surge of pride as she watched him and an empty hurtful ache a bittersweet regret that this son she so loved could not have been briens it is hard to say mama it all depends upon who has the french kings ear if it is abbot bernard and the bishop of lisieux they may well persuade him to talk peace if he is fool enough to keep listening to eustace well all be the losers for it ranulf was intrigued by his nephews candor for it was his experience that young men invariably proclaimed their eagerness to go to war and with many that eagerness was even genuine but harry had an uncommonly pragmatic view of warfare for one in only his nineteenth year hed proved himself willing to do what must be done to win but it was clear he took no pleasure in it to test his theory ranulf said so you hope your differences with louis can be settled by negotiation of course id choose bargaining over bleeding any day as would all men of sense so it goes without saying then that eustace is lusting after a bloodletting the more i learn about this rival of mine uncle ranulf the more i realize that eustace is the most convincing argument possible against hereditary kingship ranulf and maud laughed but henrys mother did not for that sounded like blasphemy to her even in jest how could anyone argue against hereditary kingship she protested and henry grinned i can assure you mama that id be the last one to make such an argument he said and was leaning over to give her a hug when one of maudes servants entered with an urgent message once such a message would have been for maude now it was for henry for the lord duke it is from papa henry said gazing down at the familiar seal moving toward the nearest lamp he read rapidly that contest over the french kings ear well it seems that eustace lost louis has agreed to enter into negotiations and papa wants me to return straightaway for we are expected in paris in a weeks time thank heaven maude said fervently now we can concentrate upon the real enemystephen and his wretched son easy mama henry cautioned weve not made peace yet these talks might well come to naught but we have nothing to lose and possibly much to gain soit looks like im off to paris he glanced at the letter again and then over at ranulf at the very least he laughed ill finally get to meet eleanor of aquitaine they had just passed the abbey of saintdenis so henry knew paris was only seven miles away and he spurred his stallion to catch up with geoffrey tell me he said about the french king what sort of man is he one of meagre importance if not for a hungry sow seeing his sons bafflement geoffrey grinned you never heard that story then louis was the second son pledged to the church but when he was ten he was snatched from the cloisters and thrust back into the world courtesy of that aforesaid pig it was foraging for food along the river seine just as louiss elder brother philippe happened to ride by when the sow spooked his horse philippe was thrown and killed so little louis was suddenly the heir apparent and it is a great pity for he would have made a far better monk than he has a king tell me more papa henry urged what are his virtues and his vices his greatest vice is that he has none geoffrey laughed at his own joke and then gave his son a serious answer he is very devout has good manners and a good heart nor does he lack for courage but he is cursed with the worst sort of stubbornness the stiffnecked inflexible obstinacy of the weak and because he is so troubled by selfdoubts he tends to be too easily influencedinvariably by the wrong people he is melancholy by nature and suffers periodic pangs of guilt over his disastrous attack upon vitrythat the town where more than a thousand villagers took refuge in the church and died when it caught fire and he is burdened with a paralyzing sense of sin a truly pitiful affliction for a man wed to one of the most desirable women in christendom he shuns her bed henry was incredulous jesu the man must be mad youll get no argument from me harry but monks are not supposed to indulge in carnal lust and louis remains a monk at heart a monk married to eve they sound even more mismatched by corpus than your mother and me they do indeed henry agreed cheerfully he had no illusions whatsoever about his parents marriage tell me more about eve is she that in truth wellshe is indeed willful much more than any woman has a right to be she is worldly for certes and high spirited and too clever by half is she a wanton too mayhap yes mayhap no i never had the opportunity to find out for myself but then i never thought wantonness to be a female character flaw at least not in another mans wife off to their right a village came into view which geoffrey identified as clignancourt in the distance the wooded hill of montmartre rose up against the hazy august sky geoffrey said there were the ruins of an ancient roman temple on the summit which offered an impressive view of paris henry was sorry they did not have time to stop and see hed never paid much mind to gossip himself but his father was a reliable source for humor and scandal ive heard such unlikely tales about their crusade papa just what did happen in antioch louis made an ass of himself refused to go to the rescue of edessa and doomed the crusade the prince of antioch and his marriageall in one fell swoop that made no sense to henry i thought it was the fall of edessa that stirred men to take the cross so why did louis balk that is what prince raymond wanted to know too ever since edessas capture by the turks hed feared that antioch would be next and he was relying upon the french kings crusaders to stave off disaster when louis insisted that he could do nothing until hed fulfilled his vow to reach jerusalem raymond took it badly eleanor agreed with raymond but she had no luck in changing louiss mind and by all accounts the quarreling got very hot indeed raymond was her kinsman was he not her uncle like many a younger son hed gone off to seek his fortune in the holy land and by luck and guile and a fair measure of charm hed won himself a great heiress and the principality of antioch but when eleanor sided openly with raymond louiss advisors claimed that proved she was not to be trusted id say it proved she had more common sense than louis if antioch fell jerusalems fall would be a foregone conclusion was this when eleanor declared her intent to end the marriage geoffrey nodded and she was shrewd enough to pick the one argument likely to shake louis to the depths of his pious soulthat their marriage was a sin raymond had revealed to her she contended that she and louis were fourth cousins and thus forbidden to wed without a papal dispensation she then reminded louis that after eleven years of this sinful marriage he still lacked a male heir what greater proof could there be of gods displeasure louis was distraught for in his innocent odd way he truly loved his wife he could not bear to lose herand aquitainebut neither could he abide the fear that hed offended the almighty as i said eleanor knew her man her thrust had gone right to the heart what provoked him then into dragging her away from antioch by force he sought counsel and comfort from his chaplain and a templar named thierry galeran a eunuch whod long chafed under eleanors barbs he seized his chance to repay her in kind and he and odo the chaplain convinced louis that eleanors real reason for seeking a divorce was arrantly sinfulbecause shed taken raymond as her lover henry was not easily startled but now he almost dropped the reins so hastily did he swing around in the saddle to stare at his father they accused her of bedding her own uncle jesus wept was it true i seriously doubt it geoffrey conceded with a trace of regret sins are no more equal than men and incest is a grievous transgression indeed far more damning than mere adultery it is clear from his subsequent conduct that louis did not really believe it either else hed never have been able to reconcile with her and share her bed again be that as it may he was hurt and jealous and angry and he heeded his counselors compelled eleanor to accompany him to jerusalem what happened after that lad you doubtless know louis made a halfhearted assault upon damascus retreated after four days and the glorious second crusade was over id say your decision not to take the cross was a wise one papa and their troubles did not end in the holy land did they i heard they had a harrowing journey home that they did eleanors ship was captured by the greeks rescued in the nick of time by the king of sicilys fleet then blown far off course toward the barbary coast finally coming ashore at palermo where eleanor was gravely ill for weeks and where she got word of her uncle raymonds death slain in a courageous foolhardy clash with the turks his head cut off and sent as a gift to the caliph of baghdad and she blamed louis for that i daresay wouldnt you but by then theyd reached tusculum where the pope did his best to mend the rifts in their marriage assuring them they had gods blessing upon their union and tucking them into bed together to make sure poor dim louis got the point when she became pregnant louis could not contain his joy never doubting that the almighty would at last reward him with a son it must have been a nasty shock when eleanor gave birth to a second daughter but id wager henry added wryly that louis blamed eleanor and not god his counselors did for certes the talk in paris is that a divorce is inevitable louis is still resistingso far but the marriage is being crushed under a double burden his conscience and his need for a son id not offer odds on its survival ahead lay the wooden stockade that protected the right bank of the river seine to henrys right he could see a small chapel surrounded by weathered tombstones this open marshy field was the cemetery of the holy innocents burial ground for paris he instinctively made the sign of the cross but his thoughts were still focused upon the hapless french king and his beautiful wayward queen so louis is well meaning and out of his depthshades of stephenwhilst eleanor is willful and mayhap wanton what else need i know that she is dangerous geoffrey said and laughed consider yourself warned lad henry laughed too you need not worry i plan to be on my best behavior in paris i shall have to be since youre intent upon stirring up trouble enough for the both of us the heart of paris was a walled island in the middle of the river seine the ile de la cite its eastern half was given over to god to the archbishops church and lodgings the western half held the royal palace in between lay a maze of narrow crooked streets by turns mudclogged or dustchoked for the ancient roman paving stones had survived only in patches these streets were deep in shadow even at midday for the houses had overhanging upper stories that effectively blotted out the sun and they were noisy from dawn till dusk echoing with the strident cries of peddlers the pleas of beggars the boisterous tomfoolery of students the arguments of tradesmen the barking of dogs and always always the chiming of church bells pealing out over the city in deafening waves of shimmering sound this was henrys first glimpse of paris and it would be a memory that time would not fade for the rest of his life he was to remember the august heat and the clamor and the foul smell of the river the clouds of white doves circling above the steep tiled roofs as he and his father rode across the bridge known as the grand pont toward the palace where the french king and his queen awaited them the grand pont was the finest stone bridge henry had ever seen almost twenty feet wide lined on each side with cramped wooden stalls and booths most occupied by money changers and goldsmiths it was crowded with pilgrims and merchants and students exchanging their coins for the french silver deniers they moved aside for the angevins and their entourage and henry heard his name and geoffreys bandied behind them it seemed all of paris knew they were meeting with louis he just hoped that some good would come of it they were on the island now passing through the gateway into the cite palace a flight of broad stone stairs led up to the great hall as they reined in geoffrey said that hed heard of knights riding their horses up the steps and into the hall and for a moment their eyes met in a glance of mutual mischief but the temptation was fleeting dismounting they made a decorous entrance into the hall not without a shared twinge of regret once stilted greetings had been offered and introductions made on henrys behalf he stepped aside deferring to his father for this was geoffreys moment and he was content to have it so he welcomed this opportunity to study their adversaries most of whom he was meeting for the first time louis capet the most christian king of france was in his thirtyfirst year but he looked younger tall and slender with mild blue eyes and bright blond hair henry had heard he often wore a hair shirt and he could not help speculating whether louis was wearing one now under his royal robes he could think of far better uses for the flesh than mortifying it louiss disgruntled brother robert count of dreux stood close at hand glowering at geoffrey rumor had it that hed returned from the crusade so disgusted with his elder brothers military leadership that hed had it in mind to relieve louis of the burden of kingship but even if the rumors were true nothing had come of his seditious ambitions mayhap incompetence was in their blood henry thought uncharitably and turned his attention to a more interesting member of the royal family raoul de peronne count of vermandois seneschal of france louiss cousin and brotherinlaw for the church had finally agreed to recognize his adulterous marriage to eleanors sister raoul was much older than henry had expected well past fifty his silvered hair was still abundant he covered the loss of an eye with a jaunty leather patch and he had an easy selfconfidence that many a younger man might have envied but henry could not get past the fact that raoul must be nigh on thirty years older than petronilla hed long thought their reckless affair was foolhardy now that hed met raoul it seemed even more incomprehensible to him a young heiress with a sister on the french throne rich lands in burgundy and her own considerable charms did not need to settle for scandal and a married aging loverand yet she had geoffrey liked to say that if marrying for lust was foolish marrying for love was madness for his age henry had a fair amount of experience with lust none yet with love but he saw no reason to doubt his fathers jaded assessment of matrimony he wondered if the impetuous passionate petronilla was in the hall for he was looking forward to meeting her and he wondered too if she and raoul still thought it had all been worth it standing at the rear of the dais trying to be as inconspicuous as possible was a man henry had met at his fathers court the count of meulan waleran beaumont walerans luck had yet to change for the better after being forced to choose between stephen and maude he was now caught again between two feuding overlords geoffrey and louis his presence here at paris showed that hed cast his lothowever reluctantlywith the french king hed come to regret it though henry meant to see to that the stocky balding man in the white surcoat and bloodred cross of the knights templars must be thierry galeran the embittered eunuch whose enmity had done eleanor such damage henry felt an involuntary flicker of pity for his youthful imaginings could envision no greater loss than the one the templar had suffered thierry galeran was flanked by the bishop of lisieux and odo de deuil formerly louiss chaplain now the new abbot of saintdenis but all of the men upon the dais even the king were overshadowed by an aged gaunt figure clad in the unbleached white habit of the cistercians the most celebrated monk of their age bernard of clairvaux bernard was sixtyone but if henry had not known that hed have added another decade to his age his hair was snowwhite although his beard still held glints of auburn tall and stoopshouldered he was so thin that he seemed skeletal for hed ruined his health with the harsh privations hed imposed upon himself in his continuing struggle to humble the body and elevate the soul but illness had not weakened his intellect or diminished the power of his personality his smoldering deepset eyes burned with combative zeal with the mesmerizing force of one who knew with absolute certainty that he did gods work it was bernard and not louis who seized the initiative demanding to know if geoffrey had brought giraud berlai to paris as agreed upon henry thought it ironic that the saintly abbot would be so concerned over the fate of a lawless baron like berlai for the man was no better than a brigand he understood why of course it was all about power even princes of the church were protective of their prerogatives especially princes of the church he amended and then braced himself for what was to come indeed i did geoffrey said blandly with a smile that should have warned them but didnt turning he ordered one of his men to fetch giraud berlai into the hall and then he winked at henry who camouflaged a smile he did not fully understand why his father took such pleasure in baiting his enemies he preferred a straightasanarrow path to the target himself and thought feuding was a waste of time but he tended to be tolerant of other mens amusements and he made ready to watch geoffreys sport a collective gasp swept the chamber at sight of berlai for the man was weighed down with heavy shackles filthy and obviously frightened he had been gagged and when he was thrust to his knees before the dais his eyes pleaded mutely for mercy berlais bravado was utterly gone stripped away like his fine clothes for it had taken only a few months in one of geoffreys dungeons to break his spirit henry could see from the shocked faces that theyd not expected this and yet they should have his father made an unforgiving enemy as his uncle helie had learned five years in a tours prison his health so impaired by the captivity that hed died soon after his release henry felt scant sympathy for helie though hed asked for what hed gotten he had even less pity for berlai whod terrorized the angevin borderlands with impunity sure that the french kings favor and his own formidable stronghold would keep him safe from retribution as a provocation geoffreys action could hardly have been improved upon louis was infuriated to see his seneschal treated like a common felon a man of low birth bernard was even more outraged for hed excommunicated geoffrey for holding berlai prisoner and he saw geoffreys deliberate defiance as an affront to the almighty there was a moment of utter silence and then pandemonium voices rose furiously accusing threatening demanding and in the midst of the maelstrom being indignantly assailed from all sides geoffrey glanced over at his son and grinned henry felt more like a witness than a participant watching the turmoil with benign detachment for this was his fathers hunt louis had begun to shout his fair skin blotching with hot color the whitemaned bernard was stabbing the air with a gnarled forefinger looking for all the world like one of the old testament prophets poised to hurl celestial thunderbolts but if geoffrey was impressed he gave no indication of it henry took a step toward the dais and it was then that he saw her shed come in unobtrusively through a side door but she was wearing a spectacular shade of emerald silk and the color caught his eye he half turned and then stopped transfixed she was a beautiful woman slender and graceful with chiseled cheekbones and fair flawless skin a sensual mouth eyes as green as her gown but hed seen beautiful women before hed never seen one so vibrant though or so vividly compelling she was watching the uproar as if it were a play put on for her benefit those glowing green eyes sparkling with sunlight and curiosity and silent laughter and when she glanced in henrys direction she held his gaze a look that was both challenging and enigmatic henry drew a deep dazzled breath he was utterly certain that this was eleanor of aquitaine and no less sure that the french king must be one of gods greatest fools paris france august the french king was glaring at geoffrey giraud berlai is my seneschal how dare you drag him before me in chains geoffreys response was one of injured innocence i think ive showed admirable restraint he protested i did not hang him did i geoffreys audience was not amused abbot bernard least of all your mockery is offensive to the almighty no my lord abbot it is offensive to you despite your insistence to the contrary you are not the sole interpreter of the almightys will it had been many years since anyone had dared to challenge bernards moral authority most of his countrymen had long since elevated him to living sainthood he seemed stunned by geoffreys audacity and henry spoke up quickly before he could recover and retaliate my lord father has a legitimate grievance against berlai were here to talk about it that is why you invited us to paris is it not my lord abbotto talk the abbots struggle to achieve true humility was an ongoing one he battled his pride daily and all too often lost he did not appreciate being reminded that his obligation was to act as peacemaker and it was particularly galling that the reminder should have come from henry for he was convinced that these angevins sprang from a depraved stock doomed and damned he did not lack for discipline though stifling his resentment he said coldly you are right my lord duke the purpose of this conference is to discuss our differences openly and freely then seek a way to resolve them without further bloodshed giving henry a nod of austere approval he turned the power of his accusing eyes back upon henrys father when you refused to release giraud berlai from your prison i was then compelled to lay upon you the dread anathema of excommunication i did this with the greatest reluctance for i would not see any man denied gods grace if you release berlai now i will at once absolve you of this sin of disobedience and restore you to the church i have no intention of releasing berlai my lord abbot the man is a rebel and brigand and i see it as no sin to punish him as he deserves but if it is a sin then i have no wish to be absolved of it since you claim to have gods ear day and night you may tell him that for me that i seek no absolution for an act of simple justice when geoffrey began to speak bernard stiffened righteously indignant that his olive branch should not only have been spurned but snapped in half by the time geoffrey was done though he was speechless with horror so were the french king and most of the onlookers for geoffreys defiance sounded to them like the worst sort of blasphemy even henry winced wishing that his father could have been more judicious less reckless in his refusal he understood geoffreys hostility toward berlai and felt that after a threeyear siege it was not unjustified he understood too geoffreys resentment at the posturing of the french king and abbot bernard but posturing still seemed a poor reason for going to war hed fight the french king if he had to but hed rather be fighting stephen and he could only hope that his father would remember thatere it was too late if geoffrey had an innate sense of the dramatic so too did bernard drawing himself up to his full and formidable height he thrust out his arm as if he meant to impale geoffrey upon it be not deceived for god is not mocked and whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap you have prayed for damnation and the lord god has heard you repent now you impious wicked man whilst you still can heed me well for i see your death if you do not and within a months time bernards prophetic trances were known throughout france and this one sent a frisson of uneasy excitement shuddering across the hall the french king paled noticeably some of geoffreys own men began to edge away from him while others moved in for a better view just in case the lord chose to take his vengeance here and now henry could not help admiring the abbots theatrical flair but he was suspicious of the prophecy itself for the timing was too convenient to be credible geoffrey looked even more skeptical one of his eyebrows had shot upward in a familiar gesture of disbelief a month you say could you be more specific my lord abbot if you can give me the exact date that would make it easier for me to plan berlais public hanging in the time i have left the abbot stared at the younger man and then slowly and deliberately made the sign of the cross it is true what men say that the counts of anjou come from the devils seed you blaspheme as easily as you breathe mock all that is holy you have no shame and i am doomed too lets not forget that how good of you to speak up for the lord like this whatever would he do without you the abbot sucked in an outraged breath but geoffrey gave him no chance to respond well then if i have so little time left i see no reason to waste any more of it here and without a warning without another word geoffrey turned on his heel and stalked from the hall geoffreys abrupt exit created almost as much of a sensation as abbot bernards portentous prophecy henry was taken aback too for this hadnt been in the script geoffreys nonplussed men were scrambling to follow dragging out the wretched berlai while henrys own attendants looked to him for their cue feeling left in the lurch he wasnt sure if he should stalk out too stay and attempt to salvage the talks or make a measured dignified withdrawal but as he observed the chaos that geoffrey had set loose in the hall he made an interesting discovery the french king and his counselors were enraged and appalled but they were also dismayed sothey did want peace that was useful to know assuming of course that his father was not already leaving paris behind in the dust of this hellishly hot summer day how much of his dramatic departure had been fueled by genuine angerand how much for effect but he had managed to get the last word in his clash with the sainted bernard and henry thought even the almighty would not have found that an easy feat he was not surprised to find himself the focus of all eyes the entire hall was waiting to see what he would do by now hed made up his mind and he moved without haste toward the dais where he bade farewell to the french king and the venerable abbot of clairvaux he was courteous and composed and gave away nothing not until his gaze fell again upon the woman in green silk for just a moment he hesitated and then thought hellfire and furies why not beckoning to his men he turned and crossed the hall toward her up close she was even more stunning those magnificent cheekbones highlighted with subtle sunkissed warmth emerald eyes enhanced by the longest lashes hed ever seen madame he said gravely and kissed her hand with a courtly flourish but then he added for her ears alone if you are not the queen of france by god you ought to be her mouth put henry in mind of ripe peaches it curved at the corners not quite a smile but enough to free a flashing dimple my lord duke her voice was as arresting as her appearance lowpitched and sultry and if you are not yet the king of england she murmured by god you will be there was a glint of gentle mockery in those shimmering seagreen eyes but there was something else too something elusive and intriguing this exchange of theirs could not have been more public under the full scrutiny of the french court and yet it was also a moment of odd intimacy it was almost as if henry decided they were sharing a joke no one else got it had been arranged for the angevins to stay at the benedictine abbey of saintgermaindespres on the left bank of the seine and it was there that henry found his father nor did he need to coax geoffrey into resuming the peace talks that was always geoffreys intent he confessed readily that his walkout had been a calculated ploy meant to checkmate abbot bernard and unsettle the french henry was not surprised for only maude had been able to send geoffreys temper up in flames with the rest of his foes he was always coldly in control as abbot bernard and louis would soon discover the talks began anew on the morrow in an atmosphere of strained and pessimistic civility in the days that followed henry was formally introduced to queen eleanor met her notorious younger sister petronilla and had several opportunities to take the measure of the french king and his barons but that seemed all hed be taking away from his paris visit for the negotiations were soon deadlocked geoffrey was not willing to free berlai while henry was loath to make further territorial concessions to the french crown geoffrey had already ceded half of the county of the vexin in order to induce louis to recognize him as duke of normandy and the french king was now demanding the remainder of the vexin as his price for extending recognition to henry a price he found too high with neither side willing to yield this peace conference seemed likely to be but a prelude to war in midweek the french king gave a lavish feast and entertainment for his obstinate vassals but if hed harbored any hopes of wining and dining the angevins into a more obliging frame of mind he was to be disappointed geoffrey and henry were agreeable guests they exchanged pleasantries with the french king flirted with eleanor tactfully avoided any mention of eustace and even treated abbot bernard with polite deference but that was just good manners the negotiations remained bogged down in a quagmire of mutual suspicions and shared intransigence the following morning saw an early visitor to the queens chambers for the countess of vermandois was becoming uneasy on her sisters behalf and had decided a candid talk was in order petronilla had no illusions about the troubled state of eleanors marriage she envisioned it as a sunscorched arid field parched and barren and dangerously dryand if there was ever a man with a knack for striking sparks it was count geoffrey of anjou the more time that eleanor spent with geoffrey and his son the more smoke petronilla smelled petronillas disapproval was practical not moral for her conscience was an elastic one able to stretch enough to accommodate a multitude of sins nor could she fault eleanors taste for geoffrey was undeniably one of the handsomest men shed ever laid eyes upon but her sisters timing was deplorable geoffrey might be gorgeous but petronilla did not think he could be trusted to bed louiss queen without boasting about it afterward and infidelity was a lethal weapon to give an aggrieved husband on the brink of divorce she didnt worry about finding louis in eleanors bed despite the earliness of the hour since the tragedy at vitry louiss marital ardor had been effectively quenched by his numbing sense of guilt and that flame had never burned very hot even in the first years of the marriage louiss love for his wife had always been struggling against the lessons hed learned too well during his boyhood at the abbey of saintdenis that carnal lust was sinful women were the devils lures and celibacy the chosen path to salvation thinking now of the barrenness of her sisters marriage bed stirred an old memory one of eleanors ladiesinwaiting had eavesdropped upon a confidential conversation between the two sisters and overheard the queen say i thought id married a king and found id married a monk the young woman could not resist sharing so sensational a bit of gossip and had been dismissed in disgrace once eleanor discovered her betrayal it was a muchquoted remark but only petronilla knew it was a counterfeit coin the girl had gotten the words right the intonation wrong people repeated it as mockery it had been said though in frustration and sadness eleanor looked up in comical disbelief as petronilla was ushered in for the younger woman had been known to sleep till noon id wager youve not been to bed at all but she agreed to dismiss her attendants when petronilla asked watching her sister with quizzical curiosity as she continued to brush her hair sowhat has gotten you up at such an ungodly hour did you have another quarrel with raoul eleanor surely youve noticed by now that raoul and i like to quarrel that is how we liven up our lovemaking petronilla settled herself on the edge of the bed and began to pet her sisters brindle greyhound i am here to talk about geoffrey of anjou let me say at the outset that i do not blame you for being tempted that man could start a lustcrazed riot in a convent full of nuns mayhap benedictines but surely not cistercians your tribute to geoffreys manhood definitely conjures up some intriguing images and i daresay hed be the first to agree with you but all those lustful nuns notwithstanding i have no intention of taking geoffrey as my lover truly petronilla was relieved yet puzzled i must have misread the signs but i ought to warn youi think louis did too i watched him watching you and geoffrey last night and he looked very disgruntled i surely hope so eleanorwhat is going on what are you up to eleanor looked at her thoughtfully then put her finger to her lips and moved swiftly and soundlessly across the chamber petronilla watched in astonishment as she jerked the door open is it as bad as that you really think louiss men would spy on you eleanors lip curled thierry galeran would hide under my bedif only he could fit yes i am quite sure i am being watched the death vigil for my marriage has begun and with the venerable abbot bernard himself standing ready to give the last rites petronilla should not have felt any surprise abbot suger of saintdenis had been the french kings chief adviser utterly insistent that his marriage was valid in gods eyes but hed died that past january and the french king was now heeding abbot bernardabbot bernard who believed that if all women were suspect daughters of eve eleanor was one of lucifers own but even though the news was expected it still came as a shock for the ramifications would be earthshaking divorce was usually disastrous for a woman she would invariably lose custody of her children her dower rights and often her good name as well eleanor would also lose a crown for a woman whod been queen of france the rest of her life was likely to be anticlimactic petronilla thought it was the true measure of her sisters desperation that shed wanted a divorce even knowing what it might cost her eleanorthere is still time to resurrect your marriage louis does love you and if you could only get pregnant again no the marriage has been dead for years petra i would not try to breathe life back into a corpse better we finally bury it it is not the divorce that is stealing my sleep at night it is what happens afterward it would indeed be ironic sister if the peace should prove more perilous than the war petronilla nodded somberly eleanor was the greatest heiress in christendom for she held aquitaine in her own right a vast and rich province stretching from the river loire to the pyrenees comparable in size and wealth to france itself once eleanor was free shed be a tempting prize indeed and shed be fair game for any baron with more ambitions than scruples all too often heiresses were abducted and forced into marriage as both women well knew the year before his death their father had become betrothed to the daughter of the viscount of limoges only to have her stolen away and wed against her will to the count of angouleme so the danger was a real one and would remain so until eleanor was safely wed again but as eleanors liege lord louis would be the one to choose another husband for her and petronilla did not think hed choose a husband to her liking whatever louiss failings as a husband he was still king of france it seemed to petronilla that whomever eleanor married next it was bound to be a comedown she could not help thinking that eleanors wretched marriage to louis was still the lesser of evils but she knew better than to say so eleanor took no more kindly to unsolicited advice than she did she would only be leaving herself open to a pointed reminder of her own stubborn insistence upon having raoul even if that meant theyd be together in hell no matter what angle she viewed it from her sisters future looked precarious at best but one thing she never doubtedthat eleanor would not sit placidly by whilst her destiny was decided by others what mean you to do eleanor sat down beside her on the bed well this much i know for certesthat the only fate worse than being yoked to louis for the rest of my life would be marriage to a man handpicked by that sanctimonious selfproclaimed saint bernard eleanors greyhound reached up suddenly swiping her cheek in a wet kiss and making her laugh almost at once though she sobered and so she continued coolly i mean to do my own husbandhunting petronilla rolled her eyes and you dare to call me reckless why is it reckless to want a say in my own life you can well imagine the sort of pathetic french puppet theyd choose for me a lackey whod look to paris for guidance the way infidels look toward mecca do you think id entrust aquitaine to such a weakwilled wretch i need a husband whod not be afraid to defy the french crown or even the church a man who could command respect from my duchys unruly quarrelsome barons she paused and then added dryly a man i could respect too would be a pleasant change you are not asking much are you eleanor reclined back against the pillows and smiled impishly at her sister oh but i want much more than that petra those were aquitaines needs but i have my own too i want a man who knows his own mind who sees nothing odd about reading for the fun of it a man who likes to laugh even at himself a man who is not so intent upon the glories of the next world that it blinds him to the pleasures of this one eleanor was no longer smiling above all i want a man i do not have to coax to my bed and where do you expect to find this paragon of manhood i can think of only one man who measures up to those exacting standards and raoul is already spoken for picking up the brush petronilla combed out her sisters long hair then began to braid it with nimble fingers what of geoffrey why then were you flirting with him merely to vex louis i had a twofold purpose i wanted to remind louis how mismatched we are just in case hed begun to have second thoughts about the divorce the only voice he heeds these days is that of our saint in residence who divides all of womankind into three categories nuns sluts and potential sluts so i knew hed look upon flirtation as only slightly less heinous a sin than sacrilege and i was right you see petra those famed mystical trances of bernards are only part of his sleightofhand when louis opens his mouth lo and beholdbernards words come out it was not often that eleanor let her bitterness show so nakedly and petronilla felt a surge of immediate and indignant sympathy her loyalties burned too hot and too deep ever to allow for detachment or objectivity she supposed that louis had his side too but she had no interest whatsoever in hearing it eleanor was right to look for a way out she decided the marriage was indeed dead and decomposing and keeping up the pretense would be like living in a charnel house trying all the while to ignore the stench forget what i said earlier about attempting to mend the rift id not urge you to run back into a burning building just because you had nowhere else to go but i am still curious about that twofold remark of yours why else were you seeking geoffrey out i know you claim you have no interest in a dalliance but you must have been tempted at least a little i am beginning to think raoul had best keep an eye on you till geoffrey departs paris must i assure you again that i am not as susceptible as you to a handsome face geoffrey of anjou was my red herring no more than that petronillas frown was one of bafflement she had hunted enough to understand eleanors allusion drawing a herring across a trail was said to throw pursuing dogs off the scent but she did not see its application not at first when it finally came to her she gasped aloud and inadvertently jerked on eleanors braid holy mother mary it is not geoffrey at all is it not the sirethe son eleanor laughed glory be at last are we such an unlikely pairing that you never once thought of henry it is a brilliant match eleanor petronilla enthused when i was ransacking my brain for a suitable husband i did not even think of him i admit itmayhap because of the age difference and yet he is the ideal choice of course he is rather young but he is no green lad for certes no son of maude and geoffrey could lack for boldness so youd be getting a husband willing to challenge the french crown one with prospects enough to unsettle even the most complacent of former husbandsduke of normandy heir to anjou and maine not to forget that very intriguing claim across the channel jesu eleanor he might be king of england one day id say that is a foregone conclusion petra henry strikes me as a bowman who rarely misses the target id wager he gets whatever he aims for petronilla looked closely into her sisters face and then grinned so that is the way the wind blows does it i think you fancy the lad eleanor grinned too lets just say i think he haspotential petronilla burst out laughing leaning over to give her sister an exuberantly affectionate embrace eleanors greyhound took that as an invitation and jumped onto the bed felice down eleanor fended off the dog with a pillow laughing too and for a few moments they managed to forget about the high stakes the allornothing gamble that eleanor was about to make it did not even occur to petronilla to wonder if henry would be receptive to eleanors overtures no man in his right mind would turn down eleanor and aquitaine that she never doubted nor did she see a need to speak of eleanors daughters sixyearold marie and oneyearold alix they were lost to eleanor whether she married henry or not for the french king would never give them up thered already been discussions about finding them suitable highborn husbands forging marital alliances that would further french interests and as likely as not theyd grow to girlhood in faroff foreign courts just as the eightyearold maude had once set sail for germany child bride of the imperial emperor heinrich v you have not yet had a hearttoheart talk with henry eleanor shook her head i have been observing him closely all week and i like what ive seen so far he is quickwitted deliberate and rather cockybut i need to know if he is also discreet if louis had even a suspicion of what i was planning id find myself conventcaged for the remainder of my days and i do not think id make a good nun eleanor had spoken lightly but there was too much truth in what shed said for humor petronilla was suddenly and uncharacteristically pensive eleanor was right louis would do almost anything to keep her from marrying henry and uniting aquitaine with normandy and mayhap even england she could not have chosen anyone better calculated to appall the king and desolate the man eleanor are you sure you want to do this have you thought about all youd be risking of course i have eleanor said impatiently after a moment though she smiled but then i think about all id be gaining paris had been sweltering in a highsummer heat wave but the weather changed abruptly by weeks end the city awoke to a steady downpour and dropping temperatures it was a dismal day outside and no less gloomy within the cite palace where the peace negotiations had broken down in recriminations and acrimony geoffrey had a hangover and a throbbing headache and hed walked out in midmorning once again declaring hed had enough and would be departing for anjou on the morrow this time henry believed him henry remained a while longer in a final attempt to come to terms with the french king it was another exercise in futility for neither one was willing to compromise the rain was still falling by the time henry and william de vere his chancellor emerged out onto the wide stone steps of the cite palace henry was just starting down them when he was accosted by a woman in a red mantle may i have a few moments of your time my lord henry her face was halfhidden by her hood but henry readily agreed for hed recognized the voice and was curious to find out what the lady petronilla wanted from him sending his men back into the hall henry fell into step beside petronilla hiding his surprise when she led him out into the deserted raindrenched royal gardens if not for the weather it would have been an idyllic setting with bordered walkways raised flower beds abloom with poppies madonna lilies and spectacular scarlet peonies a grassy mead spangled with snowwhite daisies and an abundance of fragrant red roses today though it was wet and windraked the turf seats soaked the paths pockmarked with puddles even the river seine looked different flat and leadengrey under a lowering slate sky petronilla kept up a comfortable flow of chatter the sort of soothing small talk that put people at their ease and yet revealed nothing of importance she tactfully made no mention of the flagging peace negotiations instead told henry an amusing story about her young sons latest misdeed asked politely about his mother the empress and reminded him playfully that theyd nearly been kin for several years ago geoffrey had suggested a marriage between henry and marie louis and eleanors baby daughter henry had almost forgotten that and he was glad now that nothing had come of it for he had no wish to be so closely bound to the french king after a moment he laughed aloud unable to envision the exotic eleanor of aquitaine as his motherinlaw the rain had eased up but not for long the clouds were thick and foreboding by now theyd reached the far end of the island jutting out into the seine like the prow of a ship a trellised garden arbour lay just ahead sheltered by climbing roses and tangled honeysuckle it was so well shielded that henry did not at first see the woman seated within not until he and petronilla were almost upon her she was clad in a hooded mantle of a glistening silver grey and looked elegant and somehow ethereal too a maid of the mist that was rising off the river when henry glanced her way she reached up and drew back her hood he came to an abrupt halt staring at the french queen and then moved swiftly toward her as he kissed her hand eleanor gave him a vivid smile i apologize for the deception and for dragging you out into the rain but i needed to speak with youin private im willing to brave some rain for your sake when she gestured toward the bench he did not need to be asked twice and seated himself beside her in the trellised hideaway only then did he remember petronilla but she was already retreating back up the walkway to keep watch the dreary day had suddenly taken a dramatic upswing for the better henry could not imagine a more pleasant pastime than an intrigue with eleanor that he did not yet know the nature of this intrigue troubled him not at all this is very clandestine and mysterious he acknowledged and i am eager to find out why youd want to talk in such secrecy not that i am complaining just curious after being lured out into a secluded garden many men would leap to the simplest most obvious conclusion that the woman had dalliance in mind i doubt that there is anything obvious about you lady eleanor henry parried she did not have seagreen eyes after all he was close enough now to see gold flecks in the green hazel suited her better he decided for it was an uncommon color subtle and everchanging she was watching him with an odd intensity as if a great deal depended upon his answer a rainsoaked garden is a good place for privacy he said but not for a tryst it would be too damnably wet his candor seemed to amuse her like a shooting star that dimple came and went moreover he continued infidelity has more serious consequences for a woman than for a man and for a queen most of all no whatever your reasons for this rendezvous it is not because you yearned for an hour of highrisk sinning with a stranger she said nothing but her sudden smile was blinding why do i get the feeling he joked that ive just passed some sort of test eleanor laughed marveling at his intuitiveness and sure now that her instincts had been right he was looking at her with alert interest slight wariness and undisguised desire as their eyes met he grinned but if you ever did decide to throw yourself at me id be right pleased to catch you how gallant of you henry my friends call me harry his nonchalance was just a little too studied to be utterly convincing she suspected that he was not as confident as hed have her believe but she was not put off by this hint of youthful insecurity she found it rather endearing for she was untroubled by the tenyear gap in their ages in some ways he seemed more mature to her than her husband who at thirty was still dithering indecisively at every royal crossroads harry she echoed i like that tell mewhat do your bedmates call you he blinked unforgettable but he could not quite carry it off and burst out laughing so did eleanor for she was more and more charmed by this engaging youth bravado and selfdeprecating humor and unabashed lust were an appealing brew to a woman whose marriage had been sober and chaste and desertdry more often than not henry still did not know what she wanted from him but he was willing to waitwith rare patienceuntil she was ready to reveal her intent he was also very willing to carry on this fascinating flirtation and he was disappointed when she then steered the conversation into a more innocuous channel one with no erotic depths the rain had stopped and he jerked his hood back running his hand absently through his damp unruly hair all the while trying not to stare too openly at the soft hollow of her throat or the solitary raindrop that had splashed onto her cheek and trickled like a wayward tear toward her mouth she was the most desirable woman hed ever seen and when he found himself thinking that a man could get drunk just by breathing in her perfume he realized how prescient his father had been to call her dangerous eleanor was well aware of the effect she was having upon him for fully half of her life men had been looking upon her with hot hunger and carnal lust only the man shed married had never been singed by her heat here in this trellised grotto that was scented with honeysuckle and glimmering with crystal droplets of rain she was seducing henry merely by inflaming his imagination the conversation was deceptively casual for the moment they were both pretending to be oblivious of the undercurrents swirling between them the questions were mainly eleanors the answers henrys he explained that his father had gotten the informal surname plantagenet because of his habit of wearing a sprig of broom or planta genesta in his cap he confirmed that he called himself henry fitz empress rather than fitz count or fitz geoffrey while he did not elaborate upon his reasons for this break with tradition eleanor understood the realism of it and approved after fourteen years of marriage to a man without a shred of practicality in his soul she could appreciate henrys pragmatism as much as she did his ambition petronilla had lamented the fact that henry did not resemble his father more closely while shed agreed that he was attractive he was too roughhewn for her taste utterly lacking geoffreys flamboyant good looks and dashing sense of style eleanor conceded that no one would ever call henry suave as they did geoffrey geoffrey always looked as if hed just been visited by his tailor whereas henrys clothes were of good quality but carelessly worn as if hed flung on the first garment at hand geoffrey had hair any woman might envy bright gold and gleaming rarely mussed henrys hair was redder unfashionably short and usually tousled petronilla had remarked that he looked more like a huntsman than a highborn lord and eleanor tended to agree with her sister she thought it a fine joke that the son of the empress maude and geoffrey le bel should be so downtoearth so indifferent to the trappings of power but henry was not indifferent to the power itself that she never doubted as she studied him now she was struck again by his presence she had to keep reminding herself that he was not yet nineteen for already he had it that indefinable quality that would give him the mastery of other men hed been in motion constantly as he talked gesturing expressively with his hands stretching out his legs he wore high leather boots not shoes as if hed dressed for a days hunting and with sudden insight she realized that this was indeed how he seemed to heras a man always on the verge of action his energy was awesome like a fire at full blaze and she found herself wondering what it would be like to feel all that energy between her thighs the erotic image of the two of them entwined together in a rumpled bed startled her somewhat for shed not expected to be drawn so strongly to him i think she said that it is time i told you why i contrived to meet you out in these rainsodden gardens you were right when you said it was an unlikely place for a tryst but it is a good place to avoid eavesdroppers or onlookers whilst not compromising me beyond repair if we are discovered together her dimple flashed again almost too quick to catch rumors to the contrary i am more careful of my reputation than certain churchmen claim henry saw no reason not to name her enemy straight out if we are choosing up sides lady eleanor i would rather be on yours than on abbot bernards he said and this time her dimple lingered it is passing strange she said the odd turns that fate takes no sensible man would set out upon a long journey without knowing the roads to follow and yet we all blunder through life without any maps whatsoever ive puzzled you i can see i was remembering that longago suggestion of your fathers that we consider marriage for you and my daughter marie who would ever have imagined then what lay ahead do not ever doubt harry that the almighty has a sense of humor this was the first time shed called him harry and he was young enough to take pleasure in that but he also felt a distinct letdown was this why shed wanted to see him aloneto revive those scuttled marriage plans that was such a prosaic and mundane solution to a marvelous mystery no intrigue merely a marital alliance hiding his disappointment he said i am not sure i understand lady eleanor are you offering me your daughter again no harry i am offering myself henry had been shifting in his seat but he stopped in midmotion and stared at her so she thought he can sit still after all he scarcely seemed to be breathing his eyes intently searching her face she knew without being told that he was seeking to make sure she was serious for it was becoming evident to her that there was a cool calculating brain behind the heat of those smokegrey eyes i accept do not be too quick to commit yourself harry do you not want me to specify what i am offering ere you say yes i assumed you were talking of divorce but if i misread you and you are offering a liaison the answer is still the same i would take you he said huskily any way i could get you even barefoot and in rags yes she murmured but you would not marry me without aquitaine and henry began to laugh recognizing in this worldly older woman a true kindred spirit you are right he admitted i would not marry you without aquitaine no more than you would marry me without normandy since we are being so candid what of england is this marriage of ours contingent upon my first becoming king of the english no she said ill take you as you are my lord duke your capture of the english crown is not a contingency but i think i can safely say that it is an inevitability henry exhaled an uneven admiring breath what a queen of england you will make to eleanors amusement hed already slid over on the bench so that their bodies were now touching how quick men were to claim possession to plant their flags this lad would need no prompting for certes hed made a very promising beginning kissing her fingertips her palm and then the pulse at her wrist laying her hand flat against his chest over his heart she said reluctantly i dare not take you to my bed harry no one can have even a glimmering of suspicion about us for if they do louis will never set me free he knew she was right he was warmed too by the note of genuine regret in her voice but that still did not make it any easier to agree how long do you think it will take to have your marriage annulled most likely about six months or so she said and smiled when he winced and muttered an obscenity under his breath his eagerness was sweet balm for an old wound when henry had seen her in the hall shed always been wearing the newly fashionable wimple a delicate white scarf which framed her face while covering her neck and hair today shed reverted to the older style and wore only a gossamer veil which left her slender throat bare and gave him his first glimpse of her long glossy braids adorned with goldthread ribbons he should have been surprised that her hair was not blonde for fairness was the defining measure of beauty in their world but he was not for he was learning that eleanor of aquitaine was a law unto herself in all things at first he thought the braids were black but when he reached for one and entwined it around his hand he saw it was actually a very dark brown burnished with auburn glints he wondered how long it would be ere hed get to see her hair spilling across his pillow and his fingers twitched with the urge to untie those ribbons one kiss he said surely we can risk that we do have a plight troth to celebrate after all even as he spoke he was already leaning toward her and eleanor decided that a kiss was not an unreasonable request she tilted her face up and he caressed her cheek with his fingers before claiming her mouth with his own the kiss was unhurried gentle at first but with enough passion to make it interesting when they drew apart eleanor was smiling very pleased with herself and this youth who would soon share her dreams and her bed they would rule an empire together she and harry and she would give him all the sons a man could want confounding louis and bernard and those whod dared to judge her so harshly to scorn her so unfairly as that greatest of all failures a barren queen she was still congratulating herself on how well her plans had gone when henry began kissing her again her brain warned her this was too reckless but her body was more receptive to the message it was getting from henry his mouth was hot his hands sliding up her back under her mantle pulling her in tight against him she started to tell him this was dangerous but by then he was fondling her breasts kissing her throat and instead of protesting she sought a closer embrace followed him heedlessly into the flames christ on the cross the cry was strident sharp enough to rip them apart flushed and dazed they spun around to confront a highly indignant petronilla have you both gone stark mad she demanded if you mean to put on a public display by all means lets invite the entire court so everyone can watch by now eleanor had recovered her breath and her senses the rain has stopped so people will be coming out into the garden harryyou must go henry was shaken too belatedly realizing how foolish theyd been you are right he agreed hoarsely and managed a crooked grin i do not trust myself around you but still he lingered until petronilla turned and gave him a slight push hurry she urged for i do not trust either one of you henry insisted upon kissing eleanors hand one last time before turning away adjusting his clothing as he strode along the pathway he paused once looking back at eleanor as shed known he would and she watched until hed vanished from view stepping into the trellised arbour petronilla sat beside her sister and reached over to pull eleanors hood up i hope to god he does not look at you like that out in the hall apart from the danger of starting a fire it would be a signed confession of adultery you need not worry petra harry will be discreet for your sake hed better be petronilla gave eleanor a sidelong appraising glance and then a sly smile so she said how did your hunt go did you get your quarry eleanor nodded only half listening to her sisters banter she was still gazing out across the wet empty garden in truth she said softly i think harry and i may be getting more than we bargained for upon his return to the abbey guest quarters geoffrey had instructed his men to prepare for departure in the morning and then took his hangover and his headache off to bed he awoke long before he was ready to find his head still hurting the rain still coming down and his son carrying on like a lunatic banging around the darkened chamber in search of a lamp and making enough racket to be heard back in anjou rolling over geoffrey groaned and called henry a foul name just as a light flared half blinding him go away harry ere i get my strength back and kill you he mumbled trying to blot out the glare and noise with his pillow but his son seemed to have developed a death wish for he snatched the pillow away and insisted that geoffrey sit up utterly unfazed by the steady string of curses being hurled at his head here papa have some wine itll make you feel much better he said sounding so odiously cheerful that geoffrey began to suspect that maude was an even worse wife than hed realized for how could this be a son of his loins he protested in vain soon found himself propped up with pillows scowling at henry as the young man sloshed a wine cup into his hand and then settled himself crosslegged on the foot of the bed maude put you up to this i know she did so you might as well admit it henry laughed stop grumbling papa and listen i have a great favor to ask of you quit whilst youre ahead harry whilst youre still in my will geoffrey took a tentative swallow of the wine and grimaced where did you get this it tastes like goat piss you were certainly guzzling it down last night without complaint i am serious papa i want you to set giraud berlai free geoffreys wine cup froze in midair are you drunk i am as sober as the sainted bernard and very much in earnest papa on the morrow i am going to tell louis that ive decided to cede the vexin to him i want peace with the french king and i want you to help me get it this morning you were determined to hold on to the vexin what has changed since then everything henry leaned forward splashing wine onto the bed but not even noticing his eyes were shining his color high geoffrey had rarely seen him so excited not off the hunting field i think youd better tell me what this is all about lad he said and grabbed for henrys wine cup just in time to keep it from being dumped in his lap why are you suddenly willing to give up the vexin for aquitaine henry said and grinned for eleanor and aquitaine id say that is a fair trade papa more than fair youand eleanor geoffrey was stunned but not disbelieving his son was too euphoric to doubt are you saying what i think you are lad henry nodded vigorously as of this afternoon i have a wifeor i will have as soon as she gets shed of louis once she does we shall wed so you see why i need to make peace with louis i want nothing to distract him from the urgent matter of getting his marriage annulled holy mother of god geoffrey shook his head slowly i thought id taken your measure harry but clearly ive been undervaluing you no papa as much as id like to claim credit for this the idea was eleanors she is a remarkable woman and if she were mine i would never let her go but louis will and once he does the english crown will be ours for the taking can you imagine how stephen will react when he hears henry laughed again swung off the bed and went to get another flagon from the table sowhat say you papa will you set berlai free for me of course i will although youll owe me for this lad and you may be sure ill remind you frequently of that now pour me some more of this swill and lets talk i agree that stephen will likely have a seizure when word of this gets out for the day you wed eleanor youll cast a shadow across half of europeand all of france that is why you must think about how louis will react too he is your liege lord as well as eleanors and if you marry the woman without his consentwhich hed never giveyoull be making a mortal enemy hell not like it any henry admitted but hell get over it no harry i think not he does love her you see and if she divorces him because they are fourth cousins or whatever and then marries you also a fourth cousinwell believe me when i say a wound like that will never heal trust me on this for i know more about hating than you hell be cursing you both with his dying breath mayhap you are right henry agreed but what of it surely you are not suggesting that i do not marry her geoffreys smile was wry no i am notand youd not heed me even if i did you cannot turn down an opportunity like this for marriage to eleanor could make you master of europe one day normandy and aquitaine and england and anjou and mainechrist jesus harry caesar might well envy you and if you were mad enough to spurn eleanors offer youd have to worry then about the man she might marry in your stead i just want you to understand that shell be bringing you the undying enmity of the french king as her marriage portion it is still as you said a fair trade but you need to bear that clearly in mind for this marriage will turn christendom upside down and that is no lie i understand that papa truly i do but can i not have one day just to be happy about it henrys smile was coaxing and so contagious that geoffrey had to smile back fair enough lad reaching out he clinked his wine cup against henrys in a mock salute to you and your bridetobe i think i can safely predict that your life together will never be dull what of your mother do you plan to tell maude hed caught henry off balance id rather not he confessed for the fewer people who know the better but i suppose i should for mama would not soon forgive me if i did not no she would not but you need not worry about her keeping your secret whatever she may say to you about this marriage in private shed never breathe a word to the world at large henry lowered his wine cup you think she will not approve geoffreys mouth twitched the empress will counsel you to wed eleanor as soon as she is free to do so but i suspect that the mother will find it deplorable that her beloved son must settle for damaged goods he saw henrys head come up at that and held up a hand to stave off his protest you do not like that do you well youd best get used to hearing it harry for you will be marrying a woman whose honour is frayed around the edges or so men think spiteful gossip and slander henry said scornfully and geoffrey shrugged gossip is still something we all have to live with lad if you can ignore it more power to you look harry i am not saying i believe the stories i told you honestly on the road to paris that i do not know if the rumors about eleanor are true nor will i lie to you now just because it would be what you want to hear eleanor might well be as pure and chaste as the blessed lady mary or she may indeed have strayed but if she did louis gave her cause i am not arguing with you lad you need not defend her to me but i will give you some advice and i hope you heed me let it lie decide now that whatever may or may not have happened in her past is between eleanor and her confessor and do not pry can you do that yes henry said after a long pause but i still say rumors prove nothing accusing a woman of wantonness is the easiest way to discredit her for some of the mud is always sure to stick you are right but god help you for you are also sounding like a man smitten geoffrey joked there is another matter we ought to talk about though you were eighteen last march and if memory serves me eleanor turned twentynine this summer are you comfortable with so great an age difference henry shrugged ten years five monthsnot so vast a gap if my memory serves mama is eleven and a half years older than you yes and weve had twentythree years of wedded bliss and marital joy geoffrey said with a tight smile too much rancor for humor henry was quiet for a moment not wanting to hurt his father by pointing out the obvious that maude had never wanted to marry geoffrey whereas he was very sure indeed that eleanor wanted to marry him it does not trouble me papa truly not he assured his father she is still young enough to bear children and that is what counts i have no doubt that shell give me sons she has been unfairly blamed for failing to bear louis an heir for you said yourself that he shied away from their marriage bed believe me that is not a problem shell ever have with me no with you id say the problem will be getting you out of her bed not into it papai am sensing some misgivings on your part are you just playing the devils advocate or do you truly have qualms about this marriage geoffrey did not respond as henry hoped with a hearty denial staring down into the dregs of his wine cup he said not qualms lad not exactly i want you to be king of england and your prospects will be greatly enhanced by marriage to eleanor i am pleased for you gods truth i just wish you were not so taken with the woman herself why ever not i think it is my great good fortune that i shall have a wife i find so desirable not only is she beautiful but she is clever and witty and educated bred to be a queen how lucky can i get i am going to give you some more advice harry that i do not expect you to take save your passion for your concubines your respect for your wife the best marriages are those based upon detached goodwill or benign indifference but unfortunately for you the one emotion you will never feel for eleanor of aquitaine is indifference jesu i would hope not papa i know you mean well but miserable marriages are not passed down from father to son like hair color or height it is no secret that you and mama made mistakes but why should i not learn from them rather than repeat them why not indeed geoffrey conceded i hope you do lad god knows i hope you do this was not a conversation henry had expected to have with his father hed thought maude would be the one to harbor doubts he was both amused and irked that geoffrey should be so protective for his wariness reflected poorly upon eleanor papa you need not worry about this marriage i have always known that one day i would rule over england i have never doubted that and i am just as sure now that eleanor is the woman meant to rule with me i know in my heart that it is so i swear i do id say the body part youre heeding at the moment is not your heart geoffrey drawled and then laughed abruptly do not mind me harry i am right proud of you and who knows mayhap even a little envious congratulations lad youve captured a queen and in that moment the full wonder of it hit henry too yes he said jubilantly i did laughing he raised his wine cup high to eleanor duchess of aquitaine queen of france andone dayqueen of england le mans france september the sudden concessions by the angevins astonished the french court such a dramatic volteface was bound to stir up speculation but the french king accepted it as divine intervention so did abbot bernard who felt grimly gratified that hed been able to instill the fear of god in so great a sinner as the arrogant count of anjou giraud berlai did not care what had motivated geoffreys change of heart he was just hysterically happy not to be going back to the angers dungeon and so the contentious peace talks came to an unexpected and gainful end geoffrey was restored to the church once berlai was set free henry did homage to the french king for his duchy while eustaces spies looked on glumly and eleanor watched with a secret smile henry and geoffrey then rode west into maine upon reaching le mans they parted company henry remaining in the city while geoffrey pushed on for tours and then angers they had much to do and less than a fortnight in which to get it done for a summons must be sent out to the barons of anjou and maine and normandy bidding them to appear at lisieux on september th henry could now direct all his energies and efforts toward recovering his mothers stolen crown the time was ripe to plan a fullscale invasion of england henry was a light sleeper and awakened as footsteps approached his bed the chamber was still filled with nightshadows but the figure bending over him was holding a candle revealing a face that was youthful troubled and familiar ivo the squire jumped and splashed hot wax onto henrys pillow i am so sorry my lord i thought you still slept i wasuntil you woke me up with an effort henry stifled his irritation ivos tonguetied shyness could be a trial but he was a good lad you must have a reason for hovering by my bed in the middle of the night he prompted sowhat is it it is nigh on toward dawn ivo mumbled and henrys patience started to unravel ivo fidgeted splattering some wax upon himself this time and henry began to realize that there was more to the boys reticence than his usual bashful diffidence ivo what are you so loath to tell me what is wrong the boy continued to squirm when he finally met henrys eyes henry was chilled by what he saw in themanguished pity my lord it is your father hehas been taken sick henry felt a rush of relief youth and optimism usually went hand in hand but ivo was an exception so anxietyridden that he not only expected the worst he actively courted it invariably turning a cough into consumption a scratch into a festering wound a growling dog into a rabid wolf i saw my father just three days ago ivo and he was fine now what is this all about a man has ridden in my lord insisting that we let him speak to you straightaway he says you must come back with him to chateauduloir that lord geoffrey wants to see you ere the boy faltered gulped and fell miserably silent this is crazy why is my father at chateauduloir that is barely twenty miles from here and he left le mans on tuesday he got no farther than chateauduloir for he fell ill that same night the voice came from the doorway and as the man stepped forward henry recognized one of his fathers household knights the lad is telling you true my lord henry the count is in a bad way and asking for you this makes no sense how could he fall sick so fast swinging out of bed henry grabbed for whatever clothes he could find tell me he demanded his voice muffled within the folds of his tunic tell me what happened we reached the castle in late afternoon and it was so hot that he decided to take a swim in the river but that night he was stricken with chills and fever and he did not feel well enough the next morning to continue on to tours none of us thought his ailment was serious my lord he least of all but he got worse yesterday bad enough to send for a doctor and then to fetch you his eyes were hollow his fatigue showing plainly and something far more frightening to henrydespair i rode all night by now henry was half dressed reaching for the boots ivo was holding out what does the doctor say the man looked away he is dying my lord henry stared at him i do not believe you he said roughly i do not believe you as they galloped south henry was oblivious to the dust and latesummer heat equally unmindful of the curious stares of other travelers and the commiserating glances of his companions his thoughts were racing ahead toward the man lying at chateauduloir geoffrey had just celebrated his thirtyeighth birthday during their stay in paris he was in robust health how could he be dying henry set such a breakneck pace that his escort was hard pressed to keep up and by the time chateauduloir came into view their horses were well lathered and the men soaked in sweat there was no challenge the drawbridge was already lowering to admit them as they rode into the inner bailey two men hastened out to intercept them henry knew them both thomas de loches his fathers chaplain and chancellor and jocelyn de tours his seneschal and longtime friend familiar faces but contorted and ravaged now by grief henrys stallion shied away as they approached pawing at the dry cracked earth but henry made no effort to rein the animal in he sat frozen in the saddle his hand clenched on the leather pommel for as long as he did not dismount they could not tell him that he was too late and his father was dead shock hits men in different ways it muted the gregarious jocelyn de tours but the normally taciturn thomas de loches was suddenly voluble compelled to give henry every detail of his fathers last three days assuring him repeatedly that the doctor had done all he could his words swirled about henry like drifting leaves every now and then he was able to catch one but most floated down out of reach his father had died within the hour that was all he could think about as they entered the stairwell that led up to geoffreys bedchamberthat he was just an hour too late his steps flagged as they drew near the door but the priest forged ahead and he had no choice but to follow the chamber was shuttered against the september sunlight candles flickered wanly upon the table henry had yet to look toward his bed waswas he shriven the priest seemed to take that as a personal reproach of course he was i heard his confession myself absolved him of his earthly sins and put the body and blood of christ upon his tongue he went to his maker in a state of grace you may be sure was he in his senses the chaplain nodded he knew he was dying and his thoughts were for you he made us all swear that we would acknowledge you as his lawful heir to you he bequeathed anjou and maine and to his son geoffrey the castles of chinon loudun and mirebeau he urged you not to rule one province by the customs of another each domain must be allowed its own identity be it normandy anjou or england when my lord jocelyn praised him for bringing peace to anjou and winning normandy he saidhe said that you were his greatest success and his only regret was that hed not live to see you crowned as king of england jocelyn de tours smiled sadly actually he called it that godforsaken isle for he never did have much regard for england or the english did he but that was only one of his regrets he also said nothing of importance the priest cut in hastily my lord henryhave you any questions henry shook his head his mouth too dry for speech but when they would have withdrawn he reached out and caught jocelyns sleeve neither spoke for several moments the angevin baron offering henry what he most needed just then silent sympathy jocelyn watched henry glance toward the bed and then away the muscles in his throat tightening convulsively what else jocelyn what did the chaplain not want me to hear thomas speaks fluent french and latin and provencal but bless him humor remains an alien tongue he was not trying to keep anything from you harry he just thought it unseemly that geoffrey should be joking on his deathbed but that is what id rather remember and i suspect you will too lad what vexed him the most about dying he said was the wretched timing of it that the sainted bernard should now get to claim the credit jocelyn was smiling through tears when he looked into henrys face he clasped the youths shoulder in a gesture of wordless and futile comfort then retreated quickly henry did not move until the door closed approaching the bed with a leaden step he stood staring down at his fathers body the doctor had done his work well and geoffreys features were composed his hands folded peacefully on his chest a rosary loosely entwined around his fingers his skin had a waxen cast and his lips were pale but his body had not yet begun to stiffen and it was possible for henry to imagine that he was merely asleep that at any moment hed open an eye and wink but it was no practical joke and only the abbot bernard would be laughing henry reached out tentatively his fingers brushing back the hair falling across geoffreys forehead the skin still felt warm to the touch and he backed away after a moment he sank to his knees beside the bed he did not pray though he wept geoffrey le bel was buried at his request in the cathedral church of st julien in his mothers city of le mans where hed long ago wed the empress maude and where his eldest son had been born after the funeral henry had no time to mourn riding for angers he claimed his legacy accepting the homage of his angevin vassals as the new count of anjou and maine a brisk october wind was sweeping through the priory of notredamedupre sending clouds scudding across the twilit sky and stripping the trees bare in a foretaste of winter heedless of the chill maude was standing in the doorway wrapping her arms around herself to stop from shivering as she watched her sons dismounting in the priory garth it took a while for them to get their men settled their horses led off to the priory stables eventually though maude was able to usher them inside toward the hearth are you hungry i can send to the kitchen for food her offer was met with shrugs and silence they looked exhausted numbed and overwhelmed by the magnitude of their loss all the more devastating because it had been as sudden as an amputation the sight of their grieving tore at maudes heart she would have given anything to be able to stanch their bleeding but she did not know how the ground shed gained in these past three years was strewn again with pitfalls and snares and maude the bravest of the brave now found herself so afraid of making a misstep that she dared not move at all tell me about the funeral she said at last did it go as planned henry nodded slumping down in a chair close to the hearth shed rarely seen him look so listless drained of his usual exuberance and energy maude knew hed been accustomed since early youth to shouldering a mans responsibilities but she felt that burying his father was one burden too many shed have spared him that if she could but shed not been consulted hed taken it all upon himself and she could see the cost now in the distance reflected in his eyes wills eyes were redrimmed and he was blinking so rapidly that he felt the need for a mumbled complaint about the smoky hearth it was a fine funeral mama he said and flushed when his voice cracked he was fifteen now and had hoped that hed outgrown that particular indignity we buried papa in front of the high altar and harry ordered a splendid tomb papas chancellor chose the epitaph though by your sword o prince the crowd of robbers is put to flight peace flourishes and churches enjoy tranquillity will cast an oblique glance toward his eldest brother then confided harry says that if the fever had not killed papa hed have died laughing at that epitaph but i like it what about you mama what do you think maude hesitated groping for a tactful response but geoff forestalled her hed yet to take off his mantle and had been stalking about the chamber giving off almost as much heat as the hearth why ask her will he jeered the only epitaph shed have favored would have been one that said hallelujahdead at last maude gasped for this resentful seventeenyearold youth had the power to wound her as none of her enemies ever could will looked stricken and henry dangerously dispassionate a sure sign that his temper was about to erupt their disapproval only made geoff all the more defiant i am just saying what the whole world knows he insisted you hated papa and never made any secret of it you can pretend now that you were not glad to hear hed died but what fool would believe shut your mouth geoff you keep out of this harry you may be mamas pet but i take no orders from you yes henry said icily you do and geoff discovered that running headlong into reality hurt far worse than any of the bruises and scrapes of boyhood mishaps he could not remember a time when hed not been jealous of his elder brother it had gnawed away at him that harry was the heir the firstborn the favored one that someday he would inherit it allthe lands the titles the power someday far in the future not now harry was not supposed to have it so soon it was not fair none of it was fair papa was dead and hed not even gotten to say farewell mama would now play the grieving widow and harryhis vexing insufferable boastful brother harry was now his liege lord it had happened in angers hed gone from rival to vassal as hed watched harry being invested as count of anjou and maine but it was not until tonight that he had fully understood all the implications of that ceremony and the realization was more bitter than he could bear ive a right to speak my mind harry if your mind was a well it would be bonedry henry said scathingly and to geoffs secret shame he was the first to look away he did not lack for reasons to detest his brother but this was the most compelling reason of allthat his will was always the weaker of the two the first to break saving face as best he could he muttered that he was going off to bed as much as he wanted to storm out in high dudgeon he lost his nerve at the last moment too shaken and miserable to dare to defy mother and brother both and bade them goodnight with a poor pretense of civility when they did not object he felt as if hed made his escape from enemy territory and yet he was perversely aggrieved too that theyd been willing to let him go mama will had far more freckles than either of his older brothers scattered profusely across an open appealing face one that was not structured for secrets or scowls he was the most equable of her sons goodnatured and accommodating neither as moody as henry nor as highstrung as geoff henry and geoff had inherited their fair share of geoffreys sardonic humor and a goodly portion too of the infamous angevin temper but not will he was an anomaly an innocent in a domain in which innocence did not often thrive and while maudes deepest love was reserved for henry her strongest protective urges were for will he was regarding her now with anxious blue eyes slouching down further and further in his seat like a turtle withdrawing into its shell mamageoff was not right was he you were not glad when papa died no maudes protest was involuntary indignant she stepped toward her youngest meaning to reassure him when she happened to glance over at henry he too was watching her intently even warily and as their eyes met she suddenly understood about the funeral it had been done very fast allowing enough time for henrys brothers to ride from angers to le mans but not for her to travel the much greater distance from rouen shed not comprehended the reason for the rush as henrys claim to anjou was uncontested there were no rival claimants racing him to angers but now she knew and she was sorry she did henry had been afraid to give her a chance to attend geoffreys funeral afraid that shed have refused no will i was not gladdened by your fathers death i will not lie to you lad there was a timeearly in our marriagewhen i might have been but that was so long ago will a lifetime ago i was truly shocked by geoffreys deathand pained by it if the pain had been more for her sons than for geoffrey she saw no reason to confess it will did not reply but his shy halfsmile told her that shed found the right words said what he needed to hear turning then toward her firstborn she reached out letting her hand rest lightly on his shoulder i would have come henry she said softly i swear to you that i would have come he nodded and ducked his head but not before she saw the tears shining behind his lashes you look weary my lady minnas fingers were not as nimble as theyd once been but it never occurred to her to let one of maudes younger attendants tend to her needs nor had it occurred to maude she tilted her head back so minna could finish unfastening her braids just as shed done every night for more years than either woman could remember i am tired maude acknowledged too tired to sleep i am afraid minna that geoff is slipping out of reach again he is so angry needing to blame someone for his fathers death and i suppose it is either me or the almighty you often despaired of ever breaking through all his walls minna pointed out but he was slowly letting some of his defenses down and he will again every freeze is followed by a thaw madame i hope so minna how i hope so but i am not as confident as you not about geoff you see he could never forgive me for not loving geoffrey and nownow he cannot forgive me for loving henry as candid as they usually were with each other minna had learned to weigh her words when discussing maudes sons she was very fond of maudes youngest for will had a singular sweetness a naiflike charm that was uniquely his own henry she adored even at his wayward worst he was still madames true son whose destined kingship would redress all of her ladys struggles all of her suffering but she viewed geoff with a jaundiced german eye seeing a spoiled young lordling with an overabundance of grievances and no sense of obligation or duty only a sense of entitlement that was an opinion however that she could never share with geoffs mother and she concentrated instead upon brushing out maudes hair still a deep rich black although her next birthday would be her fiftieth they were afraid that id welcomed geoffreys death maude confided i swore to them that i had not and that was the truth minna id be the last one to doubt henrys abilities but he is still so young geoffrey could have done what i cannotkeep the peace in normandy whilst henry seeks to overthrow stephen i can fight for my son but not on the battlefield it always comes back to that henry had need of his father there was a time when i was not willing to admit that but the knock was so soft that maude was not sure at first what shed heard when it came again minna hastened over and opened the door henry paused on the threshold at sight of his mothers unbound hair youre getting ready for bed id not realized it was so late before he could back out maude beckoned him in i always have time to talk with you minna had already disappeared conveniently remembering a sudden need for night wine reclaiming her seat maude watched her firstborn prowl restlessly about the chamber is will abed henry nodded it upset will that papa left chinon and the other castles to geoff nothing to him i explained that these castles had long been regarded as the rightful appanage of the house of anjous younger son that papa was merely following family tradition and it in no way meant that hed favored geoff i did my best to assure will of this and i also assured him that hed not be left to beg his bread but i think it would help mama to hear it from you too ill speak to him tomorrow maude promised ill remind him that once he is of age well find him an heiress to wed there is something else i want to discuss with you mama it is about what happened in paris i was wondering about that maude admitted why did you change your mind about relinquishing the vexin i daresay youve heard the rumors about the french kings troubled marriage well the rumors are true louis has decided to divorce his wife and once he does i mean to marry eleanor myself good god maude sat back in her chair openmouthed youve always been one for surprises henry but this time youve truly outdone yourself thank you he said dryly assuming that was meant as a compliment you sound very sure that this will come to pass i gather then that you and eleanor have reached some sort of understanding the corner of henrys mouth twitched i think you can safely say that no wonder you were willing to give up the vexin you do realize though what a hornets nest youll be stirring up you could have no better steppingstone to the english throne than aquitaine but the french king will view this marriage as unforgivable treachery so papa said too henry conceded you and eleanorwho would ever have guessed lets hope no one does mama not until were safely wed she nodded henryyou know how much i want you to be king of england but i also want you to be happy for the highborn marriage is a practical matter indeed with no allowance made for sentiment a political union a means of gaining territory a way to forge an alliance no one ever asks if the couple is mismatched if they are likely to be compatible but believe me those are not frivolous questions you may be seeking a consort and wedding a duchess but youll be living with a woman and now is the time to consider her i know you want aquitaine do you also want eleanor he regarded her impassively for hed inherited geoffreys irritating knack of being able to mask his thoughts when he chose yes he said i want her wellthen i can give you more than my approval i can give you my blessings too truly henrys smile offered her a sudden glimpse of sunlight breaking through the clouds dispelling the oppressive mourning gloom credit where due mama you can surprise too papa was so sure youd have misgivings about the marriage a tart rejoinder hovered on her lips that geoffrey had not known her nearly as well as hed imagined it went unsaid instead she reminded herself that their marital war was over at last no more uneasy truces just the eternal peace of the grave as she embraced henry she could not help thinking though that the final victory had been geoffreys she knew that her sons loved and respected her at least henry and will did but she doubted that theyd have grieved as much for her as they now grieved for geoffrey the storm caught north wales by surprise for it was only november the snow started during the night and the welsh awoke to find that winter had arrived with a vengeance by midday the wind had intensified soon even the silhouetted peaks of eryri were no longer visible ranulf had not seen so much snow since hed been trapped in the siege of oxford as the storm increased in severity it began to seem as if trefriw were under siege too but by a more formidable foe than stephen fortunately this was an enemy that could be safely waited out and the only weapon the besieged needed was patience but that evening rhiannon went into labor she was not due for another fortnight and they hoped at first that these were false labor pains it soon became apparent however that the baby was comingin the midst of a blizzard with no midwife ranulf had been desperate enough to try to fetch the woman he got no farther than the stable barely made it back to the hall that night seemed endless neither ranulf nor rhodri slept at all huddled by the fire waiting for word abovestairs in the birthing chamber rhiannon struggled to deliver her child attended by the willing but inexperienced hands of enid eleri olwen and heledd their elderly cook downstairs ranulf struggled too seeking to convince himself that all would go as it ought but enid was barren eleri and olwen were virgins and heledds own childbearing more than thirty years distant men were barred from the birthing chamber but from time to time enid or eleri would emerge with forced smiles and assurances that grew less and less convincing with repetition bechan the servingmaid crept about like a stray cat shrinking into corners and daubing at her eyes with the corner of her apron it was obvious that she was already mourning her mistress and ranulf could not trust himself to glance in her direction lest he banish her from the hall but how could he blame the wench for lacking faith when he had so little of it himself with the coming of dawn the blizzard at last showed signs of abating white waves no longer swept across the bailey obscuring all traces of land for the first time in many hours ranulf could make out the sloping contours of the stable roof pulling up the hood of his mantle he plunged out into the bailey the cold seared his lungs brought tears to his eyes wading through drifts deep enough to drown in he slogged toward the stable it was slow hazardous going but he battled on until he reeled into the stable sinking down on a bale of hay the horses peered over their stall doors grateful for the human company hungry for their breakfast of fodder and hay ranulf was still trying to get his breath back when the door banged again and two more hooded figures staggered in hed not realized that he was being followed for their cries had been carried away by the gusting snow like him they headed toward the bales of hay and collapsed against the wall padarn recovered first his the resilience of youth and volunteered to tend to the horses panting and wheezing rhodri blew on his chapped hands stamped his feet to warm them and brushed snow off his eyebrows mustache and even his lashes have you lost your wits altogether he accused how far did you think youd get the storm seemed to be easing up since the midwife lives only a few miles from here i thought i could make it christ jesus ranulf where is your common sense this was a fools gamble if ever i saw one ranulf could not argue the point i did not realize how bad it still was not until i was out in it but i had to try uncle it has been more than twelve hours i know the women say that is not unusual but would they tell us if it were so much can go wrong in a birthing and without a midwife his shoulders sagged and he said very low and fast my mother died in childbed and the babe with her i know lad i know it is never easy for the woman nor for the man either i remember all too well what the waiting was like each time my nesta was brought to bed of one of our bairns i could not help noticing how raw your nerves became as rhiannons time drew nigh none of us reckoned upon this accursed storm but you were already sorely afeared you would not even choose names for the baby lest you tempt fate this is not like you ranulf why are you so loath of a sudden to let yourself hope for the best ranulfs smile was bleak for most of my life i not only hoped for the best i expected it as if it were my godgiven birthright that was the worst sort of arrogance uncle and it brought nothing but griefnot just to me but to the innocent too i truly thought the rest of my life would be penance for these sins i deserved no less but you do not deserve rhiannon and your babeis that what you fear that god means to punish you for daring to be happy rhodri slid over on the bale until he was close enough to grasp the younger mans arm why is it that the almighty forgives us more readily than we forgive ourselves listen to me lad i cannot tell you there is no danger in childbirth but i can tell you how good youve been for my daughter how much come quick padarn had been keeping vigil at the door spinning around he gestured urgently they are shouting for us lurching to their feet ranulf and rhodri hastily followed padarn out into the snow linking arms they ploughed through the drifts for they now had the wind at their backs as they stumbled toward the hall eleri appeared in the doorway her hair was in disarray her color ashen her eyes swollen with fatigue her gown splattered with blood but her smile was incandescent the entire household had crowded into rhiannons chamber to admire her newborn son everyone from the timid bechan to the burly stable grooms she accepted their congratulations and good wishes with exhausted aplomb but was grateful when eleri eventually took charge and insisted that they all withdraw so she could rest she groped quickly for ranulfs hand letting him know she wanted him to stay needlessly so as nothing short of force could have dislodged him from her bedside a reluctant rhodri was the last to leave pushed out by his wife and daughter as he craned to get one more loving look at his grandson once they were finally alone ranulf leaned over and kissed his wife then his son rhiannon smiled tiredly the baby had begun to whimper and she drew back the bed covers guiding his little mouth toward her breast he needed no further urging was soon sucking contentedly upon her nipple shed refused from the outset to consider a wet nurse and ranulf now understood why nursing was an especially intimate act for a mother unable to see her child what color is his hair she asked and he reached over to stroke the infants head the silky scant hair was as soft as the downy plumage of a baby chick it is hard to say he teased for he is wellnigh bald if i had to guess id say a flaxen shade its like to change anyway which is fine with me id not mind if it turned green i think id prefer a more conventional color rhiannons smile ended as a yawn i want you to name him ranulf are you sure love it would not be a welsh name she squeezed his hand in reply you wish to call him robert after your brother ranulf gently wiped away the milk dribbling down his sons chin no he said i want to name him gilbert beaugency france march in late september louis and eleanor had begun a royal progress through her domains they were welcomed with enthusiasm for eleanor had always been extremely popular with her people and they were heartened by rumors of an impending split with her foreign french husband these rumors gained credence as the weeks passed for in the course of the progress french garrisons and crown officials were replaced with men of eleanors choosing men of aquitaine the french sovereigns celebrated their christmas court at limoges it was to be their last one as man and wife in february they parted eleanor returning to poitiers louis to paris by now all knew a divorce was both imminent and inevitable on the friday before palm sunday the archbishop of sens convened a church council at the royal castle of beaugency not far from orleans evidence was presented that the french king and his queen were related within the prohibited degree for her greatgrandmother had been a granddaughter of his greatgrandfather the clerics were not long in delivering their solemn verdictthat the marriage must be annulled on grounds of consanguinity the young princesses marie and alix were declared to be legitimate and their custody was granted to the french king eleanor relinquished her queenship and resumed those titles that were hers by birthright duchess of aquitaine and countess of poitou the french king was now free to wed again to seek a wife able to give him a son and heir at the prodding of eleanors advocate the archbishop of bordeaux the council agreed that she was free to wed too but of course not without louiss consent for her former husband was still her king and liege lord the following morning was a mild sunlit saturday a good day for travel but the count of vermandois did not doubt that his sisterinlaw would have ridden out in the teeth of a raging gale so eager did she seem to leave beaugency and her former life behind he would be sorry to see her go and he said so now telling her that the royal court would be a dull place without her that her going would break male hearts and quench candles all over paris eleanor smiled for she liked raoul his gallantry might be a bit heavyhanded at times but shed take that any day over the sort of somber piety shed been living with for the past fourteen years gathering her into his arms raoul winked over her shoulder at his wife you do not mind if i run off with eleanor for a few weeks do you petra of course not petronilla said absently not hearing a word hed said she was finding this harder than shed expectedsaying farewell to her sister knowing how drastically their lives were about to change i shall miss you eleanor she said summoning up a game but forlorn smile who will i have to quarrel with once youre gone that is what husbands are for as the sisters embraced eleanor found her eyes misting too you must visit me at poitiers later in the spring she said adding significantly i will tell you when to come petronilla nodded and raoul cheerfully promised to accompany her the two women said nothing for it was understood that petronilla would find a way to come alone raoul was louiss cousin and liegeman and seneschal of france they could not compromise his honour by allowing him to attend eleanors wedding to henry fitz empress eleanor had no illusions about what was to come there was a time when shed been careless of consequences but no longer louis would see her marriage as a grievous betrayal both of the man and of the monarch what would he do she knew him so well and yet she was still not sure how hed react she felt confident that she and harry would be a match for him but she was determined to shield any others from louiss wrath and so raoul must be kept in ignorance for his own protection the great hall was thronged with clergy and curious onlookers eager to watch this historic parting between the french king and his notorious queen as soon as eleanor appeared heads turned and necks craned the men whod command her escort were waiting by the door saldebreuil de sanzay her constable and geoffrey de rancon lord of taillebourg she smiled at sight of them for they were more than loyal vassals they were friends men who would willingly lay down their lives to keep her safe louis was nearby engaged in conversation with the archbishops of rouen and reims not yet aware of her presence she was about to start toward him when she saw the tall whitehaired figure by the hearth his simple monks habit contrasting dramatically with the colorfully clad nobles and the ornately garbed princes of the church the holy man of france the venerated and honoured abbot of clairvaux her sainted enemy abbot bernard greeted her with frigid formality he so resembled one of the patriarchs of oldpale and haggard burning dark eyes and flowing long hairthat eleanor wondered cynically if hed deliberately cultivated the image i understand she said that you convinced louis not to bring my daughters to beaugency to bid me farewell he told me that he would have done soif not for you my lord abbot he was quite untroubled by the accusation that is true he said calmly i thought it was for the best such a meeting was bound to be painful am i to believe then that you were acting out of christian kindness i care for all of gods lost lambs madame even the foolish ones who keep straying into the hills where wolves prowl and dangers lurk the lord forgives much provided that there is true repentance it is always possible to come back into the fold back into grace with you as my guide id rather take my chances with the wolves take care madame lest you imperil your immortal soul you do but prove i had good reason to keep your daughters away from your baneful influence as wrathful as he was the abbot still remembered to keep his voice down for this was not a conversation for others to hear your lack of gratitude should not surprise me though given your lamentable lack of decorum and discretion gratitude my apologies my lord abbot it seems ive been maligning you unfairly for you do have a sense of humor after all it is foolhardy to court danger madame but it is lunacy to court damnation you do indeed owe me a debt of gratitude if not for my forbearance you might have been cast aside for adultery rather than consanguinity it is also foolhardy my lord abbot to hold your foes too cheaply your convictions to the contrary most women are not idiots i could not have been accused of adultery for you have no proof and well you know it and even if youd found men willing to swear falsely that it was so a verdict of adultery would have prohibited louis from marrying againas you well know too i see no point in continuing this conversation if you would spit upon salvation so be it then i leave your sins to god fortunately for the king and for france he is now free of your unholy spell free to choose a wife devout and docile and virtuous a wife who will give him the heir you could not eleanors eyes shone with a greenish glitter what a pity she said that the blessed virgin mary is not available for she would have suited his needs admirably bernard drew in his breath with a sibilant hiss you are an evil woman wanton and truly wicked and you will indeed suffer for nono she is not neither eleanor nor the abbot had heard louiss approach and they both spun around at the sudden sound of his voice you are wrong abbot bernard he said with a firmness eleanor had seen him show all too rarely i know her far better than you and there is no evil in her soul only a misguided sense ofof levity eleanor was tempted to retort that to a man like the abbot levity might well be the greatest sin of all but she did not for louiss sake the abbot was regarding the king with the pained patience of a tutor for a likable but slow student you are sometimes too tolerant my liege he said too forgiving for your own good that eleanor couldnt resist did not our lord christ preach that forgiveness was a virtue she murmured earning herself a toxic look from the abbot a reproachful one from the king seizing her elbow louis steered her away from bernard toward a recessed window seat he did not suggest that they sit the time was past for that why is it that turmoil and commotion always follow after you as faithfully as that dog of yours louis asked pointing to the greyhound that had trailed them into the window alcove but he sounded more plaintive than protesting even mustering up a sad smile as their eyes met his was an easy face to read it took one glance to reassure eleanor that hed not overheard her blessed virgin gibe she was glad for it was bernard shed wanted to wound not louis that was not always so thered been times when shed yearned for words sharp enough to draw blood to leave ugly scars shed blamed louis for much that had gone wrong in their marriage for not being bolder or able to laugh at lifes perversities for not being more like the swaggering spirited roguish men of her house for no longer heeding her advice as hed done in their first years together for loving god far more than he could ever love her and for the reluctant desire and sense of shame that hed brought to their marriage bed but shed not hated him for these failingsanger and frustration and occasional contempt but not hatred that had come only after antioch after louis had accused her of harboring an incestuous passion for her uncle and threatened to have her bound and gagged and dragged away by force if need be ever a realist shed yielded far too proud to fight a war she could not hope to win she was learning that women must pick their battles with care that strategy mattered more than strength eventually louis had apologized and swore upon the true cross that he knew her to be innocent but by then it was too late by then her uncle had been slain by the turks his impaled head rotting above the caliphs palace in the hot baghdad sun and eleanor could not look upon her husband without raymonds doomed and bloodied spectre coming between them but now that shed regained her freedom she found herself remembering how it had been at first for them a fifteenyearold bride and her sixteenyearold groom shyly appealing awed by her beauty and eager to please her before hed begun to yearn for the peace of the cloister before those poor souls had died in the flames of a vitry church before the miscarriage and daughters instead of sons before his hair shirt and her disgrace before the crusade and antioch and raymonds needless death before abbot bernard for a poignant moment she could see that longlost youth reflected in the depths of translucent blue eyes and then the memory faded and she was looking at a man decent and ineffectual and despairing a man she could pity but not respect and never love i promise you he said earnestly that i will not speak ill of you to our daughters she knew better his intentions were good they always were but he would never be able to forgive her for henry fitz empress no more than shed been able to forgive him for her uncle raymond i ought to have brought them he said striving to be fair you can see them whenever you come to paris that i promise you too i would ask though thatyou not come for a while eleanor no she agreed not for a while knowing that shed never be welcome in paris she had to believe shed see her daughters again for she would never give up what was hers but as louis leaned over and kissed her circumspectly on the cheek she realizedas he did notthat it was not likely theyd ever meet again a door was slamming shut and thered be no going back there was nothing more to be said louis seemed to grasp that too for he stepped aside and wished her godspeed which struck her as an odd epitaph for a marriage i wish you well louis she said and discovered that she meant it i wish you happiness a wife with no misguided sense of levity and the son you so crave and that too she meantalmost raoul and petronilla followed eleanor from the hall out into the bailey where her armed escort waited uncomfortably aware of abbot bernards disapproving gaze louis did not instead he retreated from the hall with what dignity he could once hed reached the privacy of his bedchamber he unlatched the shutters leaned out in time to see eleanor riding across the bailey out of the castle and out of his life he watched from the window mourning what theyd lost and what theyd never had he kept vigil until shed disappeared into the distance until even the dust had settled again onto the grooved pitted road but shed never looked back an early spring had begun to repair the damage done by winter the trees were budding and the wild daffodils known as lent lilies were gilding the river meadows with splashes of gold the loire shimmered like liquid silver reflecting the sky and clouds and the soaring spirits of the aquitanians most of the men in eleanors escort detail were southerners never happy in the less hospitable domains of the french king they were a different breed these sons and daughters of aquitaine for theirs was a warmer more indolent clime a land of rich harvests and fertile vineyards and lush emerald valleys they understood that life was short and unpredictable and therefore it behooved a prudent man to taste as many of its pleasures as he could if their exuberant joie de vivre conflicted with the churchs stringent teachings about the mortification of the flesh that never seemed to trouble them much they were glad to be escaping the rigors of northern winters even gladder to be leaving behind the french kings austere staid court the jokes flew by faster than the miles as they galloped south so delighted were they to be bringing their beautiful duchess home not all of the members of eleanors household were born and bred in aquitaine one of her ladiesinwaiting came from a wilder region the fogdrifted seacoast of brittany yolande had been with eleanor only a few months it had been her misfortune to join the french queens retinue just as eleanors queenship was breathing its last but if she minded trading paris for poitiers she showed no sign of it riding alongside the lady colette eleanors longtime attendant she kept up a running commentary of cheerful observations and ingenuous questions they would be back at poitiers for easter would they not was it true that the famed troubadour and poet bernard de ventadour would be joining the duchesss court did colette think the duchess was in true danger from wouldbe suitors would they still be stopping for the night at blois why had the duchess been so loath to accept the invitation theyd gotten from its young count hed sounded quite charming judging from his letter and very highborn for was he not the english kings brother yolande was almost as much in awe of the blackeyed elegant colette as she was of the duchess herself colettes moods were as changeable as the weather she could go from sun to frost and back to sun fast enough to set yolandes head to spinning today though the forecast seemed favorable colette listened to yolandes chatter with goodhumored indulgence answering her queries and making wry asides of her own theyd soon be back in poitiers she assured the breton teenager within four days if all went well shed not be at all surprised if bernard de ventadour sought the duchesss patronage poets and troubadours would be flocking to aquitaine like migrating swallows in the spring indeed there was a very real danger now that the duchess was free to wed again why did yolande think they had so large an escort one of eleanors household knights dropped back beside them presenting colette with a fragrant sprig hed just plucked from a flowering blackthorn bush she thanked him with a coquettish flutter of her lashes a hinted smile but after hed spurred his stallion on she dropped the blossoms down into the dust and the softhearted yolande winced hoping the knight hadnt seen as if theyd not been interrupted colette resumed the conversation yes she confirmed theyd still be passing the night at blois but in st lomers abbey not the castle count theobald had been too importunate for the duchesss liking lady eleanor thought hed seemed much too eager for her to accept his hospitality as for his charm that was no recommendation speaking from her own experience shed learned that most charming men were about as trustworthy as barbary pirates and no count theobald was the english kings nephew not his brother yolande had confused the son with the father count theobald of champagne and blois king stephens elder brother whod died in january the eldest son henry had inherited champagne and the second son theobald got blois surely yolande had not forgotten about the plight troth yolande blushed for while she did have difficulty keeping track of the various barons and lords and peers of the realm she ought never to have gotten so muddled about theobald of blois it was less than two months since theobalds brother henry the new count of champagne had pledged to wed the little princess marie the plight troth had provoked a sharp quarrel between the french king and eleanor for she had not been consulted and was angry that shed been given no say in a decision that would shape the entire course of her daughters life yolandes elder sisters had been married off in that same summary way her father had conferred with neither her mother nor the prospective brides beforehand nor was it likely that shed be consulted in her turn but that was the way of the only world she knew and it had not occurred to yolande to object it had occurred to eleanor although the french king and his counselors had gone ahead with the plight troth nonetheless and sixyearold marie was now the count of champagnes betrothed how soon she would become his wife would depend upon her father and husbandtobe for in that too her mother would not be consulted just as yolande knew eleanor would not be heeded when the time came to choose another husband for her the man would have to meet the french kings approval and mayhap the abbot bernards too to be judged as a loyal vassal one worthy enough to be entrusted with aquitaine as to what eleanor might want that would not matter much in the councils of power yolande had been bedazzled from the first by her glamorous audacious mistress and she thought it would break her heart to see her lady snared and earthbound for the rest of her days wings clipped so she could no longer fly nudging her mare closer to colettes sleek white mule she said diffidently colettewhat does the future hold for our lady you need not fret on her behalf child this i can tell you for true that the duchess could teach a cat about landing on its feet colette was frowning into the distance the sun had set and they were losing the light theyd soon have to bring out the lanterns look she said something is afoot yolande peered into the gathering dusk and saw that colette was right as a horseman emerged from a grove of trees beside the road her pulse sped up colette was urging her mule forward and she followed hastily but by now it was evident that the rider was alone and some of her alarm eased whatever this was about at least it was not an ambush eleanor had reined in her mare protectively flanked by saldebreuil de sanzay and geoffrey de rancon she watched with wary curiosity as the stranger was led forward he was young not much more than twenty dark as a spaniard with bold admiring eyes and courtly manners that did not jibe with the plain homespun of his garb his cap was off with a sweep and the movement gave her a brief glimpse of a sword hilt as his mantle parted madame he said ive been watching for your approach eleanor beckoned him closer why he did not mince words to warn you away from blois he said bluntly eleanors eyes narrowed count theobald he nodded if you enter the city tonight youll not find it easy to leave on the morrow the count was sorely aggrieved my lady when you declined to stay at his castle he means to remedy that by force if need be he has it in mind to insist that you lodge with him rather than the monks and i daresay he has a biddable priest ready and willing to perform a hasty marriage ceremony once youveaccepted the inevitable eleanors mouth tightened accepted the inevitable a discreet description indeed of abduction and rape beside her geoffrey de rancon was swearing under his breath revealing a command of obscenity that any sailor might have envied saldebreuil de sanzay was more controlled but no less enraged theyd known they might run into trouble theyd not expected though that theyd encounter it so soon within a day of the divorce so the hunt has already begun has it she said grimly rancon was still fuming we would never have let that whelp take you my ladynever i know that geoffrey but it would have been an ugly clash and likely a bloody one men ought not to die because of a boastful lordlings lustnot my men by god they deserve better than that eleanor wasted no more time fulminating upon count theobalds treachery tell the others she said her eyes resting speculatively upon their good samaritan youve done me a service i will not soon forget i was very fortunate that you somehow became privy to theobalds plans a remarkable stroke of luckif that is indeed what it was even in the fading light she could see a flash of white as he grinned you are quick my lady as well as fair as you guessed luck had nothing to do with it as soon as word got out that the church synod would be convened at beaugency we knew youd have to take this road back to poitiers i was sent into blois a week ago charged to see to your safety whilst you were in the city sometimes a lone man can do more good than an army if it is the right man eleanor agreed and he grinned again it was not that difficult to root out the counts acorns he was careless and one for bragging a disdainful shrug the almighty might not look upon clumsiness as a sin but i do and it gladdens me greatly that the count will have so much to repent upon the morrow i value a man who knows his own worth i could easily find a place for you in my household if you were interested but you are notare you they smiled at each other in perfect understanding no my lady i am quite content as i am serving my lord duke of normandy rancon and sanzay exchanged startled glances even more perplexed when eleanor showed no surprise at all you must thank your lord for me she said who knows mayhap one day i may have the opportunity to thank him myself he laughed softly the triumphant laugh of a man whod acquitted himself well and who would soon be reaping the rewards of it and then offered to show them a littleused lane that would allow them to detour safely around the city so theyd be miles away by the time theobald began to suspect that his scheme had gone awry but as eleanor started to turn her mare sanzay drew her aside for a roadside colloquy switching from french to their native provencal my lady i confess to some unease about all this how can we be sure the duke of normandy is acting in good faith he might well want to thwart theobald in order to claim you for himself well be entering his territory once we draw near to tours what if this man of his is luring you into a trap he can be trusted you need not fear sanzay was puzzled by her certainty rather than reassured how can you be so confident of that because a man need not take by force what is to be given to him freely saldebreuil it was so dark now that she could no longer see his face but she could hear the changed rhythm of his breathing are you saying what i think you are he asked at last and eleanor laughed yes i amand now you know just how much i trust you dear friend hold your questions though until after weve left bloisand its hungry young countfar behind in the dust by riding all night eleanor and her entourage reached safety at tours the capital of henry fitz empresss province of touraine they arrived at the abbey of st martins in time to attend palm sunday mass and then collapsed gratefully upon the beds provided for them in the monasterys guest quarters the next morning they were on the road again sending out scouts to reconnoiter the terrain ahead theyd left the fine weather of passion week behind at tours the sky was lowering and they were caught in a brief drenching shower before noon they were just a few miles from portdepiles intending to ford the river creuse there when one of their scouts came into view traveling at such a fast gallop that they were alerted even before hed gotten within shouting range geoffrey de rancon and saldebreuil de sanzay spurred their horses out to meet him so did eleanor who was never one for waiting bad news my lady sanzay declared as she drew up alongside them there are men lying in wait at portdepiles and i think we can safely assume that theyre up to no good eleanor mouthed an unladylike oath they have most peculiar courting customs in these parts but her irony was outward camouflage inwardly she seethed outraged that her divorce had of a sudden made her fair game that there were so many men willing to chase her down like a prize doe do you have any idea who this latest suitor might be to her surprise rancon nodded the lad here says it is as maladroit an ambush as hes ever seen so sure are they of taking you unaware at the ford that they did not bother to post any guards themselves he had no trouble getting close enough to look them over and recognized their leader straightaway another young lordling on the prowl and to add insult to injury this cubs but a second son passing strange that the duke of normandy should have done you such a good turn at blois for his brother now seeks to do you an ill one at portdepiles god and his good angels geoffrey fitz empress was all of whatseventeen no nigh on eighteen shed made it a point to learn as much as she could about henrys background and that included his brothers but shed certainly not anticipated meeting one of them in an ambush by the river creuse she shook her head marveling at lifes odd twists and turns this gives a whole new meaning to the saying keeping it in the family rancon looked mystified but sanzay gave a startled snort of laughter you have a wicked tongue my lady he said with a grin damn me if you do not someone else said that too abbot bernard i believe it was drizzling again and eleanor pulled up her hood as the raindrops began to splatter about them in earnest well have to find another crossing does anyone know of one rancon did there is another ford downstream not far from where the creuse and the vienne flow together he laughed suddenly with luck the fitz empress stripling will be waiting out in the rain for the rest of the day id love to see his face when he realizes hes been outwitted what a surprise the lad is in for eleanor winked at sanzay indeed he is she said blandly but you do not know the half of it safe in her own domains eleanor lingered for two days at her uncles castle at chatellerault and on thursday of holy week she was at last approaching the city she most loved perched on a bluff overlooking the river clain the ancient capital of poitoupoitiers the city walls shone in the spring sunlight graceful church spires reaching up toward the heavens and as ever eleanors heart rose at the sight of all the loves of her life her first and last and greatest would always be for this land of her birth aquitaine was in her blood even its air seemed sweeter to her she could see the turrets of her palace now rising up into the sky crowned with clouds and the joy of her homecoming was tempered somewhat by regret for marriage to henry fitz empress might well lead to a throne but it would also lead away from aquitaine coming from the north they crossed the clain at the bridge called pont de rochereuil it was then that they heard the bells pealing out across the city filling the valley with silvery celestial sound eleanor was baffled for by tradition church bells were muted during the final three days before easter when they would ring in the resurrection so why were they chiming now saldebreuil de sanzay was the first to comprehend turning in the saddle he smiled at eleanor the bells are for you my lady he said they are welcoming you home bury st edmunds england april the black monks of st edmunds abbey had gathered for their daily chapter meeting they opened with a prayer to the blessed st edmund whose holy shrine attracted such large and profitable crowds of pilgrims to their monastery after reading aloud a chapter of their benedictine rule they moved on to more secular concerns a discussion of finances the need to find a new tenant for one of the abbeys manors the allocation of weekly duties among the monks when abbot ording stepped up to the lectern his audience expected to hear the familiar words let us now speak of matters of discipline freeing the brothers to come forward and accuse themselvesor one anotherof mistakes misdeeds and occasional sins instead abbot ording said somberly i have news to impart the king and his son the count of boulogne will be arriving on the morrow and they will of course expect us to offer them the hospitality of our abbey a royal visit was never an unmixed blessing for the cost of entertaining a kings entourage could strip an abbeys larders bare especially if the king chose to linger in their midst but the dismay that greeted abbot ordings announcement went well beyond economic anxieties the sad fact was that in this the seventeenth year of stephens reign the english king found himself at war with his own church this latest clash had been the most serious one yet stephen had become convinced that the only way to safeguard the throne for his son was to have eustace crowned in his own lifetime in accordance with continental custom but the archbishop of canterbury refused to cooperate and stephen had at last lost all patience early in the year hed summoned a church council to london and demanded that they agree to anoint eustace then and there the archbishop had again balked but this time his refusal rocked stephens throne to its very foundations for he claimed to be acting under direct orders from the pope who would not recognize eustaces right to an illgotten crown one obtained by perjury never before had the papacy spoken out so boldly against stephens kingship so great was stephens outrage that hed taken a very imprudent action ordering the clerics arrested until archbishop theobald agreed to perform the ceremony but in the confusion the archbishop managed to slip away and once again fled england seeking refuge in flanders stephen soon came to his senses released the clerics and permitted the archbishop to return but the rift had not been mended and as long as stephen remained at loggerheads with his chief primate he would find no warm welcome in the abbeys and priories of his realm the monks of bury st edmunds did their best though to put their grievances aside for the length of the kings stay the guest hall was made immaculate abbot ording turned over his own quarters for stephens comfort and the abbey cook served up a dinner that would have done any king proud baked lamprey eels stewed mutton stuffed capon custard applesauce a spiced chicken broth and hot bread the abbot was grateful that the fare was so appetizing for he took his obligations as a host seriously he could only hope that the pleasures of the meal would compensate for the stilted and desultory nature of the dinner conversation so much was not suitable table talk above all no mention could be made of the nineteenyearold youth who not only held normandy anjou maine and touraine but who now had the blessings of the pope as he cast his eyes toward england abbot ording sighed for so many names would sink like stones in the conversational waters the earl of chester whod dared to defy the crown and gotten away with itso far hugh bigod who was the reason why stephen had gone north in a show of force hopingnot very realistically in the abbots opinionto intimidate bigod into obedience robert beaumont who was ostensibly loyal but rarely at stephens court rainald fitz roy who was rumored to be in normandy at the behest of his fellow barons urging his nephew to invade england as soon as possible roger fitz miles whod recently duped stephen into believing he was contemplating a switch in loyalties when in reality hed merely been trying to lure stephen away from his siege of wallingford castle no the list of safe topics was a short one indeed political talk led invariably to henry fitz empress and discussion of church matters would only remind them all of stephens feud with the archbishop abbot ording sighed again not yet desperate enough to comment upon the mercurial spring weather and then brightened is the bishop of winchester still in rome my liege although even that was a sensitive subject for all knew stephens brother had made the arduous journey to the papal court in a foredoomed attempt to regain some of his dwindling influence with the vatican stephen sopped up gravy with a bread finger smiling at his uncomfortable host no he has departed rome but i do not expect him to be back in england until the autumn for he intends to return by way of spain he has always wanted to see the holy shrine at santiago de compostela that drew a quick response from stephens second son id rather see paris myself or mayhap poitiers the abbot had never met the young earl of surrey before will was like all of stephens children quite goodlooking flaxenhaired and blueeyed he was also one of the wealthiest eighteenyearolds in christendom for three years ago his father had secured for him a great childheiress isabella de warenne whod inherited the earldom of surrey after her father died on crusade he had a winning smile the untested confidence of youth and the brash cockiness so common to the sons of kings laughing immoderately at all his own jokes and interrupting his elders much too freely for the abbots liking but he still made a favorable impression especially among those familiar with eustaces barbed defenses and sudden sarcasms poitiers stephen was smiling quizzically at his son he was as the abbot and much of england well knew the most indulgent of fathers denying his children nothing not only had he bestowed the prestigious abbacy of westminster upon his illegitimate and unqualified son gervaisan appalling appointment in abbot ordings judgmentbut hed even founded a benedictine nunnery in kent so that he could name his young daughter mary as its prioress it occurred to the abbot that his failings as a king had not served him well in fatherhood either for with his sons as with his barons he could not bring himself to disappoint to discipline or to demand the respect due him why poitiers lad he asked curiously and will grinned impishly because of the lady eleanor of course poitiers will be attracting more pilgrims than any shrine in christendom now that she is in the marriage market again stephen laughed but eustace did not if youre looking for a whore he said impatiently you can find any number of sluts right here in bury st edmunds little brother there is no need to go all the way to aquitaine for one the silence that followed was stifling will flushed but he was not as cocky as the abbot first thought for although he glared at his elder brother he held his tongue the abbot was offended as were most of those whod overheard eustace for hed just broken one of their societys unwritten rules whatever men might say among themselves in private a highborn ladys honour was not besmirched in a public setting stephen was no less dismayed than the monks have you forgotten that were dining at gods table he asked testily his first inclination was to insist that eustace apologize to the abbot and his brethren but his son was no errant schoolboy at twentytwo he was a man grown a man who must accept responsibility for his own acts his own words no matter how illconsidered signaling for more wine he regarded his eldest with baffled anger whatever had possessed eustace to defame a woman whod been his own brotherinlaws queen and within hearing of bury st edmundss abbot of all men the abbot was watching eustace too with more objective and therefore more discerning eyes than stephen he was not long in concluding that eustaces affront had been a deliberate provocation well calculated to embarrass his father the most chivalrous of men before an audience of monks but eustaces triumph did not seem to have given him much pleasure his smile was at once defiant brittle and defensive almost as if hed been the one wronged and somewhat to the abbots surprise he found himself feeling a twinge of pity for them both fathers and sons always a gordian knot for certes but how much more troubling when there was a crown caught up in its tangled coils no one seemed to know what to say it was the abbeys hospitaller who finally came to the rescue it is my duty and privilege your grace to meet all the needs of the guests staying within the walls of our abbey may i ask how long you plan to remain with us with an effort stephen forced his eyes away from his son well be staying just one night departing on the morrow adding politely as much as we would enjoy your hospitality my queen and the lady constance are awaiting us at cantebrigge the monks tried to conceal their relief that his visit would be so brief with mixed success but one of the other abbey guests a prosperous wool merchant was looking perplexed after some hesitation he said begging your pardon my liege but i live in cantebrigge i arrived at the abbey last night for i always stay with the good monks on my trips to ipswich and catching himself he gave an abashed smile but that is of no earthly interest to you what i wanted to tell you was that the queen is not in cantebrigge not unless she arrived after i rode out yesterday morn now the perplexity was stephens no she ought to have reached cantebrigge days ago this makes no sense frowning he pushed his food around on his trencher his appetite gone after a few moments he beckoned to a knight at the end of the table everard i want you to ride to cantebrigge as soon as the meal is done and find out if the queen and the countess constance are there or not everard was one of stephens household knights in his service long enough to gauge the urgency of his kings need ill be off as soon as i get my horse saddled he said shoving away from the table with that stephen gave up all pretense of unconcern his eyes raking the hall he found another face he could trust and dispatched the man south to the earl of oxfords castle at hedingham for that was matildas last known stopping place after that the meal broke up the monks and abbey guests scattering to their various pursuits leaving the abbot to do his best to allay the unease of his king but less than an hour had passed in this awkward manner before they heard shouting out in the garth stephen came swiftly to his feet at sight of the man striding into the hall for he should have been miles away by now riding hard for hedingham what in blazes are you doing back so soon guy hedingham is a good twenty miles away and if you expect to reach it by dark sir guy now committed a serious breach of protocol he interrupted his king my liege hear me out i encountered a messenger on the road one of the earl of oxfords men he was on his way here seeking you a second man had followed sir guy into the hall coming forward he knelt before stephen my lord king i am sir robert fitz henry i serve the earl of oxford am here at his bidding a few days after her arrival at hedingham your lady queen took sick she refused to let us send for you insisting shed not have you worried for naught but she took a turn for the worse and last night she asked for you and for he bit back the words so hastily that he seemed to have swallowed them only making his omission all the more conspicuous stephen frowned who else did she want our daughter mary yes my liege but she also asked us to send to holy trinity priory for again his words trailed off for he could see that stephen still did not understand he paused then looked away so hed not have to watch as stephen finally realized what he was so reluctant to say she asked he said for her confessor matilda had always envisioned time as a river flowing forward inexorably into the future forcing people to keep up with the current as best they could no more though time had become tidal lying in the shuttered dark of an unfamiliar bedchamber she could feel it receding toward the horizon leaving her stranded upon the shore as a little girl in boulogne shed often walked along the beach throwing back the starfish trapped by the ebbing tide now forty years later when it was her turn to be marooned by the retreating waves there was no one to save her as shed saved the starfish but she did not mourn for herself dying was not so terrible for all that people feared it so she was in gods hands a feather floating on the wind waiting to see if he would call her home if only stephen understood that if only he would not grieve so hed not left her bedside for days pleading with her to hold on to hope to fight off death not comprehending that death was not always the enemy she was so tired so very tired for too long shed been ailing in body and spirit struggling to keep her malaise secret from stephen so much bloodshed so many graves so many widows and orphans and all for what a tarnished crown that had brought them both more pain than pleasure but he could not relinquish it must keep on fighting to hold on to itfor eustace for the son she loved who ought never to be entrusted with a kings sovereign powers the chamber was dimmed for the candles had begun to hurt her eyes stephen was clutching her hand lacing her limp fingers through his his grip so tight that her wedding ring was pinching her flesh constance was weeping again crumpled in the window seat matilda ached for her the daughter by marriage whod become as dear as her daughters by birth will was swiping at his face with his sleeve her fledgling her secret favorite and eustacehalf hidden in the shadows ashamed to let anyoneeven his stricken familysee his tears at sound of a womans step her lashes fluttered but it was cecily again stephen kept insisting that mary was on her way likely to arrive at any moment and shed clung to his assurances with all the forgiveness and faith of the love shed so long ago pledged to him but this was to be one promise he could not keep mary would be too late stephen not even a whisper in her own ears but he somehow heard her and leaned over vivid blue eyes of their lost youth awash now in tears look after constance but who would look after him surely the almighty would for even his worst mistakes were well intentioned did this tooclever son of maudes have such a good heart nogod would judge what mattered most stephen was kissing her hand pressing it against his wet cheek his beard was grizzled with silver like an early frost how old he seemed of a sudden she wanted to tell him one last time that she loved him to promise that shed be waiting for him at heavens gate but she could not catch her breath she closed her eyes and when she opened them again the room was filling with light she could hear sobbing but it seemed to be coming from a great distance it grew more and more faint until at last she could not hear it at all matilda died on saturday may rd in her fortyseventh year her body was taken with royal ceremony to faversham kent and buried before the high altar in the church of st saviours the cluniac abbey she and stephen had founded four brief years before the church was very quiet cupping his candle the young monk slipped around the roodscreen into the choir the white marble of the queens sepulchre glimmered in the shadows as he drew near he saw that someone had laid a yellow primrose upon the tomb he was not surprised by the floral offering for all at st saviours were in mourning for their queen shed spent as much time as she could spare at the abbey finding within its cloistered walls the peace that was so elusive in the rest of her husbands realm shed been extremely generous with the monks and they in turn had given her their wholehearted devotion brother leonard knew that he was not the only one of his brethren whod loved the queen the funeral had been over for hours but there had been too much pain in this church for it to have faded away so soon it seemed to echo in the stillness the way the smell of smoke lingered even after a fire had been doused brother leonard knew he was being fanciful but he could not help himself the faces of the queens loved ones still haunted him for never had he seen a family so desolated so overwhelmed by their loss the king had done all that was expected of him accepting condolences keeping watch over his daughterinlaw and stunned daughter but his eyes were glazed his shoulders bowed hed buried his heart with his wife and all who looked upon him knew it the queens younger son had wept openly throughout the service as had his warenne childwife and most of the mourners the lady constance had almost fainted as they first entered the church and although shed insisted upon remaining there were times when stephens encircling arm seemed all that was keeping her on her feet brother leonard gently fingered the stem of the primrose wishing hed thought to bring flowers too hed remedy that on the morrow the primrose was freshly plucked for it had not yet begun to wilt despite his best intentions he found himself thinking of another flower the lady mary never had he seen a prioress who looked remotely like mary she was just shy of sixteen and under other circumstances the dramatic benedictine black of her habit would have set off her fairness to perfection but on the day of her mothers funeral she was a lost waif berating herself to anyone whod listen for not getting to hedingham castle in time to bid her mother farewell it shamed brother leonard that hed been most affected by marys grieving for he feared that his sympathy was suspect unduly influenced by her youth and beauty the queen had often teased him that his conscience was too tender remembering that now his eyes blurred with sudden tears what would she say if shed known hed cast admiring glances at her nun daughter most likely shed have understood for hed never known anyone as forgivingas good how could she and the king have ever bred a son like the count of boulogne and yetand yet hed found himself pitying eustace too at the funeral standing apart from the others keeping his face averted so none could notice his swollen redrimmed eyes hed looked so reclusive in his grief so utterly alone that brother leonard could not help hurting for him he was all too familiar with the queens temperamental son for twice eustace had come to faversham at his mothers behest but never before had he noticed how solitary eustace seemed he could recognize loneliness easier than most for much of his life hed been an outsider never having a sense of belonging until fate and the queen had brought him to faversham at first it seemed foolish indeed to compare himselfan outcast orphan of low birthwith the king of englands son and heir and eustace had soon forfeited his sympathy by turning upon his weeping wife rebuking her for making a spectacle of her grief but when he thought about the funeral later it was eustaces isolation that the monk would remember his inability to end his selfimposed exile even on the day of his mothers funeral letting the flower drop back onto the tomb brother leonard said softly ah my lady how will we ever learn to abide your loss crossing to the high altar he knelt and began to pray for matildas soul although he was confident that if ever there was one judged worthy of passing straight through purgatory into heaven it would be the queen he was still on his knees when he heard the voices in the nave do you wish me to go with you my lord no id have you await me out here brother leonard scrambled to his feet for hed recognized the second voice a low guttural growl that still evoked distinctive echoes of his native flanders he heard the tapping now of a cane against the tiles and was tempted to duck out before william de ypres became aware of his presence but he hesitated too long the cane halted its sweep and the fleming said challengingly who is there it is me my lordone of the monks although ypres had always treated him with a gruff offhand courtesy brother leonard was never fully at ease in his company the fleming had been the queens closest ally between them theyd managed to keep stephen and the archbishop of canterbury from a final and irrevocable split patching up one peace after another as the need arose but brother leonard was not ignorant of ypress lurid past monks liked to gossip too and hed heard all the stories knew that until ypres had begun to lose his sight hed been one of the kings most brilliant and brutal mercenary captains reason told him that the man was no longer dangerous for he was in his sixties an age as vast as methuselahs to the twentyyearold monk and he was utterly blind in one eye going blind in the other but whenever he gazed into those oddly opaque eyes brother leonard felt as if he were looking at an aged wolf fangs worn down but by no means harmless brotherleonard is it not yes my lord it is surprised and rather flattered that the fleming remembered him so readily he gestured toward the queens tomb i was saying a prayer for my lady ii owed her so much i was hired to help out in the infirmary and when the queen learned of my desire to serve god she persuaded abbot clarembald to accept me as a novice even though i was of humble birth and without two coins to rub together and when it was time for me to take my vows she came down from london to bear witness she did all that for me he said wonderingly and got nothing in return but as long as i have breath shell have my prayers youre wrong lad it gave her great pleasure that shed been able to guide you onto the road to heaven as she liked to say ypress smile was both wry and weary she talked of you often you and all her other lost lambs without warning tears flooded the young monks eyes i know it is not for a poor wretch like me to question the ways of almighty god butbut why did he have to take her now when we still needed her so much the fleming reached out resting the palm of his hand against the cold unyielding marble of matildas tomb if you truly loved her lad he said be grateful that he did take her now poitiers poitou may petronilla found eleanor up on the battlements of the palace keep the sky was streaking and the rivers clain and boivre curved around the city like flowing ribbons of gold but the light had yet to fade following eleanors gaze toward the north petronilla saw what had drawn her eyes a small band of fastriding horsemen leaving a trail of dust in their wake as they approached the pont de rochereuil eleanoryou think that is harry eleanor nodded he said hed be arriving on whitsunday eve late in the day between vespers and compline yes but surely hed have a more impressive escort than that jesu forfend eleanor said emphatically the last thing we want is to attract attention ere were safely wed he said hed bring just enough men to fend off robbers traveling as inconspicuously as possible she kept her eyes intently upon those distant riders who were now passing the abbey of st jean de montierneuf although i doubt that hed have brought a large retinue in any event he does not seem to care much for pomp and ceremony a son of the empress maude if that is so he must be a changeling when eleanor failed even to acknowledge the jest petronilla subjected her sister to a closer scrutiny eleanorare you having misgivings not about the man petra but the marriageyes a few misgivings petronilla was not taken totally by surprise for shed noticed that eleanor had become more and more preoccupied and pensive as her wedding day drew near why eleanor was quiet for a few moments i suppose she said because of the past two months two months in which i was accountable to no man for what i did or what i wanted ive never had freedom like that before and i found it a sweet taste indeed but what good is freedom without security eleanor you need a man to protect aquitaine from the french crown and to protect you from those hordes of wouldbe husbands eager to share your domains with you whether you willed it or not you need not fret petra i am not about to leave harry at the altar you are righti do need a man for the very practical reasons youve just argued and for reasons you did not mention i want more children i want a man in my bed again one who has more in mind than prayer and i want a crown ill not deny it all of which ive a good chance of getting from harry sure now that it was indeed her future husband who was entering her city eleanor moved away from the battlements for she wanted to be below in the great hall to greet him upon his arrival i just wish she said with a skepticism that held an oddly wistful note too that the balance of power in a marriage was not tilted so much in the mans favor henry could not seem to get comfortable in the bed for the tenth time he repositioned his pillow when he flung the sheets back he soon felt chilled but when he drew the covers up he was too hot by his increasingly exasperated reckoning it was well past midnight this sleepless night before his wedding was shaping up to be the longest one of his entire life in less than twelve hours he and eleanor were to be wed in the cathedral of st pierre shed made all the arrangements leaving him nothing to do but show up he could see the sense in it for poitiers was her capital city he just wasnt accustomed to being a bystander marching to a drumbeat not his own their wedding was to be a simple affair not at all the sort of lavish royal spectacle that would normally have attended the marriage of a duke of normandy and a duchess of aquitaine a onetime queen and a wouldbe king henry remembered hearing that when eleanor and the french king wed the revelries had lasted for three full days but for them there would be nothing so extravagant or elaborate just a wedding supper after the church ceremony for had they invited all their vassals to celebrate their wedding as would be customary theyd have risked having their nuptials interrupted by an invading french army henry hoped that eleanor did not feel cheated mayhap one royal wedding in a womans lifetime was enough for her for himself he did not care hed always been more interested in where he was going than in how he got there and even if hed been one to enjoy such prolonged and highflown festivities not here not now not in this company for certes eleanor had summoned a few of her most eminent vassals to bear witness to her wedding those men too devoted or too proud to learn of her marriage afterthefact geoffrey de rancon lord of taillebourg saldebreuil de sanzay formerly eleanors constable newly named as her seneschal the lords of lusignan and thourars the count of angouleme theyd not liked eleanors first marriage to the french king and it soon became obvious to henry that they were not enthusiastic about her second match either their courtesy was cold enough to threaten frostbite and they watched him as warily as sheepdogs protecting their flocks from a marauding angevin wolf henry was surprised neither by their suspicions nor by their audacity for these southern barons were known for their recalcitrance and prickly independence while they were celebrated for their generosity and humor and joyful zest for life their conviction that aquitaine was eden and they gods chosen people had given them a sense of moral superiority that their neighbors often found intolerable it had been geoffreys acerbic opinion that the aquitanians were an ungovernable lot ready to rebel at any pretext not in the least awed by authority as quick to quarrel as they were to laugh how much of his fathers caustic appraisal was true henry had yet to judge he did not doubt though that eleanors vassals would gladly give him as much grief as theyd given louisif he let them but if hed anticipated some initial resistance from eleanors barons hed not expected trouble from her family in addition to her sister shed invited her maternal uncles hugh de chatellerault and raoul de faye and her illegitimate halfbrothers william and joscelin and from them hed gotten something hed never encountered before and was utterly unprepared forcondescension shoving his pillow back against the headboard henry found himself remembering a story ranulf had once told of a man supposedly shot by his own arrow when it ricocheted off a tree he hadnt believed it thenor nowbut he did feel as if his surprise for eleanor had somehow rebounded upon him too thinking that his bride would surely be pleased to discover on her wedding night that he could speak her native tongue hed made an effort to learn the dialect of the south known as langue doc or provencal as hed always had a good ear for languages hed soon picked up enough to impress eleanorand also to understand the smug conversational currents flowing around him unlike her barons eleanors kin had welcomed him with expansive goodwillto his face but behind his back they laughed and jested in their own tongue always at his expense they joked about his inferior bloodlines debating which was worse having an angevin sire or a normanscots dam they boasted to henry that eleanor was descended from charlemagne and then snickered to one another about the demon countess of anjou the devils daughter they lavished compliments upon henry and then mocked his short hair calling him a shorn sheep for all men of fashion wore theirs shoulderlength henry was able to shrug off their supercilious comments about his heritage reasoning that if theyd not thought the king of france good enough for eleanor it was only to be expected that hed fall short too and as he cared nothing for fashion he could not be wounded by disapproval of that sort but it stung his pride to be treated like a raw green lad it had never occurred to him that eleanors family might see their clandestine courtship as a hunt their wedding as the kill and eleanor as the hunter he the quarry did these dolts truly think that nineteen was so young that their age difference gave eleanor such an advantage did eleanor and that was the real reason why he lay awake and restless hours after going to bed eleanor not her unruly barons not even her vexing relatives eleanor shed welcomed him as if he were the most honoured of guests gracious and obliging concerned for his comfort hed caught her in no indiscretions no lapses in langue doc shed been the ideal hostess poised and polished as regal in bearing as if that lovely dark head were still adorned with a crown but as much as he admired her social graces he looked in vain for the woman he would wed the teasing temptress in that raindrenched paris garden was gone eclipsed by the duchess of aquitaine worldly and desirable and distant he supposed he could not blame her if she was suffering a few eleventhhour qualms watching her entertain him with such impersonal perfection hed found himself thinking of an old adage a burnt child dreads the fire after fourteen years with st louis most of them miserable was it any wonder that she might be skittish of marriage who would understand that better than he for much of his life hed been an unwilling eyewitness to the carnagestrewn battlefield that was his parents marriage hostage to their embittered and irreconcilable demands hed found it easy enough to reassure himself that if eleanor was indeed having some doubts it was only to be expected but if he was so sure of that why was he unable to sleep he refused to believe he might be nervous the one and only time hed ever experienced anxiety over bedsport was before his first sexual encounter at age fourteen hed never expected to feel such unease again but hed never lain with a woman as seductive and highborn and daunting as eleanor his bedmates had been numerous for he rarely slept alone but they were usually bedazzled village girls or highpaid harlots never a queen one of the greatest beauties in christendom hed sometimes felt sorry for women as they seemed to have a much harder row to hoe than men what man could be more strongwilled or daring than his mother a kings daughter an empress a wouldbe queen in her own right shed still been expected to obey his father and had lost every major battle of their marital wars it was not that henry thought women should be given an equal say in the matters of men he could not imagine anyone making an argument that preposterous he could not help sympathizing with their plight nonetheless for he could envision few fates worse than to be utterly powerless but as he tossed and turned in one of eleanors guest bedchambers he discovered that women were not as powerless as hed often thought eleanors weapon might be a smile instead of a sword but she could wreak her own sort of havoc for certes how else explain why he was still lying awake in the early hours of this his wedding day henry and eleanor were married that whitsunday afternoon out in the spring sunlight by the door of the cathedral church of st pierre the churchyard was thronged with excited jostling spectators for word had soon spread through the city and people turned out in large numbers to watch their lady wed standing before the bishop of poitiers henry had eyes only for his bride eleanors wedding gown was formfitting to the hips with a swirling full skirt and train sleeves tight to the elbow and then billowing out in graceful hanging cuffs the material was a richly woven silk brocade a deep dusky shade of gold her hair was plaited into two long braids entwined with goldthread ribbons her veil as light as sunlight and almost as transparent held in place by a gleaming coronet she wore his bridegift on her right hand an emerald ring of beaten gold the jewel had reminded him of her eyes but today her hazel irises reflected the color of her gown taking on a tawny amber glow cats eyes he thought giving away no secrets and slipped the wedding band onto each of her fingers in turn before sliding it down onto the third finger of her left hand the one judged closest to the heart having promised before man and god to cleave unto this beautiful stranger from this day forth till death us do part he said with this ring i thee wed and as a loud burst of cheering rocked the churchyard he could only hope that this was indeed well done upon their return to eleanors palace henry was not pleased to find that the trestle tables had not yet been set up in the great hall it seemed there was to be dancing before the meal began since there would also be entertainment afterward this meant that the festivities would last till well past dark he wanted nothing so much as to be alone with eleanor to discover again the woman whod bewitched him in the royal gardens of the cite palace but that would be hours away till then he would have to curb his impatience politely put up with her barons and family as best he could he did try he would latermuch laterinsist to eleanor that hed acted in good faith striving to play the part expected of him that of the eager joyful bridegroom eager he was without doubt joyfulno he was too tense too irritated by his new inlaws for genuine joy but he would have been able to give a reasonably convincing performanceif only hed not understood langue doc in his boyhood one of his favorite stories was of a young man who found a magical cloak one that rendered him invisible whenever he wore it henry had been fascinated by the folktale but hed never realized that such a power might be a twoedged sword hearing what was not meant for his ears was not a pleasurable experience the jokes were ribald and forthright in french but far more offensive in provencal normally hed have taken the teasing in stride for that was every bridegrooms lot but his sense of humor seemed to have decamped in the night he could deflect the bawdy jokes aimed at him he was not easily embarrassed but the private jesting by eleanors brothers and uncles could not be laughed off for their mockery was premised upon a highly insulting assumptionthat eleanor would soon have him jumping through hoops and begging for favors like a ladys spaniel lapdog he danced several carols with eleanor chatted amiably with petronilla the only member of his wifes family he could abide and listened with feigned enthusiasm to a song by the troubadour and poet bernard de ventadour one too lavish in praise of eleanors beauty for his liking bored and tired and increasingly restive he found it helped to fortify himself with the freeflowing wine although he was usually a very sparing drinker accepting his third cup of spiced hippocras he traded thinly veiled barbs with geoffrey de rancon hed not met rancon before poitiers but the man was known to him hed heard the sorry saga of rancons deadly blunder on the march toward jerusalem one that had caused the deaths of countless crusaders rancon had been ordered by the french king to halt at the summit of mount cadmos but hed chosen to disregard louiss instructions and led the vanguard onward in search of a better campsite the king riding in the rear was unaware of this and allowed the rearward to lag behind thinking they would soon be upon rancons encampment when the watching turks swooped down upon them the french panicked and the rugged mountain terrain was soon soaked in christian blood the king himself had narrowly escaped death and although eleanor remained steadfastly loyal to her beleaguered vassal geoffrey de rancon had been sent home in disgrace henry was not well disposed toward any man so cavalier about disobeying a royal command convinced that inevitably led to anarchy to stephens england excusing himself as soon as he could he was turning to look for eleanor when he heard her brothers laughing behind him there he goes on her scent again id wager that in no time at all shell have the lad heeling and going down on command without even needing a leash well early training works wonders with greyhound pups fledgling hawks and yearling colts will so why not with young husbands it is just a matter of using the right bait under other circumstances henry might have reacted with indifference or annoyance depending upon his mood now he swung around with an oath his temper flaring up so fast that he had no chance at all of quenching it anger longsmoldering took only seconds to become a conflagration eleanor had been slow to realize that something was troubling her new husband distracted in part by her obligations as hostess and in part by her own edginess about the marriage nor did she find it easy to read henry he was not like louis whose face was a faithful mirror for his every thought noharry was going to be more of a challenge she was sure hed give away clues all men did but it might take her a while to learn to recognize them it was not until their return from the church that shed begun to sense something was amiss shed noticed at breakfast that henry looked as if hed slept poorly but shed taken his wakefulness as a compliment watching him as they danced though shed concluded that he was not enjoying himself she would have to make sure that the festivities did not drag on too long she did not know yet how shed manage that but shed find a way this marriage had to succeed there was too much at stake declining an offer to join in the circle forming for the next carol she beckoned to her sister have you seen harry over there with will and joscelin one glance was enough to alert eleanor to trouble henrys back was to her but her brothers looked as if theyd been caught bloodyhanded over a dead body she headed toward them but henry was already stalking away wait she cried out before her brothers could bolt the pair of you look guiltier than horse thieves what happened they exchanged uncomfortable looks will shook his head almost imperceptibly but joscelin refused to take the hint we have to tell her will he insisted better she hears it from us eleanor did not like the sound of that at all for the love of god jos just say it straight out eleanorhe understands langue doc oh no eleanor stared at them in dismay if harry had heard even half of the jokes floating around the hallwhat did you say jos will will shrugged refusing to meet her eyes looking shamefaced joscelin mumbled we were jesting he ought to have let us know he spoke our tongue squirming under his sisters accusing eyes he glanced toward will for help got none and sighed wewell we joked that hed soon be following you about like one of your greyhounds or words to that effect eleanor was not mollified realizing shed just been given a cleanedup version of what henry had overheard ive never had a taste for watereddown wine jos she warned how can i make amends unless i know just how grievously you offended him try the truth this time but at that moment there was a stir throughout the hall the musicians had stopped in the midst of the carol the dancers halted in puzzlement the musicians looking apologetically in eleanors direction she knew they would not have ceased playing so abruptly unless ordered to do so and there were just two people present with the authority to give such a command gathering up her skirts she started hastily toward her husband but she was too late henry was already mounting the steps of the dais standing alone upon the dais henry soon attracted attention he waited though until all eyes were upon him the dancing will resume in a few moments he said and startled murmurs rippled across the hall for hed spoken in their tongue having made his point he switched then to french for he understood provencal better than he spoke it my lady duchess and i would like to thank you for celebrating our wedding with us we hope that you enjoy yourselves during the dancing and the feasting to follow but i prefer to have a private wedding supper with my beautiful wife judging from what ive been hearing in this hall i am quite sure that you will understand never had henry seen a crowd fall silent so fast it was suddenly and utterly still from his vantage point upon the dais he could see shocked faces abashed and uneasy looks as people tried to recall whether theyd compromised themselves in his hearing he was depriving the guests of the favorite part of any wedding celebration the boisterous beddingdown revelries but there were no protests no objections his last statement had been a threat sheathed but with a sharp blade withal as he had said they understood perfectly by now hed located eleanor standing a few feet away she was looking up at him in astonishment eyes wide lips parted at a rare loss for words before she could recover from her surprise he came swiftly down the dais steps holding out his hand she took it and the guests moved aside to let them pass the spell held not until theyd exited the hall did bedlam break out behind them henrys anger had been too hot not to have soon burned itself out it was already cooling by the time he stepped from the dais and now he found himself surrounded by charred embers and ashes wondering how such a brief fire could have done so much damage eleanor was walking sedately at his side her fingers still linked in his deceptively docile but she was no more submissive a wife than his mother had been and while he was grateful for her public compliance he was not deceived by it hed dragged her away from her own wedding feast and even if hed not said so plain out not a soul in the hall doubted his intentthat he was not willing to wait any longer to take his wife to bed if geoffrey had done that to his mother maude would have been mortifiedand shed never have forgiven him not in this life or the next that henry knew with a chilling certainty what sort of a start had he gotten their marriage off to by the time theyd reached the stairwell leading up to their wedding chamber in the maubergeon tower hed faced a hard truth at the very least he owed her an apology and if that was not enough for her hed have to abase himself if need be no matter how painful that was to his pride for her grievance was a just one a smoking rushlight in an overhead wall sconce dispersed some of the darkness in the stairwell eleanor stumbled over her trailing skirts and when henry reached out to steady her she said suddenly i still cannot believe you truly did that he stiffened then turned to face her i know you must be angry eleanor but he got no further with a rustle of silk and an elusive scent of unnamed exotic flowers she was beside him on the stair her arms going up around his neck why ever should i be angry you did enliven the festivities for certes gave our guests enough to talk about for days to come and showed my barons that youre a man who knows what he wantsand when he wants it by god her laugh was low her amusement too genuine to doubt but henry could not quite believe his luck you truly are not wroth with me whilst i had good cause for my anger i never meant to shame you that i swear upon the surety of my soul harryit does not shame a woman that her husband wants her it only shames her if he does not i do want you he said with a shaken laugh you have no idea how much when she smiled he kissed her this was not the chaste kiss of peace theyd exchanged in the cathedral it was one to fire the blood and bring men to ruin no matter how close he held her it was not close enough her breath was hot against his ear her fingers entwined in his hair she tasted of wine and temptation her kisses as hungry as his own and he forgot time and place and the world beyond her embrace aware only of this moment and the woman in his arms and the need to make her his it was the sound of rending silk that brought eleanor back to reality harryharry wait she gasped let me catch my breath his own breath was coming in short uneven bursts too as he drew back his shoe struck something metallic bending down he retrieved her coronet and they both laughed for neither one could remember when it had been discarded whenever i thought about our wedding night he said i never saw myself ravishing you in a stairwell well then she said lets find ourselves a bed they continued climbing the stairs pausing every few steps to kiss again when they finally reached the door henry said wait lets do this right and before she realized what he was about he caught her up into his arms carried her over the threshold and across the chamber to their marriage bed given the urgency hed shown in the stairwell eleanor expected him to join her at once in the bed to her surprise he moved away you are not going to quench the candles are you she asked hoping he was not louis had always insisted upon making love in the dark jesu no he gave her a startled smile over his shoulder who wants to fumble around in the dark i suppose that works well enough for bats but not for me fortunately eleanors servants had already made the chamber ready for them wood was stacked in the hearth to be fired if need be the floor was strewn with fresh rushes intermingled with fragrant herbs like sweet woodruff and costmary knowing how she loved flowers colette and yolande had filled the room with bouquets of periwinkle and violets and even a few earlyblooming white roses a flagon of wine and two gemencrusted goblets had been set out upon the table and after he slid the doors bolt into place henry poured wine into one of the goblets and carried it back to the bed to our union he said holding out the cup she saluted his wordplay with a smile took a sip and passed the cup back he sat beside her upon the bed and they took turns drinking watching each other avidly all the while eleanor was pleased that he no longer seemed in such a hurry reassured that he could exercise this sort of selfcontrol would he be as good a lover as his passion promised so much she did not know about him so much they both had to discover but what shed learned so far she likedvery much indeed handing henry the goblet she began to unbraid her hair once her hair was free she shook her head until it drifted about her shoulders in a dark glossy cloud making her look even more desirable and wanton than in henrys most erotic dreams the first time i saw you there in your husbands hall ere half the french court id have bartered my soul to have you here like this in my bed you can keep your soul she assured him reclining back against the pillows in a pose that was both playful and provocative ill settle for your body my lord husband henry laughed and when she started to unlace her gown he caught her hand in his no he said let me eleanor lifted her hair up out of the way and he soon had the laces loosened so deftly done that she knew hed had some practice at this her gown had gotten a small tear in that frenzied embrace out in the stairwell and it tore still further as he drew it over her head but he offered no apology for he was learning what mattered to her and what did not her chemise was of silk too ivorywhite and as soft as her skin her shoes were a patterned spanish leather slit over her instep and fastened with an ankle thong her stockings gartered above the knee with beribboned scarlet ties watching him through her lashes as he slid a stocking down her leg she murmured now i know what a birthday present feels like as it is being unwrapped some gifts are worth taking time and trouble with leaning forward he kissed her again and then slowly and deliberately removed her last garment as the chemise fluttered down to the floor his breath quickened helen of troy must have looked like you he said and she laughed softly that is a pretty compliment she said and i like it well i like even better what i see in your eyes weve waited a long time for this night harry but there is no need to wait any longer he was in full agreement with her already jerking at his belt as he started to strip off his tunic she reached over to help him saying my turn next time love i can do it much faster this he proceeded to prove as tunic and shirt went sailing across the room his chausses were short reaching to the knee and quickly disposed of that left only the linen braies and as he slid them down over his hips he grinned saying this you can help with love marveling at how very different were the men shed married eleanor did eleanor was realistic enough to be aware that their first lovemaking might be less than perfect they might well need time for their bodies to become attuned to discover what pleased each other to trust enough to let down their defenses as drawn as she was to henry she had no way of knowing what sort of lover he would be not until they were in bed together on their wedding night and if shed misjudged him by then it would be too late she was sure hed need no coaxing for he was young and hotblooded but he might still prove to be a selfish lover one intent only upon his own pleasures or too quick too eager spilling his seed too soon because she found that such a troubling prospect shed labored to rein in her expectations reminding herself that a weddingnight disappointment did not mean marital disaster they could adapt they could learn he was not like louis she soon discovered that she need not have worried making love with her new husband was as natural and easy as breathing as satisfying and sensual an experience as she could ever have hoped for there was not much tenderness in this initial coupling they were both too aroused for that what happened between them was impassioned intense and whitehot like falling into a fire and somehow emerging unscathed that was eleanors first coherent thought afterward she lay very still loath to let henry go even though he was no longer supporting his weight with his elbows having collapsed on top of her as he reached his climax she could hear the hammering of his heart feel sweat trickling down between their bodies it was not particularly comfortable but she would have been content to stay like that for some time to come when he finally lifted himself up she felt bereft as he withdrew and protested no not yet i must be squashing you he insisted rolling over onto his back his voice was normally hoarse and lowpitched but now it had taken on a husky rasp his words coming out slow and scratchy turning his head on the pillow so he could look at her he said good god woman eleanor smiled without opening her eyes well put she agreed and after a few more moments he groped for her hand kissing her palm forget what i told you in paris he said i would have married you without aquitaine you are a gallant liar she said and he laughed he seemed to be reviving faster than she was leaning over he kissed the corner of her mouth then reached down to recover their wine cup from the floor rushes finding it empty he swung off the bed for a refill pausing to snatch up a towel along the way back in bed he shared both with eleanor trading sips as he patted her dry and then rubbed himself far more vigorously eleanor stretched lithely propping their pillows behind her back it seems ungracious to complain after you just gave me the most memorable wedding night any woman ever had she said but you also abducted me from our wedding supper ere i could get even a crust of bread ive never yet let a hostage of mine starve rising from the bed again he strode over to ring for a servant eleanor enjoyed watching him for he was so comfortable in his nakedness so utterly unselfconscious so unlike louis she wondered how long it would be ere she stopped comparing them how long ere louiss spectre faded into insignificance she did not think harry would leave room in his marriage for any other man even a memory a servant soon came in response to the summons and henry opened the door just wide enough to order supper the chamber was strewn with their discarded clothing and as he started back to the bed she asked do you think we ought to pick up our clothes ere they bring in the food he glanced about at the telltale disarray then shrugged why this is our wedding night i doubt that anyone thinks were playing chess up here to pass the time but he was still pondering her query and as he got back into bed with her he gave her a curious speculative look was louis one for setting up the chessboard in a manner of speaking she conceded it is only natural that people should have been so interested in what happenedor notin our marriage bed he was the king after all but that scrutiny always made him uncomfortable he would never have allowed servants to enter our room had it looked like this one does as if wed undressed in a mad race for the bed that sounds like a race well worth running he joked given what is waiting at the finish line he had an exceptional memory as eleanor now discovered and always in the dark too she nodded somewhat reluctantly for she did not really want to discuss her first husband with her second not only did it seem a gratuitous cruelty to louis but she could not abide the thought that harry might pity her a queen of france whod been forced to live almost as chastely as a nun i cannot believe you remembered my query about the candles i think you may be too quick for my own good not when it truly counts he promised and eleanor rolled over into his arms relishing another pleasure that had been scarce in her first marriagethe sweet sin of laughing together in bed eleanor had never had a meal like this one eaten in bed a table pulled within reach so they could help themselves for neither she nor henry wanted servants hovering about henry preferred to do the honours himself lifting the chafing dishes to offer her a spiced meatball a taste of savory rice a few spoonfulls of pea soup your cooks must think i have a harem hidden away up here he said for theyve sent enough to feed a dozen hungry souls do you want some more of the roast pheasant nowhat are those dishes off to your right henry lifted the lids this looks like lamprey eels in some sort of sauce and this one has beefmarrow tarts when she selected the latter he passed it to her on a napkin sowhere were we ah yes you were telling me that your father once clashed with abbot bernard too eleanor nodded he was not as stalwart as geoffrey though she said regretfully for when abbot bernard confronted him with the host he went pale as death and toppled over like a felled tree a pity henry said succinctly and eleanor smiled fondly at him for she found his skepticism a pleasant contrast indeed to louiss absolute certainty that bernard was a living saint i think it bodes well for our marriage she teased that we seem to dislike all the same people leaning over she fed him the last of her marrow tart when shall i get to meet your mother harry id not be in such a hurry if i were you he said wryly most people find my mother to be a very formidable lady indeed it will be fascinatingin a scary sort of wayto watch the two of you take each others measure but that is not likely to come about in the near future remember what i told you last nightthat my english allies are growing impatient they insist they need me in england and cannot comprehend why ive kept finding excuses to put off the invasion i just hope they understand why i could not risk telling them about our marriage plans but i promised my uncle rainald that id be at barfleur in a fortnight and wed start gathering a fleet eleanor was momentarily taken aback for shed expected that theyd have more than a fortnight together but she could hardly complain for it was not as if he were going off on a pleasure jaunt do you want me to go with you to barfleur henry was delighted with her matteroffact response how many men were lucky enough to have a wife with such political acumen and as seductive as eve in the bargain i would love to have you with me at barfleur he said but i need you more here in poitiers i can rely upon my mother to keep watch over normandy whilst i am in england i want you to make sure that aquitaine stays calm too eleanor or as calm as it ever gets i will she said and he kissed her gratefully then selected a gingerfilled wafer for them to share what about your mother do you remember her eleanor truthfully not a lot aenor she was called did you know that is what my name means the other aenor i was eight when she died but i have few vivid memories of her for she was not like your mother harry not a woman to be reckoned with she was softspoken not one for drawing attention to herself i do not think she was ever happy with my father nor he with her they were coerced into the marriage by my grandfather and her mother and i can understand why they were loath to wed it had created enough of a scandal when my grandfather carried off the wife of one of his own vassals but then to marry his son to that womans daughteryou can well imagine the gossip that stirred up henry sat up so abruptly that he almost spilled his wine did i hear you right your grandfather was having a tryst with aenors mother not just a tryst harry a notorious dalliance the lady who had the remarkably apt name of dangereuse was wed to a neighboring lord the viscount of chatellerault my grandfather always did have a roving eye and he never seemed to see marriage as much of a hindrancehis or anyone elses i assume he already had a wife when he stole the viscounts by then he was working on his second marriage his first wife was a kinswoman of yours harry ermengarde your fathers greataunt fortunately for us that marriage fell apart ere they had any children my grandfather took as his next wife the longsuffering lady philippa heiress to toulouse she gave him two sons and five daughters but their marriage was no happier than his first as he put it he loved women too much to confine himself to just one but dangereuse was different not a passing fancy more like a grand passion philippa had put up with his straying as best she could but his infatuation with dangereuse could not be ignored for after he wooed her away from her husband he brought her right under his roof settled her here in the maubergeon tower that was too much for philippa and who can blame her when my grandfather refused to send dangereuse away philippa left him she retired to fontevrault abbey whereas unlikely as it seemsshe became good friends with grandpa wills first wife ermengarde who dwelt at the nunnery whenever the whim took her imagine the conversations they must have had on those long winter nights im still mulling over the fact that your grandfather was having an affair with his sons motherinlaw henry said with a grin it is not as if i come from a line of monks myself my own grandfather could have populated england with all his byblows but i have to admit that this grandfather of yours seems to have had a truly spectacular talent for sinning what did the church say about these scandalous goingson oh he was often at odds with the church but it never bothered him unduly in truth harry nothing did he liked to scandalize and shock people but there was no real malice in him as you may have guessed i adored him most people did for he had more charm than the law should allow he did treat my grandmother rather badlyone of them anyway but i was too young to understand that and by the time i did he was long dead what i remember most is his laughter and i suspect that is what truly vexed his enemies that he got so much fun out of life he could find a joke in the most dire circumstances as his songs attest that shocked people too that a man so highborn would write troubadour poetry but he enjoyed it and so what else mattered henry brushed back her hair tell me more he urged and she shivered with pleasure as he kissed the hollow of her throat wellgrandpapa will painted an image of dangereuse on his shield saying he wanted to bear her in battle just as shed so often borne him in bed he liked to joke that one day hed establish his own nunneryand fill it with ladies of easy virtue and when he was rebuked for not praying as often as he ought he composed a poem o lord let me live long enough to get my hands under her cloak henry gave a sputter of laughter between the two of us weve got a family tree rooted in hell once abbot bernard learns of our marriage hell have nary a doubt that our children will have horns and cloven hooves the first one born with a tail well name after the good abbot eleanor reached for a dish of strawberries in sugared syrup popping one neatly into his mouth he fed her the next one and when she licked the sugar from his fingers as daintily as a cat his body was suddenly suffused in heat dipping his finger in the syrup he coated one of her nipples she looked startled but intrigued and when he lowered his mouth to her breast she exhaled her breath in a drawnout sigh abbot bernard preaches that sin is all around us she said throatily but i doubt that even he ever thought to warn against strawberries hed likely have an apoplectic seizure if he only knew what can be done with honey henry predicted and eleanor began to laugh i think she said that you and i are going to have a very interesting marriage henry thought so too i want you eleanor her eyes reflected the candle flame but brighter and hotter making promises that would have provided abbot bernard with a full year of new sermons my lord duke she said tonight all of aquitaine is yours for the taking they were both exhausted but neither was ready yet to let the night go staving off sleep they lay in each others arms watching as the hearth flames wavered and danced and sent up whitegold sparks henry could not remember ever feeling so content god truly did reward those willing to gamble breathing in the scent of his wifes perfume he nuzzled her neck and she nestled closer he was not at all surprised that she could fire his passion as no other woman had but hed not expected to feel so intensely protective she was quite capable of taking care of herself hed never thought to meet a woman more selfsufficient than his mother but here she was her thigh resting on his her hair tickling his chest it was not that she needed him to take care of her it was that he wanted to and this was a novel sensation for him lust took on a new taste altogether when tenderness was added to the brew how had she gotten to him like this mayhap it was just the afterglow it was only natural that hed feel close to her after lovemaking like theirs any more heat and theyd have set the bed on fire or was it that any last lingering doubts about her honour had gone up in smoke however much hed insisted to his father that he did not believe the gossip and innuendoes and rumors thered been a small dark corner of uncertainty one hed not acknowledged even to himselfuntil now but no more no matter what men said of her he knew now that she was not a wanton she was passionate and blessedly uninhibited and ardent but she knew none of a courtesans erotic tricks those special seductive ways of pleasuring a man that most wives never mastered hed lain with enough harlots to recognize practiced passion and from harlots that was indeed what he wanted but not from eleanor hed not wanted her to be too knowing too artful in her caresses for she could never have learned such skills from monkish fettered louis if she had ever been unfaithful he was sure now it had been a brief tryst no more than that it was passing strange for he ought not to care what shed done whilst wed to another man but he did if tenderness was an unfamiliar emotion for him so was this urge too hed never been jealous of a bedmate before never felt possessive of one either was it because she was his wife was that what made it so different so much more complicated harrywhat are you thinking about papal politics the price of corn whether i ought to get my stallion shoed the usual he joked while tightening his arm around her shoulders she had the most luxuriant hair hed ever encountered in a bedmate he could not keep his hands away from it running its silkiness through his fingers wondering why men found blonde hair so alluring it reached well past her hips ebony in the night shadows a deep rich brown whenever the firelight played upon it separating a long gleaming strand he entwined it around his fingers looping it about his wrist her lashes flickered are you worried that i might run off whilst you sleep i just want to keep you close he said and she smiled drowsily you need not worry harry she said ill not stray eustace had moved to the open window watching the river traffic on the seine behind his back the french king exchanged puzzled looks with his brother robert and his cousin raoul louis was as surprised as anyone by eustaces unexpected arrival in paris he must have left england within a few days of his mothers funeral which bespoke an unseemly haste to louis moreover his presence was something of an embarrassment now that louis had made peace with his rival the duke of normandy the other men in the chamber were regarding eustace with no favor for he had few friends at court but he had to be made welcome they could hardly turn away the count of boulogne the french kings brotherinlaw eustace was well aware that these men liked him not but he harbored no goodwill toward most of them either while hed always been on civil terms with the french king he could not respect a man so weakwilled louiss blustery brother the count of dreux he disliked heartily an antagonism robert returned in full measure nor did he think much of louiss dissolute kinsman raoul de peronne raouls courtesy too often held a hidden sting a hinted smugness that eustace found infuriating coming as it did from a man whod made a fool of himself over a slut young enough to be his daughter he had no reason to think badly of the templar thierry galeran and he did not know hugh de champfleury louiss new chancellor as for waleran beaumont the less said of him the better eustace would never forgive him for going over to maude and these were the men whose voices louis most heeded if so no wonder his brotherinlaw seemed to lurch from one blunder to another like a ship with no rudder did you bring constance with you louis queried politely as eustace turned away from the window eustace shook his head started to say that constance had remained behind to tend to his father whose grieving was still raw he caught himself in time for that would only stir up another flurry of commiserations hed already accepted their condolences wanted no more if he would rather mourn his mother in private that was betwixt him and god and no concern of theirs what he really wanted to discuss with louis was the calamitous mistake hed made in coming to terms with maudes whelp henry fitz empress could not be trusted what angevin could not for nothing did men call anjou the devils birthplace sooner or later louis would realize how badly hed erred eustace hoped to make it sooner but he preferred to wait for a more opportune moment he had a better chance of convincing louis if they were alone since eustace seemed to feel no obligation to stoke the conversational fires it fell to the evercourteous king to perform that task for him it was not easy going for so many subjects held pitfalls fortunately louis got some help from the affable raoul who was a past master at social discourse the sort of talk that was lively and smoothflowing and said nothing of any consequence but louis was not enjoying himself and it was a relief to be summoned away by adam brulart his secretary hovering anxiously in the doorway well what shall we talk about now raoul asked eustace i can always tell you the story of my life i daresay youve been awaiting that with bated breath eustace stared suspiciously at the older man sure that raoul was mocking him but not sure what to do about it humor was the weapon he most mistrusted for it was one hed never learned to handle with any skill but he was spared the need to reply glancing about the chamber raoul frowned then rose from his seat cousin is something amiss by now other heads were turning toward louis too he did look sickly eustace conceded for he had no more color than a corpse candle and an odd glazed stare as if he were not seeing any of them filled with foreboding eustace started toward him raoul and robert were already there asking questions that louis did not seem to hear it fell to adam brulart to tell them after a troubled look at his kings ashen face the clerk said reluctantly the kings grace has just learned that the lady eleanor and the duke of normandy were wed in poitiers on whitsunday as the unhappy clerk had known it would his news created a furor voices rose as men struggled to make themselves heard eustace finally prevailed for hed had much practice in shouting others down is it true he demanded of louis just tell me if it is true louis swallowed a mistake he said it must be a mistake eleanor would not do that to me i know she would not he was a minority of one in that belief several of the men had begun to curse raoul had paled clutching his royal cousins arm he said urgently i did not know louis i swear by the holy cross that i did not know louis said nothing for he was not listening neither was eustace turning away he rested his palms flat against the wall standing motionless arms outstretched head down normandy anjou maine touraine and now aquitaine tooblood of christ without warning he balled his fist hammered it into the wall repeatedly leaving a smear of blood behind in the confusion no one noticed the french king continued to insist plaintively that it must be a mistake he was eleanors liege lord she had no right to wed without his consent and never would she have wed henry fitz empress had she not wanted to annul their marriage because their kinship was an affront to the almighty it had gnawed away at her peace shed told him sooften but she was even more closely akin to henry than she was to him so such a marriage could never be she would not mock gods law like that she would not mock him but his protests carried less and less conviction and at last he slumped down in a chair too stricken to keep up the pretense any further gradually the other men quieted and a discomfited silence filled the chamber watching louis bleed was painful for them too but none knew how to treat a heart wound after much shuffling of feet and clearing of throats they seemed to have reached an unspoken consensus that the greatest kindness they could do their king would be to leave him alone they began to mumble regrets to murmur vaguely of duties elsewhere putting eustace in mind of the hushed unnatural voices of the mourners at his mothers funeral crossing the chamber swiftly he planted himself directly in front of his brotherinlaws hunched figure arms folded across his chest legs spread impossible to ignore what mean you to do about this louis looked up blankly a man roused from his own private hell blinking as if surprised to find the men still here what can i do they are already wed but you are not going to let them get away with it are you they had no right to wed and well they knew it if it is too late to prevent the marriage it is not too late to punish them for it if you do not others will think that they too can defy you with impunity eustaces mouth twisted and for a moment he thought of his father you have no choice he said but to make an example of them one that others will not soon forget hed struck a common chord for once he did not lack for allies and they all agreed that eleanor and henry must be held to account for their treachery there must be a reckoning if thierry galeran was spurred on by his known hatred for louiss queen that could not be said of louiss chancellor and hugh de champfleury argued somberly too for retribution when at last eyes turned toward raoul he did not hesitate for long his fondness for eleanor was genuine but his position was precarious enough as it was no in this case she was on her own a man does what he must he said carefully you must think of the crown my liege such unanimity was rare in louiss royal councils he knew they were right so great a betrayal could not be ignored it must be avenged shed lied to him from the first with her talk of conscience and gods will mayhap this had even been planned from the onset as far back as last summers peace conference with the angevins mayhap that was why count geoffrey and his spawn had become so reasonable of a sudden that suspicion twisted the knife almost beyond bearing how she must be laughing at him lying in bed with the angevin stripling congratulating themselves for having made such an utter fool of the king of france well let her beloved aquitaine be overrun by french troops let her watch as poitiers burned let her see then if she still felt like laughing i shall summon them both to my court he said abruptly to answer a charge of treason they approved nodding grimly raoul glanced around at their faces wondering if he was the only one who thought it unlikely that the guilty pair would obey the summons he knew his sisterinlaw better than any of them and he could not see her submitting meekly to a judgment of the french court ah eleanor he thought bleakly what have you done for such a clever lass how had she gotten herself into such a predicament what had possessed her to put her world at risk like this with nothing between her and disaster but luck and a cocky nineteenyearold as satisfied as eustace was with this outcome he still harbored a few qualms louis sounded steadfast enough now but how long would that last what happens he said if they dare to defy the summons louis raised his head his eyes held a blueice glitter that eustace had never seen before that he found very heartening then louis said it will be war fontevrault abbey anjou june the sun was high overhead filling the cloisters with brilliant whitegold light eleanor and the abbess mathilde were sauntering along the walkway in such animated conversation that they did not notice when yolande lagged behind tugging at colettes sleeve to attract her attention did you hear that the abbess called our ladys new husband harry how does a nun know the duke so well colettes black eyes held an amused glint that is a scandalous suggestion she chided and yolande blushed brightly i did not mean there was anything improper betwixt them colette sighed i was but teasing you child the abbess is lord henrys aunt his fathers elder sister so it is hardly surprising that she calls him harry you do not know of her history then if not for a drunken helmsman and a hidden reef in barfleur harbor she would have been queen of england for shed been wed as a child to the english kings only lawfully begotten son the one who drowned in the wreck of the white ship although it had been more than thirty years since the sinking of the white ship its tragic fate continued to haunt the imagination its story to find new audiences yolande might be ignorant of english politics but she knew every one of the legends that had sprung up around the white ship and she stared after the abbess with avid curiosity truly how unlucky she was oh id say she was very lucky indeed for she could have been on the white ship too but fortunately for her shed sailed with the old king far better to be widowed than drowned yolande even if it does mean forfeiting a crown theyd not been as discreet as theyd believed their voices carried across the garth eleanor gave her new kinswoman an apologetic smile but the abbess shrugged unperturbed i fully expect she said dryly that as i lie on my deathbed ill still hear whispers about the white ship who knows even the almightys angels may have a question or two to put to me eleanor laughed shed expected to encounter one of gods holy lambs for mathilde had lived most of her life within fontevraults sheltering walls instead shed found a handsome woman of forty or so one who ruled her cloistered domains with competence pragmatic piety and wry good humor eleanor thought those were admirable qualities for abbess and queen alike i remember she said a childhood riddle that my sister fancied what can never be outrun the answer was supposed to be my shadow but it could as well have been gossip and rumor too weve both been the quarry in that hunt mathilde said candidly but eleanor took no offense for she knew none was intended she should have realized that geoffreys sister would have her share of angevin spice whatever might be said of her husbands family no one could ever accuse them of being bland smiling she followed the abbess down the shallow steps into the church almost at once eleanor stopped in surprise shed often wondered why churches were invariably filled with shadows and solemnity instead of ablaze with gods light and joy here in this benedictine nunnery of the blessed lady mary shed finally found a church to gladden her heart and dazzle her eyes sun spilled into the chancel from ten soaring windows the frescoed walls of the nave glowed with vibrant color and the floor a gleaming white marble shimmered like glazed ice eleanor had always been intrigued by fontevrault for it had been founded upon the precept of the lord christ to st john son behold thy mother at fontevrault women reigned supreme even the adjoining community of monks was subject to the authority of the abbess that alone would have endeared fontevrault to eleanor the fact that it had once given sanctuary to her grandmother and was now ruled by her husbands aunt made it all the more appealing and shed been pleased to grant the abbey a charter confirming their existing privileges shed also made a generous donation of five hundred sous to the convents coffers but as she gazed admiringly now upon the sunlit splendor of the great minster she wished shed given more dipping her fingers into the font of holy water eleanor dutifully made the sign of the cross did you see much of harry as he was growing up not as much as i would have liked hes always been my favorite nephew although i suppose i ought not to admit that tell me is it true that the french king ordered you both to his court to defend yourselves against a charge of treason eleanor nodded we got the summons just as harry was about to depart for barfleur he told louiss messenger that it was not convenient for him to visit paris this summer but hed let louis know when he had some free time mathilde joined in her laughter that sounds like harry bless him it sounds like geoffrey too but might it not have been wiser to seek to placate louis possibly eleanor conceded but it would not have been as much fun and the abbess concluded that her nephew and his beautiful controversial bride were a wellmatched pair indeed when eleanor began to ask about henrys childhood mathilde was pleased seeing eleanors curiosity as a promising proof that their marriage would prosper for only a contented wife would be interested in her husbands boyhood misdeeds since henry had never lacked for imagination she did not lack for stories and she was quite willing to acquaint eleanor with some of henrys more memorable escapades the time he found a fox cub and smuggled it into the castle hoping to tame it only to have it eat his mothers pet magpie the time he tried to climb from his bedchamber using sheets knotted together and fell into the moat the time he sneaked blue woad dye into his brother geoffs bath they were still laughing over that last prank when they heard the footsteps out in the nave turning they saw an elderly nun hastening toward the chancel at a pace rapid enough to compromise her dignity holy mother she panted there are men come to see the duchess we wanted to escort them to the guest hall explaining that males may not roam about in a nunnery at will but they refused to wait insisting upon seeking out the duchess for themselves did they indeed the abbess said sounding to eleanor more like geoffrey facing down abbot bernard than one of christs brides just who are these illbred intruders sister pauline the duchesss kinsman the viscount of chatellerault and her seneschal reverend mother they were most rude the banging of the church door cut off the remainder of her complaint and she spun around with an indignant cry there they are eleanors uncle hugh de chatellerault had always been volatile given to emotional outbursts and dramatic posturing she saw nothing significant or sinister in his discourtesy for he was quite capable of forcing his way into a nunnery on a whim but saldebreuil de sanzay was another sort of man altogether rarely riled the most levelheaded of all her counselors and eleanor had never seen him look as he did nowthoroughly alarmed neither man responded to the abbesss sharp challenge not even hearing her at sight of his niece the viscount quickened his stride christ jesus eleanor he erupted hoarsely accusing what have you brought upon us eleanors eyes narrowed moving dismissively from her uncle to sanzay saldebreuil what has happened war my lady he said grimly a french army has gathered on the norman border poised to strike eleanor caught her breath could she have so misread louis shed expected him to rant and rave and even to bluster and threaten but not to back up those threats with force his nature was pacific and passive not at all martial he was never belligerent or combative not unless goaded to itas at antioch she should have guessed there would be those to goad him at paris too louis is not being a gracious loser is he she said with more coolness than she felt and as always his sense of timing is deplorable if hed just waited another fortnight harry would have been in england when he attacked the viscount gave a snort of disbelief you truly think your young lordling will be our salvation her coolness was no longer feigned that is not the first time youve spoken of my husband with disdain let it be the last uncle harry is more than a match for louis as hell soon prove her seneschal slowly shook his head you do not know all of it my lady nor the worst of it the french king has assembled a formidable coalition allying himself with his brother the count of dreux count eustace of boulogne the counts of champagne and bloisand lord henrys younger brother geoffrey fitz empress eleanor paled beside her the abbess mathilde gasped fontevrault was close enough to the border of poitou for her to have picked up sufficient langue doc to understand the gist of what sanzay had just said that her nephew had been betrayed by his own brother there was a moment or two of stricken silence as eleanor admitted to herself just how badly she and henry had erred utterly underestimating the furor their marriage would create but then she rallied and smiled scornfully harry is a match for any of them too her uncle started to scoff but daunted by her warning he thought better of it just in time sanzay looked at her in somber sympathy mayhap he would be a match for any of them he agreed politely but for all of them yes eleanor glared at them defiantly you do not know harry i do he will prevail against them that i can assure you neither man looked convinced but neither dared to contradict her i hope your faith in the duke is not misplaced my lady sanzay said bleakly for this will not be a war you can afford to lose you see the french king has promised his allies that your domains will be carved up between them like a michaelmas goose the french king eleanor echoed acidly can promise them half of heaven for all the good it will do him louis was ever one for promising more than he could deliver and his greedy accomplices will learn that soon enough well see no blood spilled on our soil for theyll never get that far nonetheless it behooves us to take all sensible precautions wed best return to poitiers straightaway for there is much to be done the men were in full agreement with that if with nothing else shed said her vassals must be warned men summoned for military duty castles made ready to withstand sieges patrols sent out to guard their borders these were familiar activities and for that reason reassuring to eleanors uncle and seneschal much more so than her conviction that the angevin youth shed wed would be able to defeat a vengeful king his most implacable enemy his own brother and three highborn and landhungry lords all eager to turn normandy and then aquitaine into a smoldering wasteland of razed castles and plundered towns reaching out eleanor took mathildes hands in hers bade her farewell and promised to return to fontevrault once the war had been won the abbess kissed the younger woman lightly and approvingly on both cheeks bear in mind she said what scriptures tell us that david prevailed over the philistine with but a sling and a stone i think we can safely say that harry will be far better armed eleanor smiled and they embraced briefly it was only then that the abbess realized how much of eleanors impressive aplomb was sheer bravado for she whispered softly and urgently in mathildes ear pray for us in july the french king invaded normandy and laid siege to the castle neufmarche on the th henry led an armed force from barfleur riding hard for neufmarche but he was too late by the time he got there the castle had already fallen to the french at henrys approach louis pulled back and a battle was averted when louis withdrew toward chaumont henry followed and the skies over the vexin were soon smokeblackened then in august louis suddenly crossed the seine again henry broke off his harrying campaign in the vexin and raced for verneuil louiss likely target but on a swelteringhot monday the french army appeared before william de breteuils castle at pacy from the battlements at pacy william de breteuil looked out upon a scene that fulfilled all his expectations of the netherworld darkness was falling and torches had begun to flare in the enemy encampment bodies still lay sprawled beneath the castle walls for it was too risky to come within arrow range merely to retrieve the dead the assault had been a bloody one fiercely fought on both sides the defenders had been able to repel the first attack although at a high cost theyd lost more men than they could spare and when the onslaught resumed on the morrow william doubted that they could hold out for very long moving stiffly for hed suffered a leg wound in the assault william clambered down a rope ladder and limped across the bailey a few of their dead still lay unclaimed where theyd fallen from the battlements but most had been dragged into the great hall which was doing double duty as charnel house and hospital as he sent men to relieve their comrades up on the walls william found himself wondering how many of them would be among the wounded and dead at this time tomorrow he fully expected to be one of them for he would never yield hed fought too long and too hard to gain pacy ever to relinquish it not if he still had breath in his body he knew the odds were against him but that had been true all his life he ought never to have gotten pacy for his own it was also claimed by the powerful beaumont family but the strife over the english crown had offered opportunities for men wise enough or lucky enough to choose the winning side and in count geoffrey of anjou had granted him all hed ever wanted the honour and castle of pacy sur eure he would rather die defending it than surrender and have to watch as the french king turned it over to waleran beaumont he found his wife in the great hall tending to the wounded bending over a youth whod been burned when a fire arrow ignited his clothing she was applying goose grease and fennel to his raw blistered arm so intent upon her task that she did not notice her husbands approach not until he said emma very low she looked exhausted her skin sallow in the smoky rushlight her eyes shining with blinkedback tears there were bloodstains on her skirt and her hair had been pulled back severely caught up in an untidy knot at the nape of her neck her veil long gone hed never seen her so disheveled or so indifferent to her appearance moving away from the moaning man at her feet she let william lead her toward a window seat it is so ungodly hot she said but she did not suggest that the window be unshuttered she knew better while night attacks were rare they were not unheardof her husband had slumped into the seat beside her his chin sunk down on his chest she could see dried blood in his beard and hoped it was not his she knew though that hed been in the midst of the handtohand fighting up on the wall just as she knew hed be there on the morrow swinging a sword as long as he had the strength to wield it after a while he bestirred himself and began lying to her again saying what he thought she needed to hear assuring her that theyd be able to stave off the next assault that theyd be able to hold out until the duke arrived emma wanted desperately to believe him but the duke had been heading for verneuil and they could not be sure that their man had reached him with their urgent plea for aid and even if he had even if the duke at once swung about and rode for pacy it was nigh on forty miles between the two strongholds pacy would suffer the same fate as neufmarche and by the time the duke got there it would be too late will she got no further it would do no good to urge him to surrender shed never known a man so stubborn so prideful for there was no pride as fierce as that of an outsider one whose birthright was tainted by the bar sinister williams father had been a fitz osborn an only son but born out of wedlock hed spent his life in an embittered struggle to claim the honours of breteuil and pacy and her william had then taken up the quest too nogod help him but he would never yield not with his fathers vengeful ghost dogging his every footstep come abovestairs she said wearily and let me put some fresh plantain leaves on your wound will they were just entering the stairwell when they heard the shouting william spun around so hastily that he tripped emma grabbed his arm to help him regain his balance and held tight for they shared the same fearthat the french king had decided not to wait until the morrow was attacking now as they hurried back into the hall one of williams knights came bursting through the door my lord come quick something strange is happening in the french camp laboring for breath he leaned upon a chair for support and startled them then with a sudden smile it is going to sound mad i know but it looks like they are pulling out william did not believe it not until he stood on the battlements and saw for himself the confusion and turmoil in the french camp jesu he breathed awed beyond words at gods goodness for the french army was indeed in retreat breaking camp with such urgency that he knew there could be but one explanation theyd gotten warning of another armys approach tell my wife he directed joyfully to go to the chapel thank the almighty and the duke for our deliverance as the pacy garrison watched and cheered and hooted from the battlements the french army made a hasty retreat leaving behind bodies and tents and smoking campfires soon afterward riders came into view the horses were caked with lather and the men looked as though theyd been bathing in dust but their smiles shone triumphantly on begrimed drawn faces and when the drawbridge was lowered to admit them into the castle they were mobbed by the grateful garrison the youth on a rawboned grey stallion was just as fatigued and filthy as the others but the word soon spread among them that this was their duke and henry rode into the most heartfelt and heartening welcome of his life shoving his way toward henry william de breteuil had a protective arm around his wifes shoulders and was brandishing a wineskin in jubilant celebration drink my lord he urged sloshing the wineskin upward all that i have is yours for the asking and to the men crowding to get closer for the love of god give the duke some room how can he dismount with you coming at him from all sides i cannot stay henry interjected reaching gratefully for the wineskin we have not a hope in hell of overtaking them not after the way weve had to use our horses but we ought to make sure that they are in full retreat well be back though so start breaking out your wine casks your men can drain every last one william promised and with my blessings if i had all the wine in christendom at my disposal id pour it out like a river for your troops and never count the cost you saved us from certain defeat my lord and i still do not know how you did it you could not have gotten here faster if your horses were winged in all honesty i never expected you to reach us in time henry took another deep swallow from the wineskin and then grinned down at his beaming vassal neither he said did louis maude was a woman with a keen sense of injustice one who neither forgave nor forgot her grievances shed not thought there was anything more she could learn about betrayal for shed been wronged so often her father had betrayed her by naming her as his heir and then failing to safeguard the succession for her stephen had betrayed her trust and stolen her crown the english had betrayed her by refusing to accept her as queen despite stephens decisive defeat at lincoln geoffreys betrayals were beyond counting by her stringent standards even robert had betrayed her at first by acquiescing in stephens illicit kingship but nothing had prepared her for the pain of her sons betrayal she was both infuriated and horrified that her second son could have played into their enemys hands like this what had ever possessed geoff to behave so treacherously was he truly so jealous of henry that he could rejoice in his brothers downfall or was he so foolish that he did not even realize they meant henrys ruin shed never had any doubts about how to deal with disloyalty nor had she ever had any mercy to spare for those who knowingly sinned against god and man but this sinner was her son flesh of her flesh as angry as she was with geoff she could not help fearing for him too but her greatest fear was for henry shed never have thought she could regret geoffreys death so deeply if only he were still alive to come to henrys aid why had the almighty chosen to take robert and brien too when her son had such need of them now night after night she paced the floor of her bedchamber for when she slept her dreams were dreadful shed never feared to risk her own life but henrys life was far more precious to her his death the one loss she could not have survived maude was preparing for bed when her son arrived at the priory with minnas help she hastily rebraided her hair made herself as presentable as she could in the brief span before he was ushered into her chamber until he entered she was not sure which son to expect hoping against hope that it might be a contrite geoff come to his senses she felt a surge of relief nonetheless at sight of her youngest will where have you been did you not realize how worried i would be when i did not hear from you he looked surprised and then sheepish no he admitted i did not i am sorry mama but you need not have fretted at sixteen im old enough to take care of myself ive been with harry of course where else would i be that had occurred to me she conceded for i know youve always gotten along better with henry than with geoff but i needed to know for certes will no one gets along with geoff will almost added except the whores whore paid to put up with him remembering in the nick of time that he was speaking to his mother harry or geoffthat was an easy choice mama he startled her then though by saying matteroffactly after all harry is going to be king of england one day she studied his sunburned freckled face the guileless blue eyes who would have guessed that her last fledgling so cheerful and forthright had such a practical core are you so sure then that henry will win this war he seemed puzzled by the question that it need even be asked mama he is already winning did you not hear about pacy when she nodded he straddled a chair leaning forward eagerly a pity you could not have been there to see it youd have been so proud of harry we half killed ourselves racing for pacy and we did lose some of our horses but we got there in time to save the castle and scare off the french this is the second time too that the french king has refused to do battle with harry how does he expect to win this war if he keeps skulking away whenever harry gets within a mile of the french army i daresay quite a few men are asking themselves that same question what happened after you rescued the lord of pacy i heard that henry then invaded dreux is that true will nodded vigorously that is why i am here mama to let you know what has been occurring harry thought you ought to hear it from me he explained and grinned he probably reckoned that a brother would boast of his exploits more than a courier would but he has earned the right to do a bit of bragging mama and im happy to do it in his stead after the french retreated harry said it was time to teach louiss allies that this war was going to be a costly one for them too we crossed into the count of dreuxs lands burned brezolles and marcouville and harry demanded hostages from the counts vassal richer de laigle after that we took and burned his castle at bonmoulins the local people were right glad to see it burn saying it was a brigands castle a veritable den of thieves minna approached then with a brimming wine cup and will interrupted himself long enough to accept it with a beatific smile it was becoming obvious to maude that her youngest son saw this dangerous and needless war as a grand adventure where is henry now where did he go after destroying the castle at bonmoulins he is garrisoning all his castles along the norman border and once he is sure that normandy is no longer threatened he said hell be able to quell the rebellion in anjou will stifled a huge yawn i have much more to tell you mama but i think id best save the rest for the morrow my men are bedding down in the priory guest hall and with your permission ill join them for its been a long ride a long day of course maude bade her son goodnight kissed him on a smooth beardless cheek and agreed to meet him for morrow mass the following morning but once he departed all her energy seemed to have gone with him and she sat down wearily upon a coffer chest after a time she felt minnas hand on her shoulder for minna understood too why henry had sent will to rouen hed done it for her maude knew so that her youngest would not be present when henry dealt with his faithless brother eleanor awakened with a start the chamber was dark save for a single night candle colette a sound sleeper lay motionless on her pallet by the bed but eleanors greyhound had begun to whine and yolande was fumbling with her bedrobe as she stumbled sleepily toward the door the knocking continued louder now when yolande opened the door eleanor recognized the voice seeking entry jordan her clerk why would he be awakening her in the night unless the news was dire she was grabbing for her bedrobe when yolande spun around eyes wide with shock my lady it is your husband eleanor went cold he is not dead no my lady no jordan says he is here opening the door wider yolande cried jordan tell her it is true madame the duke has just ridden into the bailey as if realizing how unlikely this sounded jordan insisted i saw him dismounting with my own eyes my lady i swear i did has he been wounded no my lady not judging by what i saw while jordans assurance dispelled eleanors fears about henrys safety her unease persisted she was optimistic by nature as all gamblers are but it was difficult to be sanguine about her husbands midnight arrival why would harry break off his campaign and return without warning to poitiers she could think of only one reason the wars tide had turned against him so badly that aquitaine itself was now threatened with invasion by all accounts hed been more than holding his own but she knew fortune was never so fickle as on the battlefield what else could it be by now colette was up too hastily pulling on her chemise as yolande shooed jordan back outside while they dressed slipping into her bedrobe eleanor was searching in the floor rushes for her shoes when they heard the voices out on the stairwell eleanor forgot about her shoes started for the door as it burst open again and a moment later she was in her husbands arms i am so glad to see you she said once hed stopped kissing her somewhat surprised herself by just how glad she was but i do not understand why you are here is the war about to spill over into aquitaine henry smiled and shook his head no love he said the war is over below in the great hall it was chaos henrys men were tired and hungry and triumphant in need of food and wine and welldeserved accolades all of which the palace inhabitants were more than willing to provide for once the cooks did not mind being roused from their beds to prepare a latenight meal as word spread that their duchesss young husband had routed their enemies and protected aquitaine from invasion people began to crowd into the hall eager to share in the excitement and a boisterous celebration was soon in progress up in the maubergeon tower a private celebration was already under way eleanor and her ladies could not do enough for henry and despite his exhaustion he found himself enjoying all the attention joking that this was every mans dream come true to be waited upon by three fair women was he thirsty yolande flew downstairs to fetch a flagon of spiced hippocras was he hungry colette was happy to send to the kitchen for venison stew and hot bread and honeyed wafers when he expressed a need for a bath one was swiftly arranged eleanor unbuckled his scabbard assisted him in removing his muddied boots and insisted that he settle himself comfortably upon the bed while he awaited the arrival of his food and bath propped up by pillows basking in female admiration henry told them about the war louis has offered a truce and gone back to paris to nurse a fever and his bruised pride he related with a sardonic smile that could not hide his jubilation his stouthearted accomplices had already made themselves scarce for this war did not turn out to be as much fun as theyd expected after i raided into dreux stephens nephews decided they were urgently needed at home lest i pay a visit to champagne or blois next they were always more keen on the spoils of war than the war itself all save eustace whos like to be sore crazed with rage at such spineless allies henry paused then as yolande came rushing back into the chamber with several precariously balanced wine flagons pouring a cup of hippocras eleanor carried it over to the bed and sat beside him as he drank what of your brother harry what happened in anjou geoffs rebellion sputtered out like a dying candle the malcontent lords hed lured to his banner scattered to the winds as soon as i crossed into anjou i had no trouble convincing geoffs castellans at mirebeau loudun and chinon that it was in their interest to yield the castles to me geoff and those of his followers not already in hiding holed up in montsoreau i laid siege to it and captured it easily enough to embarrass geoff who had no choice then but to seek my forgiveness i see eleanor did not expect him to cast his brother into a dungeon and let him rot but she feared that if he was too lenient with geoff other wouldbe rebels might learn the wrong lesson from his forbearance and did you did you forgive him yes henry said i did he drank watching her all the while but first i took away his castles eleanors smile was dazzling men will be talking about this war for years to come she predicted you humbled the french king put the fear of god into his lackeys thwarted your chief rival for the english throne chastened your brat of a brotherand you did all that in less than two months leaning toward him she murmured after such a remarkable campaign the least i can do is give you an equally memorable welcome home her breath was warm on his skin her eyes a luminous catgold and henry wondered if hed ever learn to take her beauty for granted if hed ever look at her without feeling his pulse jump that is a most intriguing offer eleanor could you be more specific eleanor laughed softly all in good time colette was beckoning from the doorway and she slipped off the bed to confer colette reported that the food was almost ready and the bathwater was being heated would be brought up after the meal yolande and i will sleep elsewhere tonight she said smiling and without waiting to be asked she began to unfasten eleanors night plait colette knew enough of men to be sure that henry would want his wifes hair loose and freeflowing for their lovemaking with deft strokes she brushed eleanors hair until it felt like silk and looked like firelit sable how perfect it would be she whispered if tonight you conceived a son eleanors throat tightened so great was her desire to bear henry an heir he had proved himself and in spectacular fashion to her and to the world but her battlefield would be the birthing chamber and if she could give him the son god had denied to louis that would be her joy her triumph and her vindication god willing colette she said and turned back toward henry only to come to a surprised stop when colette started to speak she shook her head putting her finger to her lips as colette joined her beside the bed colette thought henry looked very appealing and unguarded in sleep shed never noticed before that he had such long golden lashes do you want me to send the food up later nolet him sleep lord knows he has earned a nights rest eleanor eased herself onto the bed but henry didnt stir gesturing for colette to hand her a blanket she gently tucked it around him then slid under the covers blowing out all the candles but one colette quietly withdrew at the door she paused eleanor was propped up on her elbow gazing down at her sleeping husband colette would have expected to find indulgent amusement in her face and did but as she watched the amusement gave way to a different sort of smile one like a caress surprising and revealing smiling too colette closed the door henry did not at once remember where he was it had been weeks since hed slept in such a soft bed half asleep he wondered why he was still dressed especially since there seemed to be a female form beside him in the bed yawning he leaned over to get a look at his bedmate admiring the bare shoulder emerging from the sheets as he did he caught a beguiling familiar fragrance eleanors perfume jesus god wide awake now he sat bolt upright as it all came back to him how could he ever have fallen asleep in eleanors bed his movement had shaken the mattress and her lashes were beginning to flutter hoping she wasnt too vexed with him he was framing an apology as she opened her eyes and smiled up at him captivated by the sudden appearance of her dimple he had a powerful urge to kiss it and from there it seemed only natural to move to her mouth he would later swear to eleanor that hed not meant to make love to her yet not until hed washed off the dust of the road but she kissed him back with enough ardor to blur his good intentions and so what happened next was not only predictable it was inevitable raising up on his elbow henry grinned for his discarded tunic had been flung across the room and landed atop felice eleanors greyhound it seemed to have snagged on her collar for it was draped over her like a tent as she sniffed about in the floor rushes shifting so he could slide his arm around eleanors shoulders he smoothed her hair back from her face her throat was reddened chafed by his beard and he stroked the soft skin with his fingers saying ruefully i really did plan to take a bath first but youre too tempting for your own good love eleanor yawned then gave him a smile of drowsy contentment im not complaining no he conceded youve been very goodnatured about all of this are you always going to be such an obliging wife not likely she said and laughed at the moment im inclined to deny you very little but that mood is sure to pass so youd best take advantage of it whilst you can henry laughed too and pulled her still closer she traced the freckles on his throat with the tip of her tongue her fingers playing pleasurably with the hair on his chest gently scraping his skin with her nails i just noticed something your hair and beard are sort of a copper color and your chest hair is golden but down here she said trailing her fingers across his belly toward his groin the hair is bright red he wouldnt have thought she could arouse him again so soon but his body was telling him otherwise flames are always reddest where the fire burns hottest did you not know that if your fire burned any hotter she teased all of poitiers would have gone up in flames leaning over she kissed him gently no longer playful she looked intently into his face ah harry she said softly and quite seriously i am so proud of you what surprised henry was not her words it was his response to them he already knew that hed waged an extraordinary campaign one that men would not soon forget not in france nor england while he was pleased by all the plaudits hed reaped he did not need this acclaim to understand the full magnitude of what hed accomplished never had the english crown been so close and his one regret was that his father had not lived to see his triumph hed not expected eleanors praise to mean so much to him for hed not realized until now just how much her opinion had begun to matter instead of jesting he said simply im glad i want to give a great feast for you she said one so lavish and bountiful that people will talk of it in awe i know you do not care much for such revelries but trust methis one you will enjoy harry you and i will sit at the high table eating porpoise and swan whilst we watch my male kinfolk eating humble pie you are right henry said laughing i daresay i would enjoy that i suppose i ought to summon a servant for you must be starved but eleanor could not bring herself to move a pity she and harry could not spend the entire day in bed the door bolted the world shut out passing strange she said for were into our fourth month of marriage and weve had only a fortnight together so far i suppose england is already beckoning too how long can you stay this time as long as you want she sat up staring at him are you serious ive been thinking about it if england has survived for nigh on seventeen years under stephen it can muddle through for another few months and soi have decided to put off my invasion for a while i thought id let you show me aquitaine instead despite himself his voice rose questioningly for they were still in so many ways intimate strangers and he could not be sure that shed not be disappointed by the delay craving the english crown more than his company he saw at once though that he need not have worried kneeling naked before him on the bed her eyes sparkling and her hair in wanton disarray she looked of a sudden very young giving him a glimpse of the girl whod gone off with such high hopes to wed the french king you and aquitaine harry nothing would please me more newbury england october the town of newbury was an ancient one strategically situated on the road that ran north to oxford and south to winchester the site had once been settled by the romans then the anglosaxons and it was here that john marshal had chosen to erect a castle on this blustery october thursday eustace was approaching newbury from the east along the reading road the siege works were already in sight encircling the castle and occupied town when an armed force rode out to challenge him eustace recognized the earl of northampton the most steadfast of his fathers allies it took him a moment however to identify the man riding beside northampton for william de mohun had not often come to stephens court lord of dunster mohun had been granted the earldom of somerset by maude a title stephen refused to acknowledge he was a strikingly handsome man with a reputation as foul as his appearance was fair hed deserted maude after the siege of winchester and gone over to stephens side yet his main interest was in feathering his own nest the war had spawned so many men like mohun brigand barons whod taken advantage of the conflict to rob and extort with impunity but not after he was king by god eustace knew how hed rule like the old king not like his father never like his father mohuns presence at the newbury siege was disheartening for it showed eustace just how badly his fathers circle of supporters was shrinking if he had to rely upon such untrustworthy selfseekers ypres was blind warenne dead on crusade robert beaumont wellnigh invisible hugh bigod and the earl of chester in the enemy camp and how many more would be turning traitor once they heard about that angevin whoresons triumph over the french king eustace was not a fool he knew that his fathers kingship was wounded and bleeding not hemorrhaging but even a steady trickle of blood could prove fatal if not stanched how was he to do that though holy christ on the cross how halting his men eustace rode out to meet northampton and mohun he brushed aside their surprised queries ignored their curiosity he knew hed have to talk about the disastrous normandy campaign but the longer he could put it off the better instead he asked brusquely about the siege john marshal they informed him indignantly was as treacherous as a serpent and as false as judas himself may god smite him as he deserved this was less than illuminating to eustace but with some prodding he got them to begin with the facts at the start of the siege newburys castellan had sought a brief truce so that he might warn his lord john marshal of the castles peril eustace nodded that was only to be expected marshal had then asked for a longer truce one that would enable him to confer with the empress and her son for he held newbury in their names again this was in accordance with the laws of war and eustace was hard put to hide his impatience i assume my father agreed his mouth twisted as if stephen the soul of chivalry would have refused but he did demand hostages indeed he did my lord marshal agreed quite readily yielding up his youngest son a lad of about four or five but then he betrayed usand the boy he took advantage of the truce to sneak supplies and men into newbury enabling them to withstand a long siege eustace knew that his youth put him at a disadvantage with his fathers supporters and to compensate for that hed cultivated the worldweary jaded air of a man whod seen too much ever to be truly surprised the pose slipped now though and he whistled soundlessly almost admiringly for few men would have had the iceblooded audacity to gamble with such high stakes sounds like marshal has sons to spare he joked grimly did my father warn him that the boys life would be forfeit that was not a question he should have had to asknot of any king but his father he was relieved when northampton nodded somberly of course he did my lord eustace he sent a warning yesterday to marlborough telling marshal that the lad will be hanged unless marshal agrees to yield newbury marlborough is how far twenty miles so well hear today then eustace said and smiled it seems i shall be just in time for newburys surrender dinner was normally served in the morning but it had been delayed by eustaces arrival and the trestle tables were not set up in stephens tent until noon the meal was surprisingly good for camp farea savory capon stewand conversation flagged as men concentrated upon their trenchers the faces were all familiar to eustace in addition to northampton and mohun their dinner guests included stephens loyal seneschal william martel and a handful of highborn lords william daubigny earl of arundel had begun to play a more active role on stephens behalf since losing adeliza to a flemish convent and an untimely death aubrey de vere earl of oxford was stephens chamberlain but like so many in this war his past was chequered for at one time hed been allied with maude the same was true of roger beaumont earl of warwick a cousin of the beaumont twins and a former partisan of the empress eustace was glad they were eating with such gusto for it put off their inevitable and intrusive questions about the normandy debacle stephen alone had no appetite for the stew it was growing cold on his trencher as he toyed with a piece of bread eustace had not seen him since the spring and he was taken aback by how much stephen seemed to have aged he did think stephen was old to twentytwo fiftysix was tottering on the edge of an open grave but his father had never looked his age before eustace studied stephen as he ate not liking what he saw mamas death was a wound that ought to be healing by now it had been five months after all he missed her too but papa could not afford to give in to his grieving there was too much at stake for that the meal was almost over when the talk turned to the topic eustace had wanted to avoid yet knowing all the while that it would come up that it must be dealt with for henry fitz empresss triumph would affect them all it was the affable tactless william daubigny who breached the tacit conspiracy of silence sopping up gravy with a thick chunk of bread he looked inquiringly down the table at eustace now that youre here lad you can tell us what truly happened in normandy this summer what with the rumors and gossip who knew what to believe did the french king really get chased all the way back to paris with his tail between his legs stephen glanced up swiftly frowning his sympathy stung eustace as much as aubignys clumsy curiosity and he said roughly before stephen could intercede on his behalf if you heard that the french kings milksop allies fled like rabbits that is true enough and may god forgive them for i never shall as for my brother by marriage louis hardly covered himself in glory either he of all men had reason to avenge himself upon maudes whelp but he had no stomach for fighting for stephen leaned over eustace eustace shook off his fathers hand he knew he was being dangerously indiscreet but he no longer cared you wanted the truth did you not well i am giving it to you henry fitz empress did not win the war louis lost it twice he balked at doing battle with henrytwice no wonder he was not man enough for that wanton wife of his for ive seen snakes with more backbone there were some involuntary laughs at that quickly smothered eustace ignored them unable to stop himself now even if hed wanted to his rage had been too long pent up once it became clear that this would be no quick and easy war of conquest louiss resolve began to waver like a broken water reed instead of confronting henry at pacy he showed his heels id stayed behind to garrison neufmarche and by the time i got to louis it was too late all the fight had gone out of him pausing to gulp down the last of his wine eustace shook his head in angry bafflement louis sees ill omens if he so much as stubs his toe the botched attack on pacy was bad enough but then his cousin died suddenly and after that he was wellnigh useless convinced that all these setbacks must be proof of gods disfavor his brother and my craven cousins had already flown the coop for dreux blois and champagne and so this wretched war ended with the king of france stricken with a convenient fever skulking back to paris in shame stephen agreed with his sons scornful assessment of the french kings inept campaign but he wished eustace had waited until they were alone to express it for he knew every embittered word would eventually get back to louis the men in this tent could never resist repeating such choice gossip when you spoke of louiss mourning his cousin i assume you mean the count of vermandois we heard that hed died during the campaign eustace nodded the one besotted with eleanors sister louis was right fond of the man god knows why in truth i think he was just looking for an excuse to end the war and i suppose raouls death was as good a reason as any better than that sudden fever for certes he laughed harshly sonow you know what truly happened in normandy this summer my lord of arundel it was great fun a pity you missed it no one knew what to say stephen yearned to console his son but he realized that any comfort hed offer would ring false to eustace even if almighty god were to send an archangel into their midst to absolve eustace of any blame it would change nothing all over england men would still be talking of henry fitz empress bedazzled by the apparent ease of his victory over the king of france when he returned to england this time he would come as a man of proven prowess on the battlefield a man dangerous to defy already a far greater threat than ever his mother had posed and who knew that better than eustace a servant was moving around the table refilling their wine cups stephen took a swallow it tasted bitter i was surprised he said when henry did not start gathering another fleet at barfleur do you know why eustace the younger man shrugged i heard that he was loath to leave his bride judging by his haste in getting back to her bed all those lurid stories told about her must be true but no woman can compete with a crown not for long once he gets his fill hell start casting his eyes toward england again that i do not doubt neither did stephen did you hear any talk about how long he means to stay in aquitaine now that winter is nigh mayhap hell tarry there till the spring i expect he will although i heard nothing about his plans ere i sailed for england the only gossip coming out of aquitaine concerned the incident at limoges glancing about the table eustace saw no comprehension on the watching faces only puzzlement and curiosity i see you have not heard yet about that after henry hurried back to eleanor they set off on a progress through her domains almost at once they ran into troubleat limoges where the citizens balked at offering them hospitality when henry demanded an explanation the abbot of st martials pointed out that he and eleanor were camped on the edge of town and claimed that the limousins had a duty to provide food for their liege lord only when he actually lodged within the city walls this is preposterous the earl of northampton exclaimed and the others chimed in too equally indignant for in that moment every man there felt a fleeting sense of solidarity with henry briefly seeing him not as an enemy but as one of their own a highborn lord denied his just due by those who owed him deference and respect even eustaces voice had a grudging note of approval as he described now the retaliation taken by his hated nemesis upon the recalcitrant citizens of limoges that reasoning did not satisfy henry either the accounts i heard say that he treated the limousins to a display of angevin rage that theyll not soon forget he then ordered the citys walls razed so thered be no such disputes on future visits this time the murmurs were both appreciative and amused stephen alone was dubious surely it was not necessary to take such a drastic measure as that he protested when a warning would have sufficed reaching for his wine cup he was bringing it up to his mouth when he realized they were all staring at him in astonishment what is it he said defensively for this was not an uncommon occurrence hed make an observation that seemed eminently reasonable only to have his barons react as though hed suddenly begun to speak a tongue utterly incomprehensible to them christ jesus papa that was an unforgivable insult lord eustace is right my liege such a deliberate provocation must never go unpunished for men would see that as weakness as i know that stephen interrupted impatiently but in destroying the city walls that punishment fell upon the innocent as well as the guilty upon those citizens of limoges whod had no say in it who likely did not even know why henry was so wroth with them stephen stopped then for it was obvious he was wasting his time and his breath they did not understand his point of view any more than he understood theirs a familiar and frustrating sense of isolation swept over him did all kings feel so solitary so alone what did youths like his son and maudes son know about the loneliness of kingship what did they know about the conflicting claims of justice and mercy only one person had ever understood how hard the choices could be only tilda may god assoil her sweet soul only tilda servants had cleared away the dishes and were dismantling the trestle tables when the messenger arrived from john marshal ushered into stephens tent he knelt awkwardly in the cramped space and held out a sealed parchment as stephen broke the seal and began to read the others watched glad that this troublesome siege was finally over holy christ stephens hoarse whisper was almost inaudible but they all saw the color drain from his face the man is mad he said sounding stunned he must be when they crowded around clamoring for answers stephen handed marshals letter to his son eustace scanned it rapidly his eyes widening marshal says hell not surrender the castle as for our threat to hang his son he said go ahead hang him that he has the hammer and anvil to forge other and better sons these were men not easily shocked but john marshal had managed to do just that there was silence and then uproar with all talking at once stephen had reclaimed marshals letter he kept rereading it as if expecting to find thered been some mistake for he simply could not believe any man capable of saying of his fiveyearold son hang him i never thought id see such evil as geoffrey de mandeville loosed on the fenlands he said but even he murdered other mens children not his own i always heard that marshal had no nerves at all look at the way he held out up in that burning church at wherwell willing to risk being broiled alive rather than surrender but thisjesu eustace elbowed around the encircling men to reach his father papai am truly sorry i know how hard this will be for you stephen had never heard his son sound so solicitous raising his eyes from the letter he saw eustace was watching him intently so were the other men he did not at first understand when he did he expelled his breath in an audible rush as if hed just taken a blow to the pit of his stomach you cannot think he said incredulously that i am going to do it papa you have no choice lord eustace is right my liege northampton heaved a sound much like a sigh i hate this he said heavily what man would not but it must be done you cannot let marshal defy you like this you threatened to hang his son if he did not yield newbury now you have to follow through with your threat you cannot back down god help you but you cannot no i will not kill a child just to save face but when stephen looked to the other men for support he found none one by one they began to voice their agreement with eustace and northampton mohun was chillingly composed contending that the age of the hostage was immaterial aubrey de vere mumbled his assent as if hoping god would not hear william daubigny wanted no part in it but when forced to declare himself he condemned the child with tears in his eyes shaken by their unexpected unanimity stephen turned to his seneschal for he knew william martel to be a decent godfearing man one whose judgment he trusted but martel too argued for the hanging all the more convincing for his obvious distress stephen would later look back upon that afternoon as one of the worst of his life reeling under their assault he continued to insist that hed not execute a child no matter what the provocation but they continued to insist that he must and they had logic and history and political necessity on their side whereas he had only instinct an aversion rooted in emotion heartfelt but not easy to articulate he could not rebut their arguments all they said was true hostages lost their value if there was no risk why would a man ever keep faith if he could be sure his hostages would come to no harm a kings word must be good whether he promised or threatened he must do what he said he would if marshal was allowed to get away with this other wouldbe rebels would take heart respect was but one side of the royal coin the other was fear for unless men feared to cross him why would they stay loyal he had a tenuous grip at best upon the allegiance of his subjects warweary and yearning for peace and now he was no longer facing a haughty irksome woman as his rival for the throne with henry fitz empress breathing down his neck he had no margin for error he could afford to make no more mistakes to do anything that might cause men to doubt his will to see him as weak or indecisive they were accustomed to speaking their minds freely with stephen and they did not hold back now they reminded him that his uncle the old king of blessed memory had agreed to mutilate his own granddaughters so important was it that the kings word could be trusted they reminded him too how hed gallantly allowed maude to ride away safe from arundel whereas had he taken her captive the war would have ended then and there theyd staked their futures upon his kingship and what of his son how could he risk eustaces birthright upon an impulse of misguided mercy i am not saying it is right my liege william martel said softly only that it is necessary sometimes an innocent must be sacrificed so that other innocents may live is it not better that one child should die if his death would hasten the end of this accursed war i suppose it would depend upon whether the child was yours but stephen was beaten and he knew it he could not fight them all for much of what theyd said had hit its target dead on how many had died in the thirteen years since hed let maude go free at arundel whenever hed heeded his own inner voice it was invariably wrong the men read surrender in his silence and were relieved that they had prevailed but this would not be a victory to celebrate it would be one to forgetif they could now that the crisis was over the toll it had taken showed clearly on their faces william de mohun alone seemed to have emerged unscathed in this battle between conscience and kingship and the others suspected that was because his own conscience had been stillborn he proved that by volunteering for a task any rational man would have shunned offering to take charge of the execution of john marshals son they were more than willing to put the onus off onto him and eustace nodded assent all the while thinking that mohun was a fool if he believed this would gain him any royal favor who wanted to dine with a hangman to break bread with a gravedigger when mohun reentered the tent the men hoped hed come to report that it was done but instead he announced with odious indifference that the arrangements had all been made do you want to witness the hanging my liege or shall i just inform you once it is over stephen raised his head regarding mohun with revulsion but it was nothing compared to his own selfloathing if a child is to die by my command i owe it to him to watch turning hollowed accusing eyes upon his accomplicesfor that was how he saw themhe said bitterly we all owe him that much executions were usually a grisly form of entertainment drawing large crowds in cities and towns rarely had a hanging been as poorly attended as this one but as word spread through the camp few of the men wanted to watch only the calloused and morbidly curious were gathered by the tree chosen as a gallows most found reasons to keep away stephens barons were there but by command not choice they shifted uneasily for few men could contemplate a childs death with william de mohuns sangfroid he might not know it yet but mohun had gained himself several new enemies this day cursing him under their breaths for putting stephenand themthrough this needless ordeal why had the fool just not gone off and done it eustace felt honourbound to stand shoulder to shoulder with his father although he would rather have been anywhere else in christendom hed not thought he would hate anyone more than henry fitz empress but john marshal now ran henry a close second no matter how long it took he would make marshal pay for springing this diabolic trap upon them the death of the boy was only a down payment on the debt he knew full well that his father would never forgive himself for what they were forced to do here as much as he hated to admit it he was feeling a certain queasy tension too as the time drew nigh he could only hope that the lad would not weep and sob but when william marshal appeared eustace discovered that there was more to be feared than tears a lively handsome child brownhaired and sturdy william was utterly at ease for hed been well treated during his weeks in the royal encampment he was too young to understand what being a hostage meant he knew only that the king had been unfailingly kind to him and he smiled at sight of stephen with an appalling and heartrending innocence theyd set up a barrel under the tree so that the lad would break his neck when it was kicked away instead of slowly strangling william de mohun explained oblivious as the men shrank back as if he were a leper stephens throat had closed up and it hurt to breathe but he forced himself to watch as william marshal was led toward the barrel the boy paused to gaze admiringly at william daubignys lance which the man had been shifting nervously from hand to hand wondering why the earl looked so odd when he asked if he could hold it later aubignys face twisted in anguish and he muttered an obscenity that made william giggle for hed heard enough cursing from his father to recognize it for what it was the soldier chosen as hangman was being well paid for his labors but brought face to face with his young victim he wanted only to get it over with as soon as possible and he reached out suddenly scooped william up and deposited him on the barrel the child looked startled but not alarmed he rather liked being the center of attention for as the youngest of four sons he wasnt paid much mind in the marshal household curious and trusting he entered willingly into the spirit of this strange new game and did not object as the noose was fastened around his neck an unnatural hush fell over the camp the hangman made ready to kick the barrel away looking to william de mohun for his signal shamed by his weakness eustace averted his eyes but stephen was already in motion striding forward he waved the hangman back enough i will not do this do you all hear me by god i will not the hangman hastily moved aside torn between relief and fear that hed be cheated of his fee reaching up stephen took the rope from the bewildered childs neck and set him back on his feet by then eustace was beside him papa what are you doing what i should have done at the outset god forgive me for letting it go this far youre making a fool of yourselfagain you do realize that once word gets out how marshal duped you and then defied you youll be a laughingstock look at the lad eustace damn you look at him we came within a hairbreadth of hanging this child and for what no crown is worth this it is my crown too and ill not stand idly by whilst you lose it that i swear william martel and the earl of northampton were hovering about them pleading that they stop to no avail william marshal had begun to fidget troubled by the anger in their voices moving closer to stephen he tugged at the kings sleeve saying plaintively i do not want to play this game anymore stephen looked down at the boy you do not have to lad it is over bending he lifted william into his arms and carried him toward the tent as the others watched wordlessly sharon kay penman when christ and his saints slept wallingford england december a swirling wet snow had been falling since dawn by the time the bishop of winchester arrived at his brothers siege he was chilled to the bone and grateful for even the meagre warmth of the brazier in stephens command tent stephen seemed genuinely glad to see him for in the two months since his return from rome theyd begun to mend the rifts in their relationship just as their estrangement had been mainly the bishops doing so too was their reconciliation his papal disgrace and thwarted ambitions had given the bishop a greater appreciation for familial bonds a belated realization that hed served neither stephen nor god with wholehearted devotion in his youth hed craved power and glory the holy see of canterbury possibly even a cardinals hat he knew now that some dreams were dust he would rise no higher in the church but all was not lost his brother still needed him and so did england it had been a year of mourning first their brother theobald and then stephens matilda and stephen would soon be facing the gravest threat yet to his embattled kingship stephen might be clinging to the shreds of a lifetimes optimism but the bishop was too realistic to underrate the danger they dared not hold maudes son too cheaply the french king had already learned that to his cost i hear your men finally captured newbury stephen nodded watching his brother warily but the bishop continued to sip his mulled wine if he too was critical of stephens handling of the newbury siege he was keeping it to himself stephen was grateful for that too many others had faulted him for sparing john marshals son i sent the little lad to constance in london he said waiting for a negative response again he was reprieved the bishop merely nodded is it true that eustace has crossed the channel again yes he wants to hire more mercenaries whilst keeping a hawks eye on maudes son and he heard that the french king was threatening to break the truce so i suspect he also hopes to prod louis into another war if he can stephen did not sound as if he expected eustace to succeed neither did the bishop the french king could not be eager to take on henry fitz empress again and even if eustace did talk him into another campaign louis had proved he was no match for henry on the field it was their accursed luck the bishop thought morosely that maudes son would be one of those blessed few born with a flair for command stephen seemed to have read his brothers sour musings for he said suddenly normandy is lost to us if we are to defeat maudes lad it must be hereon english soil that is why the fall of wallingford matters so much it has become a symbol of angevin defiance the castle the king could not win twice i tried to take it by force twice i failed and because that is so its surrender will daunt our foes and hearten our supporters beyond measure the bishop forgot his aching back his frozen feet and chilblained hands for this was news of consequence indeed wallingford is going to yield to you they have no choice stephen said for they are running out of food the castellan asked to be allowed to send an urgent message to henry fitz empress advising him that unless he can come to their aid they will be forced to yield while to the uninitiated that might have sounded suspiciously like john marshals ruse at newbury the bishop knew that was strictly in accordance with the laws of war for such an appeal allowed a besieged garrison to surrender with honour if help was not forthcoming and for wallingford it would not be not only was it the dead of winter but henry was not even in the country still dallying with his new wife in faroff aquitaine rejuvenated and revitalized the bishop gave stephen the rarest sort of smile one of unqualified approval well done stephen the fall of wallingford could be a turning point in your kingship god grant it so stephen said fervently for i cannot lose this war i cannot let my son down henry and eleanors return to poitiers was a hectic one with vassals awaiting them in the great hall petitioners seeking audiences and a vast pile of letters accumulated in their absence for not all of their correspondents had been able to track them on their progress through aquitaine after two days of continuous chaos eleanor decided they both could use some quiet time together and surprised henry with a candlelit supper for two up in their bedchamber henry joked that hed never heard of a mans having a secret tryst with his own wife but he was pleased for privacy was a scarce commodity in their lives over an advent meal of herring and pike they enjoyed a rare luxurya conversation overheard by no others eleanor was able to confide her concern about her widowed sister petronilla had recently suffered another blow for the french king had awarded the wardship of petronilla and raouls young son to waleran beaumont henry in turn complained about his vexing brother geoff having just found out that geoff had been pestering their aunt the abbess mathilde entreating her to intercede with henry on his behalf to get his forfeited castles back why mathilde eleanor asked surely your mother would be the natural choice to mediate betwixt you geoff would not dare approach our mother henry said with a scornful smile he has yet to face her according to her last letter my aunt said she blistered his ears but that is nothing to what mama would have done he told her then of the other news in his mothers letter stephens clash of wills with john marshal at newbury eleanor was riveted by the tale how could any man be so indifferent to his own child marshal is a gambler willing to take great risks even if the odds are not in his favor he proved that when he was trapped in a burning bell tower at wherwell abbey i told you that story love remember im guessing that he was gambling again at newbury this time upon how well he knew stephen a diabolic wager for certes eleanor said shaking her head incredulously with his sons life as the stakes he judged stephen rightly though henry pointed out but at what a cost if he had not i cannot help wondering eleanor said how the boys mother felt about it henryyou would not have hanged the child no henry said leaning over to pour them both more wine i would not but neither would i have threatened to hang him as stephen did that was his great mistake no man ought to make a threat he is not willing to carry out especially a king they were interrupted then by the arrival of a courier from england bearing an urgent message for henry excusing himself he hastened down to the great hall he was gone longer than eleanor had expected the servants had cleared away the dishes and brought up a bowl of costly imported oranges before he returned eleanor had been peeling an orange for him but she set the fruit aside at sight of her husbands face the news was not good he shook his head a desperate appeal from william boterel the castellan of wallingford castle they have been under siege for months and they doubt that they can hold out much longer stephen has seized the bridge so they no longer have a way of getting supplies into the castle and their larders are wellnigh empty this wallingfordis it an important castle henry yes for it controls the upper thames valley but it has more than tactical significance the man who held it brien fitz count was the most steadfast of my mothers supporters it was to wallingford that she fled when she made that miraculous escape from oxford wallingfordwell it came to signify resistance our hope for victory hed begun to pace halting before the hearth he stood for several moments gazing into the flames watching him eleanor already knew what he would do you are going to wallingfords rescue she said you are going to brave a january crossing of the channel and launch a winter campaign you do realize harry how mad that sounds of course i do he said and smiled wryly that is why ill take stephen utterly by surprise the hearth had burned low and embers glowed in the shadows visible from the bed henry leaned over and kissed his wifes throat just below her ear why are you not asleep yet ive a lot to think about she said much of it troubling i intend to invite my sister to stay with me once youve gone she still mourns for raoul and now her son has been taken away from herwhere is the justice in that wellin fairness to louis he probably meant to reward beaumont not to punish petronilla after all how often are women given wardships precisely my point she retorted women are the ones who must bear children suffering the travails of the birthing chamber and indeed often dying to give life and yet we have no say about what happens to the child afterward it would never even have occurred to john marshal to consult his wife ere he dared stephen to hang their son no more than louis cared how he grieved petra by putting her childrens future into the hands of a selfseeking lout like waleran beaumont it is so unfair harry so outrageously unfair henry had honestly never given the matter of wardships much thought his views about women were conflicted as the son of a strongwilled defiantly independent woman in a world that taught him females were inferior meant to be ruled by men following neither the welltraveled road of tradition nor the rocky lonely trail maude had blazed hed found his own path not challenging their societys concept of male dominance but acknowledging individual accomplishments in women like his motheror his wife there is some truth to what you say he conceded made cautious because they were venturing into unmapped territory until now theyd rarely discussed her daughters you are talking too about marie and alixare you not yes she admitted i suppose i am henry propped himself up on his elbow but it was too dark to see her face im sorry he said if i could get them back for you eleanor i would but it is beyond my power and not even a crown will change that i know she said why do you think i mention them so seldom because they are lost to me louis will never allow me to see them and there is nothing i can do about it she turned toward him in the dark seeking his embrace hell teach them to hate me harry and there is nothing i can do about that either henry tightened his arms around her it is not as easy as people think to poison a childs mind during my mothers years in england there were few at my fathers court to speak well of her god knows he did not your marie is older than i was when my mother left us old enough to hold fast to her own memoriesas i did yes but you knew your mother had not abandoned you abandonment will be the least of my maternal sins ill not deny that theyll hear slanderous stories about you but your notoriety might well work to your benefit for youll not be like other discarded wives eleanor to be cast aside and forgotten your daughters will grow up knowing that you are the duchess of aquitaine and normandy and god willing queen of england how can your girls not be curious about you and once they are old enough i think theyll want to find out for themselves what sort of woman you are jesu harry what comfort can i take in that the chance of a reunion twenty years from now but almost at once eleanor regretted her sharpness i am not being fair am i had you offered me empty promises vowed to win them back then id have blamed you for lying to me my nerves are on the raw tonight more so than i realized henry kissed her gently he could not ease her yearning for her daughters but he did have a parting gift for her when you write to your sister ask her to join you at angers not poitiers why i shall ask my mother to watch over normandy in my absence and of course you will continue to govern aquitaine but i would also have you act on my behalf in anjou as hed guessed that pleased her immensely do you trust me as much as that then why not you have sound political sense and good judgment toofor a woman he teased and pretended to wince when she nipped his neck how he was going to miss sharing her bed in the months to come with you and my mother keeping vigil for me ill not have to worry about my fool brother stirring up another revolt without geoff to distract me ill have a better chance of avoiding a heroic martyrs death on some godforsaken english field do not jest about that she chided with a gravity that he found quite flattering she quickly lapsed back though into the bantering levity that was the coin of their marital realm i do not want you to take any needless risks harry i would hate to have to start husbandhunting all over again i doubt that youd have to hunt very hard he said dryly most likely youd find yourself fending off suitors at my wake yawning he drew her into an even closer embrace and soon after fell asleep when he awoke it was almost dawn the fire had gone out and the chamber was cold and damp but eleanors body was warm against his her skin soft to his touch and fragrant with her favorite perfume one that she said put her in mind of summer roses and moonlight and honeysweet sins why was it sinful though to lay with his wife henry could not understand the churchs reasoning why was celibacy so holy carnal lust so sinister even in wedlock it remained suspect for hed heard priests claim that a man sinned if he loved his wife with too much passion if that was true he was putting his immortal soul in peril about twice a night laughing softly to himself henry reached for eleanor eleanor awoke with reluctance for shed been dreaming that she and henry were making love alone in a secluded meadow with scented clover for their bed and a sapphireblue sky for their ceiling shed never done that never made love out in the open under a hot summer sun and her first thought upon awakening was a drowsy regret for all shed missed and then she smiled understanding why her dream had veered off into that meadow now youre seducing me in my dreams too she murmured and laughed when he said that was passing strange for in his dreams she was always the temptress she knew that their honeymoon harmony was not likely to last they were both too selfwilled not to clash occasionally and she did not doubt that they would sail into rough seas at times but she felt quite confident that their marriage bed would always be a safe harbor whether they called it lust or passion or even love what they found together in bed was rare and real and had nothing to do with crowns or kingships she understood how lucky theyd been hoped that he did too hed begun to stroke her thighs and wherever his fingers touched her skin seemed to burn the frigid december dawn receded and she was back in her dream their bodies entwined aware only of each other the urgency of their need and then the shared intensity of their release lying slaked and spent in a tangle of sheets they soon discovered that sexual heat did not linger and they dived shivering under the coverlets where they got into a playful tussle when henry tried to warm his cold feet against her legs that led to the first pillow fight of their marriage which ended abruptly when eleanors greyhound decided to join in the fun after evicting the dog they settled back against the pillows and eleanor told henry about her erotic dream he promised that hed find them a private meadow provided that she was willing to wait for the spring thaw but then they looked at each other their laughter stilled remembering that he would be in england in the spring fighting a war eleanor was quiet for a time after that once he rode away from poitiers who could say how long theyd be apart she dared not wait would have to tell him now harrydo you think there is any chance that you might be back by august i do not know he admitted shifting so he could see her face he gave her a quizzical look his birthday was in march hers in june their anniversary in may what significance did august have in their lives true theyd met for the first time in august but he knew his wife was not sentimental why august he asked and then caught his breath eleanor eleanor had known hed guess the truth he was nothing if not quick yes she said i think i am with child indifferent to gossip they remained abed for most of the morning henry was as solicitous as he was jubilant summoning servants to light the hearth and fetch cider and honeyed bread for their breakfast promising eleanor that hed not be gone a day longer than necessary promising too to bring back a crown for their babe to play with he was so delighted by the prospect of fatherhood that he was quite unfazed when she confessed that she could not be utterly certain yet having missed only one flux so far he blithely insisted that she was right to tell him now that this was news to be shared in bed not to be imparted in a letter he even did his best to assure her that hed not be disappointed if their first child was a girl with such conviction that she almost believed him did you never doubt that i would give you a son no he said emphatically never and this time she did believe him reaching for his hand she laced their fingers together harrydo you not think it is time we owned up to it as cryptic as that might have sounded to others he understood she saw comprehension in his eyes and a certain wariness as he considered his response not surprisingly he settled upon humor you first eleanor was never one to resist a dare all right she agreed i will when i began to confide in my sister about you petra listened and then exclaimed you fancy him she was right i did i did not realize how much though until we were alone in the garden you do remember what happened when we kissed henrys mouth quirked till my dying day i was caught by surprise for fires usually have to be stoked ere they flame up like that i remember telling petra that you and i might be getting more than wed bargained for and the same can be said for our marriage she flashed a sudden smile at once mischievous and tender too i discovered on our wedding night that setting a fire in a rainy garden was childs play compared to the conflagration you could kindle in bed but even then i did not expect to fall in love with youcertainly not so quickly and completely you were supposed to be satisfied with my body not lay claim to my heart too henry leaned over swiftly seeking her mouth she returned the kiss with enthusiasm but when it ended she said your turn you already know he protested you would not have been so candid were you not sure of me that was a shrewd thrust and she acknowledged it as such pride is a shield as well as a sin youre right i would not have been so quick to put it down had i not been convinced id not need it i know that you care harry you prove that in bed and out but i would like the words too so commanding was his selfassurance that she rarely remembered his youth but now she found herself being reminded that he was not yet twenty for hed begun to look distinctly uncomfortable she was not offended by his reluctance for she could understand why he might be leery of letting down his own defenses caught too often in the crossfire of his parents war but shed spoken no less than the truth she did need the words especially now that she faced months of separation and anxiety a lonely pregnancy under the constant threat of widowhood louis was not so tonguetied she gibed sweetly and henry grimaced that was a low blow he complained i am utterly besotted with you woman as anyone with eyes to see could tell is that not enough for you she said nothing greenishgold eyes never leaving his face and he capitulated with a smothered oath i do love you eleanor pulling her into his arms he kissed her again god help me but i do generous in victory she forbore to tease although the temptation was considerable for his declaration of love had sounded almost like a confession it might not be polished or even voluntary but it was heartfelt that she did not doubt shed known from the first that he would never be a man for romantic gestures or pretty speeches so be it then what he could give her mattered far more than the superficial and studied gallantries of courtly love sliding his hand between their bodies he rested it upon her belly so flat and taut that he could not easily envision it swollen with new life i would that i could promise to be back for the birth he said regretfully but i cannot i know she reassured him i do i ask only that you promise to take care harry to remember that your life belongs to me now too after a hurried trip to rouen to bid his mother farewell and to borrow the vast sum of seven thousand pounds from moneylenders henry set sail from barfleur on epiphany eve by dawn his ships were within sight of the dorset coast entering the river frome henrys fleet anchored at wareham after a crossing so rough that the men would have gladly kissed the groundhad a raw sleetladen wind not been blasting across the harbor unloading soldiers and horses was never easy and in weather like this it became a logistical nightmare by the time the first of henrys army came ashore men from the castle were hastening down onto the docks turning at sound of his name henry found himself enveloped in a hearty avuncular embrace holy rood but you feel like a block of ice lad stepping back rainald beamed at his nephew we could not believe it when we first spotted sails on the horizon this must have been the voyage to hell and back close enough henry admitted i am right glad to see you here uncle but surprised too since you had to come all the way from cornwall how were you able to get to wareham so fast my usual good luck i happened to be at bristol with will when he got his summons as rainald glanced back henry saw that his cousin will was coming toward him with another familiar figure at his side roger fitz miles henry greeted them both warmly but he could not help feeling a regretful twinge too for although will was his kinsman and roger his friend he knew neither one of them could hold a candle to their deceased fathers what he would not have given to be waging this campaign with his uncle robert henry remained on the docks for a while supervising the landing the others kept close by hunched deep in their mantles and cursing the cold as they gave him their news they expected the earls of chester and salisbury and ranulf and john marshal to be awaiting him at devizes castle ranulf might be delayed since getting word into wales had been no easy feat why hed chosen to live in the back of beyond rainald would never understand baldwin de redvers would be answering the summons too his health permitting and chesters brother william de roumare was likely to appear as well that was heartening news to henry for his thirtysix ships held only one hundred forty knights and three thousand foot soldiers not a large force to overthrow a king he made a mental note to find out how many men had sailed with his greatgrandfather when william the bastard had invaded england in gods year and then strode down to the waters edge to shout a warning for a young soldier was attempting to unload a horse without blindfolding it first the sleet was giving way to hail and henry finally allowed his kinsmen to escort him up to the castle as loath as he was to admit it he was exhausted very much in need of a blazing fire and a few hours sleep but as they approached the castle pealing church bells began to echo on the stinging sea air calling christs faithful to hear mass on this the holy feast of the epiphany the earl of gloucester at once drew rein we ought to give thanks to god for guiding you safely through that storm harry while henry was in agreement that the almighty deserved his gratitude hed have preferred to tender it after hed been fed and thawed out but he could think of no graceful way of refusing for what sort of impious wretch did not have time for god and so he did not object as his cousin led them into the small benedictine priory east of the castle dismounting in the garth they slipped in a side door of the nave left open for latecomers the church was crowded monks kneeling in the choir townspeople in the nave a few heads turned at their entrance but most kept their eyes upon the priest as he solemnly intoned the introit for the mass behold the lord the ruler cometh and the kingdom is in his hand henrys head came up sharply the response of his companions was far more dramatic they looked at one another in astonishment and then at henry with something approaching awe gods word on high will said softly crossing himself whatdivine prophecy but henrys skepticism merely glanced off wills certainty and he nodded earnestly most men will think so rainald grinned jubilantly for if his one nephew interpreted the priests words as holy writ and the other as fortuitous happenchance he saw them as a political windfall maude must have told you about stephens ominous mishap ere the battle of lincoln harry when his candle broke in his hand during the mass a shiver of foreboding swept through the entire congregation so sure were they that this was an evil omen for a man about to go forth and do battle but that was a puny portent indeed when compared to this so intent were they upon the amazing aptness of gods word that they had forgotten for the moment that they were in gods house as their voices rose people were turning to stare in their direction with disapproving frowns and puzzled mutterings warehams castle had long been an angevin stronghold though and the three earls were known on sight to some of the parishioners those whod recognized the earls soon guessed henrys identity too and once they did their priests words took on a new and fateful significance as they enlightened their neighbors the church was soon in a state of excitement and disquiet henry watched the turmoil in fascination his uncle had been right leaning over he murmured to roger this is a tale to grow with each telling and by the time it reaches stephens ears people will be swearing that an angel of the lord appeared to me in the midst of a burning bush siege of wallingford january steady rain had turned stephens siege encampment into a morass knowing how wretched the roads were stephen was amazed to see william de ypres ride into the camp for after his sight had begun to fail the fleming rarely traveled beyond his own estates but whatever had motivated ypres to venture so far from kent stephen was delighted that he had for the gaunt grizzled old soldier brought back memories of a happier time memories of matilda horse litters were used only by the aged and the infirm and sometimes women most people would have agreed that a blind man could travel in a horse litter without shame but pride was the only crutch william de ypres would permit himself and hed continued to ride as always although his vision had now deteriorated to such an extent that hed reluctantly agreed to let his mount be led theirs was an age in which the blind were too often condemned to a beggars fate but ypres was a very wealthy man able to hire men to act as his eyes and to judge by the conscientious way they watched over him he paid them handsomely the ground was treacherous glazed and pitted and even with their assistance ypres stumbled several times and once almost lost his footing altogether but by then stephen was there guiding him into the shelter of his command tent you remember my son stephen said beckoning his youngest forward to greet the fleming eustace is here too and will be right glad to see you he always did think you walked on water will ypres was trying in vain to warm his hands over the brazier eustace is in england he asked surprised i heard hed crossed over to france again he did but he came back as soon as he got word that henry fitz empress had sailed from barfleur so it is true then maudes son has come in answer to the wallingford garrisons plea i was not sure if the rumors could be trusted it has been my experience stephen said wryly that rumors and falsehoods are kin more often than not but this time they speak true will well ypres said after a brief silence the lad does not lack for backbone does he he comes by it honestly stephen said generously for ive known few men who could match maudes grit but grit alone is not enough as her son is about to learn all his strongholds are in the west which means hell have to make a long and dangerous march clear across england in the midst of winter through shires hostile to him whilst lugging along food for his army since hell not be able to live off the land and if and when he does reach wallingford ill be waiting for him god willing ill be able to end this accursed war at last thered been a time when stephen would have sounded jubilant in predicting victory now he just sounded tired god willing ypres echoed knowing that they were both thinking of matilda cheated of what shed most wantedto see peace finally come to her husbands realm stephen tilted his head listening and then rose ill be back he announced and ducked under the tent flap riders were dismounting stumbling toward the closest fire i thought i heard your voice stephen said moving toward his eldest son you found nothing out of the ordinary nothing we circled the entire camp spoke with all the sentries theyre as edgy as bridalnight virgins flinching at shadows as if they expect fitz empress to come charging over the hill at any moment itll get worse ere it gets better come back with me to the tent youll not believe who rode into camp this afternoonnone other than will de ypres stephen was startled by the look that crossed his sons face one of dismay eustace i thought youd be pleased you always seemed so fond of him eustace shrugged how could he explain that he was loath to see ypres for that very reason because the man had once loomed so large in his life it was painful to see what hed been reduced to this man whod once been feared by so many it was like looking upon a lamed stallion able only to hobble about when once it could race the wind he glanced at his fathers puzzled face then away fumbling for an excuse to avoid the fleming but then he heard the shouting stephen heard it too and felt a sudden unease a lone rider was coming in much too fast within the tent ypres found himself alone with stephens younger son the fleming had never had any dealings with will whose childhood had coincided with ypress tenure as the kings mainstay the queens confidant doing some mental math he concluded that will was nigh on nineteen although he seemed younger untested ypres had heard it said that hed inherited a goodly measure of stephens affability he hoped the lad had gotten some of matildas mettle too may i ask you something will spoke up suddenly his curiosity getting the better of him can you see anything at all the question was oddly childlike direct and without artifice and ypres answered in kind in one eye nothing in the other i can still distinguish light and shadowfor now will nodded solemnly but then he stiffened did you hear that yelling id best find out what its about straining to hear ypres could make out only a babble of rising voices once he would have been in the midst of the action now he must wait until someone remembered to return and tell him what was happening it felt at times as if the very center of his world had become hollow and try as he might to fill it with faith the emptiness lingered he was not sure why his faith was not enough although he suspected that it was because it had come to him so late in life if he were god hed look askance too at deathbed conversions no matter what the priests might tell him piety must lose some of its lustre when it was not altogether voluntary it was will who eventually brought ypres the news that had set the camp in such an uproar malmesbury castle is under siege he reported breathlessly the castellan sent my father an urgent plea for aid saying the town has fallen to henry fitz empress and the castle is like to fall too unless the king comes to their rescue ypres showed no surprise hed been half expecting something like this i see he said laconically and will looked at him in bemusement well i do not the youth admitted it sounds to me like papa and the others are going to abandon the siege and i do not understand why i thought wallingford mattered it does its fall would be a severe blow to the angevins the trouble is lad that malmesburys fall would be a great setback toofor us it is the only royal stronghold of note left to stephen in the west losing it would hurt us fully as much as wallingfords loss would hurt henry fitz empress will frowned wellwould not the loss of the one offset the other we take wallingford let them take malmesburycheck and mate unfortunately it is not that simple you see the king cannot afford to ignore a challenge to his authority lest others see that as weakness if he did hed risk losing more than malmesbury but that is not fair if henry makes papa come to him well forfeit all the advantages we would have had at wallingford when ypres nodded will edged closer my lord ypresdo you think my father is a good battle commander indeed he is ypres agreed reassuring will by how readily he answered he is one of the best ive seen leaving unsaid his private conviction that if stephen were not his kingship would never have survived this long given how inept hed proved to be at statecraft will hesitated what of henry fitz empress is he a good battle commander too yes lad ypres said grimly it is beginning to look as if he is despite the wet frigid weather and the washedout roads stephen responded to malmesburys peril with commendable speed accompanied by those barons still loyal to him he approached malmesbury from the north along the cirencester road his scouts had warned stephen that the river avon was running high but by the time his army made camp darkness had fallen over the frozen wiltshire countryside and it was not until the morning that he discovered the full extent of the flooding the february dawn was stormdarkened sleet and gusting winds assailing the kings men with unrelenting ferocity as stephen rode out to inspect the river avon the tetbury branch of the avon narrowed as it flowed around malmesbury and was usually as easily forded as any stream despite the warning by his scouts stephen was unprepared for the sight that now met his eyes the heavy rains had transformed the placid avon into a churning cauldron wide and deep and dangerous spilling over its banks it swallowed up adjoining fields sweeping uprooted trees along on its current as if they were twigs occasionally the men glimpsed a halfsubmerged body drowned rabbits and badgers an exhausted foundering deer a dogs bloated corpse stephen reined in his stallion gazing out upon the floodwaters with consternation beside him he heard men cursing the wind was stinging iced with sleet and they soon turned back toward their camp fortunately the wind muffled the sounds of altercation coming from stephens tent for he would not have wanted this dissension to be overheard by his soldiers he was stunned by the resistance he was encountering it had never occurred to him that he might have to battle henry fitz empress natures fury and his own barons too but that was proving to be the case led by robert beaumont earl of leicester they were arguing against launching an attack upon malmesbury the earls of derby and arundel were most vocal in beaumonts support but the earls of oxford and warwick were murmuring muted agreement too only eustace and the earl of northampton showed any zeal for the upcoming battle william de martel and stephens younger son took no active part in the discussion they would do whatever stephen willed and in the shadows william de ypres listened in silence to the discord swirling about him it would be folly to attempt an assault upon malmesbury under these circumstances robert beaumont insisted calmly he had none of his twins flamboyance had always been overshadowed by waleran and had seemed content that it was so but in the years since walerans selfimposed exile from england robert had come into his own and his sober reasoned argument was falling on receptive ears sensing that eustace focused his energies and his anger upon beaumont saying scornfully just why do you think we marched on malmesbury my lord to admire the winter countryside that would have provoked a heated retort from waleran but robert retained his composure even his manners we had no way of knowing that the river would be impassable he pointed out coolly now that we do it behooves us to reconsider i do not see how it will advance the kings cause to lose half our army in the avon if robert fitz roy had been so leery of getting his feet wet in the fossedyke eustace riposted thered have been no battle of lincoln now would there would that not have been for the best his brother asked not meaning to be sarcastic blushing when several of the men snickered and eustace glared at him william daubigny interceded before eustace could turn upon his discomfited brother i do not believe this is a battle we can win he confessed glancing apologetically toward stephen even if we get across the avon the wind is coming from the south theyd have it at their backs whilst wed be getting hit in the face with sleet and icy rain it is asking a lot of men to fight under conditions like that would it not be wiser to wait for wait for whatthe spring thaw eustace raged or for some of you to find your misplaced manhood that much time we cannot spare robert beaumont remained coldly impassive but the hottempered earl of derby took immediate offense and stephen was forced to intervene it is obvious that well do no fighting this day if we must wait upon the weather so be it the squabbling subsided but the ill will remained and nothing had been resolved stephen was shaken by what hed witnessed eustaces gibes to the contrary these men were not craven but neither were they eager to do battle on his behalf was it truly just the vile weather that daunted them my liege william de ypres had risen to his feet groping for his cane these old bones stiffen up in cold like this may i ask you to summon my attendants so they can escort me back to my own tent stephen was astonished unable to believe hed just heard william de ypres of all men complaining of his infirmities and asking for help after a moments reflection he realized what the fleming was up to itll be easier he said to take you myself brushing aside other offers for he knew that ypres wanted an opportunity to confer with him alone sleet was bombarding the camp the wind tearing at the tents making life miserable for men and horses alike stephen gripped the flemings arm tightly steering him around the worst of the muddy sloughs but ypres stopped just before they reached his tent my men are within he said and what i have to tell you cannot be overheard weve braved worse perils together than winter weather stephen said what is it will i can no longer wield a sword for you but i can still be your ears my liege that is the real reason i asked to accompany you on this march so that my men might listen and watch and learn theyre quite good at it as well they ought to be for that was what i hired them for and what they have told me is that you dare not fight on the morrow you have more to fear than a flooded river what are you saying will that i ought to fear treachery no id not go that far your camp is rife with rumors though supposedly some of your barons have been in secret communication with henry fitz empress there is no proof to speak of but id not dismiss these stories out of hand who stephen demanded and ypres shrugged i would that i had evidence to offer but i do not should you mistrust beaumont because he keeps aloof from your court or because he wed his daughter to the earl of gloucester was he seeking a wealthy husband for his girl or a link to the angevin camp for himself or both and what of that private peace made between the earls of derby and chester is that cause for suspicion i wish i knew but it would take a soothsayer to sort it all out what i can say for a certainty is that these men have no stomach for this particular battlewhatever their reasons if you force them into it theyll follow you but i do not trust them to hold fast if the battle turns against you stephen sucked in his breath lincoln he said hoarsely and for an unsettling moment it was almost as if he were reliving that nadir of his kingship abandoned on the field by the men he had most reason to trust ypres nodded just so my liege i think theyd bolt at the first hint of trouble a sudden blast of wind blew back stephens hood and he grasped at it with frozen fingers but what would you have me do will how can i retreat without doing battle how can i lose face like that would you rather lose your crown ypres asked bluntly you cannot risk it how many lincolns can you hope to survive stephen it was the first time that hed ever called stephen by his given name stephen looked at him realizing with relief just how much he trusted this aging unscrupulous mercenary before he could respond though another voice cut into their conversation as sharply as any sword thrust i cannot believe it the wind had covered the sound of eustaces approach his hood had fallen back and the rain had plastered his hair to his skull running in rivulets down his face his skin was reddened and chapped by the cold but he seemed oblivious to the storm staring first at his father and then accusingly at ypres that you would betray us like this when i was a lad ii thought you were a godsend my fathers champion his voice choked more fool i for forgetting what you really werea man selling his soul to the highest bidder how much is henry paying you this time eustace you are wrong but stephens protest went unheeded his son had already spun on his heel willwill i am sorry ill make him understand even in his agitation stephen did not forget ypress need and he hastily led the other man the few remaining steps toward his tent before plunging after his son ypres caught hold of the tent moorings and stood motionless for several moments shivering in the freezing rain he could do nothing for matildas son his kingship was already lost the best they could hope for now was to try to save stephens tottering throne the fleming was sure matilda would have understood he was just as sure stephen did not at least not yet but eustace did the fear in his voice told ypres that he understood all too well a wan february sun flitted between clouds providing little warmth but still a welcome sight to the winterweary residents of wiltshire ranulf and his welshmen were pleased to see it too for as inured as the welsh were to wet weather their journey from wales had tested even their proverbial hardihood but they were young eager for excitement and plunder and their spirits rose as soon as the road started to dry out ranulfs mood was less festive if ever hed viewed war as an adventure those days were long gone as they rode south he was preoccupied and tense spurred on by concern for his wife and child back in wales and increasingly anxious for his nephew as his hopes faltered that hed reach malmesbury in time ranulf approached malmesbury therefore with some degree of trepidation not knowing what theyd find sure only that hed never forgive himself if evil had befallen henry in his absence as theyd ploughed their way along the waterlogged roads of wales and western england hed done his best to reassure himself that henry would be a match for stephen stories of henrys spectacular summer campaign against the french king had penetrated even into the mountain fastness of eryri and hed eventually gotten glowing reports from maude rainald and his niece in chester as well as a firsthand account from henry himself but as proud as he was of his nephews growing fame he could not banish a nagging unease for he knew what a capable commander stephen was much to ranulfs amazement by the time he reached malmesbury it was all over stephen and henry had agreed to a truce and stephen had then pulled back his army without ever taking the field north of the avon stephens camp was deserted nothing remaining but the charred ashes of quenched fires and mounds of rubbish strewn about within malmesbury itself the mood was mixed for henrys soldiers jubilation and for most of the citizens relief at least for those not mourning loved ones slain in the capture of the town the truce was all that people were talking about and ranulf had no trouble learning the termsterms as favorable to henry as they were detrimental to stephen it had been agreed that stephen would retreat a battle would be avoided and henry would halt his siege of malmesbury castle stephens castellan would then raze the castle to the ground thus denying the stronghold to both sides and stephen in turn had agreed to end the continuing siege of wallingford nor to assault it again for six months ranulf was astounded by what his nephew had accomplisheda reprieve for wallingford and a humiliating setback for stephenall without a battles being fought once he finally located henry walking in the cloisters with the abbot of malmesburys great benedictine abbey of st mary and st aldhelm he wasted no time congratulating his nephew upon his brilliant and bloodless victory he knew at once that hed trod amiss for the stately abbot stiffened then excused himself so abruptly that ranulf realized hed somehow offended ranulf was not left alone with henry for long as abbot peter stalked away rainald came barreling up the walkway toward them but ranulf had not forgotten the abbots odd reaction and once boisterous greetings had been exchanged with his brother he asked henry why the abbot had seemed so irate because my victory was not bloodless for the townspeople or the monks malmesbury has long been a royal stronghold for stephen and when we attacked some of the citizens joined the castle garrison in the towns defense we were able though to get over the walls with scaling ladders most of the garrison managed to reach safety within the castle but some of them fled into the abbey our men followed and blood was spilled in the church itself ranulf crossed himself no wonder the abbot was wroth it was even worse than you think uncle not only were some of the men seeking refuge in the church slain but so were a few monks whod tried to intervene henry shook his head in remembered anger breton mercenariesall they know is killing ah but youd have been so proud of our nephew ranulf rainald interjected harry acted at once to reassure the monks and townspeople whilst also showing our men what would happen to those who dared shed blood in gods house what did you do harry ranulf was relieved that henry had taken action and curious to know what hed done for one of the most vexing challenges facing a battle commander was how to keep his army under control some did not try very hard geoffrey had been one of those others deliberately encouraged their soldiers to commit cruelties as one more weapon of war the way the earl of chester had turned his men loose on lincoln even commanders like robert fitz roy who did attempt to rein in their troops were not always successful i got rid of them henry said i do not expect soldiers to act like holy monks but id warned them that id not abide sacrilege or wanton killing if the bretons are not yet out of england they soon will be i sent them under guard to bristol to be put on the first available ship back to normandy the only thing worse than keeping them bloodyhanded in my hire would have been for them to turn up next in eustaces service as they talked theyd been walking briskly back toward the abbey guest hall ranulf explained that hed been delayed first by family illnessthe night before he was to depart his young son had been stricken with a high feverand then by the sorry state of the roads henry and rainald gave him a more detailed account of their assault and revealed their immediate plans to remain at malmesbury just long enough to make sure that stephens castellan would follow through with the order to destroy the castle and then head for bristol for with wallingford no longer in immediate danger they could take their time in deciding where they should strike next henry paused just as they reached the hall it could not have been easy for you uncle ranulf riding away from your wife and son not knowing how long youd be gone ill not forget that you may be sure introduce me to eleanor and well call it even ranulf said and henry pushed him laughing into the hall within it was full of familiar faces and ranulf spent the next quarter hour greeting friends and kinfolk he was heartened to see how many of englands barons had responded to henrys summons and as he glanced about the noisy crowded hall it seemed to him that he could almost see the benevolent ghosts of his brother robert miles and brien watching in satisfaction from the shadows laughing at his own sentimentality he elbowed his way back to his nephews side why do you think stephen balked at doing battle with you harry the talk i heard in the town was that he was thwarted by the winter storm and flooding but there has to be more to it than that youd be loath to fight too rainald said smugly if you had to keep looking over your shoulder ranulfs eyes narrowed was that it harry did stephen distrust his own barons he asked and henry shrugged youd have to ask stephen he said but then he grinned it would not surprise me though it was clear to ranulf that his nephew knew more than he was willing to admit at least in public he asked no more questions content to wait until henry was ready to confide in him and followed his nephew as they started toward the high table being set up on the dais trestle tables had already been brought in and men began to wander over claiming their seats for dinner but before henry reached the dais jordan de foxley malmesburys castellan was ushered into the hall henry greeted him amiably for he had no personal animosity toward the man whod only been doing his duty as a soldier youre welcome to join us for dinner sir jordan afterward we can discuss your plans for razing the castle kneeling before henry the castellan said low and urgent thank you my lord duke but i have need to speak with you now if you spare me a few moments i can assure you that youll not regret it it was deftly done and many in the hall did not even notice henrys discreet departure although they did wonder why dinner was being delayed they were not kept long in suspense less than half an hour had elapsed before henry returned to the hall strode up onto the dais and called for silence i have just met with the castellan of malmesbury castle he announced and i am pleased to inform you that he has offered to turn the castle over to me intact and whole henry got no further whatever else hed been about to say was drowned out by a burst of cheering dinner was forgotten for some time afterward the hall was in tumult a scene of triumphant and raucous celebration ranulf watched from the dais as the castellan was escorted back into the hall this time to be greeted as a hero by henrys elated barons in the course of this war there had been many defections some men had switched sides more than once ranulf sensed that this defection was different though that the malmesbury castellans action was a straw in the wind he dearly loved his nephew and wanted very much to see henry as englands king but he could not help the words that came unbidden now to his lips too softly to be overheard poor stephen henry celebrated his twentieth birthday at bristol planning the next stage of his campaign soon after easter he was joined by robert beaumont the earls holdings included more than thirty fortified castles scattered throughout the midlands strongholds now put at henrys disposal as this powerful and cautious lord publicly allied himself with the angevin cause formally acknowledging maudes son as the rightful heir to the english throne siege of wallingford july henry resumed his campaign after the spring thaw he suffered a loss in maythe death of an ally and kinsman the scots kingbut he experienced no setbacks upon the field he captured berkeley castle then laid siege to the earl of derbys stronghold at tutbury and once that castle fell the earl renounced his allegiance to stephen henry then gained control of warwick castle having reached an understanding with the countess a halfsister of henrys new ally robert beaumont the earl of warwick was so distressed by his wifes action that when he died soon afterward it was commonly believed that his sudden demise was due to shame and grief after occupying coventry and visiting leicester and sacking bedford henry then headed toward wallingfordand a final reckoning with stephen stephen had built a countercastle across the river from wallingford at crowmarsh henrys first assault upon crowmarsh won the outer bailey but the garrison rallied and drove his men back henry and his army then settled down to lay siege to the castle waiting for stephen once again two enemy armies were confronting each other across a river this time it was the thames at stephens approach henry issued a challenge to do battle one stephen had every intention of accepting with his eldest son at his side he rode out to inspect his troops his was the larger army and although he knew that was no guarantee of victory he felt a reassuring surge of optimism as he looked upon his men well fight at dawn he told eustace and youll command the vanguard that was an honour eustace felt he deserved but it pleased him that his father thought so too all ive ever wanted he said earnestly is to meet maudes whelp on the field and teach him a lethal lesson in what manhood is all about by this time tomorrowpapa it happened without warning seemingly without reason stephens horse reared up suddenly forelegs flailing at the sky and then began to buck wildly caught off balance stephen was pitched over the stallions head when the bishop of winchester and the earl of arundel were ushered into william de ypress tent he dismissed his attendants so they could confer in private not that there were any secrets left to guard there was not a man in the camp still unaware of what had happened that afternoon stephen had been thrown from his horse not just once but three times in succession as stephen was known to be a skilled rider and his mount was a welltrained and battleseasoned stallion those whod witnessed the kings mishap were at a loss to explain itexcept as an ominous portent of disaster what the bishop and the earl had come to tell ypres he already knew for his men had been canvassing the camp for hours seeking to gauge the level of unease and so when the bishop said that stephens odd accident had spooked his soldiers fully as much as the stallion ypres interrupted impatiently lets get to the heart of the matter that skittish horse is not the reason why our men are balking it is merely an excuse the kings men were already loath to fight for him hed half expected the bishop to argue with him but stephens brother surprised him showed that he could hear the truth without flinching what you mean he said is that they are loath to fight against henry fitz empress against the man they want as their next king and there it was out in the open at last his shoulders slumping the bishop sat down wearily on ypress coffer the earl of arundel hovered by the tents entrance fidgeting with the hilt of his sword ypres did not need to see his face to envision his discomfort for he knew william daubigny to be an essentially decent man but one without imagination or initiative caught up like so many others in a civil war not of his making a war that had bled england white for far too many years it was time to put an end to it ypres knew that was what matilda would have wanted but would she have understood that peace could not come without sacrificing her son the bishop roused himself at last glancing first at the edgy arundel and then at the impassive fleming how are we going to convince stephen stephen had retired to his tent to nurse his bruises puzzled and embarrassed by his stallions erratic behavior but not alarmed for it had not occurred to him that men might find dire significance in his triple fall he was utterly unprepared therefore for the message his brother and william de ypres were attempting to deliverthat there could be no battle on the morrow i dare not fight because a horse threw me he said incredulously you cannot be serious i am hardly noted for my humor now am i bishop henry said irritably stephen i assure you that never have i been more serious i am going to be brutally blunt about this for i know no other way to do it youve always liked your truth and your wine sweetened but all the sugar in christendom could not make this easier for you to swallow your barons do not want to fight henry fitz empress and if you force them to follow you into the field i very much fear youll have reason to regret it stephen stared at his brother stunned by what he was hearing they think i have been such a bad king for all of the bishops bold talk of brutal bluntness he could not bring himself to give stephen an honest answer to that question he chose to dodge the blow deferring to ypres the fleming displayed a soldiers skill at deflection for he did not answer stephens plaintive query either instead he said my liege do you not see you won your war against maude the fight is now over the succession in the past your barons have fought and bled and died to keep you on the throne but they are not willing to risk death for eustace they fear the sort of king he would beand in truth so do i that was a truth though that stephen could not accept he immediately launched into an impassioned defense of his son with such vehemence that they suspected he was attempting to quell his own inner doubts about eustaces fitness to rule but neither the bishop nor the fleming would relent not with so much at stake they took turns pointing out to stephen just how precarious his position was henry enjoyed the support of the church the archbishop of canterbury was even now in his siege encampment unlike stephen he had the wholehearted support of his barons and vassals including the earls of chester leicester gloucester hereford salisbury and cornwall and more and more public opinion was shifting in his favor people had heard about the epiphany day prophecy men claimed that at malmesbury even the wind had been henrys ally was it surprising then that soldiers would react with superstitious dread when stephen was unhorsed three times before doing battle with his rival need they remind him that men who expected to be defeated usually were need they remind him of lincoln when theyd exhausted all their other arguments ypres and the bishop were forced to make the most painful one of all men did not yet know henry fitz empress all that well but what theyd so far seen of him they liked they did know eustace and liked him not throughout england hed earned himself a reputation for courage but also for cruelty and arrogance and vengefulness men might have accepted him as king had they been given no choice but they would not fight to make him king eventually stephen stopped arguing with them no matter what they said though he kept repeating stubbornly i will not betray my son and nothing seemed likely to break the impasse for stephens paternal instincts were stronger than those for selfpreservation surprisingly it was the earl of arundel who found a solution he and the earl of northampton had entered the tent in answer to the bishops summons hed hoped that stephen would be swayed by the realization that even the steadfast northampton would rather negotiate than fight but northamptons gruff plea had fallen on deaf ears it was arundel who saw what these men more clever than he had not that stephen would grasp at any alternative which avoided an outright repudiation of his son we are not asking you to make peace with henry fitz empress my liege we seek only a truce no more than that so many lives have already been lost would it not be better to talk rather than bleedjust this once if the talks come to naught what have we lost it was a disingenuous argument for to seek a truce would be a damaging admission of weakness on stephens part but it offered stephen what he so desperately neededa reprieve however brief time in which to try to find a way to save his sons kingship so be it he said dully but what makes you think henry will agree to a truce his brother was not about to give stephen a chance to change his mind lets find out although some moments had passed since henry had stalked out in a fury the impact of his anger still smoldered it was the first time that most of the men had seen henrys temper at full blaze and theyd found it to be a sobering sight only the earl of chester was impervious to the heat for hed been on the safe side of the fire like henry hed wanted to scorn the offer of a truce and seek a battlefield resolution but the others had all counseled caution urging henry to agree to the truce and enter into negotiations arguing that thered been enough killing unable to make any inroads or win any converts henry finally lost patience and departed leaving behind dismay and disquiet when henrys cousin will suggested tentatively that one of them must follow after henry and make him see reason there were murmurings of agreement but no volunteers i will talk to him the archbishop of canterbury said resolutely feeling it was only fair for no one had pressed henry harder to make peace than he nay my lord archbishop let my brother go rainald nudged ranulf with his elbow then winked we can spare him easier than you ranulf jabbed back but he did not object to being offered up as a sacrificial lamb for he knew his nephew better than that ill go he agreed but not yet itll be better if he comes around on his own to our way of thinking the archbishop looked suddenly hopeful are you so sure that he will yes ranulf said i am you see our future king has a hot temper but a cool head when he did seek henry out later he found his confidence had not been misplaced henry was inspecting a partially constructed belfry tower intended to be used in the assault upon crowmarshs outer walls work upon it had been suspended at the approach of stephens army from the way henry was bantering with the soldiers it was clear to ranulf that the crisis was past do i need a white flag henry shook his head did you all draw lots to see which one got to soothe my ruffled feathers i insisted upon the honour you know ive always been a glutton for punishment ranulf said and fell in step beside his nephew following henry away from the belfry out of earshot of the soldiers can you understand uncle ranulf why i wanted to fight of course i can if you defeat stephen on the field of battle the crown is yours for the takinghere and now no concessions no compromises no waiting but a lot more blood youre supposed to twist my arm henry objected not break it i know we must accept their offer of a truce i am not convinced that i can bargain for the crown instead of fighting for it but at least we have to try i was sure that youd agree ranulf admitted but i am right glad to hear you say so lad with the church and common sense on your side what else could i do henry smiled tightly without much humor uncleyou know stephen as well as any man alive do you truly think he will agree to disinherit his son not willingly no but he cannot fight you and his brother and barons too it may take a while but i think hell eventually be forced to it i would never agree henry said thinking of his unborn child in less than a fortnight eleanors lyingin would begin but not only could he not be with her hed have to wait weeks to find out if shed borne him a son if she and the babe were well more women died in childbed than men did on the battlefield eleanor was strong and healthy but so was his mother and shed almost died giving birth to geoff frustrated and thwarted compelled to do what he most hated in all the wordwaithe swore suddenly with feeling i tell you this uncle that id pawn my soul to the devil for a chance to shed blood on the morrow provided that it was eustaces nor would i be loath to see some of stephens spilled too but it seems it is not to benot yet ranulf sympathized for he knew that his sister and nephew saw this bloody and ruinous civil war in stark and simple termsas evil that had sprouted from one poisonous seed the usurpation of their crown to others it might matter that stephen had been consecrated as englands king anointed with the sacred chrism that forever set a king apart from other men that alone was enough to make some reluctant to see him deposed but to henry it counted for nothing as a fraud born of a theft the urge to avenge his mothers wrongs raced in tandem with his own mettlesome ambitions and it could not be easy to rein in either of them ranulf felt enormously proud of his nephew now that he was willing to try no more talk about pawning souls though he joked not in the archbishops hearing anyway you do not want to remind him that the devils daughter roosts in a branch of your family tree do you that got a grin from henry and ranulf reached out clouting the man fondly on the shoulder you are twenty and stephen fiftyseven time is your ally harry not his and as unhappy as you are with this truce just think how eustace must feel eustace wait stay and hear me out it is true that i agreed to ask for a truce but only because they gave me no choice i have no intention though of bargaining with maudes son that i swear to you lad upon your sweet mothers soul do not besmirch mamas memory with your lies eustace was drunk on despair the very ground seemed to be shifting under his feet and all he had to hold on to was his rage you betrayed me admit it i know you mean to make a deal with that angevin hellspawn but what sort of man would disown his own son will you listen to me i agreed to a truce nothing more i would never betray you our men have lost heart for further fighting but we can remedy that together we can find a way eustace to restore their faith in you but you must trust me for i cannot do it alone trust you what a sour joke that is youd give your last coin to a beggar by the roadside even if it meant your own would starve by the time maudes accursed son is done with you youll be plucked clean and thanking him for leaving you a chamber pot to piss in old man but youll not barter away my birthright by all thats holy you will not ill see you both in hell first stephen caught his arm as he swung away but eustace jerked free and within moments hed disappeared into the darkness beyond stephens tent badly shaken stephen deemed it best not to follow they both needed time to calm down before their healing could begin it was a sensible decision but one he would soon come to lament for in the morning he discovered that eustace was gone he had ridden off in the night leaving stephen with an anguished regret that his sons last words to him had been a curse the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of winchester negotiated a fortnights truce under terms beneficial to henry stephen and henry agreed to lift the sieges of wallingford and crowmarsh stephen also consented to raze his castle at crowmarsh and henry permitted its eightyman garrison to march out unharmed but the preliminary efforts to end the war by mediation did not progress well eustace cast a long shadow eustace soon made his presence felt in a far more ominous way gathering a large band of mercenaries he rode north into cambridgeshire and began to pillage and rob whether he was simply venting his own fury and frustration or seeking to bait henry into coming after him no one knew for certain possibly not even eustace himself but the skies over cambridgeshire were once again darkening with smoke as in the wretched days when geoffrey de mandeville had rampaged through that unhappy shire the monks of bury st edmunds knew that eustaces army was on the prowl and getting closer for panicked refugees had been streaming into the monastery for days abbot ording continued to hope though that his abbey would be spared for st edmunds tomb was englands most sacred shrine surely the kings son would not allow his brutal hirelings to desecrate such holy ground hed held to that hope right up to the moment that a terrified lay brother stumbled into the chapter house crying out that eustaces men had been sighted on the cantebrigge road heading for their abbey when eustace rode into the abbey precincts he found abbot ording waiting for him flanked by his prior and hospitaller with the other brothers huddled a few steps behind the abbot sought to ward off disaster with a wan welcoming smile they were indeed honoured he said to have the count of boulogne as their guest again and hed already given orders to prepare his own quarters for the counts comfort just as hed done at the counts visit last year with his lord father the king their cook was busy making a dinner sure to be to the counts liking fresh pike from their fish pond and a special delicacy rabbit stew eustace seemed taken aback and the abbot prayed that their feeble defensehospitalitywould hold was it too much to hope for that if eustace was treated as a guest hed act like one but this eustace bore little resemblance to the privileged unhappy youth the abbot remembered unkempt and almost gaunt blue eyes bloodshot and suspicious this was no pampered kings son the abbot had seen men like this before men haunted and hunted some of them brigands and bandits others merely victims of bad luck but all of them with nothing left to lose thank you my lord abbot i would be pleased to dine with you and your brethren but if eustace had been surprised into civility he had not been dissuaded from his purpose but first we have a matter of money to discuss i am running short of funds to pay my troops i am sure though that i can rely upon the generosity of your abbey he named a sum then that caused the monks to gasp the abbot had gone ashen my lord thatthat is a vast amount of money eustace smiled chillingly you are too modest my lord abbot so prosperous an abbey could easily spare that much in fact id say it was a bargain indeed in view of what youd be gainingthe favor of a future king my lord count i swear that youve been misled even if our revenues were twice what they are we would not be able to raise such a sum a muscle twitched in eustaces cheek and his smile became a grimace think you that i am some green callow stripling to be put off with soft words and honeyed lies all know that you black monks have even more money than the jews i entreat you the abbot began hoarsely but his prior could no longer keep silent well past sixty too old to be intimidated he glowered at this intruder in their midst his high reedy voice cracking with indignation not fear there can be no greater crime than to steal from almighty god look to your immortal soul son of stephen ere it is too late the prior might have lacked the majestic presence of an abbot bernard but he did make an impressive sight tonsured silver hair streaming down onto the somber black cowl of the benedictine order cobaltblue eyes aiming at eustace like arrows a clenched fist upraised as if to invoke the almightys intercession for a brief moment eustace looked at the aged monk and then he turned in the saddle saying to his men take whatever we need whatever you want at first the monks offered no resistance watching in appalled silence as eustaces soldiers plundered and despoiled their abbey the stables were hit first and then the storehouses abbot ordings lodgings too were stripped bare the guest hall the monks dorters the kitchen and bakehouse and buttery even the infirmaryall were ransacked the looting soon spilled over into the town and smoke began to stain the cloudless august sky somewhere a woman was screaming abbot ording flinched away from the sound groping for his rosary this was his domain the townspeople too were under his protection and yet he could do nothing for them his eyes blurred with tears and he sank to his knees in the dust praying to st edmund to protect his own when some of the soldiers emerged from the church laden with chalices and expensive altar cloths and st edmunds special silver candlesticks there were gasps of outrage from the monks at sight of the pyx holy receptacle for the host now tucked under a brigands arm several of the younger monks could not contain their fury and rushed at the offender only to be beaten down into the dirt by his comrades for mercenaries rarely held monks in much esteem do not resist them the abbot cried crouching over one of his bruised and dazed monks he pillowed a bleeding head in his lap staring up at the kings son whitefaced and accusing st edmund will punish you for the evil you have done you have sinned against him and against the almighty and for that there can be no forgiveness there was a time when eustace would have been dismayed and alarmed by the abbots words now he did not care what did gods curse matter when compared to the loss of a crown tell your st edmund to do his worst he said mockingly his men laughed impressed by his bravado but the monks shuddered and abbot ording made the sign of the cross stephen had easily captured the north sea port town of ipswich and for the past ten days hed been besieging hugh bigods castle the siege was faring well but he was not he sought to fill all his waking hours with enough activity to keep from thinking of his renegade son and crippled kingship only to lie wakeful and wretched night after endless night the bishop of winchester was no longer with him having gone off to consult again with his erstwhile adversary the archbishop of canterbury stephen might have admired his brothers newfound zeal for peacemaking had he not known that any proposed peace plan must of necessity involve a repudiation of eustace but the others in his dwindling inner circle were here at ipswich the earls of arundel and oxford william martel his younger son will and even william de ypres again exposing himself to the rigors of the road and the pity of others for stephens sake and yet never had stephen felt so isolated so utterly alone the blows had been coming in swift succession giving him no time to recover his bearings eustaces rebellious flight had been followed by the sudden death of one of the few men stephen truly trusted simon de senlis earl of northampton and as he mourned his old comradeinarms word began to filter into suffolk of eustaces outlaw raids tales of crops burned in the fields and villages torched culminating in last weeks outrage at bury st edmunds horrified and heartsick stephen refused to discuss his sons marauding with any of his men forcing them to join him in a conspiracy of silence in which it was tacitly understood that as long as eustaces banditry was not acknowledged nothing need be done about it before the others stephen stubbornly held his peace alone in the night he prayed for his son to come to his senses and he grieved after occupying the town stephen had found lodgings at holy trinity a small priory of augustinian canons hed returned this monday at dusk after another long tiring day at the siege site although he knew the others were waiting for him in the guest hall he slumped down in a chair by the window at times he found it hard to remember why it mattered whether he took this castle or not hed been told that henry had gone north that he was now laying siege to william peverels castle at stanford apparently as a favor to the earl of chester he wondered if it ever occurred to henry that they were playing a peculiar form of chess a castle taken here another lost there and the game went on he was turning away when several men raced past the window running flatout on a hot august evening when even a brisk walk would work up a sweat he leaned out saw nothing in the gathering dusk but the oddness of it lingered and when william martel entered a few moments later he commented upon it half humorously to the seneschal i just saw two of the black canons sprinting across the garth theyre usually so protective of their dignity but these lads were kicking up so much dust youd swear satan had come calling william martel did not return his smile it is eustace stephen froze what of him he is here my liege he just rode into the priory their shouting had carried beyond the chamber out into the garth where men gathered to listen when stephen and eustace finally emerged their covert audience scattered in haste but neither man noticed so caught up were they in their private war stephen kept staring at this stranger who was his son unable to admit that there was nothing left to be said hed raged and cursed and then pleaded but hed gotten no answers from eustace only angry abuse eustace had offered neither explanations nor apology for what hed done hed come back he said defiantly because if he were not here to defend his rights no one else would and for stephen that was the most painful of his wounds that eustace had been so quick to believe in his betrayal eustace stumbled as they entered the hall jostling his father and only then did stephen realize how much his son had been drinking but he found a small measure of comfort in that if eustace had not dared to face him sober how could he be as unrepentant as he claimed their entrance killed all conversation several of the augustinian canons were present but not for long for as soon as eustace came through the door they made a hasty exit stephens men seemed no less hostile than the canons although they at least attemptedhowever poorlyto hide their antipathy eustace raked the hall with a bold challenging stare as if defying anyone to speak out none did yet there was no thaw in the air no easing of the tension come take a seat stephen insisted eustaces arm was rigid under his hand but stephens grip was too tight to shake off and he reluctantly allowed his father to steer him toward the high table familiar faces were all about him arundel that judas fleming his milksop of a little brother to his fury none of them seemed willing to meet his eyes did they think they could make him disappear by pretending not to see him if they hoped hed slink away in the night they would be sorely disappointed hed never make it easy for them theyd have to confront him openly from now on if they dared it enraged him though to be shunned like this as if he were a foul stinking leper instead of the rightful heir to the english throne draining his wine cup much too fast he signaled for a refill the food on his trencher was a favorite dish of his a lampreyeel pie but he was too angry to savor it and ate quickly without tasting what he swallowed brooding upon the injustice of it all silently cursing henry fitz empress and his weakwilled father with every bite it was proving to be a miserable meal for stephen too the food on his trencher went untouched even unnoticed what was he going to do if he punished his son as he deserved hed risk pushing eustace into open rebellion but the monks of st edmunds had been grievously wronged and how could he ignore that eustace could not have served henry better than he had at bury st edmunds why could he not see that if only tilda were here to counsel the lad mayhap she could have made him see reason each time stephen glanced up he saw men warily watching eustace how long would they remain loyal if he continued to force eustace upon them and yet how could he ever abandon his own son so unnaturally quiet was it that the sound of an overturning chair was shockingly loud startling them all seeing his son on his feet stephen felt a throb of despair what sort of mischief was eustace up to now could he not even get through a single meal without shaming them both but once he got his first clear look at his sons face he cried out sharply something was wrong eustace was clutching at his throat his eyes cutting frantically toward stephen when he lurched into the table knocking a wine flagon over onto the other diners there were curses and even a few audible mutterings about drunken sots stephen knew better eustace what is wrong tell me eustace seemed to be trying to do just that his mouth was working but no words were emerging by now theyd all realized that he was having some sort of seizure chairs were shoved aside and men scrambled away from the table away from eustace for the same thought was in most of their minds a plundered abbey and a saints curse eustaces face was suffused with blood he sank to his knees one hand still clawing at his throat the other reaching out toward his father he is choking time seemed to have slowed even to have stopped as stephen struggled to get to his son eustace was convulsing there was spittle and blood on his lips and his skin had taken on a bluish hue stephen began to pound him desperately upon the back and shoulders someone was shouting for a doctor there were a few cries too for a priest but most of the men just stood there watching eustaces eyes were rolling back his body jerked in several uncontrollable spasms and then went limp those whod ventured closer now caught the smell of urine death was no stranger to any of them but few had ever witnessed a death like this one so sudden and swift and divinely ordained for surely it could not be mere happenchance that eustace would be struck down in all his youthful arrogance just days after defiling a holy shrine as stephen cradled his son and wept men glanced at one another and then crossed themselves vengeance is mine saith the lord and st edmund was not to be mocked for he tended to his own and as the shock began to subside more than a few of the witnesses gave silent thanks to this vengeful saint even as they looked with pity upon their stricken king stephens younger son still stood rooted at the end of the table he did not seem capable of movement so chalkywhite that he appeared likely to keel over himself at any moment when someone shoved a wine cup into his hand though he drank obediently as color slowly came back into the boys face william de ypres said go to your father lad he has need of you the youth blinked then did as he was bade moving as if in a daze he did not have it in him to take charge but fortunately there would be others to do what must be done william martel was already at stephens side gently seeking to coax him away from his sons body ypres was more than willing to let others shoulder the burdens for a change surprised by how tired he suddenly felt he fumbled for a chair sat down wearily midst the wreckage of eustaces last meal hed choked on a mouthful of lamprey eel the same dish that had supposedly caused the old kings death too ypress mouth twitched in a grim and private smile for the eerie aptness of it appealed to his sense of irony if henry fitz empress were prudent hed ban eels from the royal table in future why tempt providence after all it had been a hot summer for england an even hotter one for aquitaine by midmorning eleanors lyingin chamber was already sweltering and the windows were opened as wide as they could get insects soon invaded the room and as her ladies fanned eleanor and wiped the sweat from her face they also had to swat away flies in late afternoon thunder rumbled in the distance a promise of relief that never came the air remained utterly still stifling eleanor refused to cry out too proud to lay bare her pain for the world listening under those unshuttered windows she held on to her sisters hand so tightly that her nails left scratches on petronillas wrist but the other woman did not complain theirs was a sisterhood not just of blood but of the birthing chamber too for petronilla knew firsthandas colette and yolande did notwhat eleanor was enduring childbirth was the curse of eve but eleanors curses were directed at her absent husband at a world in which women must reap what men had sown the midwife was shocked but petronilla grinned and confided that during the most difficult of her three deliveries shed vowed to live as chastely as a nun from then on whether raoul liked it or not but fortunately for the future of mankind she quipped god has given women flawed memories eleanor laughed to the midwifes amazement but then she groaned biting down on her fist when the contraction passed she muttered that if the folklore was true that sons were birthed more easily than daughters it must be because girls knew what awaited them outside the womb and again the midwife marveled for it had been her experience that the birthing chamber was a setting for hope and fear and joy and too often peril but rarely for humor not until dark did the heat begin to abate from her bed eleanor could see a starlit ebony sky when yolande tilted a cup to her swollen bitten lips she swallowed thirstily too tired even to identify what she was drinking deep shadows lurked under her eyes hollowed her cheekbones and for the first time she looked her age to yolande a woman of thirtyone a woman past her first flush of youth all the glamor and glitter stripped away by her twelvehour ordeal but as eleanor smiled down at the infant in her arms yolande felt tears sting her eyes so great was her regret that her ladys husband would never see that smile ah madame if only you could be there when lord harry hears i wish so too yolande eleanor admitted but it was not to be fighting her fatigue she looked again at her baby and then up at the women hovering by the bed nor would i have minded being there when louis and abbot bernard hear she murmured and this time her smile was irrepressible wickedly triumphant ranulf had been to the lincolnshire market town of stanford once before on his odyssey with the fenland orphans hed had to seek out a barber in st peters street to yank simons infected tooth the barber was still there older and grayer and understandably alarmed by the siege under way up the road barely a stones throw from his small cramped shop the castle of william peverel boasted a newly constructed circular stone keep rising above the meadows of the river weland it had held out for the past fortnight under heavy bombardment the local quarries providing ample ammunition for henrys mangonels but september got off to a promising start the garrison was offering to talk the benedictine priory of st leonards just east of the town had become henrys headquarters and the black monks were making heroic efforts to accommodate not only the duke of normandy and his entourage but a handful of demanding lords including the notorious earl of chester long the bane of lincolnshire on this ominously overcast morning ranulf had lingered at the priory to tend to a personal matter he was sending one of his welshmen home with a letter for rhiannon hed thought that their separation would get easier with time the opposite seemed to be occurring without even realizing what was happening hed given his heart away and england was now the alien land padarn was waiting out in the priory garth with their horses and they headed into the town by the time they reached the siege rain had begun to fall the marketplace adjoined the castle and would normally have been crowded with stalls and booths had the siege not utterly disrupted town life instead of customers it was occupied by soldiers and it was here that ranulf found his nephew conferring bareheaded in the rain with rainald and a visibly irate earl of chester catching sight of ranulf henry beckoned to him just as the clouds split asunder and a torrent engulfed the marketplace men scattered for cover ranulf following henry toward the closest shelter the alcove of all saints church as they waited for the rain to subside henry revealed why chester was so disgruntled even though the garrison had agreed to surrender we discovered that william peverel was never in the castle it seems he is holed up at nottingham so of course that is where chester wants us to go next i told him that id have to think about it helping chester settle scores with all his enemies could well turn into a lifetimes occupation henry said and laughed ranulf laughed too pleased to see his nephew in such high spirits august had not been a good month for henry not at first for he was waiting impatiently for word from his wife finding it hard to focus all his energies upon the stanford siege still vexed that hed been cheated of a battlefield confrontation with stephen and eustace at wallingford but that had all changed dramatically once they learned of the events at ipswich on august th most people seemed convinced that eustaces death was divine retribution for his sins and even more impressive proof that the almighty favored the angevin cause naturally henry did nothing to contradict this view remarking privately to ranulf that god could hardly be improved upon as an ally but whether he owed a debt of gratitude to an unforgiving saint or a lamprey eel the result was the same the removal of the last obstacle in his march to the throne roger fitz miles was holding forth on that very subject a few feet away assuring all within hearing that peace was at hand it was just a matter now of working out the details one of which is the earl of surrey henry interjected you do remember him rogerstephens other son how can you be sure that stephen will not want him to step into eustaces shoes no one can see will as englands next king not even will himself ranulf commented and then added sotto voce for henrys ear alone you know that too harry you might as well face it lad youre not going to be able to fight for the crown youll just have to grit your teeth and let us hand it over to you at the bargaining table but henry always gave as good as he got i think you mean at stephens grave do you not uncle that is the fly in the ointment after all unless you want me to start sending the man eel pies only as a last resort but no sooner were the words out of ranulfs mouth than he regretted them for he had too complicated a history with stephen to joke comfortably about his demise before he could say more a voice carried across the marketplace calling out for henry a rider was cantering toward the church close enough now to be recognized as one of rainalds household knights dismounting he swore lustily as he stepped down into a widening puddle the churchyard was fast becoming a sea of mud my lord duke i have a message for you one of the monks was coming to find you and i told him id pass the word on a courier has ridden into the priory with a letter for your eyes only from aquitaine while many of henrys men knew how anxiously he was awaiting word from his wife this particular one did not even know eleanor was pregnant surprised by the urgency in henrys voice he nodded and then stood gaping as henry snatched the reins from his hand vaulted up into the saddle and galloped off on his horse by the time ranulf and roger got to their own horses and followed henry was out of sight they spurred their mounts along high street on toward the priory arriving onto a scene of jubilation henry was standing in the guest hall surrounded by abbot thoralds smiling monks as soon as he saw ranulf he broke away from his wellwishers strode across the hall and gave his uncle a wet joyful hug eleanor has borne me a son it took a while for a semblance of calm to return to the hall and ranulf had to wait to learn that eleanor was in good health that the baby had his fathers bright hair and that shed christened him william she claims she named him after my greatgrandfather william the bastard henry chortled but i know damned well she really had her father and her beloved grandpapa will in mind i guess i can count myself lucky she did not name the lad after another one of her illustrious ancestorscharlemagne i am gladdened for you harry ranulf said experiencing a sudden longing for his own small son gilbert eleanor has given you a great gift indeed roger agreed although he could not keep from pointing out the political benefits of this birth stephen lost a son you gained one the contrast will not escape people that your fortunes are rising as stephens are plummeting especially once they learn that my son was born on a monday eve two days after the assumption henry said and nodded as they stared at him in amazement he was no longer smiling for that was so uncanny a juxtaposition of life and death hope and doom that there could be no joking about it on the same day that eustace was dying at ipswich eleanor was giving birth to william it took another two months of negotiations to end the war but an end did come due in great measure to the patient and persistent mediation of the church the eventual agreement was a compromise in the truest sense of the word in that no one was fully satisfied stephen acknowledged henrys hereditary right to the english crown and agreed to accept henry as his son and heir henry in his turn conceded that stephen should continue as king for the remainder of his life stephens surviving son william was to receive all those lands and titles that stephen had held prior to his kingship and henry agreed to recognize him as count of boulogne and mortain and earl of surrey as his young warenne wife was a great heiress in her own right william would emerge from the peace conference as the richest lord in england his wealth eclipsed only by that of the king the other provisions of the agreement were aimed at implementing it the tower of london and the castles of windsor oxford lincoln and winchester were to be entrusted to castellans acceptable to both sides solemn oaths were to be exchanged to uphold the pact henry was to do homage to stephen and their barons would then do homage to him as englands future king the men disinherited by the war were to have their lands restored foreign mercenaries were to be expelled and castles constructed since the death of the old king were to be razed lastly stephen agreed to consult with henry in the governance of the realm although it was deliberately left vague as to how that would work out in practice for no one truly knew they were breaking new ground on november th almost eighteen years after stephen had claimed maudes crown he met with her son at winchester the city that had suffered more than any other during those desolate blighted years when it was believed that christ and all his saints slept they agreed to the terms hammered out by their gobetweens the archbishop of canterbury and the bishop of winchester although a formal treaty still had to be concluded in december the people of england at last dared to hope that peace was within reach ranulf found it unsettling at first to be back at winchester more than twelve years had passed since their catastrophic rout and while much of the city had been rebuilt there were still scars of the siege and fire to be found most of them on the souls of its citizens his return stirred up memories ranulf would rather not have relived yet upon reflection it seemed appropriate to him that the healing should begin here the gathering in the great hall of the castle was an odd experience too for him fraternizing with men hed have been crossing swords with had they met on the battlefield as he watched the awkward interaction it was obvious that he was not the only one unsure of his footing there were a few satisfied faces to be found the archbishop of canterbury and stephens brother were basking in their success as peacemakers but most of those present looked more wary than joyful it would be a slippery road ahead for certes but god willing not a bloody one across the hall stephen was mingling with men whod done their utmost to dethrone him he was making a gallant attempt to be cordial with better success than most but then hed never been one for collecting grudges ranulf would wager that there were few indeed whom stephen would not be able to forgive john marshal chester the latters absence was both a puzzle and a blessing ranulf could not imagine what might have kept chester away from winchester and a chance to gloat but thank god for whatever it was even on his best behavior hed have muddied the waters enough to splatter them all as stephen moved toward the hearth his son trailed after him hed not let stephen out of his sight all day so plainly in over his depth that ranulf felt pity flickering was will wounded at being bypassed it was true that hed not been raised with the expectation of kingship as eustace had stephen had consoled himself with that hed confided as much to ranulf earlier in the day ranulf wondered if will had ever indulged in secret dreams of crowns and sceptres even if so no one else seemed to have ever thought of him in regal terms he was not like harry glancing around then in search of his nephew ranulf finally located him standing alone in the shadows on the dais this was the first time all day hed not been mobbed for suddenly his world was overpopulated with men eager to ingratiate themselves ranulf supposed it was only to be expected for people always prized tomorrow more than yesterday stephen might now be guaranteed that hed die as a king but henrys favor would be courted more ardently for he was englands future whether stephen knew it yet or not the remainder of his reign had become a death vigil taking advantage of this rare chance to catch his nephew alone ranulf moved swiftly across the hall up onto the dais henry was watching the activity below him with what appeared to be alert interest but ranulf recognized that look for what it was a mask what is the matter harry i know youve never been one for waiting he stopped for henry was shaking his head it is not that as you said uncle time is on my side not stephens what is it then i do think this settlement was best for england as you also pointed out there has been far too much bloodshed i know it will not be easy to make this pact work but i can rely upon the church to stave off any doubledealing down the road oddly enough i think i can rely upon stephens good faith too his smile came and went almost too quick to catch do not tell my mother i ever said that though you still have not told me what is troubling you it just seems soso incomplete uncle ranulf to have it end like this this is not the resolution id sought and stephen is not the enemy id thought id find we talked alone for the first time last night just the two of us i do not know what id expected but henry frowned impatiently for he was not accustomed to having such trouble expressing himself there was nothing to be said i could not even hate him as i ought you know that he has promised to treat me as his son well as crazy as it sounds it is almost as if he is starting to think of me that way ranulf not so crazy if you know stephen ranulf said there is anan innocence about him lad and despite his blundering and the grief hes brought upon himself and others it still survives like a candle that is never quite quenched i suspect that hed not find it hard at all to treat you as a son harry for that is the world as hed like it to be a world where men are honourable and women comforting where good deeds are always rewarded and debts paid and christian kindness prevails but his debt is not paid henry interrupted with sudden intensity not to my mother he caught ranulfs arm grey eyes flashing as the words came rushing out no longer measured or even voluntary he did her a great wrong not all men think so but you must ranulf for you know what he took from her more than a crown ive been fighting for the throne but i was fighting for her too to make stephen pay for all hed stolen from her i feel cheated now if you want the truth the kingship is mine or it will be but i could not redress her grievances and it was not supposed to be like that i know nothing on gods earth will give maude more pride and pleasure than seeing you as englands king but you are right it is not enough what she lost no one could get back for her not even you lad but you are wrong if you think stephen has somehow escaped payment he buried his wife his son died in his arms he could not secure the throne for his other son and he will live out his days knowing that men judged his kingship as an abysmal failure and one day he may even die henry said dryly but hed begun to sound amused now that you have convinced me uncle it is only fair that you get to come back with me to rouen and convince my mother sorry ranulf said grinning but as soon as this war is finally pronounced dead and ready for burial im off to wales so fast you will not even see my dust and for at least a year thereafter i am instructing my niece not to send on any messages or letters every time i get a letter from you lad i end up packing my saddlebags sharpening my sword and sleeping around campfires instead of snug in my wifes bed instead of smiling henry gave him a thoughtful look there is something i ought to tell you for i know how fond you are of my cousin maud we thought it best to say nothing until this council was over a few of us know besides me the archbishop and stephen and his brother and the earl of derby who found out on his own being wed to peverels daughter everyone has been asking after chesters whereabouts he is at gresley castle up in derbyshire and not likely ever to rise from his sickbed if the accounts ive heard are true ranulf whistled softly chester was such an elemental force that hed seemed wellnigh invincible if not downright immortal after i saw him survive a blow to the helmet that broke stephens axe but left him with no more than a headache id have wagered on him against death itself he admitted as the joke goes god would not want him and the devil would not take him maud will cope we need not fret about that but why the secrecy lets be honest wed have to hunt far and wide to find any mourners for chesters funeral and what does peverel have to do with this given how much he hates chester hed like nothing better than to spit into randolphs open coffin but so would half of christendom spitting would not have satisfied peverel he had murder in mind a poisoned wine that claimed three other lives and so sickened chester that he is not expected to live as ranulf stared at henry in astonishment another voice delivered a harsh judgment neither one had heard stephen approach and they both spun around as he said it would be better for england better for us all that he does not recover you can be sure cousin that he would give you fully as much trouble as he gave me a scorpion must sting for that is its nature henry had at last found some common ground with stephen i daresay you are right i gave him a very ample grant this spring but it would not have kept him content for long if he does indeed die his epitaph should be that his hand like ishmaels was against every man stephen nodded all the while studying henry so intently that he finally felt compelled to say coolly cousin is there something wrong stephen caught himself and smiled ruefully i was staring at you was i not do not take this amiss but i found myself thinking how very young you are not in judgment or maturity in years should god grant you as many winters as i have seen twenty will seem heartrendingly young to you too cousin he explained and henry could only look at him in bemusement sure now that it had not been his imagination stephen was regarding him with a benevolence that was indeed paternal he dared not meet ranulfs knowing eyes lest he laugh at the absurdity of it all that this war which had lasted for almost all of his life should end not in bloodshed but adoption the day was to conclude with a mass of reconciliation at st swithuns cathedral as henry and stephen emerged from the shadows of the castle barbican they drew rein startled for high street was thronged with spectators men and women and youngsters whod been waiting patiently in the winter cold for hours all in hope that peace would be made at sight of stephen and henry riding side by side a vast roar went up from the crowd so loud it could almost have been heard in heaven henry felt his throat tighten as he looked out upon their faces some beaming others streaked with thankful tears although this was his first visit to winchester he felt a close kinship with its citizens for hed grown up on tales of their suffering and their steadfast loyalty to the angevin cause their joy was as contagious as it was rapturous and he wished passionately that his mother could have been here to witness it as henry urged his stallion forward the noise intensified hats and caps were tossed into the icy air parents lifted children so they could see and henry heard his name taken up as a chant by the crowd it was only then that he glanced over his shoulder and saw that stephen had halted for the moment a generous gesture but also a realistic recognition that the cheers belonged to henry dovercanterbury road kent england march early in lent henry accompanied stephen to dover to meet the count of flanders and his wife henrys paternal aunt on this rainsodden march friday they departed dover castle in midmorning bound for canterbury they were still about five miles from the city when the archbishops saddle girth began to slip a hasty examination revealed that the girth buckle was giving way and the royal cavalcade halted while the problem was corrected as the delay lengthened henry found it increasingly difficult to hide his impatience stephens son will and a few of his companions were amusing themselves by galloping their horses across a nearby meadow henry was half tempted to join in but although the rain had stopped the ground was still muddy and slick and he was not willing to endanger his stallion just to keep boredom at bay as he fidgeted by the side of the road watching the races he was joined by one of the archbishops clerks who reported that the saddle girth was taking longer than expected to repair when the clerk lingered after delivering his message henry was pleased for hed found thomas becket to be good company at first glance they seemed too unlike for friendship becket was more than twelve years henrys senior having been born a month after the sinking of the white ship and they did not share the same affinity for the religious life but what they had in common mattered more than what they did not a keen intelligence a love of learning unfettered ambition and an ironic eye for lifes incongruities henry thought he could find use for a man of beckets talents looking ahead to that day when englands government would be his for the shaping but whether becket ever became a royal councilor or not at the moment he was a welcome diversion and henry was in need of one had he been asked to describe purgatory hed have said it was a place of infernal and endless waiting the past few months had been busy ones for henry and stephen formalizing the agreement theyd struck at winchester getting the barons of the realm to do homage to henry as their future king issuing orders to demolish those castles judged illegal preparing to expel foreign mercenaries becket knew theyd not been pleasant months for henry filled with dawntodusk activity but not much satisfaction it was with a touch of sympathy therefore that he asked is it true that your uncle has gone back to wales henry nodded i tried to talk him out of it but he reminded me that hed not seen his wife and son for more than a year i reminded him in turn that id not seen my wife for more than a year either and had yet to lay eyes upon my son but he then pointed out that it was my crown not his and that left me with nothing to say except godspeed how much longer ere you can go back to normandy i would that i knew soon i hope others might see me as the heir apparent the next king but just between you and me thomas i feel more like the chief mourner at a funeral waiting around for the deceased to take sick surely i can put my time to better use than that some men might be content to keep a death watch becket agreed sounding amused but for certes not you henry glanced curiously at the older man becket stood high in the archbishops favor and with so illustrious a patron he could have a promising career in the church if he wanted it but did he i know youve been in the archbishops service for the past eight years he told me that when the next opening for an archdeacon comes up he means to appoint you youd have to take holy orders first of course and you have nothave you not yet henry considered that answer trying to understand how a man could choose of his own free will to give up so much even for god i do not think id have made a good priest myself he said at last i suspect youd have had particular trouble with the vow of chastity becket said dryly and henry grinned i probably would not have done so well with the obedience vow either he conceded fortunately the qualifications are less stringent for kings becket grinned too i understand it helps he said slyly if a king does not fall off his horse henry had heard of course of stephens balky stallion at least not three times in a row he laughed and then grabbed for becket pulling the other man aside just as several of the racers galloped past spraying mud in all directions henrys quick action had saved becket from a thorough dousing but the hem of his mantle had still gotten splattered he frowned at the splotched wool then gazed after the riders shaking his head in disapproval what a pity he said that some men make such poor use of the wits god gave them and then jesu for as they watched one of the horses slipped in the mud scrabbled futilely to retain its footing and went down henry had not seen the rider it was not until he heard stephens anguished cry that he realized it was will with becket a stride or two behind he hastened toward the fallen stallion but stephen got there first made fleet by his fear will was pinned under the horse and it took several men to pull him free the hapless stallion was beyond help doomed by a shattered foreleg thrashing about in terror until a soldier mercifully put an end to its suffering at first sight the kings son did not seem likely to survive his stallion wills face was blanched under a coating of mud his flaxen hair darkening with blood his mouth was contorted blue eyes clouded with fear and pain and he plucked frantically at stephens sleeve as his father bent over him it hurts so he moaned and stephen found himself thrust back in time to an august night hot and humid watching in horror as eustace choked to death merciful god not again papa will clung to stephens hand as if his father alone could save him do not let me die you are not dying will stephen promised recklessly i swear you are not but will did not believe him ive sinned he sobbed but i am sorry do not let me be damned shouting hoarsely for a doctor stephen blotted blood away as it trickled down into wills eyes lie easy lad he pleaded you make it worse for yourself when you move i ought to have told you wills eyes were riveted upon his fathers face i did not truly think theyd do it though i swear i did not i know lad stephen said soothingly i know try not to talk i must the youth insisted weakly lest i die ere i am shriven of my sin sweat beaded his forehead his upper lip murder he whispered the flemingsthey mean to kill him kill him stephen repeated numbly what are you talking about the flemings wills voice faltered they spoke of killing maudes son christ jesus stephen raised his head appalled by what hed just heard only to see henry standing behind him so close that he must have heard too stephen had been searching all over christ church priory for henry finally finding him in the cloisters with thomas becket they fell silent as he approached henrys face giving away nothing of his thoughtsor his intentions how is will he asked politely noncommittally god is indeed good for the doctor says hell live stephen told them then about wills injuries a gashed forehead cracked ribs and the most serious a broken thigh bone his convalescence would be a lengthy one but he would heal in time henry and becket wished will a quick recovery a response dictated by courtesy not telling stephen what he needed to know hed considered saying nothing gambling on the off chance that henry might have missed wills mumbled confession but as his eyes met henrys stephen realized how foolish that would have been maudes son was not one to be bluffed once i was sure that wills life was not in danger i asked him about the flemings one of his men speaks flemish and hed overheard some of the flemish hirelings talking in a dover alehouse they were sorely vexed about the peace terms angry at being cast out of england and blaming you for their plight harry wills servant told him that they were saying it would be for the best if you had a mishap of some sort but will swears he did not take it seriously he dismissed it as drunken maunderings and that is why he said nothing if hed believed you to be in real danger hed have spoken up straightaway stephen sounded earnest yet uneasy too henry did not doubt his sincerity he believed in his son and it could have happened just as will claimed for hed struck henry as an amiable mediocrity but even a capon might envy the cock who was to say i daresay you are right cousin the foolish babbling of men in their cups it is not surprising that will acted as he did stephens relief was palpable i am gladdened that you understand harry it would have been a great pity had wills name been tarnished by alehouse gossip you have no reason to doubt my sons good faith that i swear to you you need not fret cousin for ive taken wills measure stephen smiled well id best get back the doctor gave will a potion for his pain but i want to be there when he awakens archbishop theobald was kind enough to put will up in his own lodgings if you could find time to stop by later i know it would mean much to will henry promised that he would and stephen was soon striding off buoyantly intent upon thanking the almighty for sparing his youngest son henry and becket waited until hed disappeared into a side door of the cathedral only then did they turn away continuing along the cloister path i hope you plan to watch your back becket said quietly ive been told that few knives are sharper than a flemings blade so ive heard too henrys smile held an edge of its own you asked he said when id be returning to normandy i think the time has come i would not want to overstay my welcome after all on the morning after henrys return to angers eleanor awoke with a languorous sense of wellbeing which lasted until she realized that she was alone sitting up she brushed her hair out of her eyes could harry not have lingered in bed just this once no wonder his enemies claimed his energy was demonic her clothing lay strewn about the chamber and the sight brought a soft smile to her lips as she remembered their urgency to reach the bed her husbands scabbard had been hung over a chair and was still there so at least he was somewhere in the castle with a sigh she reached for her bedrobe opening the shutters eleanor stood at the window breathing in the mild april air shed selected one of her favorite gowns a rich winered and she was about to summon yolande to help her dress when she heard an odd thumping sound out in the stairwell she opened the door just in time to admit henry he had their son slung over his shoulder and was guiding two servants up the stairs as they struggled with a large unwieldy burden a carved oaken cradle i thought the tadpole might like to swim in our pond for a while henry gestured toward the hearth as the men dragged the cradle across the threshold put it over there harry youre holding that child like a sack of flour he does not mind henry insisted and as he turned eleanor saw that will did seem content now in his eighth month he was such a placid cheerful baby that eleanor sometimes joked he must be a changeling and he appeared to have taken in stride being awakened and carried off by a man who was a stranger to him after the servants had departed henry settled his son in the cradle rocking it back and forth as will yawned and then began to suck contentedly upon a rattle when eleanor joined them the little boy gurgled happily at sight of her and reached up to snatch at the long tresses tumbling over her shoulder evading his grasp she kissed the crown of his head i still find myself marveling at those golden curls of his she confided for marie and alix both have dark hair like mine ought he to be putting that rattle into his mouth he is teething harry when his discomfort gets too bad we rub honey on his gums or give him a liquorice root to suck on retrieving her brush eleanor retreated to the bed do you intend to keep will in here with us i doubt that will work out very well why not the lad and i have a lot of catching up to do henry was continuing to rock the cradle and eleanor had to restrain herself from warning that hed make will seasick if he did not ease up his first efforts at fatherhood might be heavyhanded but she did not want to discourage him she was pleased that he was so taken with their son for too many men treated the nursery as alien territory henry was laughing for will was now trying energetically to capture his feet trust me will even if you somehow got those into your mouth toes do not taste good he squirms about like an eel eleanor is he always this lively ever since we took off the swaddling ive seen babies swaddled they look like little caterpillar cocoons surely they do not enjoy being wrapped up that way i never thought about it eleanor admitted but it is for their own good for it keeps them warm and safe henry was leaning over the cradle again tickling will and making him squeal with glee eleanor watched smiling i hope youll be such an attentive father for our other children she teased a soothsayer told me that wed have a bakers dozen ere were done so youd best gird your loins for you anytime but his smile was fleeting he looked down at will then back at eleanor grey eyes guarded there is something you need to know i have another son her brush halted in midstroke do you indeed do not keep me in suspense harry the why is rather obvious but what of the when and where of it he was born last december in london i named him geoffrey henry was annoyed to hear himself adding needlessly after my father but he was not as confident as he sought to appear for he was not sure how eleanor would react she was the most unpredictable woman hed ever met and while that was a great part of her charm there were timeslike nowwhen hed have welcomed a fire that gave off a little less heat you intend to recognize him as your own he is mine eleanor how could i turn away from him and the mother she meant nothing to me if shed not gotten with child id have long since forgotten her name it was an unchivalrous answer but the one eleanor wanted to hear well then she said i suppose i should offer my congratulations he did not respond at once searching her face for sarcasm you truly mean that eleanor why not i do not begrudge you your joy in this child and i would not attempt to talk you into shirking your obligations to him it is all too easy for men to walk away afterward i find it rather refreshing harry that you did not he was quiet for a moment marveling you never fail to surprise me it does not vex you that i bedded another woman more than one id wager she said with a sardonic smile it is not as if this comes as any surprise you were gone nigh on sixteen months after all id not have expected you to refrain from eating until you could get home to dine with me so why would i expect you to abstain from other hungers she shrugged significantly then reclined back against the pillows letting her bedrobe slip open enough to reveal a glimpse of thigh it goes without saying though that your dining out had best be done at a distance harry henry grinned you need not worry about that love given a choice id eat all my meals at home as he moved away from the cradle will whimpered in protest but he didnt notice at the moment his wife was claiming all of his attention you are the most amazing woman eleanor i have to admit that i was not expecting you to be so understanding ive always understood men she said blandly and ive always tried to be tolerant of their failings id like to think that youd be as tolerant too harryshould the need ever arise he stopped abruptly halfway to the bed if youre suggesting you sound upset why is that infidelity is not the same sin for men and women he said tautly for it puts a childs paternity into question youre clever enough to realize that eleanor to know he cut himself off in midsentence and she said encouragingly know what do go on harry by now though hed caught on but mixed in with his relief was a genuine anger for he was not accustomed to being laughed at damn you he said softly and her eyebrows arched upward in feigned surprise why harry she murmured are you trying to seduce me again the corner of his mouth twitched in involuntary amusement what would you have me say eleanor that i am sorry she shook her head impatiently i do not care if you tumbled an english harlot harry i am not about to get jealous because you scratched an itchas long as that is all it was he thought he saw now where hed erred crossing to the bed he threw the covers back seating himself beside her if i said id never stray id be lying and we both know it but you have my heart not to mention my crown surely that matters more than an occasional trespass a crown you say she pretended to ponder it and then reached out inviting his embrace as her arms slid up around his neck she kissed him with incendiary effect finally getting his breath back he murmured against her throat that kiss was hot enough to leave a brand if that is indeed what you intend you might want to aim somewhat lower she laughed and drew him deeper into the bed but as he started to strip off her robe she caught his hand in hers promise me that youll remember what i am about to tell you harry whenever youre tempted to trespass in the future just bear in mind that i am willing to be reasonablebut not saintly ill promise anything on earth love if itll keep you from ever getting saintly after that they did not talk concentrating upon ridding him of his clothes they were making progress when an indignant wailing blared from the cradle his face red mouth puckered and eyes tearing their small son was venting his outrage at being ignored loudly and persistently henry shot up in the bed christ almighty is all that noise coming from him i did warn you eleanor said beginning to laugh that having will sleep with us might not be one of your better ideas welcome to fatherhood harry soon after his return from england henry found himself forced to deal with some of eleanors rebellious barons this he did with such dispatch that by the end of june he was able to take his wife and son to rouen for their first meeting with his mother henry was unable to sit still he kept getting up and prowling aimlessly about the chamber all the while keeping a wary eye upon the women in his life they were making polite conversation seemingly at ease but he could not enjoy the lull constantly scanning the skies for approaching clouds the only one more obviously uncomfortable than henry was his brother geoff he was slouched down in his seat twitching nervously every time his mother glanced his way will at last took pity upon them both and suggested that they adjourn to the stables to see his new roan stallion his brothers accepted his offer with alacrity and retreated in unseemly haste watching them go eleanor shook her head men are not usually so squeamish about bloodshed maude blinked looking at eleanor so blankly that she wondered if shed made a mistake but then the older woman smiled men do not know nearly as much about women as they think geoffrey was sure that id not approve of you but id hoped that henry would have more sense eleanor had decided beforehand that honesty was the only weapon likely to penetrate her motherinlaws defenses it just matters so much to harry that we get along ill admit that i was somewhat uneasy myself about this meeting if you believed even half of whats been said of me youd have good reason to fear for harrys immortal soul gossip maude said dismissively the world is full of mud and unfortunately there is no shortage of people eager to splatter it about with women the targets of choice you need not have fretted about your reception eleanor i can think of at least three compelling reasons why i should want to welcome you into my family the first and foremost one is sitting on your lap she said gesturing toward will balancing on eleanors knee would you like to hold him eleanor suggested and will switched laps with aplomb and the other reasons you make my son happy and then of course maude said with a faint smile there is aquitaine eleanor returned the smile i appreciate your candor as it happens there is a fourth reason too we were not going to say anything until i could be certain but id like you to know i may be pregnant again so soon that is indeed blessed news maude detached her grandsons clutching fingers from the rosary at her belt no will not the pater noster you said that you are not sure yet eleanor ive missed just one flux so far but yesyes i am sure sometime in lent by my calculations i hope to give harry another son two pregnancies in two years of marriage possibly two sons after a moment maude smiled saying with satisfaction but some pity too poor louis october that year was an idyllic month mild and dry with clarion blue skies and mellowed golden sunlight londoners were determined to make the most of this respite before the winter freeze and the friday horse fair at west smithfield had drawn a large boisterous crowd a race was in progress across the meadow and most of the bargaining had been suspended so people could watch although neither ranulf nor padarn had wagered on the outcome they found themselves cheering as loudly as the other spectators caught up in the excitement the winner a rangy bay edged out a lathered chestnut in a rousing finish that satisfied all but the chestnuts backers ranulf was turning toward a piebald filly that had taken his eye when he heard his name called out behind him bearing down upon him was a ghost from his past fulk de bernay annora and ancels elder brother once greetings had been exchanged fulk clapped ranulf heartily on the shoulder what are you doing in london wed heard that youd gone off to live on top of a welsh mountain ranulf was accustomed by now to jokes about his adopted welsh homeland and had learned to shrug them off since the peace seems to be holding i decided this would be a good time to show england to my wife and son we went to chester first collecting my niece maud her sons and her mother who happened to be visiting weve been to coventry woodstock oxford and my fathers tomb at reading and for the past week weve been enjoying the sights of london from here we go on to canterbury and then dover to meet the king and on our way back to wales we hope to stop at bury st edmunds to see st edmunds shrine ranulf was not normally so loquacious but the words just kept cascading out as if of their own will this unexpected encounter had unnerved him somewhat stirring up memories hed as soon forget fulk looked eerily like ancel and his gleaming dark eyes could have been annoras but it was reassuring that he was being so friendly for there could be no better proof that ancel had not shared his secret at least annoras family had been spared that ultimate rupture fulk was regarding ranulf with evident puzzlement it just goes to show he said how outlandish rumors can get do you know what we heard ranulf as crazy as it sounds that this welsh wife of yours was blind he laughed ranulf did not rhiannon is blind he said evenly and embarrassed color flooded into fulks face ii am sorry he stammered but you said you were showing her the sights and ii just assumedhow could shethat is ranulf let him flounder on like that for a few moments more he wanted to ask fulk why he thought the blind were bereft of their other senses too rhiannon was enthralled by the pealing chimes of st pauls cathedral she could hear her footsteps echoing across the marble tiles as she approached its high altar she whod never known any church but the small secluded chapel at llanrhychwyn where theyd been wed when hed led her out onto london bridge shed felt the lifeforce of the thames surging against the wooden pilings and when he walked with her on the beach below dovers white cliffs she would experience the sea hearing the waves break upon the wet sand the gulls shrieking overhead feeling the salt spray on her face sensing the vastness that she could not see but he knew fulk would never understand and so he said only no offense meant so none taken fulk was fumbling his way out of the pit hed dug for himself you said you have a son yesgilbert will be three next month fulk smiled in surprise passing strange for ancel named his firstborn gilbert too i expect to see him at martinmas shall i give him a message from you tell himtell him i wish him well ranulf hesitated how is annora she seems content enough she has a little lass of her own and gervase still dotes upon her every whim fulk caught himself with a selfconscious laugh it does not bother you to hear me say that i know you two were plighttrothed but that was such a long time ago you are right ranulf agreed politely it was a long time ago he started to excuse himself then with a polite smile i promised my niece that id buy her a mare this afternoon so id best get to it ranulf wait ive a question to put to you i heard that henry fitz empress has been taken gravely ill can that be true the word in the alehouses is that he might not live but surely that is just idle tavern talk there is some truth in it fulk my nephew was stricken with a high fever last month and was ill enough to give us all a scare but he recovered fully and the last i heard he was dealing with a troublesome vassal in the vexin thank god fulk said with such fervor that ranulf stared at him for fulk had been one of stephens most steadfast supporters it was heartening to realize that even harrys former foes now saw him as englands only hope for a lasting peace when she awoke rhiannon could not at once remember where she was ranulf she called out again quietly in case the others were still sleeping for theyd been sharing their chamber for most of this trip with olwen gilbert and gwen his young nurse she heard nothing though not even the soft sounds of breathing by now her memory was awakening too they were at canterbury in a guest chamber of the royal castle but where was ranulf he entered as she was fumbling for her bedrobe so youre finally awake love you were so tired yesterday that i thought it would do you good to sleep in this morning ive got breakfast here for two and whilst we linger over it maud is taking gilbert and her lads to the marketplace with luck we might actually have an entire hour or two all to ourselves bless her rhiannon said happily making room for ranulf in the bed between sips of cider and bites of honeyed bread they exchanged sticky kisses did you remember to give gwen money in case gilbert sees something he wants to buy at the market i did he said and told gwen that he could have whatever he wanted provided it was not alive i asked him this morning what part of the trip hed enjoyed most thinking hed pick the royal menagerie at woodstock or mayhap the ferry ride across to southwark but do you know what he said what he liked best was when maud bought him a pasty at the cookshop by the river rhiannon laughed does that surprise you this is the child after all whose first complete sentence was feed me ranulf shared the last of the bread with her and she settled back into his arms i truly like maud even more than you predicted i would it will be a year in december since she was widowed so shell soon be able to consider marrying again do you think she will she says nothough she puts it more colorfully than that im very fond of maud too rhiannon but id rather not be discussing her marriage prospects right now im sure we can put this time to better use he suggested and set about proving it but within moments there was a loud insistent knocking on the door ranulf let me in ranulf swore softly so did rhiannon when the pounding persisted they reluctantly drew apart and he swung off the bed opening the door to his niece maud what are you doing back so soon you promised youd keep the children away at least until i am sorry maud panted but as soon as we got to the marketplace we heardpeople were talking of nothing else last night an urgent message arrived for the archbishop of canterbury summoning him to dover stephen has been stricken with the bloody flux and the doctors fear the ailment is mortal ranulfhe is said to be dying the royal castle of dover was unnaturally still at midday the bailey would normally have been bustling with activity now it was all but deserted the few men to be seen moved hurriedly about their tasks hasty almost furtive in their movements as if fearful of calling attention to themselves as soon as he rode through the gateway ranulf felt a chill of familiar foreboding bristol castle had looked like this too as robert lay dying you take our horses to the stables he told padarn then meet me in the hall padarn nodded will you be able to see him i do not know ranulf admitted relieved when padarn asked no further questions nor had rhiannon he was grateful for that as he could not have explained even to himself why he felt such an urgent need to see stephen before he died for rhiannon though no explanation was necessary shed sent him off with a quiet godspeed the great hall was crowded and ranulfs entrance went unnoticed almost at once he spied a familiar face one of the archbishops clerks and as soon as he could he caught thomas beckets eye becket had risen in the world since theyd last met hed been appointed that past june as the new archdeacon of canterbury now he greeted ranulf with the somber courtesy befitting the occasion but with just enough warmth to indicate his pleasure at seeing ranulf again it was adroitly done and confirmed ranulfs earlier impression of becket as a man who had the makings of a superior diplomat skilled at conveying nuances and shadings while keeping his own secrets safe taking ranulf aside he quietly confided the worst that stephen was not expected to see another sunrise becket had gone to arrange ranulfs admission into the royal sickroom waiting by the hearth ranulf happened to notice william de ypres sitting alone in a window seat on impulse he walked over do you remember me im ranulf fitz roy squinting up at him the fleming said well well if it is not the empresss brother although i suppose youll soon be known as the kings uncle why are you all so sure that stephen is dying he has begun to pass clotted blood id say thats as good a sign as any to send for the priest ranulf winced is he in much pain more than hell admit after a moment ypres said do you know why he was in dover he was meeting the count of flanders again discussing their plans to go on crusade god love him a crusade ranulfs throat constricted hed have made a fine crusader he said softly and the fleming nodded a better crusader than a king for certes i know ranulf agreed so why did we both race to his deathbed then ypres shrugged your guess is as good as mine he said flippantly but ranulf knew better the fleming would never admit it but theyd come to dover for the same reasonto mourn kings were not accorded privacy even dying was done in public stephens chamber was thronged with people the archbishop of canterbury several doctors a few priests william martel abbot clarembald of faversham the earl of arundel stephens grieving son just recovering from his march accident now about to be dealt another crippling blow will was the only family member present for stephens brother was coming from winchester and was not likely to arrive in time nor was his daughter mary for she had departed the nunnery in kent for romsey abbey in hampshire and seemed destined once again to miss saying her final farewell to a dying parent becket ushered ranulf toward the bed and then stepped back so that he might have some small measure of privacy ranulf was shocked at sight of stephen until then hed believed stephen might still rally for the bloody flux was not always fatal but as he looked down into stephens face he saw there was no hope death was not only on the way it was already in the chamber stephens eyes were sunken back in his head feverglazed and bloodshot but still lucid as ranulf bent over the bed he saw recognition in their depths and genuine joy that hed come stephen was too weak to talk much but when ranulf took his hand he managed a feeble squeeze even a shadowy flicker of a smile look after maudes lad ranulf nodded mutely stephens mouth was moving again tell maude but he got no further ranulf wondered if his strength had given out or hed just realized there was nothing to be said stephens eyes had closed his breathing had an audible rasp and ranulf was glad hed been shriven already for it sounded as if each faltering breath could be his last ranulf found himself thinking of his nephew just a few heartbeats away from becoming englands kingat twentyone stephen was fiftyeight and could easily have lived another ten or fifteen years instead he was dying less than a twelvemonth after theyd come to terms at winchester it occurred to ranulf that mayhap harry truly did have an ally in the almighty stephens lashes quivered cousin ranulf leaned closer to catch the whispered words i hope the lad gets more joy from his kingship than i did from mine rouen normandy october a squall had blown in from the west soon after petronillas arrival in rouen within the castle fires were kindled in every hearth and shutters hastily latched but the solar continued to echo with the sounds of the storms fury the winds howling put eleanor in mind of hungry wolves and the rain beat a steady tattoo against the slated roof loud enough at times to intrude upon their conversation petronilla moved her chair closer to the hearth sohow do you like sharing a city with your motherinlaw i know it did not take you long to vanquish louiss mother but she lacked the lady maudes imperial will if the empress is even half as formidable as her foes claim shed be a match for barbary pirates infidels and abbot bernard too why is it eleanor wondered that no one wants to believe maude and i are on good terms she is not a meddlesome motherinlaw for she has far too much dignity for that as for her imperial will i thanked god for it when harry was taken so ill last month when his fever would not break the doctors began to despair but not maude she fought death the way she did stephenno quarter givenand she won we took turns nursing him and kept death at bay long enough for harry to rally and once he was up and about what did he do just as soon as he had the strength to climb into the saddle he was off to torigny to besiege the castle of a rebel baron god save us all eleanor shook her head sounding both amused and exasperated and then shifted uncomfortably in her chair yolande emerged from the shadows offering a cushion and petronilla gave her a sympathetic look is the babe getting restless again eleanor grimaced much of the time i feel as if ive swallowed a frog she confided and february seems so far away men do not know what joys they are missing do they i remember complaining to raoul about one of my pregnancies for it was hellishly hot and sweltering that summer and i felt like a beached whale his response to tell me i should be thankful a womans pregnancy lasted only nine months as hed read in a bestiary that an elephant carried her calf for nigh on two years for most of the past year petronilla could not talk of raoul without tears that she could now jest about her late husband showed eleanor that even heart wounds could heal if given enough time positioning the cushion behind her aching back eleanor smiled at her sister did you hear about louis that he went off on pilgrimage louis has always yearned to visit the holy shrine at santiago de compostela and now he is doing just that but for once he has more in mind than the salvation of his immortal soul you see petra the king of castile has a marriageable daughter and if she finds favor with louisthat is if she is unlike me in all particularshe will probably return to france with a bride by a very roundabout route though eleanor said and grinned rather than ask me for a safeconduct through aquitaine louis traveled to castile by way of toulouse petronilla grinned too louis will have to perform an exorcism to rid his marriage bed of your ghost she predicted and even then my lady yolande had departed the solar only moments before now she was back flushed and breathless the empressshe is here i just saw her ride into the bailey eleanor and petronilla exchanged alarmed looks what would have brought maude out in such a stormexcept news of dire urgency nor were they reassured when maude was ushered into the solar for she was soaked to the skin her mantle muddied and her hair windblown the first time that eleanor had ever seen her elegant motherinlaw in such disarray good lord maude you look like a drowned cat what possessed you to leave the priory in such vile weather unlessnothing has happened to harry no maude cried oh no my news is from england eleanor from the archbishop of canterbury she paused for breath and then she smiled a smile of triumph and joy and vindication a smile nineteen years overdue stephen is dead she said and englands crown now belongs to my son henry is to be king stephen died on october th in the year of our lord and was buried with his wife and son eustace at the abbey he and matilda had founded at faversham it was a quiet end to such a bloody war and an ironic one that after almost two decades of a disputed succession henrys accession should be so peaceful and uncontested so confident was the young king that he even delayed his departure long enough to bring his siege at torigny to a victorious conclusion once henry did take action he moved with characteristic dispatch by november th he was at barfleur assembling a large fleet but for all that henry ruled anjou maine touraine and aquitaine and was now to rule the kingdom of england he had no dominion over the weather that november saw storm after storm raking the channel battering the seaports churning up towering waves and making it too hazardous to attempt a crossing barfleurs inns and taverns overflowed with henrys entourage brawls broke out among his bored soldiers tempers frayed and anxious eyes scanned the evening skies searching in vain for signs of clearing after four weeks of waiting henry lost all patience they would sail on the morrow he announced and let the storms be damned a high wind was whipping through the streets of barfleur tearing ale poles from their hangings banging shutters and discouraging all but the hardiest souls from gathering to watch as the royal fleet got under way no rain had fallen since dawn but the sky looked angry splotched with ominous leaden clouds and patches of pale fog hid the horizon out in the harbor the ships were pitching masts bobbing up and down queasy passengers huddled at the gunwales for one last glimpse of shore anchors were being winched up sails unfurled but the kings ship was still moored at the quay waiting for henry to board the quay was almost deserted watch your step henry cautioned the footing is slippery in spots maude nodded tightening her hand on his arm he stopped then for theyd reached the gangplank sothis is farewell mama unless you change your mind and come with us she smiled shaking her head weve already discussed this henry it is best that i remain here keeping an eye on normandy in your absence i wish youd reconsider will and my uncles and cousins will be there to witness my coronation as will eleanors brothers and petronilla even geoff he added dryly glancing over his shoulder toward the ship but failing to find his disgruntled brother midst the passengers milling about on the deck you ought to be there too mamayou above all others he saw though that she would not relent and yielded reluctantly as you wish then i do not understand your decision but i will accept it just as ive accepted your decision to sail on such a foul day she pointed out although i like it not i could wait no longer mama but you need not fear for we will outrun the storm i am just sorry the seas were so rough on st catherines day what could have been more fitting than to sail on the same day as the white ship she suspected he was joking yet the very suggestion gave maude a superstitious chill jesu forfend that would have been tempting providence for certes and had you been foolhardy enough to do so i very much doubt that anyone would have dared to sail with you no henry said and laughed id wager eleanor would have maude looked across at the ship soon spotted her daughterinlaw warmly wrapped in a furtrimmed red mantle and nearby a nurse holding maudes small grandson yes maude conceded eleanor probably would for better or worse her son and his wife were well matched hawk mating hawk and flying high and then it was time stepping forward she gave him a hasty farewell hug god keep you safe henry he will he assured her and when next i see you mama ill bring back a crownand another grandson for you a quick kiss haphazardly aimed at her cheek and he was gone crossing the gangplank with a swift confident step eager to depart to claim his kingdom alone on the quay maude watched as her sons ship headed out into the harbor the sails were billowing the mast lantern swaying wildly and she said a brief silent prayer for her sons for all those crossing the channel on this raw december morning and then for the souls of the doomed passengers whod drowned in the wreck of the white ship braving the wind minna ventured out onto the quay maude did not seem aware of her approach keeping her eyes upon the fleet but then she said softly henry does not understand why id not come but how could i tell him minna hed think that i begrudged him his kingship and nothing could be more untrue than that i am so proud that he is to be king it is just that i could not watch as the crown was placed upon his head for that would have stirred up too many hurtful memories too many regrets england is henrys kingdom but it was never mine minna said nothing for between them there was no need of words the wind was knifing across the quay and freezing rain had begun to splatter onto the wet wooden planks beyond the harbor henrys fleet was disappearing into the fog henrys fleet had scattered in the fog but all eventually came ashore safely henry and eleanors ship dropped anchor in a cove near the new forest after fighting raging seas for twentyfour turbulent hours without waiting for a royal escort they rode for winchester and within days were welcomed into london coronation plans were rushed forward and on the th of december henry and eleanor were crowned in a splendid ceremony at westminsters great abbey what would become known as the plantagenet dynasty had begun westminster palace was not habitable for it had been despoiled after stephens death and henry and eleanor were forced to lodge across the river at bermondsey in a onceroyal manor now owned by the cluniac priory of st saviour ranulf and rhiannon had found lodgings at bermondsey too in one of the priory guesthouses they had very comfortable quarters for the monks had been lavish with their hospitality rhiannon had been puzzled at first by such solicitude for shed been slow to comprehend how important her husband now was as kinsman and close confidant of the young king and once she did understand she was frightened for never had englands siren songs sounded so tempting so seductive how long could ranulf resist their blandishments she no longer feared losing ranulf to annora or even to england after nearly five years of marriage she did not doubt that he loved her her fear was of losing wales lying awake on this cold december night waiting for ranulf to return from a private meeting with his nephew she made herself face a troubling truth that her husband might well want her and gilbert to live in england now that harry was king ranulf did not know how unhappy she was in this alien land for shed confided only in the almighty how could she complain his family had tried to make her welcome harry and eleanor maud amabel even rainald in his bluff hearty waytheyd all been kind but there was no acceptance beyond their small select circle she knew that to most people she would always be an oddity an object of curiosity pity and suspicion ranulf fitz roys blind welsh wife across the room gilbert mumbled in his sleep and rhiannon sat up listening intently until she was sure he was dreaming he was not happy in england either as homesick as she was shed been assuring him that theyd be going home soon but no longer for there was no comfort in a lie tonight when hed complained of missing grandpapa and aunt eleri shed said only me too gilbert me too tossing and turning in the bed she tried to imagine what her father and sister would be doing now sleeping most likely eleri might still be awake though for shed gotten pregnant within two months of her summer wedding where would she be when eleris time was nigh how could she not be there for her little sister in the birthing chamber pummeling her pillow she wondered if ranulf understood about hiraeth it translated as longing but meant so much more the love of the welsh for their homeland a sense of belonging pride in their past why they did not thrive when uprooted like plants set down in foreign soil if ranulf wanted them to live in england she would offer no protest for she would have followed him to hell if need be but it would be a life in exile rhiannon was sure shed be awake till dawn but sometime before midnight she fell into an uneasy doze her dream was not a pleasant one and she awoke with relief to find her husband in bed beside her as soon as she moved he drew her into his arms harry and eleanor asked after you rhiannon how is your headache much better she lied how was your evening interesting ranulf tightened his arms around her breathing in her fragrance familiar and flowersweet its begun to snow he murmured just in time for christmas gilbert will be right glad she said softly their first christmas away from wales how much snow could make up for that harry is a whirlwind on two feet lass king only four days and already with plans enough to keep him busy for years he means to name thomas becket as his chancellor and robert beaumont as a justiciar to punish william peverel for poisoning the earl of chester to expel the last of the foreign mercenaries and reclaim those crown castles which stephen lost and appoint new sheriffs and make the kings peace more than just a hope and a prayer and all that is just for a start i hope he plans to rest on the seventh day ranulf laughed that is what eleanor said too leaning over he kissed the corner of her mouth harry offered me an earldom tonight he said and rhiannon went rigid in his arms for a moment able to hear nothing but the beating of her own heart ii thought he would she managed to whisper at last i knew he would too he takes pleasure in giving and who can give more than a king it was no easy task convincing him that i did not want it you turned down an earldom you sound like harry did lovelike you swallowed your tongue yes i did i told harry id be right pleased to accept as many manors as he can spare preferably in the marches but ill be wanting no english earldom that is why i was late getting back it took me nigh on two hours to persuade him that i was not drunk butbut why i think you know rhiannon our son is three quarters welsh i want him to grow up in wales to know where he belongs an english earldom would yoke him to england whether he willed it or not when he is of an age to know his own mind mayhap he might choose that golden yoke but the choice ought to be his until he can make it though i must choose for himand i choose wales ranulfare you sure very sure i just hope our lad finds half the happiness in wales that i did he kissed her again and tasted tears rhiannon have i let you down mayhap i ought to have talked it over with you first but i thought we were in accord on this you do want us to go back to wales yes she said dear god yes well then he said after christmas well go home the january sky was a glazed boundless blue and bermondsey was adrift in a sea of snow glistening like crystal as the sun rose overhead the air was cold and clear the wind stilled youve a good day for travel henry said take care of my uncle rhiannon any man whod turn down an earldom needs looking after rhiannon heard laughter caught an elusive hint of summer roses and was then enveloped in a brief perfumed embrace by englands queen godspeed eleanor said warmly yn iach rhiannon rhiannon flashed a startled smile yn iach she echoed touched that eleanor should have taken the trouble to learn how to bid her a welsh farewell ranulf was now back beside her and after hed assured her that gilbert and gwen were settled into the horse litter she let him assist her up into the saddle ranulf was bantering again with henry who was about to depart in a day or so for oxford telling eleanor that if harry did not get back in time for the birth of their babe she ought to have sole say in picking the name eleanor agreed and warned her husband that she might be tempted to name the child stephen or mayhap even louis rhiannon politely joined in the laughter but she marveled at eleanors sangfroid had ranulf not been there for gilberts birth it would have been a far greater ordeal no as much as she liked harry and eleanor they were a breed apart this king of twentyone and his celebrated queen surely the only woman who would ever wear the crowns of both england and france she wished them well but she was so very glad to be going home with ranulf who did not yearn to soar up into the heavens who felt no need to see how close he could get to the sun without being scorched are we ready she asked and ranulf made one last joke wished eleanor a safe and easy lyingin and promised to be back ere the new babe could learn to walk swinging up into the saddle then he reached for the lead attached to rhiannons mare and they started off on their long journey back to wales ranulf had no regrets about what he was leaving behind after nineteen years of fighting over the english throne he had no doubts whatsoever that the most dangerous quarry was neither wild boar nor wolf no hunt was so hazardous as the pursuit of power fortunately his nephew harry was a skilled huntsman one of the best hed ever seen he glanced back once henry and eleanor were still out in the snowblanketed bailey they waved as ranulf turned and that was to be the memory he would carry into wales the two of them standing together in the bright winter sunlight smiling sure that the world like the english crown was theirs for the taking
