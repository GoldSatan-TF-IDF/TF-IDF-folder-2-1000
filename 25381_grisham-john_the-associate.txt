john grisham the associate to steve rubin suzanne herz john pitts alison rich rebecca holland john fontana and the rest of the gang at doubleday chapter the rules of the new haven youth league required that each kid play at least ten minutes in each game exceptions were allowed for players who had upset their coaches by skipping practice or violating other rules in such cases a coach could file a report before the game and inform the scorekeeper that soandso wouldnt play much if at all because of some infraction this was frowned on by the league it was after all much more recreational than competitive with four minutes left in the game coach kyle looked down the bench nodded at a somber and pouting little boy named marquis and said do you want to play without responding marquis walked to the scorers table and waited for a whistle his violations were numerous skipping practice skipping school bad grades losing his uniform foul language in fact after ten weeks and fifteen games marquis had broken every one of the few rules his coach tried to enforce coach kyle had long since realized that any new rule would be immediately violated by his star and for that reason he trimmed his list and fought the temptation to add new regulations it wasnt working trying to control ten innercity kids with a soft touch had put the red knights in last place in the and under division of the winter league marquis was only eleven but clearly the best player on the court he preferred shooting and scoring over passing and defending and within two minutes hed slashed through the lane around and through and over much larger players and scored six points his average was fourteen and if allowed to play more than half a game he could probably score thirty in his own young opinion he really didnt need to practice in spite of the oneman show the game was out of reach kyle mcavoy sat quietly on the bench watching the game and waiting for the clock to wind down one game to go and the season would be over his last as a basketball coach in two years hed won a dozen lost two dozen and asked himself how any person in his right mind would willingly coach at any level he was doing it for the kids hed said to himself a thousand times kids with no fathers kids from bad homes kids in need of a positive male influence and he still believed it but after two years of babysitting and arguing with parents when they bothered to show up and hassling with other coaches who were not above cheating and trying to ignore teenage referees who didnt know a block from a charge he was fed up hed done his community service in this town anyway he watched the game and waited yelling occasionally because thats what coaches are supposed to do he looked around the empty gym an old brick building in downtown new haven home to the youth league for fifty years a handful of parents were scattered through the bleachers all waiting for the final horn marquis scored again no one applauded the red knights were down by twelve with two minutes to go at the far end of the court just under the ancient scoreboard a man in a dark suit walked through the door and leaned against the retractable bleachers he was noticeable because he was white there were no white players on either team he stood out because he wore a suit that was either black or navy with a white shirt and a burgundy tie all under a trench coat that announced the presence of an agent or a cop of some variety coach kyle happened to see the man when he entered the gym and he thought to himself that the guy was out of place probably a detective of some sort maybe a narc looking for a dealer it would not be the first arrest in or around the gym after the agentcop leaned against the bleachers he cast a long suspicious look at the red knights bench and his eyes seemed to settle on coach kyle who returned the stare for a second before it became uncomfortable marquis let one fly from near midcourt air ball and coach kyle jumped to his feet spread his hands wide shook his head as if to ask why marquis ignored him as he loafed back on defense a dumb foul stopped the clock and prolonged the misery while looking at the freethrow shooter kyle glanced beyond him and in the background was the agentcop still staring not at the action but at the coach for a twentyfiveyearold law student with no criminal record and no illegal habits or proclivities the presence and the attention of a man who gave all indications of being employed by some branch of law enforcement should have caused no concern whatsoever but it never worked that way with kyle mcavoy street cops and state troopers didnt particularly bother him they were paid to simply react but the guys in dark suits the investigators and agents the ones trained to dig deep and discover secrets those types still unnerved him thirty seconds to go and marquis was arguing with a referee hed thrown an fbomb at a ref two weeks earlier and was suspended for a game coach kyle yelled at his star who never listened he quickly scanned the gym to see if agentcop no was alone or was now accompanied by agentcop no no he was not another dumb foul and kyle yelled at the referee to just let it slide he sat down and ran his finger over the side of his neck then flicked off the perspiration it was early february and the gym was as always quite chilly why was he sweating the agentcop hadnt moved an inch in fact he seemed to enjoy staring at kyle the decrepit old horn finally squawked the game was mercifully over one team cheered and one team really didnt care both lined up for the obligatory high fives and good game good game as meaningless to twelveyearolds as it is to college players as kyle congratulated the opposing coach he glanced down the court the white man was gone what were the odds he was waiting outside of course it was paranoia but paranoia had settled into kyles life so long ago that he now simply acknowledged it coped with it and moved on the red knights regrouped in the visitors locker room a cramped little space under the sagging and permanent stands on the home side there coach kyle said all the right things nice effort good hustle our game is improving in certain areas lets finish on a high note this saturday the boys were changing clothes and hardly listening they were tired of basketball because they were tired of losing and of course all blame was heaped upon the coach he was too young too white too much of an ivy leaguer the few parents who were there waited outside the locker room and it was those tense moments when the team came out that kyle hated most about his community service there would be the usual complaints about playing time marquis had an uncle a twentytwoyearold former allstate player with a big mouth and a fondness for bitching about coach kyles unfair treatment of the best player in the league from the locker room there was another door that led to a dark narrow hallway that ran behind the home stands and finally gave way to an outside door that opened into an alley kyle was not the first coach to discover this escape route and on this night he wanted to avoid not only the families and their complaints but also the agentcop he said a quick goodbye to his boys and as they fled the locker room he made his escape in a matter of seconds he was outside in the alley then walking quickly along a frozen sidewalk heavy snow had been plowed and the sidewalk was icy and barely passable the temperature was somewhere far below freezing it was on a wednesday and he was headed for the law journal offices at the yale law school where he would work until midnight at least he didnt make it the agent was leaning against the fender of a red jeep cherokee that was parked parallel on the street the vehicle was titled to one john mcavoy of york pennsylvania but for the past six years it had been the reliable companion of his son kyle the true owner though his feet suddenly felt like bricks and his knees were weak kyle managed to trudge on as if nothing were wrong not only did they find me he said to himself as he tried to think clearly but theyve done their homework and found my jeep not exactly highlevel research i have done nothing wrong he said again and again tough game coach the agent said when kyle was ten feet away and slowing down kyle stopped and took in the thick young man with red cheeks and red bangs whod been watching him in the gym can i help you he said and immediately saw the shadow of no dart across the street they always worked in pairs no reached into a pocket and as he said thats exactly what you can do he pulled out a leather wallet and flipped it open bob plant fbi a real pleasure kyle said as all the blood left his brain and he couldnt help but flinch no wedged himself into the frame he was much thinner and ten years older with gray around the temples he too had a pocketful and he performed the wellrehearsed badge presentation with ease nelson ginyard fbi he said bob and nelson both irish both northeastern anybody else kyle asked no got a minute to talk not really you might want to ginyard said it could be very productive i doubt that if you leave well just follow plant said as he stood from his slouch position and took a step closer you dont want us on campus do you are you threatening me kyle asked the sweat was back now in the pits of his arms and despite the arctic air a bead or two ran down his ribs not yet plant said with a smirk look lets spend ten minutes together over coffee ginyard was saying theres a sandwich shop just around the corner im sure its warmer there do i need a lawyer no thats what you always say my father is a lawyer and i grew up in his office i know your tricks no tricks kyle i swear ginyard said and he at least sounded genuine just give us ten minutes i promise you wont regret it whats on the agenda ten minutes thats all we ask give me a clue or the answer is no bob and nelson looked at each other both shrugged why not well have to tell him sooner or later ginyard turned and looked down the street and spoke into the wind duquesne university five years ago drunk frat boys and a girl kyles body and mind had different reactions his body conceded a quick slump of the shoulders a slight gasp a noticeable jerk in the legs but his mind fought back instantly thats bullshit he said then spat on the sidewalk ive already been through this nothing happened and you know it there was a long pause as ginyard continued to stare down the street while plant watched their subjects every move kyles mind was spinning why was the fbi involved in an alleged state crime in secondyear criminal procedure they had studied the new laws regarding fbi interrogation it was now an indictable offense to simply lie to an agent in this very situation should he shut up should he call his father no under no circumstances would he call his father ginyard turned took three steps closer clenched his jaw like a bad actor and tried to hiss his toughguy words lets cut to the chase mr mcavoy because im freezing theres an indictment out of pittsburgh okay rape if you want to play the hardass smartass brilliant law student and run get a lawyer or even call your old man then the indictment comes down tomorrow and the life you have planned is pretty much shot to shit however if you give us ten minutes of your valuable time right now in the sandwich shop around the corner then the indictment will be put on hold if not forgotten altogether you can walk away from it plant said from the side without a word why should i trust you kyle managed to say with a very dry mouth ten minutes you got a tape recorder sure i want it on the table okay i want every word recorded because i dont trust you fair enough they jammed their hands deep into the pockets of their matching trench coats and stomped away kyle unlocked his jeep and got inside he started the engine turned the heat on high and thought about driving away chapter busters deli was long and narrow with red vinyl booths along the wall to the right to the left was a bar and a grill behind a counter and a row of pinball machines all manner of yale memorabilia was tacked haphazardly on the walls kyle had eaten there a few times during his first year in law school many months ago the last two booths were properly secured by the federal government yet another trench coat stood at the last table chatting with plant and ginyard waiting when kyle made his slow approach the agent glanced at him then offered the standard smirk before sitting in the next booth no was waiting there sipping coffee plant and ginyard had ordered sandwich platters with subs and fries and pickles all of it untouched the table was covered with food and cups of coffee plant climbed to his feet and moved around to the other side so that both agents could watch their victim they were shoulder to shoulder still in trench coats kyle slid into the booth the lighting was old and bad the back corner was dark pinball racket mixed with a loud game on espn from the bartenders flat screen it takes four kyle asked nodding over his shoulder at the booth behind him thats just what you can see ginyard said would you like a sandwich plant asked no an hour earlier he had been famished now his digestive system and his excretory system and his nervous system were on the verge of a meltdown he was struggling to breathe normally as he desperately tried to appear unfazed he removed a disposable pen and a note card and with all the nerve he could summon he said id like to see those badges again the responses were identical disbelief insulted then ohwhatthehell as they slowly reached into their pockets and extracted their most prized possessions they laid them on the table and kyle selected ginyards first he wrote down the full name nelson edward ginyard then his agent number he squeezed the pen hard and recorded the information carefully his hand shook but he thought it wasnt noticeable he rubbed the brass emblem carefully not sure what he was looking for but still taking his time could i see a photo id he asked what the hell ginyard growled photo id please no im not talking until i finish the preliminaries just show me your drivers license ill show you mine we already have a copy of yours whatever lets have it ginyard rolled his eyes as he reached for his back pocket from a battered billfold he produced a connecticut license with an ominous snapshot of himself kyle examined it and jotted down the birth date and license data thats worse than a passport photo he said you wanna see my wife and kids ginyard said as he removed a color photo and tossed it on the table no thanks which office are you guys from hartford ginyard said he nodded at the next booth and said theyre from pittsburgh nice kyle then examined plants badge and drivers license and when he had finished he pulled out his cell phone and began pecking what are you doing ginyard asked im going online to check you out you think were posted on some nice little fbi web site plant said with a flash of anger both found it humorous neither seemed concerned i know which site to check kyle said as he entered the address of a littleknown federal directory you wont find us ginyard said this will take a minute wheres that tape recorder plant produced a slender digital recorder the size of an electric toothbrush and flipped it on please give the date time and place kyle said with an air of confidence that surprised even him and please state that the interrogation has yet to begin and that no statements have been made before now yes sir i love law students plant said you watch too much television ginyard said go ahead plant situated the recorder in the center of the table a pastrami and cheddar on one side and a smoked tuna on the other he aimed his words at it and announced the preliminaries kyle was watching his phone and when the web site appeared he entered the name of nelson edward ginyard a few seconds passed and to the surprise of no one agent ginyard was confirmed as a field agent fbi hartford you wanna see it kyle asked holding up the tiny screen congratulations ginyard shot back are you satisfied now no id prefer not to be here you can leave anytime you want plant said you asked for ten minutes kyle glanced at his wristwatch both agents leaned forward all four elbows in a row the booth suddenly smaller you remember a guy named bennie wright chief investigator sex crimes pittsburgh pd ginyard was talking both were staring watching every nervous twitch of kyles eyelids no you didnt meet him five years ago during the investigation i dont remember meeting a bennie wright could have but i dont remember that name it has been after all five years since the nonevent did not happen they absorbed this mulled it over slowly while maintaining eye contact it appeared to kyle as if both wanted to say youre lying instead ginyard said well detective wright is here in town and hed like to meet with you in about an hour another meeting if you dont mind it wont take long and theres a good chance you can head off the indictment indictment for what exactly rape there was no rape the pittsburgh police made that decision five years ago well it looks like the girl is back ginyard said shes put her life back together gone through some extensive therapy and best of all shes got herself a lawyer now since ginyard stopped without a question there was no need for a response kyle couldnt help but sink an inch or two he glanced over at the counter at the empty stools he glanced over at the flatscreen television it was a college game the stands full of screaming students and he asked himself why he was sitting where he was sitting keep talking he said to himself but dont say anything can i ask a question he asked sure if the indictment has been issued how can it be stopped why are we talking its under seal by court order ginyard said according to detective wright the prosecutor has a deal for you one that the victims lawyer cooked up one that will allow you to walk away from this mess you play ball and the indictment against you will never see the light of day im still confused maybe i should call my father thats up to you but if youre smart youll wait until you chat with detective wright you guys didnt advise me of my miranda rights this is not an interrogation plant finally said its not an investigation then he reached into the smokedtuna basket and pulled out a greasy fry what the hell is it a meeting ginyard cleared his throat leaned back a few inches and proceeded its a state crime kyle we all know that normally we wouldnt be involved but since youre here in connecticut and the indictment is in pennsylvania the boys in pittsburgh asked us to help arrange the next meeting after that well step aside im still confused come on bright legal mind like you surely youre not that thick there was a long pause as all three considered the next move plant chomped on his second fry but his eyes never left kyle ginyard took a sip of coffee frowned at the taste and continued staring the pinball machines were silent the deli was empty except for the four fbi agents a bartender absorbed in the game and kyle finally kyle leaned forward on his elbows and with the recorder just inches away he said there was no rape no crime i did nothing wrong fine talk to wright and where is he at ten oclock hell be at the holiday inn on saw mill road room this is a bad idea i need a lawyer maybe you do maybe you dont ginyard said leaning in so that their heads were a foot apart look i know you dont trust us but please believe it when we say you should talk to wright before you talk to anyone else hell you can call a lawyer or your father at midnight or tomorrow if you overreact now the outcome could be a disaster im leaving conversation over turn off the recorder neither made any move toward the recorder kyle looked at it then leaned down and said very clearly this is kyle mcavoy the time is pm i have nothing else to say i have made no statements and i am leaving busters deli right now he scooted off the bench and was almost out of the booth when plant blurted hes got the video a horse kick to the groin could not have hit harder kyle clutched the red vinyl and looked as though he might faint slowly he sat down again slowly he reached for a plastic cup and took a long sip of water his lips and tongue were parched and the water did little to help the video a fraternity brother one of the drunks at the little party had allegedly recorded something with his cell phone supposedly there were images of the girl naked on a sofa too drunk to move and admiring her were three or four or five beta brothers all naked too or in the process of undressing kyle vaguely remembered the scene but hed never seen the video it had been destroyed according to beta legend the cops in pittsburgh had searched but never found it it was gone forgotten buried deep in the secrecy of beta brotherhood plant and ginyard were elbow to elbow again all four eyes focused and unblinking what video kyle managed to ask but it was so lame and so unconvincing that he didnt believe himself the one you boys hid from the cops plant said barely moving his lips the one that places you at the scene of the crime the one that will destroy your life and send you away for twenty years oh that video i dont know what youre talking about kyle said then drank some more water waves of nausea crashed through his stomach and head and he thought about vomiting oh i think you do ginyard said have you seen this video kyle asked both nodded then you know i didnt touch the girl maybe maybe not but you were there ginyard said you were an accessory to keep from throwing up kyle closed his eyes and began rubbing his temples the girl was a wild little thing whod spent more time in the beta house than in her dorm room a groupie a dinger a party animal with an abundant supply of daddys cash the brothers of beta passed her around when she cried rape the brothers had instantly gone mute and solidified into an impenetrable wall of denial and innocence the cops eventually gave up when she proved too unreliable with the details no charges were filed she later left duquesne and mercifully disappeared the great miracle of the ugly little episode was that it had been kept quiet no additional lives were ruined the indictment names you and three others ginyard said there was no rape kyle said as he continued to rub his temples if she had sex i promise you it was by consent not if she blacked out ginyard said were not here to argue kyle plant said thats what lawyers are for were here to help cut a deal if youll cooperate then this will all go away at least your part of it what kind of deal detective wright will handle that kyle slowly sat back and tapped his head on the red vinyl bench behind him he wanted to plead to beg to explain that this wasnt fair that he was about to graduate and pass the bar and start a career his future held so much promise his past was unblemished almost but they already knew that didnt they he glanced at the tape recorder and decided to give them nothing all right all right he said ill be there ginyard leaned even closer and said you have one hour if you make a phone call well know it if you try to run well follow okay no funny stuff kyle youre making the right decision here i swear it just keep it up and this will all go away i dont believe you youll see kyle left them there with their cold sandwiches and bitter coffee he made it to his jeep then drove to his apartment three blocks from campus he rummaged through his roommates bathroom found a valium then locked his bedroom door turned off the light and stretched out on the floor chapter it was an old holiday inn built in the s when motels and fastfood chains raced to build along the highways and frontage roads kyle had passed it a hundred times and never seen it behind it was a pancake house and next door was a large discount appliance store the parking lot was dark and onethird full when he backed the red jeep into a space next to a minivan from indiana he turned off the lights but left the engine running and the heater on a light snow was falling why couldnt there be a blizzard or a flood or earthquake an invasion anything to interrupt this awful scenario why exactly was he sleepwalking through their little plan the video in the past hour hed thought of calling his father but that conversation would take far too long john mcavoy would provide sound legal advice and quickly but the backstory had many complications hed thought of calling professor bart mallory his adviser his friend his brilliant teacher of criminal procedure a former judge who would know exactly what to do but again there were too many blanks to fill in and not enough time hed thought of calling two of his beta brothers from duquesne but why bother any advice they might give would be as unsound as the strategies racing through his mind no sense ruining their lives and in the horror of the moment hed thought of the various schemes he could use to disappear a mad dash to the airport a clandestine car ride to the bus station a long jump off a tall bridge but they were watching werent they and probably listening too so all phone calls would be shared someone was watching at that very moment he was certain perhaps in the minivan from indiana there were a couple of goons with headsets and nightvision gear getting their jollies as they monitored him and burned taxpayer money if the valium was working he couldnt tell when the digital clock on the radio hit he turned off the engine and stepped into the snow he walked bravely across the asphalt each step leaving footprints could this be his last moment of freedom hed read so many cases of criminal defendants freely walking into the police station for a few quick questions only to be charged handcuffed jailed railroaded by the system he could still run to somewhere when the glass doors slammed behind him he paused for a second in the deserted lobby and thought he heard the clanging of cellblock iron at his back he was hearing things seeing things imagining things apparently the valium had reversed itself and had him ready to jump out of his skin he nodded at the decrepit clerk behind the front counter but there was no audible response as he rode the musty elevator to the second floor he asked himself what kind of fool would voluntarily enter a motel room filled with cops and agents all hellbent on accusing him of something that never happened why was he doing this the video he had never seen it he did not know anyone who had seen it in the secret world of beta there were rumors and denials and threats but no one had even known for sure if the elaine thing had actually been recorded the reality that it had and that the evidence was now in the possession of the pittsburgh police and the fbi made him ponder the bridge scenario wait a minute i did nothing wrong i did not touch that girl not that night anyway no one touched her at least that was the sworn and battletested version within the beta fraternity but what if the video proved otherwise he would never know until he saw it the noxious smell of fresh paint hit him as he stepped into the hallway on the second floor he stopped at room and glanced at his watch to make sure he was not a minute too early he knocked three times then heard movement and muffled voices the lock chain rattled the door was jerked open and special agent nelson edward ginyard said glad you could make it kyle stepped inside leaving the old world behind the new one was suddenly terrifying ginyard had his jacket off and strapped over his white shirt was a shoulder harness with a fairly large black pistol in a black holster snug under his left arm agent plant and the two others from busters were staring and all three were also coatless so that young kyle could get the full measure of their arsenal identical ninemillimeter berettas with matching holsters and black leather harnesses seriously armed men all with the same scowl as if theyd be more than happy to shoot the rapist good move plant said nodding now actually kyle thought in the haze of the moment coming here was a very stupid move room had been converted into a makeshift field office the kingsized bed had been pushed into a corner the curtains were tightly closed two folding tables had been hauled in and were covered with the evidence of busy work files and thick envelopes and notepads three laptops were open and on and in the one nearest the door kyle caught a glimpse of himself from his high school yearbook central york high school class of tacked to the bare wall behind the folding tables were eightbyten color photos of three of his beta brothers at the far end almost to the curtains was one of elaine keenan the room adjoined another and the door between them was open agent no walked through it same gun same holster and glared at kyle five agents two rooms a ton of paperwork all this effort all this work all these men just to nail me kyle felt lightheaded as he observed the power of his government in action do you mind emptying your pockets ginyard said as he offered a small cardboard box why please you think im armed you think i might pull out a knife and attack you guys agent no saw the humor and broke the ice with a good laugh kyle pulled out his key ring jangled its collection for ginyard to see then put it back in his pocket how about a pat down plant said already moving toward kyle oh sure he said then raised his arms all yale students are heavily armed plant began a very soft and quick frisk he finished just seconds after he started then disappeared into the other room detective wright is across the hall ginyard said yet another room kyle followed him out of the room into the stuffy hallway then waited as he tapped gently on the door to room when it opened kyle entered alone bennie wright displayed no weaponry he offered a quick handshake while spitting out detective wright pittsburgh pd a real pleasure kyle thought but said nothing what am i doing here wright was in his late forties short trim bald with a few strands of black hair slicked back just above his ears his eyes were also black and partially concealed behind a pair of tiny reading glasses perched halfway down his narrow nose he closed the door behind kyle then waved at the appointed spot and said why dont you have a seat what do you have in mind kyle asked without moving wright walked past the bed and stopped beside yet another folding table this one with two cheap metal chairs facing each other lets talk kyle he said pleasantly and kyle realized he had a slight accent english was not his first language though there was almost no trace of his native tongue but it was odd a man named bennie wright from pittsburgh should not have a foreign accent there was a small video camera mounted on a tripod in one corner wires ran to the table to a laptop with a twelveinch screen please wright said waving at one chair as he settled himself into the other i want all of this recorded kyle said wright glanced over his shoulder at the camera and said no problem slowly kyle walked to the other chair and sat down wright was rolling up the sleeves of his white shirt his necktie was already loose to kyles right was the laptop with a blank screen to his left a thick unopened file in the center of the table was a fresh legal pad white with a black pen on it waiting turn on the camera kyle said wright punched the laptop and kyles face appeared on the screen he looked at himself and saw nothing but fear wright went efficiently into the file retrieving the necessary paperwork as if young kyle here were simply applying for a student credit card when the proper sheets were found he placed them in the center and said first we need to cover your miranda rights no kyle said softly first we need to see your badge and some identification this irritated the detective but only for a few seconds without a word he fished out a brown leather wallet from a rear pocket opened it and said had this for twentytwo years now kyle examined the bronze badge and it did indeed show signs of age benjamin j wright pittsburgh police department officer number how about a drivers license wright yanked back his wallet opened another compartment fingered through some cards and then flung down a pennsylvania photo license satisfied now he snapped kyle handed it back and said why is the fbi involved in this can we finish up with miranda wright was readjusting the paperwork sure i understand miranda im sure you do a top law student at one of our most prestigious law schools a very smart young man kyle was reading as wright was talking you have the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in court you have the right to an attorney if you cant afford one then the state will provide one any questions no he signed his name on two forms and slid them back to wright why is the fbi involved he repeated the question believe me kyle the fbi is the least of your problems wrights hands were hairy still calm and his fingers were laced together on top of the legal pad he spoke slowly with authority there was no doubt this meeting belonged to him here is my suggestion kyle we have so much ground to cover and time is slipping by did you ever play football yes then lets say this table is a football field not a great analogy but one that will work you are here at this goal line with his left hand he striped an imaginary line in front of the laptop you have a hundred yards to go to score to win to walk out of here in one piece with his right hand he laid down the other goal line next to the heavy file his hands were four feet apart a hundred yards kyle bear with me okay okay he pulled his hands together and tapped the legal pad somewhere in here at about the fifty ill show you the video that is the source of this conflict you wont like it kyle it will make you ill nauseous sick to your stomach but if we are able then we will continue your little march to the goal line and when we get there you will be quite relieved you will once again see yourself as the golden boy the handsome young man with an unlimited future and an unblemished past stick with me kyle allow me to be the boss the coach the man calling the plays and together well make it to the promised land his right hand tapped the goal line what about the indictment wright touched the file and said its here when do i see it stop asking questions kyle i have the questions hopefully you have the answers the accent wasnt spanish eastern european maybe and at times it was so slight it almost disappeared wrights left hand touched the goal line in front of the laptop now kyle we need to start with the basics just some background okay whatever wright pulled some papers from the file studied them for a second then picked up his pen you were born on february in york pennsylvania third child and only son of john and patty mcavoy they divorced in when you were six years old neither has remarried correct correct wright made a check mark then launched into a series of quick questions about family members their birth dates education jobs addresses hobbies church affiliations even politics as the list grew longer wright shuffled papers and the check marks multiplied he had his facts straight every one of them he knew the date and place of the birth of kyles twoyearold nephew in santa monica when he finished with the family he pulled out more papers kyle felt the first signs of fatigue and they were just warming up would you like something to drink wright asked no your father is a general practice lawyer in york it was a statement but more of a question kyle only nodded then a barrage about his father his life and career and interests after every fourth or fifth question kyle wanted to ask is this really relevant but he held his tongue wright had all the data kyle was simply affirming what someone else had found your mother is an artist of some variety kyle heard him say yes and where is the football right now youve gained about ten yards what kind of artist shes a painter they probed the life of patty mcavoy for ten minutes finally the detective finished with the family and settled on the suspect he served up a few easy ones about his childhood but didnt dwell on the details he already knows it all kyle told himself honors from central york high star athlete eagle scout why did you select duquesne university they offered me a basketball scholarship were there other offers a couple from smaller schools but you didnt play much at duquesne i played thirteen minutes as a freshman then tore an acl in the final minute of the final game surgery yes but the knee was gone i quit basketball and joined a fraternity well get to the fraternity later were you invited back to the basketball team sort of didnt matter the knee was shot you majored in economics and made nearperfect grades what happened in spanish your second year you didnt make an a i shouldve taken german i guess one b in four years is not bad wright flipped a page made a note about something kyle glanced at his face on the laptop and told himself to relax high honors a dozen or so student organizations intramural softball champs fraternity secretary then president your academic record is impressive yet you managed to also maintain a pretty active social life tell me about your first arrest im sure you have the records in your file there your first arrest kyle only one a first not a second not until now i guess what happened typical frat stuff a loud party that didnt stop until the cops showed up i got caught with an open container a bottle of beer nitpicking stuff misdemeanor i paid a fine of three hundred bucks and got six months probation after that the record was expunged and yale never knew about it did your father handle it he was involved but i had a lawyer in pittsburgh who a lady named sylvia marks ive heard of her doesnt she specialize in stupid fraternity stunts thats her but she knows her stuff i thought there was a second arrest no i was stopped by the cops once on campus but there was no arrest just a warning what were you doing nothing then why were you stopped a couple of fraternities were shooting bottle rockets at each other smart boys i was not involved nothing went in my file so im wondering how you heard about it wright ignored this and wrote something on his legal pad when he finished scribbling he said why did you decide to go to law school i made that decision when i was twelve years old i always wanted to be a lawyer my first job was running the copier in my fathers office i sort of grew up there where did you apply to law school penn yale cornell and stanford where were you accepted all four why yale it was always my first choice did yale offer scholarship money financial incentives yes so did the others have you borrowed money yes how much do you really need to know i wouldnt ask the question if i didnt need to know you think im talking just to hear myself talk i cant answer that back to the student loans when i graduate in may ill owe about sixty thousand wright nodded as if he agreed that this was the correct amount he flipped another page and kyle could see that it too was covered with questions and you write for the law journal im the editor in chief of the yale law journal thats the most prestigious honor in the school according to some you clerked last summer in new york tell me about it it was one of those huge wall street firms scully pershing a typical summer clerkship we were wined and dined and given easy hours the same seduction routine all the big firms use they pamper the clerks then kill them when they become associates did scully pershing offer you a position after graduation yes did you accept or decline neither i have not made a decision the firm has given me some additional time to decide whats taking so long i have a few options one is a clerkship for a federal judge but he might get a promotion things are in limbo there do you have other job offers i had other offers yes tell me about them is this really relevant everything i say is relevant kyle do you have any water im sure theres some in the bathroom kyle jumped to his feet walked between the kingsized bed and the credenza switched on the light in the cramped bathroom and ran tap water into a flimsy plastic cup he gulped it then refilled when he returned to the table he placed the cup somewhere around his own twentyyard line then checked himself on the monitor just curious he said wheres the football right now third and long tell me about the other job offers the other firms why dont you just show me the video so we can skip all this bullshit if it really exists and if it implicates me then ill walk out of here and go hire a lawyer wright leaned forward adjusted his elbows on the table and began gently tapping his fingertips together the lower half of his face eased into a smile while the upper half remained noncommittal very coolly he said losing your temper kyle could cost you your life life as in dead body or life as in brilliant future kyle wasnt so sure he took a deep breath then another gulp of the water the flash of anger was gone replaced by the crush of confusion and fear the fake smile widened and wright said please kyle youre doing fine here just a few more questions and well move into rougher territory the other firms i was offered a job by logan kupec in new york baker potts in san francisco and garton in london i said no to all three im still kicking around a publicinterest job doing what where its down in virginia a legal aid position helping migrant workers and how long would you do this couple of years maybe im not sure its just an option at a much lower salary oh yes much how will you pay back your student loans ill figure that out wright didnt like the smartass answer but decided to let it slide he glanced at his notes though a quick review wasnt necessary he knew that young kyle here owed in student loans all of which would be forgiven by yale if he spent the next three years working for minimum wage protecting the poor the oppressed the abused or the environment kyles offer had been extended by piedmont legal aid and the clerkship was funded by a grant from a mammoth law firm in chicago according to wrights sources kyle had verbally accepted the position which paid a year wall street could wait it would always be there his father had encouraged him to spend a few years out in the trenches getting his hands dirty far away from the corporate style of law that he john mcavoy despised according to the file scully pershing was offering a base salary of plus the usual extras the other firms offers were similar when will you select a job wright asked very soon which way are you leaning im not are you sure of course im sure wright reached for the file shaking his head grimly and frowning as if hed been insulted he retrieved more papers flipped through them then glared at kyle you havent made a verbal commitment to accept a position with an outfit called piedmont legal aid in winchester virginia beginning september the second of this year a rush of warm air escaped through kyles dry lips as he absorbed this he instinctively glanced at the monitor and yes he looked as weak as he felt he almost blurted how the hell do you know this but to do so would be to admit the truth nor could he deny the truth wright already knew as he was lurching toward some lame response his adversary moved in for the kill lets call this lie number one okay kyle wright said with a sneer should we somehow arrive at lie number two then we turn off the camera say good night and meet again tomorrow for the arrest handcuffs perp walk mug shot maybe a reporter or two you wont be thinking about protecting illegal immigrants and you wont be thinking about wall street dont lie to me kyle i know too much kyle almost said yes sir but instead managed only a slight affirmative nod so you plan to do some charitable work for a couple of years yes then what i dont know im sure ill join a firm somewhere start a career what do you think of scully pershing big powerful rich i think its the largest law firm in the world depending on who got merged or swallowed yesterday offices in thirty cities on five continents some really smart folks who work very hard and put enormous pressure on each other especially on their young associates your kind of work its hard to say the money is great the work is brutal but its the big leagues ill probably end up there in what section did you work last summer i moved around but most of my time was spent in litigation do you like litigation not especially may i ask what these questions can possibly have to do with that matter back in pittsburgh wright took his elbows off the table and tried to relax a little deeper into the folding chair he crossed his legs and placed the legal pad on his left thigh he chewed the end of his pen for a moment staring at kyle as if he were now a psychiatrist analyzing the patient lets talk about your fraternity at duquesne whatever there were about ten members of your pledge class right nine do you keep in touch with all of them to some degree the indictment names you and three others so lets talk about the other three where is alan strock the indictment somewhere in that damned file less than three feet away was the indictment how could his name be listed as a defendant he had not touched the girl he had not witnessed a rape he had not seen anyone having sex he vaguely recalled being present in the room but he had blacked out at some point during the night during the episode how could he be an accomplice if he wasnt conscious that would be his defense at trial and a solid defense it would be but the specter of a trial was too awful to imagine a trial would come long after the arrest the publicity the horror of seeing his photo in print kyle closed his eyes and rubbed his temples and he thought about the phone calls home first to his father and then to his mother other phone calls would follow one each to the recruiting directors whod offered him jobs one to each of his sisters he would proclaim his innocence and all that but he knew he would never shake the suspicion of rape at that moment kyle had no confidence in detective wright and whatever deal he had in mind if there was indeed an indictment then no miracle could keep it buried alan strock wright asked hes in med school at ohio state any recent correspondence an email a couple of days ago and joey bernardo hes still in pittsburgh working for a brokerage firm recent contact by phone a few days ago any mention of elaine keenan with alan or joey no you boys have tried to forget about elaine havent you yes well shes back evidently wright readjusted himself in the chair uncrossed his legs stretched his back and returned to the most comfortable position with both elbows stuck on the table elaine left duquesne after her freshman year he began in a softer voice as if he had a long tale to tell she was troubled her grades were a mess she now claims that the rape brought on severe emotional distress she lived with her parents for a year or so in erie then began drifting a lot of selfmedication booze and drugs she saw some therapists but nothing helped have you heard any of this no after she left school there was not a word anyway she has an older sister in scranton who took her in got her some help paid for rehab then they found a shrink who evidently has done a nice job of putting elaine back together shes clean sober feels great and her memory has improved dramatically shes also found herself a lawyer and of course she is demanding justice you sound skeptical im a cop kyle im skeptical of everything but i have this young woman who is credible and who says she was raped and i have a video that is pretty powerful evidence and on top of that theres this lawyer whos out for blood this is a shakedown isnt it all about money what do you mean kyle the fourth defendant is baxter tate and of course we know what thats all about the tate family is very rich old pittsburgh money baxter was born with trust funds how much does she want ill ask the questions did you ever have sex yes i had sex with elaine keenan as did most of my pledge class she was wild as hell spent more time in the beta house than most betas could drink any three of us under the table and always had a purse full of pills her problems began long before she arrived at duquesne believe me she does not want to go to trial how many times did you have sex with her once about a month before the alleged rape do you know if baxter tate had sexual relations with elaine keenan on the night in question kyle paused took a deep breath and said no i do not i blacked out did baxter tate admit to having sex with her that night not to me wright finished writing a long sentence on his legal pad as the air cleared kyle could almost hear the camera running he glanced at it and saw the little red light still staring at him where is baxter wright asked after a long heavy pause somewhere in la he barely graduated then went to hollywood to become an actor hes not too stable meaning he comes from a wealthy family thats even more dysfunctional than most wealthy families hes a hard partier lots of booze and drugs and girls and he shows no signs of outgrowing it his goal in life is to become a great actor and drink himself to death he wants to die young sort of like james dean has he been in any films not a single one lots of bars though wright suddenly seemed bored with the questions he had stopped his scribbling his hard stare began to drift he stuffed some papers back into the file then tapped a finger at the center of the table weve made progress kyle thank you the ball is at midfield you want to see the video chapter wright stood for the first time stretched and stepped to a corner where a small cardboard box was waiting it was white and in a neat hand someone had printed with a black marker the words in re kyle l mcavoy et al kyle mcavoy and others wright fetched something from the box and with the steady purpose of an executioner preparing to pull the switch he removed a disc from its sleeve slid it into the drive on the laptop punched a couple of keys then took his seat kyle could barely breathe as the computer clicked and hummed wright began talking the phone was a nokia smartphone manufactured in with eti camcorder software installed onegigabyte memory card that holds about three hundred minutes of compressed video megapixel quality at fifteen fps voice commands voice activated state of the art for the time a really nice cell phone owned by wright shot him a smartass grin and said sorry kyle for some reason wright thought it would be helpful to show the phone itself he punched a key and a still photo of the nokia appeared on the screen ever see this he asked no didnt think so heres the scene kyle in case youre a little fuzzy on the details its april last day of classes final exams start in a week its a friday unseasonably warm for pittsburgh high of eightyfive that day almost set a record and the kids at duquesne decide to do what all good college kids do everywhere they start drinking in the afternoon and have big plans to drink all night a crowd gathers at the apartment complex where you rent a place with three others a party materializes by the pool its mostly beta brothers and a few girls you go for a swim get some rays drink some beer listen to phish the girls are in bikinis life is good sometime after dark the party moves inside to your apartment pizza is ordered the music widespread panic by this time is loud more beer somebody shows up with two bottles of tequila and of course this is consumed as fast as possible remember any of this most of it youre twenty years old just finishing your sophomore year got that the tequila gets mixed with red bull and you and the gang start doing shots im sure youve had a few shots kyle nodded his eyes never leaving the screen at some point clothes start coming off and the owner of the cell phone decides to secretly record this guess he wanted his own little video of the girls without their tops do you remember the apartment kyle yes i lived there for a year weve examined the place its a dump of course like a lot of college housing but according to the landlord hasnt changed our best guess is that the guy with the cell phone placed it on the narrow counter that separates the small kitchen from the den the counter seems to be a catchall for textbooks phone books empty beer bottles pretty much everything that passed through the apartment at one time or another thats correct so our man pulls out his cell phone and sneaks over to the counter and in the midst of a wild party he turns it on and hides it next to a book the opening scene is pretty wild weve studied it carefully and there are six girls and nine boys all dancing and in various stages of undress ring a bell kyle some of it yes we know all the names you gonna show it to me or just talk about it dont be so anxious to see it with that wright punched another key its pm when the video begins he said then hit another key the screen suddenly exploded into a frenzy of loud music widespread panic playing aunt avis from bombs and butterflies and gyrating bodies somewhere in the back of his brain kyle had hoped for a dim grainy fuzzy clip of a bunch of beta idiots drinking in the dark instead he gawked at a remarkably clear video shot from a tiny phone camera the angle chosen by the unknown owner of the phone provided a view of almost the entire den at east chase apartment b all fifteen hellraisers appeared to be very drunk all six girls were indeed topless as were most of the guys the dance was a group grope with no two partners moving together for more than a few seconds everyone held a drink in one hand half had a cigarette or a joint in the other all twelve bouncing breasts were fair game for the guys in fact all exposed flesh male or female was available to everyone touching and clutching were encouraged bodies came together hunching and lurching then parted and moved to the next one some of the guests were loud and rowdy while others appeared to be fading under the flood of alcohol and chemicals most appeared to be singing along with the band several locked lips in long kisses while their free hands searched for even more intimate places i believe thats you with the sunglasses wright said smugly thank you sunglasses yellow pirates cap offwhite gym shorts drooping low a lean body with pale winter skin in need of sunshine a plastic cup in one hand a cigarette in the other mouth open to sing along a drunken fool a twentyyearold lunatic on the verge of another blackout now five years later there was no nostalgia no longing for those rowdy and carefree college days he didnt miss the hellraising the hangovers the latemorning wakeups in strange beds but at the same time there was no remorse kyle felt a little embarrassed that hed been caught on tape but it was a long time ago his college days had been pretty typical hadnt they hed partied no more and certainly no less than virtually everyone he knew the music stopped for a moment between songs and more shots were prepared and passed around one of the girls fell into a chair and appeared to be done for the night then another song began this goes for about eight more minutes wright said glancing at his notes kyle had no doubt that wright and his gang had analyzed and memorized every second every frame as you will note elaine keenan is not present she says she was next door drinking with some friends so shes changed her story again wright ignored this and said if you dont mind ill fastforward a little to the point where the police show up remember the cops kyle yes the video scrambled forward for a minute or so until wright pressed a key at the party comes to an abrupt halt listen in midsong and with most of the fifteen still in view dancing and drinking and yelling someone off camera clearly yelled cops cops kyle watched himself as he grabbed a girl and disappeared from view the music stopped the lights were out the screen was almost completely dark wright continued according to our records the police were called to your apartment three times that spring this was the third time a young man by the name of alan strock one of your roommates answered the door and chatted up the officers he swore that there was no underage drinking everything was fine hed be happy to turn off the music and keep things quiet the cops gave him a break and left with a warning they assumed everybody else was hiding in the bedrooms most of them fled through the back door kyle said whatever the cell phone video was on voice activation so it clicked off after sixty seconds of near silence it was at least twenty feet from the front door its owner ran off in the panic forgot about it and in the melee someone knocked things around on the counter the cell phone got bumped so the picture got adjusted we cant see as much as we could before about twenty minutes pass and all is quiet at there are voices and the lights come on kyle moved closer to the screen about onethird of the view was blocked by something yellow probably a phone book the yellow pages wright said the music started again but at a much lower volume the four roommates kyle alan strock baxter tate and joey bernardo were walking around the den in shorts and tshirts and holding drinks again elaine keenan walked through the den talking nonstop then sat on the edge of the sofa smoking what appeared to be a joint only half of the sofa was visible a television unseen was turned on baxter tate walked over to elaine said something then put his drink down and yanked off his tshirt he and elaine fell into a pile on the sofa obviously making out while the other three watched television and milled about they were talking but the music and tv drowned out their words alan strock walked in front of the camera pulling off his tshirt and saying something to baxter whose view was blocked there were no sounds from elaine less than half of the sofa was visible now but a tangle of bare legs could be seen then the lights were turned off and for a second the room was dark slowly the glare from the television focused and bounced off the walls to provide some illumination joey bernardo came into view also pulling off his shirt he stopped and stared at the sofa where some manner of frenzied activity was under way listen wright hissed joey said something that kyle could not understand did you get that wright asked no wright stopped the video and said our experts have studied the audio joey bernardo says to baxter tate is she awake tate is obviously having sex with elaine whos passed out drunk and bernardo stops by takes it all in and wonders if the girl is actually conscious you want to hear it again yes wright reset the video then replayed it kyle leaned down and with his nose six inches from the screen he watched hard listened even harder and heard the word awake the detective shook his head gravely the action continued with the music and the television as a backdrop and though the den of their apartment was dark figures could be seen in the shadows baxter tate finally got off the sofa stood appeared to be completely nude and walked away another figure joey bernardo quickly took baxters place some of the sounds could barely be heard a steady clicking arose from the scene we think thats the sofa wright said dont suppose you could help on that one no and before long there was a highpitched heaving sound and the clicking stopped joey moved from the sofa and disappeared thats pretty much the end of the movie wright said the video goes on for another twelve minutes but nothing happens if the girl elaine ever moved or got off the sofa then its not on the video were almost certain that baxter tate and joey bernardo had sex with her theres no evidence that either you or alan strock did i did not i can assure you of that any idea where you were during the rapes kyle wright asked the question then pressed a key and the screen went blank im sure you have a theory okay wright was again armed with his pen and legal pad elaine says she woke up several hours later around three in the morning naked still on the sofa and suddenly had a vague recollection of being raped she panicked wasnt sure where she was admits she was still very drunk eventually finds her clothes gets dressed sees you fast asleep in a recliner facing the television when she sees you she realizes where she is and remembers more of what happened to her theres no sign of strock tate or bernardo she speaks to you shakes your shoulder but you do not respond so she hurries from the apartment goes next door and eventually falls asleep and doesnt mention rape for four days right detective or has she changed her story again four days is correct thank you not a word to anyone for four days not to her roommates her friends parents no one then suddenly she decided she was raped the police were very suspicious of her story right they finally showed up at our apartment and at the beta house and they asked questions and got very few answers why because there was no rape everything was consensual believe me detective that girl would consent to anything how could she consent if she was unconscious kyle if she was unconscious how could she remember being raped there was no medical exam no rape kit no evidence whatsoever just the blackedout memory of a very confused young woman the cops dropped the case five years ago and it should be dropped now but its not its here the grand jury believed the video proves there was a rape thats bullshit and you know it this isnt about rape this is about money baxter tates family is filthy rich elaine has found herself a greedy lawyer the indictment is nothing but a shakedown so youre willing to risk the spectacle of a trial and a conviction you want the jury to see that video you and your three roomies drunk out of your minds while a young woman is taken advantage of i didnt touch her no but you were there very close by less than ten feet away come on i dont remember it how convenient kyle slowly got to his feet and walked to the bathroom he filled another plastic cup with tap water drained it refilled it and drank it then he sat on the edge of the bed and buried his head in his hands no he did not want the jury to see the video he had just seen it for the first time and prayed it would be the last he had a visual of himself and his three pals sitting in a crowded courtroom lights dimmed judge frowning jurors gaping elaine crying his parents stoic in the front row as the video is played to a rapt audience the scene made him sick he felt innocent but he wasnt convinced the jurors would agree wright ejected the disc and placed it carefully back into a plastic case kyle stared at the industrialgrade carpet for a long time there were sounds in the hallway muffled voices feet shuffling maybe the fibbies were getting restless he really didnt care his ears were ringing and he wasnt sure why each fleeting thought was chased away by the next and he found it impossible to concentrate to think rationally to focus on what should and should not be said decisions made at this ugly moment could reverberate forever for a moment he settled on the three duke lacrosse players who were falsely accused of raping a stripper they were eventually cleared of everything but only after an excruciating trip to hell and back and there was no video no link whatsoever to the victim is she awake joey says to baxter how many times would that question echo around the courtroom frame by frame word by word the jurors would have the video memorized by the time they retired to consider the verdicts wright sat patiently at the table hairy hands folded again and motionless on his legal pad time meant nothing he could wait forever are we at midfield kyle asked breaking the silence past midfield around the forty and driving id like to see the indictment sure kyle stood and looked down at the folding table the detective began a series of movements that were immediately confusing first he pulled his wallet out of his rear left pocket removed his drivers license and placed it on the table he produced his pittsburgh pd badge and laid it on the table from a box on the floor he pulled other cards and other badges and began arranging them in line on the table he reached for a file handed it to kyle and said happy reading the file was labeled information kyle opened it and removed a stack of papers stapled together the top one looked official a bold title read commonwealth of pennsylvania allegheny county court of common pleas a smaller heading read commonwealth versus baxter f tate joseph n bernardo kyle l mcavoy and alan b strock there was a docket number file number and other official markings wright produced a pair of kitchen scissors and methodically cut his drivers license into two perfect squares the first paragraph read this prosecution is in the name of and by the authority of the commonwealth of pennsylvania against the abovenamed defendants wright was cutting some of the other plastic cards all of which appeared to be either drivers licenses or credit cards who within the jurisdiction of this court wright ripped his bronze badge from its leather wallet and bounced it on the table what are you doing kyle finally asked destroying the evidence what evidence read page two kyle who was at the bottom of page one flipped to page two it was blank not a word letter period anything he flipped to page three then four then five all blank wright was busy removing other badges kyle held the bogus indictment and gawked at the detective have a seat kyle wright said with a smile as he waved at the empty folding chair in an effort to say something kyle managed only a dying whimper then he sat down there is no indictment kyle wright proceeded as if it all made sense now no grand jury no cops no arrest no trial nothing but a video no cops oh no this stuff is all fake he waved his hands over the pile of destroyed identification im not a cop those boys across the hall are not fbi agents kyle rolled his head back like a wounded boxer then rubbed his eyes the indictment fell to the floor who are you he managed to grunt thats a very good question kyle one that will take a long time to answer in disbelief kyle picked up one of the badges ginyards fbi he rubbed it and said but i checked this guy out online he really works for the fbi yes these are real names we just borrowed them for the night so youre impersonating an officer certainly but its just a small offense not worth your trouble but why to get your attention kyle to convince you to come here and have this little meeting with me otherwise you might have run away plus we wanted to impress you with our resources we yes my firm you see kyle i work for a contractor a private one and weve been hired to do a job we need you and this is how we recruit people kyle blew out a chestful of nervous laughter his cheeks were getting warm the blood was beginning to circulate there was a rising thrill at the relief of not being prosecuted of having been rescued from the firing squad but the anger was beginning to boil you recruit by blackmail he asked if necessary we have the video we know where the girl is she does indeed have a lawyer does she know about the video no but if she saw it your life could get very complicated im not sure i follow you come on kyle rape has a twelveyear statute of limitations in pennsylvania you have seven years to go if elaine and her lawyer knew about the video they would threaten criminal prosecution to force a civil settlement it would be as you say nothing but a shakedown but it would work your life will go much smoother if you play along with us and we keep the video buried so youre recruiting me yes to do what to be a lawyer chapter with a crushing weight suddenly lifted from his shoulders and with his breathing somewhat normal again kyle glanced at his watch it was after midnight he looked at wright or whatever the hell his name really was and he wanted to smile and even hug the man because he wasnt a cop from pittsburgh and he didnt deliver an indictment there would be no arrest no prosecution no humiliation and for this kyle was euphoric but at the same time he wanted to bolt across the table and punch wrights face with as much violence as he could generate then knock him to the floor and kick him until he didnt move he vetoed both ideas wright was fit and probably trained and could take care of himself and he certainly wasnt the type anyone would want to hug kyle leaned back in his chair placed his right ankle on his left knee and relaxed for the first time in hours so whats your real name he asked wright was preparing a new legal pad for a fresh round of note taking he entered the date in the top left corner were not going to waste time with frivolous questions kyle oh why not you cant even tell me your name lets stick with bennie wright for now it doesnt really matter because youll never know the real name i like this real cloakanddagger shit you guys are good really had me going there for about four hours had a knot in my colon as big as a pumpkin already thinking about finding a nice bridge to wing it from i hate your guts and dont ever forget it when you shut up we can get down to business can i walk out right now sure and no one will grab me no more fake badges and phony fbi agents none go youre a free man oh thank you a minute passed without a word wrights fierce little eyes never left kyles face while kyle hard as he tried could not return the stare his foot twitched and his eyes darted and he drummed his fingers on the table his mind raced through a hundred scenarios but he never once thought of leaving the room lets talk about your future kyle wright finally said sure now that i wont be arrested the future has certainly improved this job youre planning to take piedmont legal aid why do you want to waste a couple of years saving the world dont really see it that way there are a lot of migrant workers in virginia many of whom are illegal and theyre subjected to all sorts of abuse they live in cardboard boxes eat rice twice a day work for two bucks an hour often dont get paid for backbreaking work and so on i figure they could use some help but why its publicinterest law okay obviously you dont get it its lawyers giving their time to help others they still teach this in law school some of us believe in it wright was not impressed lets talk about scully pershing what about them im sure youve done your research they offered you a job correct beginning when september of this year i take the bar in july and would start working in september as an associate no as a fullfledged partner or how about a secretary or a copy clerk come on bennie you know the routine dont get angry kyle we have a long way to go i see and we should cooperate now and be pals because were striving for a common purpose just you and me right bennie a couple of old friends where the hell is this going its going to scully pershing what if i dont want to work there you have little choice kyle leaned on his elbows and rubbed his eyes the folding table was narrow their faces were two feet apart have you said no to scully pershing wright asked im assuming you already know the answer to that question im assuming youve been listening to my phone conversations for some time not all of them youre a thug thugs break legs kyle were much too smart for that no i have not said no to scully pershing ive informed them that im giving serious thought to publicinterest law for a couple of years and weve even discussed a deferment theyve given me extra time but i need to make a decision so they still want you yes at a starting salary of something like that you know the numbers one of the largest and most prestigious law firms in the world the largest at least thats what they tell everybody big firm important clients wealthy partners with contacts everywhere come on kyle its an offer most law students would kill for why not take it kyle jumped to his feet and paced to the door and back he glared down at wright and said let me make sure i follow you you want me to take the job at scully pershing for reasons that im sure will be against my best interests and if i say no then youll blackmail me with the video and the rape allegations right is this where were headed bennie more or less blackmail is such an ugly word wouldnt want to offend anyone bennie im sure youre very sensitive but its blackmail or extortion or whatever youd like to call it its a crime bennie and youre a thug shut up and stop calling me a thug i could go to the cops tomorrow and bust your ass impersonating an officer attempted blackmail it wont happen i can make it happen wright slowly stood and for one horrible second made a motion as if he were about to throw a nasty punch then he casually pointed a finger at kyle and in a firm and steady voice said youre a kid with a snoot full of law you want to run to the cops go ahead work up your little textbook theories about whos right and whos wrong and you know what will happen kyle ill tell you what will happen youll never see me again the boys across the hall the fbi agents are already gone no trace whatsoever vanished forever before long ill have a visit with the attorney for elaine keenan show her the video look once again at the net worth of baxter tate provide her with the current addresses and phone numbers and emails for you alan strock and joey bernardo prod her to have a chat with the prosecutor in pittsburgh and before you know it things are out of your control maybe charges will be filed maybe not but trust me i will destroy you wheres elaine you got her in a bunker somewhere it doesnt matter we have reason to believe she feels strongly that she was raped in your apartment please shes a ticking bomb kyle and the video would set her off you have seven more years to worry about it with that wright returned to his chair and made some notes kyle sat on the edge of the bed facing the mirror it could get really ugly wright continued think about it kyle yale laws brightest student arrested on rape charges the womens groups screaming for all eight testicles the video leaked onto the internet a brutal trial chance of conviction prison a career ruined shut up no so if you think im worried about your twobit threats please rest assured that i am not lets talk business lets take the video and lock it away so that no one will ever see it how does that sound kyle it sounded pretty damned good at the moment kyle scratched his stubble as he said what do you want i want you to take the job at scully pershing why now were getting somewhere kyle now we can talk business i thought youd never ask why why why why because i need information great that really explains things thank you so much bear with me for a few minutes kyle you need a little background here there are two gigantic corporations who compete with each other both are ruthless competitors both are worth billions and they really despise each other there have been lawsuits nasty ones big public spectacles with no clear winner or loser so over the years they have tried to avoid the courtroom until now now theyre about to square off in the mother of all lawsuits it will be filed in a few weeks in federal court in new york city at stake is something in the neighborhood of billion and the loser might not survive nasty vicious litigation a bonanza for the attorneys each uses a huge wall street law firm and guess what the two law firms hate each other i cant wait to get in the middle of that thats where youre headed one firm is scully pershing the other is agee poe epps otherwise known as ape yes i interviewed there did they offer a job i thought you knew everything only what i need to know i didnt like the firm attaboy now you can really dislike them kyle walked into the bathroom ran cold water in the sink splashed it on his face and down his neck and for a long time stared at himself in the mirror dont get tired he told himself ignore the fatigue and the fear try to anticipate whats coming try to throw him a curve mess with his timing knock him off course he sat down across the table from wright whered you find the video kyle asked kyle kyle such a waste of time if the video is used in court then the owner of the cell phone camera will have to testify you cant protect his identity at that point does he know this did you explain it to him hes one of my fraternity brothers and ill bet hell refuse to testify at trial a trial youre willing to go to trial a trial holds the possibility of a conviction which means prison and prison for cute little white boys convicted of rape is not pretty ill bet she wont press charges you have nothing to bet with she needs money if she can squeeze it out of mr tate and a few bucks from you and the other two shell do it trust me i wouldnt trust you with my dirty laundry enough of the insults well go to her lawyer and show her exactly how to do it or maybe we

the whole world kyle see how it plays then maybe well edit it some more maybe include some of the rape post it again when elaine sees it your face is in the newspaper kyles mouth actually dropped open and his shoulders slumped he could think of no quick response but the one thought that hit him hard was that of being shot mr wright here was a ruthless little cutthroat who worked for some group with unlimited resources and great determination they would ruin him they might even kill him as if reading his mind wright leaned in a little closer and said kyle were not boy scouts and im tired of this bantering back and forth im not here to negotiate im here to give orders either you follow my orders or i call the office and tell my pals to destroy you i despise you so be it im just doing my job what a miserable job can we talk about your new one i didnt go to law school to become a spy lets not call it spying kyle then give it a name bennie transferring information oh bullshit its nothing but spying i really dont care what you call it what kind of information once the lawsuit gets cranked up there will be a million documents maybe ten million who knows lots of documents and lots of secrets we expect each of the two law firms to commit fifty lawyers to the case maybe as many as ten partners the rest associates youll be in the litigation section of scully pershing so youll have access to a lot of material security at these firms is extremely tight we know that our security experts are better than theirs we wrote the book kyle im sure you did may i ask what these two big companies are fighting over secrets technology great thanks do these companies have names fortune ill give you more information as we progress so youre going to be part of my life for a while im your official handler you and i will spend a lot of time together then i quit go ahead and shoot me im not spying and im not stealing the moment i walk out of scully pershing with a document or a disc im

no were much too smart kyle weve done this before its our business your firm specializes in stealing documents lets call it corporate espionage we do it all the time and were very good at it then go blackmail someone else no its all you kyle think about it you take the job youve always wanted at an obscene salary living the fast life in the big city they try to work you to death for a few years but they reward you by the time youre thirty youre a senior associate making four hundred grand a year nice apartment in soho a share of a weekend house in the hamptons a porsche a circle of friends who are all smart and rich and moving up as fast as you are then one day the lawsuit is settled we disappear the statute runs out in pittsburgh the video is finally forgotten and at the age of thirtytwo or thirtythree youre asked to join scully pershing as a full equity partner a million or two per year the pinnacle of success a great career ahead of you life is great and no one there will ever know about the transferring of information a headache that had been smoldering for the past hour finally matured and hit hard in the middle of his forehead kyle stretched out on the bed and massaged his temples he closed his eyes but in the blackness managed to keep talking look bennie i know you dont care about morals or ethics and such things but i do how exactly am i supposed to live with myself if i betray the confidences of my firm and its clients trust is the most important thing a lawyer has i learned that from my father when i was a teenager all we care about is getting the information we dont spend too much time pondering morality thats about what i figured i need a commitment kyle i need your word do you have any tylenol no do we have an agreement kyle do you have anything for a headache no do you have a gun in my jacket let me have it a minute passed without a sound wrights eyes never left kyle who was motionless except for his fingers pressing gently on his forehead then kyle slowly sat up and asked in a whisper how much longer are you planning to stay here oh i have lots of questions i was afraid of that i cant keep going my head is splitting whatever kyle its up to you but i need an answer do we have an agreement a deal an understanding do i really have a choice i dont see one neither do i so if i have no choice then i have no choice excellent a wise decision kyle oh thank you so much wright stood and stretched as if a long day at the office were finally over he reshuffled some papers fiddled with the video camera closed the laptop would you like to rest kyle yes we have several rooms youre welcome to take a nap if youd like or we can continue tomorrow its already tomorrow wright was at the door he opened it and kyle followed him out of the room across the hall and into room what had once been an fbi command center had now been converted back to a regular anight motel room ginyard and plant and the other fake agents were long gone and they had taken everything files computers enlarged photos tripods briefcases boxes folding tables the bed was back in the center of the room perfectly made up shall i wake you in a few hours wright asked pleasantly no just leave me alone ill be across the hall when kyle was alone he pulled back the bedspread turned off the lights and soon fell asleep chapter contrary to his best intentions kyle awoke several hours later he desperately wanted to sleep forever to simply drift away and be forgotten he awoke in a warm dark room on a hard bed and for a second wasnt sure where he was or how he had managed to get there his head was still hurting and his mouth was dry soon though the nightmare returned and he had the urgent desire to get away to get outside where he could look back at the motel and convince himself that the meeting with detective wright had not really happened he needed fresh air and maybe someone to talk to he eased from the room and tiptoed down the hall down the stairs in the lobby some salesmen were gulping coffee and talking rapidly anxious for the day to start the sun was up the snow had stopped outside the air was cold and sharp and he inhaled as if hed been suffocating he made it to his jeep started the engine turned on the heater and waited for the defroster to melt the snow on the windshield the shock was wearing off but the reality was even worse he checked his cell phone messages his girlfriend had called six times his roommate three they were worried he had class at am and a pile of work at the law journal and nothing girlfriend roommate law school or work held the slightest interest at the moment he left the holiday inn and drove east on highway for a few miles until new haven was behind him he ran up behind a snowplow and was content to putter along at thirty miles an hour other cars lined up behind him and for the first time he wondered if someone might be following he began glancing at the rearview mirror at the small town of guilford he stopped at a convenience store and finally found some tylenol he washed it down with a soft drink and was about to drive back to new haven when he noticed a diner across the street he had not eaten since lunch the day before and was suddenly famished he could almost smell the bacon grease the diner was packed with the local breakfast crowd kyle found a seat at the counter and ordered scrambled eggs bacon hash browns toast coffee and orange juice he ate in silence as the laughter and town gossip roared around him the headache was fading fast and he began plotting the rest of his day his girlfriend might be a problem no contact in twelve hours a night spent away from his apartment highly unusual behavior for someone as disciplined as kyle he certainly couldnt tell her the truth could he no the truth was a thing of the past the present and the future would be a life of lies coverups thieveiy espionage and more lies olivia was a firstyear law student at yale a californian ucla graduate extremely bright and ambitious and not looking for a serious commitment they had been dating for four months and the relationship was far more casual than romantic still he did not look forward to some stuttering tale of a night that simply vanished a body closed in from behind a hand appeared with a white business card kyle glanced to his right and came facetoface with the man he had once known as special agent ginyard now wearing a camel hair sport coat and jeans mr wright would like to see you at pm after class same room he said then disappeared before kyle could speak he picked up the card it was blank except for the handwritten message pm today room holiday inn he stared at it for a few minutes as he quickly lost interest in the remaining food in front of him is this my future he asked himself someone always watching following waiting in the shadows stalking listening a crowd was waiting by the door for seating the waitress slipped his bill under his coffee cup and gave him a quick smile that said times up he paid at the cash register and outside refused to scan the other vehicles for signs of stalkers he called olivia who was sleeping are you all right she asked yes im fine i dont want to know anything else just tell me youre not hurt im not hurt im fine and im sorry dont apologize im apologizing okay i should have called i dont want to know yes you do do you accept my apology i dont know thats better i expect some anger here dont get me started how about lunch no why not im busy you cant skip lunch where are you guilford and where might that be just down the road from new haven theres a great little place for breakfast ill bring you here sometime cant wait meet me at the grill at noon please ill think about it he drove back to new haven refusing every half mile to glance at his mirror he slipped quietly into his apartment and took a shower mitch his roommate could sleep through an earthquake and when he finally staggered out of his bedroom kyle was sipping coffee at the kitchen counter and reading a newspaper online mitch asked a few vague questions about last night but kyle deflected them nicely and gave the impression that he had bumped into a different girl and things went extremely well mitch went back to bed complete fidelity had been agreed to months earlier and once olivia was convinced kyle had not cheated her attitude thawed a little the story hed been working on for several hours went like this hed been struggling with his decision to pursue publicinterest law instead of taking a big job with a big firm he had no plans to make publicinterest law a career so why go there to begin with he would eventually work in new york so why delay the inevitable and so on and last night after his basketball game he decided he had to make a final decision he turned off his phone and took a long drive east for some unknown reason on highway past new london and into rhode island he lost track of time after midnight the snow picked up and he found a cheap motel where he slept for a few hours he had changed his mind he was going to new york to scully pershing he spilled this over lunch over a sandwich at the grill olivia listened with skepticism but did not interrupt she seemed to believe the story about last night but she was not buying the sudden change in career plans you must be kidding she blurted when he hit the punch line its not easy he said already on the defensive he knew this would not be pleasant you mr pro bono mr public interest law i know i know i feel like a turncoat you are a turncoat youre selling out just like every other thirdyear law student lower your voice please kyle said as he glanced around lets not have a scene she lowered her voice but not her eyebrows youve said it yourself a hundred times kyle we all get to law school with big ideas of doing good helping others fighting injustice but along the way we sell out seduced by big money we turn into corporate whores those are your words kyle they do sound familiar i cant believe this they took a couple of bites but the food was not important we have thirty years to make money she said why cant we spend a few years helping others kyle was on the ropes and bleeding i know i know he mumbled lamely but timing is important im not sure scully pershing will defer another lie but what the hell once you start why quit they were multiplying oh please you can get a job with any firm in the country now or five years from now im not so sure about that the job market is tightening up some of the big firms are threatening layoffs she shoved her food away crossed her arms and slowly shook her head i dont believe this she said and at that moment kyle couldnt believe it either but it was important now and forever more to give the impression that hed carefully weighed the issues and had arrived at this decision in other words kyle had to sell it olivia was the first test his friends would be next then his favorite professors after hed practiced the routine a few times and the lying was finely tuned he would somehow muster the courage to visit his father and deliver the news that would lead to an ugly fight john mcavoy detested the idea of his son working for a corporate firm on wall street kyles selling job though did little to convince olivia they traded barbs for a few minutes then forgot about lunch and went their separate ways there was no goodbye peck on the cheek no hug no promise to call each other later he spent an hour in his office at the law journal then reluctantly left and drove back to the motel the room had changed little the video camera and laptop were gone no sign of electronics anywhere though kyle was certain every word would be recorded in some fashion the folding table was still ground zero but it had been moved closer to the windows same two folding chairs the setting was as stark as a police interrogation room somewhere deep in the basement the headache was back kyle flipped the card ginyard left behind onto the table and began with a pleasant please tell this son of a bitch to stop following me were just a little curious thats all kyle im not going to be followed bennie do you understand bennie gave a smartass smile the deals off bennie im not going to live my life with a bunch of goons watching everything i do forget the surveillance forget the wiretaps and hidden mikes and email snooping bennie are you listening im not walking down the streets of new york wondering whos behind me im not chatting on the phone while thinking some bozo might be listening youve just wrecked my life bennie the least you can do is allow me some degree of privacy we have no plans thats a lie and you know it heres the new deal bennie we agree right now that you and your goons stay out of my life you dont eavesdrop you dont follow you dont hide in the shadows or stalk or play your little catandmouse games ill do what you want me to do whatever the hell that is but you have got to leave me alone otherwise oh otherwise otherwise ill take my chances with elaine and her bogus rape charge look bennie if my life is going to be ruined then what the hell i get to pick my poison i have elaine on the one hand and i have your goons on the other bennie exhaled slowly cleared his throat and said yes kyle but it is important for us to keep up with you that is the nature of our work that is what we do its blackmail pure and simple kyle kyle none of that now that doesnt move the ball please can we forget about the ball thats so tiring now we cant just turn you loose in new york heres my bottom line i will not be stalked or watched or followed do you understand this bennie this could pose a problem its already a problem what do you want youll know where i live and where i work theyre basically the same place for the next five years anyway ill be at the office eighteen hours a day if not more why exactly will it be necessary to keep me under surveillance there are procedures we follow then change them its not negotiable kyle jumped to his feet and headed for the door when do we meet again where are you going bennie asked as he stood none of your business and dont follow me do not follow me kyle had his hand on the doorknob okay okay look kyle we can be flexible here i see your point when and where now no i have things to do without being watched but we have so much to talk about kyle when how about six tonight ill be here at eight and for only one hour and im not coming back tomorrow chapter at the new haven train station kyle boarded the for grand central he wore the better of his two suits a plain white shirt with an utterly boring tie and black wing tips and he carried a handsome leather attaché case his father had given him last christmas he also carried the mornings editions of the new york times and the wall street journal and he was indistinguishable from the other sleepyeyed executives hustling off to the office as the frozen countryside blurred by he ignored the papers and let his mind wander he asked himself if he would one day live in the suburbs and be forced to ride a train three hours a day so his children could attend fine schools and ride their bikes down leafy streets at the age of twentyfive that was not very appealing but now most of his thoughts about the future were complicated and dreary hed be lucky if he didnt get himself indicted andor disbarred life in the big firms was brutal enough and now he would have the impossible chore of grinding through the first years while stealing confidential information and praying daily that he didnt get caught maybe commuting wasnt such a bad deal after all after three days and many hours of talking haggling bitching and threatening bennie wright had finally left town he had receded into the shadows but of course would soon materialize again kyle hated his voice his face his mannerisms his calm hairy hands his slick head his confident pressing manner he hated everything about bennie wright and his company or firm or whatever it was and many times during the past week he had changed his mind in the middle of the night and told them all to go to hell then in the darkness as always he could feel the handcuffs see his mug shot in the newspapers see the looks on the faces of his parents and worst of all he could see himself afraid to glance at the jurors when the video was played to a hushed courtroom is she awake joey bernardo asks while baxter tate has elaine down on the sofa is she awake the words echo around the courtroom the countryside vanished as the train sped through suburbs and towns then it went underground at some point dipped under the east river and entered manhattan kyle strolled through grand central and hailed a cab at the corner of lex and fortyfourth not once had he looked over his shoulder scully pershing leased the top half of a building named broad a sleek glass edifice with fortyfour floors in the heart of the financial district kyle had spent ten weeks there the previous summer as an intern the typical bigfirm seduction routine of socializing lunching barhopping watching the yankees and putting in a few light hours of work it was a joke of a job and everybody involved knew it if the wining and dining worked and it almost always did the interns became associates upon graduation and their lives were basically over it was almost am and the elevator was empty the lawyers had been at their desks for hours he stopped at the thirtieth floor the firms main lobby and paused for a second to admire the massive bronze lettering that informed all visitors that they were now on the hallowed turf of scully pershing attorneysatlaw all twentyone hundred of them the largest law firm the world had ever known the first and still the only firm to boast of more than two thousand lawyers counsel to more fortune companies than any other firm in the history of american law offices in ten us cities and twenty foreign ones a hundred and thirty years of hidebound tradition magnet to the best legal talent money can buy power money prestige he already felt like a trespasser the walls were covered with abstract art the furniture was rich and contemporary some asian whiz had done the decorating magazine quality and there was a brochure on a table that went into details as if anyone who worked there had the time to stop and ponder the interior design schemes a gorgeous little receptionist in stiletto heels took his name and asked him to please wait kyle turned his back on everything and became entranced in a work of art so bizarre he had no idea what he was looking at after a few minutes of mindless gazing he heard the receptionist call mr peckham is waiting two floors up kyle took the stairs like many manhattan law firms scully pershing spent money on the elevators reception areas and conference rooms the places clients and other visitors might actually see but back in the bowels of the firm where the grunts worked efficiency ruled the halls were lined with file cabinets the secretaries and typists all women worked in tight cubicles within reach of each other the copyboys and other gofers worked on their feet new york real estate was simply too expensive to provide them a spot or a nook of any significance the senior associates and junior partners were awarded small offices on the outer walls with a view of similar buildings the rookie associates were stuffed in tight windowless spaces three or four of them wedged together in cramped cubicles nicknamed cubes these offices were tucked away and kept out of sight lousy accommodations brutal hours sadistic bosses unbearable pressure it was all part of the bluechip law firm experience and kyle had heard the horror tales before he finished his first year at yale scully pershing was no better and certainly no worse than the other megafirms that threw money at the brightest students then burned them up at the corners of each floor in the largest offices the real partners anchored things and had some say in the decor one was doug peckham a fortyoneyearold litigation partner a yale man who had supervised kyle during his internship they had become somewhat friendly kyle was shown into peckhams office a few minutes after am just as a pair of associates were leaving whatever the meeting was it had not gone well the associates looked rattled and peckham was trying to calm down they exchanged greetings and pleasantries the usual banter about good old yale kyle knew that peckham billed an hour at least ten hours a day and therefore the time that kyle was now wasting was quite valuable im not sure i want to spend a couple of years doing legal aid kyle said not too deep into the meeting dont really blame you there kyle peckham said in a quick clipped voice you have too much potential in the real world this is your future he spread his arms to take in his vast empire it was a nice office large by comparison but not a kingdom i really would like to work in litigation i see no problem there you had a great summer here we were all impressed ill make the request myself you know though that litigation is not for everyone thats what they all said the average career of a litigator is twentyfive years the work is high pressure high stress peckham may have been fortyone but he could easily pass for fifty completely gray dark circles too much bulk in the jowls and around the waist probably hadnt exercised in years my deadline has passed kyle said when a week ago no problem come on kyle editor in chief of the yale law journal well be happy to cut you some slack ill talk to woody in personnel and clear it our recruiting has gone very well youre joining the best freshman class in years the same was said about every freshman class at every major firm thanks and id love to work in the litigation practice group got it kyle consider it done and with that peckham glanced at his watch meeting over his phone was ringing there were hushed voices just outside his door as kyle shook his hand and said goodbye he decided he did not want to become another doug peckham he had no idea what he wanted to become or if he would in fact become anything other than a disbarred lawyer but selling his soul to become a partner was not in the plans associates were waiting at the door sharply dressed young men not much older than kyle smug harried nervous they stepped into the lions den and as the door closed doug was raising his voice what a life and this was an easy day in litigation the real pressure was in the courtroom on the elevator down kyle was struck by the absurdity of what he was expected to do upon leaving the offices of scully pershing and riding the elevator like hundreds of others he was expected to have hidden somewhere upon his person or within his effects top secret information that belonged not to him but to the firm and especially to its client and he would give this valuable data to bennie with the hairy hands or whatever his real name was who would then use it against the firm and its client who am i kidding he said to himself there were four others on the elevator sweat popped out above his eyebrows so this is what my life boils down to a chance of prison for rape in pennsylvania or a chance of prison in new york for stealing secrets why not a third option four years of college three years of law school seven rather successful years all the potential in the world and ill become a highly paid thief and there was no one to talk to he wanted out out of the elevator the building the city out of this predicament he closed his eyes and talked to himself but there was evidence in pennsylvania and none in new york yet he was certain he would get caught though months before any crime was committed he knew he would get caught two blocks away he found a coffee shop he sat on a bar stool in the window and for a long time looked rather forlornly at broad at the tower that would soon become his home or his prison he knew the numbers the statistics scully pershing would hire new associates worldwide in the new york office alone they would pay them a nice salary that would amount to about an hour and the firm would in turn bill their wellheeled clients several times that rate for the associates work kyle like all rookie grunts on wall street would be expected to bill a minimum of two thousand hours a year though more would be required to make an impression hundredhour workweeks would not be uncommon after two years the associates would begin dropping out and looking for more sensible work half would be gone in four years ten percent of his freshman class would survive claw their way to the top and be awarded with a partnership after seven or eight years those who didnt drop out along the way would be squeezed out by the firm if they were not deemed partnership material the work had become so awful that the trend was for firms to market themselves as quality of life firms the associates were expected to bill fewer hours have more vacation and so on more often than not though it was simply a recruiting gimmick in the workaholic culture of every big firm the greenest associates were expected to bill almost as much as the partners regardless of what the recruiters mentioned over lunch months earlier sure the money was great at least to start with double that in five years as a senior associate double it again in seven years as a junior partner well over a million bucks a year at the age of thirtyfive as a full partner with a future filled with even higher earnings numbers numbers kyle was sick of the numbers he longed for the blue ridge mountains and a nonprofits salary of without the stress and pressure and hassle of life in the city he yearned for freedom instead he had another meeting with bennie wright the cab stopped in front of the millenium hilton on church street kyle paid the driver nodded at the doorman then took the elevator four floors up to a room where his handler was waiting bennie motioned to a round table with a bowl of bright green apples in the center but kyle refused to sit or remove his jacket the offer is still good he said ill start in september with the other associates good im not surprised and youll be in litigation peckham thinks so bennie had a file on doug peckham as well as files on all of the litigation partners and many of the firms other lawyers but theres no guarantee kyle added you can make it happen well see have you thought about an apartment here in manhattan no not yet well weve done some homework looked around funny i dont recall asking for your help and weve found a couple of places that will be ideal ideal for who for you of course both places are in tribeca fairly close to the office what makes you think i would even remotely consider living where you want me to live and well cover the rent pretty pricey real estate oh i see youll find an apartment for me and pay for it so i wont need a roommate is that it bennie one less person for you to worry about helps to keep me isolated plus the rent means that were financially joined at the hip you pay me i give you secrets just a couple of shrewd businessmen right bennie apartment hunting is a bitch in this city im just trying to help thanks so much no doubt these are places that can easily be watched maybe even wired or bugged or compromised in ways i cant even imagine nice try bennie the rent is five thousand bucks a month keep it i cant be bought evidently i can be blackmailed but not bought where are you planning to live wherever i choose ill figure it out and ill do so without any involvement on your part as you wish damned right what else do you want to talk about bennie walked to the table picked up a legal pad and studied it as if he didnt know what hed already written on it have you ever seen a psychiatrist he asked no a psychologist no a counselor or therapist of any type yes details please it was nothing then lets talk about nothing what happened kyle leaned against the wall and folded both arms across his chest there was little doubt in his mind that bennie knew most of what he was about to explain he knew far too much after the incident with elaine and after the police finished their investigation i talked to a counselor in student health services she referred me to a dr thorp a specialist in drug and alcohol addiction he roughed me up got under my skin forced me to take a long hard look in the mirror and he convinced me the drinking would only get worse were you an alcoholic no dr thorp didnt think so i certainly didnt either but there was too much drinking especially of the binge variety i seldom smoked pot youre still sober i quit drinking i grew up found some different roommates and have never been tempted ive yet to miss the hangovers not even an occasional beer nope i never think about it bennie nodded as if he approved of this what about the girl he asked what about her how serious is the relationship not sure where you figure into this bennie can you help me here your life will be complicated enough without a romance a serious relationship could pose problems its best if you postpone it for a few years kyle laughed in frustration and disbelief he shook his head and tried to think of an appropriate retort but nothing came to mind sadly he agreed with his tormentor and the relationship with olivia was going nowhere fast what else bennie can i have some friends can i visit my parents occasionally you wont have the time kyle suddenly headed for the door yanked it open then slammed it as he left chapter there is a student lounge on the first floor of the yale law school and on the walls outside its door are posters and notices advertising internships and even careers in publicinterest law the students are encouraged to consider spending a few years helping battered women neglected children death row inmates immigrants runaway teens indigent defendants the homeless asylum seekers haitian boat refugees americans sitting in foreign jails and foreigners sitting in american jails first amendment projects innocence projects conservation groups environmental activists and on and on a belief in public service runs deep at yale law admission is often determined by the applicants record of volunteerism and his or her written thoughts about using a law degree to benefit the world firstyear students are inundated with the virtues of publicinterest law and are expected to get involved as soon as possible and most do around percent of all freshmen claim that they are attracted to the law by a desire to help others at some point though usually about halfway through the second year things begin to change the big firms arrive on campus to interview and begin their selection process they offer summer internships with nice salaries and the prospect of ten weeks of fun and games in new york washington or san francisco most important they hold the keys to the lucrative careers a divide occurs at yale law as it does at all prestigious schools many of those so enamored with righteous dreams of aiding the downtrodden suddenly switch gears and begin dreaming of making it to the major leagues of american law while many are turned off by this seduction and cling to their idyllic notions of public service the divide is clear but civilized when an editor of the yale law journal takes a lowpaying job with legal services he is a hero to those on his side and to most of the faculty and when he suddenly caves in to wall street he is viewed less favorably by the same people kyles life became miserable his friends on the publicinterest side were in disbelief those on the corporate side were too busy to care his relationship with olivia was reduced to sex once a week and only because they needed it she said he had changed he was moodier gloomier preoccupied with something and whatever it was he couldnt tell her if you only knew he thought she had accepted a summer internship with an antideathpenalty group in texas thus she was full of zeal and big plans to change things down there they saw less and less of each other but somehow managed to bicker more one of kyles favorite professors was an old radical whod spent most of the s marching for or against something and he was still the first one to organize a petition against whatever he perceived to be the latest injustice on campus when he heard the news that kyle had flipped he called and demanded lunch over enchiladas at a taco bar just off campus they argued for an hour kyle pretended to resent the intrusion but in his heart he knew he was wrong the professor railed and hammered and got nowhere he left kyle with a disheartening im very disappointed in you thanks kyle retorted then cursed himself as he walked to campus then he cursed bennie wright and elaine keenan and scully pershing and everything else in his life at that moment he was mumbling and cursing a lot these days after a few rounds of ugly encounters with his friends kyle finally found the courage to go home the mcavoys drifted into eastern pennsylvania in the late eighteenth century along with thousands of other scottish settlers they farmed for a few generations then moved on down to virginia the carolinas and even farther south some stayed behind including kyles grandfather a presbyterian minister who died before kyle was born reverend mcavoy led several churches on the outskirts of philadelphia before being transferred to york in his only son john finished high school there and returned home after college vietnam and law school in john mcavoy quit his job as a lowly paid pencil pusher in a small real estate law firm in york he marched across market street rented a tworoom suite in a converted row house hung out his shingle and declared himself ready to sue real estate law was too boring john wanted conflict courtrooms drama verdicts life in york was uneventful enough he an exmarine was looking for a fight he worked very hard and treated everyone fairly clients were free to call him at home and he would meet them on sunday afternoons if necessary he made house calls hospital calls jail calls he called himself a street lawyer an advocate for clients who worked in factories who got injured or discriminated against or who ran afoul of the law his clients were not banks or insurance companies or real estate agencies or corporations his clients were not billed by the hour often they were not billed at all fees were sometimes delivered in the form of firewood eggs and poultry steaks and free labor around the house the office grew sprawled upstairs and down and john eventually bought the row house younger lawyers came and went none staying more than three years mr mcavoy was demanding of his associates he was kinder to his secretaries one a young divorcee named patty married the boss after a twomonth courtship and was soon pregnant the law offices of john l mcavoy had no specialty other than representing lowpaying clients anyone could walk in with an appointment or without and see john as soon as he was available he handled wills and estates divorces injuries petty criminal cases and a hundred other matters that found their way to his office on market street the traffic was constant the doors opened early and closed late and the reception area was seldom empty through sheer volume and an innate presbyterian frugality the office covered its expenses and provided the mcavoy family with an income that was in the uppermiddle class for york had he been greedier or more selective or even a bit firmer with his billing john could have doubled his income and joined the country club but he hated golf and didnt like the wealthier folks in town more important he viewed the practice of law as a calling a mission to help the less fortunate patty had twin girls in in kyle was born and before he started kindergarten he was hanging around his fathers office after his parents divorced he preferred the stability of the law office to the strains of joint custody and each day after school he parked himself in a small room upstairs and finished his homework at the age of ten he was running the copier making coffee and tidying up the small library he was paid an hour in cash by the age of fifteen he had mastered legal research and could hammer out memos on basic subjects during high school when he wasnt playing basketball he was at the office or in court with his father kyle loved the law office he chatted up the clients as they waited to see mr mcavoy he flirted with the secretaries and pestered the associates he cracked jokes when things were tense especially when mr mcavoy was angry with a subordinate and he pulled pranks on visiting lawyers every lawyer and every judge in york knew kyle and it was not unusual for him to slip into an empty courtroom present a motion to a judge argue its merits if necessary then leave with a signed order the court clerks treated him as if he were one of the lawyers before college he was always around the office at five on tuesday afternoons when mr randolph weeks stopped by with a delivery of food fruits and vegetables from his garden in the spring and summer and pork poultry or wild game in the fall and winter every tuesday at pm for at least the past ten years mr weeks came to pay a portion of his fee no one knew exactly how much was owed or how much had been paid but mr weeks certainly felt as though he was still in debt to mr mcavoy he had explained to kyle many years earlier that his father a great lawyer had pulled a miracle and kept mr weekss oldest son out of prison and kyle though only a teenager had been the unofficial lawyer for miss brily a crazy old woman whod been run out of every law office in york she trudged the streets of the town with a wooden file cabinet on wheels boxes of papers which she claimed proved clearly that her father who had died at the age of ninetysix and she still suspected foul play was the rightful heir to a huge tract of rich coal deposits in eastern pennsylvania kyle had read most of her documents and had quickly concluded that she was even nuttier than most lawyers suspected but he engaged her and listened to her conspiracies by then he was earning an hour and worth every penny of it his father often parked him in the reception area to screen those new clients who at first glance showed the potential to waste a lot of his time except for the usual adolescent dreams of playing professional sports kyle always knew he would be a lawyer he wasnt sure what kind of lawyer or where he would practice but by the time he left york for duquesne he doubted if he would return john mcavoy doubted it too though like any father he often thought of the pride he would have if the firm name became mcavoy mcavoy he demanded hard work and excellent grades but even he was a little surprised at kyles academic success in college and at yale law school when kyle began his interviews with the big corporate law firms john had plenty to say on the matter kyle had called and told his father he would arrive in york late friday afternoon they had agreed on dinner as usual the office was busy at when he arrived most law firms closed early on friday and most lawyers were either in bars or at the country club john mcavoy worked late because many of his clients got paid at the end of the week and a few stopped by to write small checks or see about their cases kyle had not been home in six weeks since christmas and the office looked even shabbier the carpet needed replacing the bookshelves sagged even more his father couldnt stop smoking therefore smoking was permitted and a thick haze floated near the ceiling late in the day sybil the ranking secretary abruptly hung up the phone when kyle walked through the door she jumped to her feet squealed grabbed him and thrust her gigantic breasts at him they pecked on the cheeks and enjoyed the physical greeting his father had handled at least two divorces for sybil and the current husband would soon be on the street kyle had heard the details during the christmas break the firm currently had three secretaries and two associates and he went from room to room downstairs first then upstairs where the young lawyers were kept speaking to the employees as they packed their briefcases and purses and tidied up their desks the boss might enjoy staying late on fridays but the rest of the firm was tired kyle drank a diet soda in the coffee room and listened to the voices and sounds of the office as it wound down the contrasts were startling here in york the firm was filled with coworkers who were friends who could be trusted the pace was busy at times but never frantic the boss was a good guy someone you would want as your lawyer the clients had faces and names the lawyers across the street were old pals it was a different world from the hard streets of new york city not for the first time he asked himself why he didnt tell his father everything just spill it all start with elaine her allegations the cops and their questions five years earlier he had come within minutes of hustling home and asking his father for help but then it passed and then it went away and john mcavoy was never burdened with the ugly episode none of the four kyle joey bernardo alan strock and baxter tate had told their parents the investigation ran out of steam before they were forced to if he told his father now the first question would be why didnt you tell me then and kyle wasnt prepared to face it many tougher questions would follow a regular crossexamination by a courtroom brawler whod interrogated his son since he was an infant it was much easier for kyle to keep his secrets and hope for the best what he was about to tell his father was difficult enough after the last client left and sybil said goodbye and locked the front door father and son relaxed in the big office and talked about college basketball and hockey then family the twin sisters first as always then patty does your mother know youre in town john asked no ill call her tomorrow shes okay nothings changed shes fine patty lived and worked in the loft of an old warehouse in york it was a large space with lots of windows that provided the light she needed to pursue her painting john paid the rent utilities and everything else she needed through a monthly stipend of it wasnt alimony and it certainly wasnt child support but simply a gift he felt compelled to pass along for her upkeep because she could not support herself if she had sold a painting or a sculpture in the past nineteen years no one in the family knew about it i call her every tuesday night kyle said i know you do patty had no use for computers or cell phones she was severely bipolar and the mood swings were at times astonishing john still loved her and had never remarried though hed enjoyed a few girlfriends patty had been through at least two ruinous affairs both with fellow artists much younger men and john had been there to pick up the pieces their relationship was complicated to say the least so hows school john asked downhill i graduate in three months thats hard to believe kyle swallowed hard and decided to get it over with ive changed my mind about employment im going to wall street scully pershing john slowly lit another cigarette he was sixtytwo thick but not fat with a head full of wavy gray hair that began no more than three inches above his eyebrows kyle at twentyfive had lost more hair than his father john took a long drag from his winston and studied his son from behind wirerimmed reading glasses perched on his nose any particular reason the list of reasons had been memorized but kyle knew they would sound flat regardless of how smoothly they were delivered the legal services gig is a waste of time ill end up on wall street eventually so why not get the career started i dont believe this i know i know its an aboutface its a sellout theres nothing that requires you to pursue a career in a corporate firm its the big leagues dad in terms of what money thats a start no way there are trial lawyers who make ten times more each year than the biggest partners in new york yes and for every big trial lawyer there are five thousand starving sole practitioners on the average the money is much better in a big firm youll hate every minute of a big firm maybe not of course you will you grew up here around people and real clients you wont see a client for ten years in new york its a nice firm dad one of the best john yanked a pen from his pocket let me write this down so a year from now i can read it back to you go ahead i said its a nice firm one of the best john took notes and said youre gonna hate this firm and its lawyers and cases and youll probably even hate the secretaries and the other rookie associates youre gonna hate the grind the routine the sheer drudgery of all the mindless crap they dump on you response i disagree great john said still writing then he pulled on the cigarette and blew out an impressive cloud of smoke he put down the pen i thought you wanted to try something different and help people in the process did i not hear these words from you just a few weeks ago ive changed my mind well change it back its not too late no but why there must be a reason i just dont want to spend three years in rural virginia trying to learn enough spanish so i can listen to the problems of people who are here illegally in the first place im sorry but that sounds like a great way to spend the next three years i dont buy it give me another reason with that john shoved his leather swivel chair back and jumped to his feet kyle had seen this a million times his father preferred to pace and toss his hands about when he was agitated and firing questions it was an old habit from the courtroom and it was not unexpected id like to make some money for what to buy things some new toys you wont have the time to play with them i plan to save of course you will living in manhattan is so cheap youll save a fortune he was walking in front of his ego wall framed certificates and photos almost to the ceiling i dont buy it and i dont like it his cheeks were turning colors the scottish temper was warming up speak softly kyle reminded himself a sharp word or two would make things much worse he would survive this little clash as he had survived the others and one day soon all the harsh words would be over and kyle would be off to new york its all about the money isnt it kyle john said you were raised better im not here to be insulted dad ive made my decision i ask you to respect it a lot of fathers would be thrilled with such a job john mcavoy stopped pacing and stopped smoking and he looked across his office at the handsome face of his only son a twentyfiveyearold who was quite mature and unbelievably bright and he decided to back off the decision was made hed said enough any more and he might say too much okay he said okay its all you youre smart enough to know what you want but im your father and ill have some opinions about your next big decision and the next thats what im here for if you screw up again ill damned sure let you know it im not screwing up dad i will not bicker can we go to dinner im starving i need a drink they rode together to victors italian restaurant johns friday night ritual for as long as kyle could remember john had his usual endoftheweek martini kyle had his standard drink club soda with a twist of lime they ordered pasta with meatballs and after the second martini john began to mellow having his son at the largest and most prestigious law firm in the country did have a nice ring to it but he was still puzzled by the abrupt change in plans if you only knew kyle kept saying to himself and he ached because he couldnt tell his father the truth chapter kyle was relieved when his mother did not answer the phone he waited until almost eleven on saturday morning before calling he left a pleasant little message about popping in for a quick hello as he was passing through york for some vague reason she was either asleep or medicated or if it was a good day she was in her studio thoroughly absorbed in creating some of the most dreadful art never seen in a gallery or an exhibition visits with his mother were painful she rarely left her loft for any reason so the suggestion that they meet for coffee or lunch was always dismissed if the meds were in sync she talked incessantly while forcing kyle to admire her latest masterpieces if the meds were out of order she would lie on the sofa with her eyes closed unbathed unkempt often inconsolable in her gloom and misery she seldom asked about his life college law school girlfriends plans for the future she was much too absorbed in her own sad little world kyles twin sisters stayed far away from york he left the message on her recorder as he was hustling out of town and hoped she didnt return the call anytime soon she did not in fact the call was never returned which was not unusual four hours later he was in pittsburgh joey bernardo had tickets for the penguinssenators hockey game saturday night three tickets not two they met at boomerangs a favorite watering hole from their college days after kyle quit drinking joey did not he avoided most bars driving to pittsburgh he had hoped for some quiet time with his old roommate but it wasnt to be the third ticket was for blair joeys soontobeannounced fiancée by the time the three of them settled into a tight booth and ordered drinks joey was gushing with the news that they had just become engaged and were looking at wedding dates both were glowing with love and romance and seemed oblivious to everything else they held hands sat close even giggled at each other and after five minutes kyle felt uncomfortable what had happened to his friend where was the old joey the tough kid from south pittsburgh son of a fire captain accomplished boxer allconference high school fullback tremendous appetite for girls a cynical smartass wisecracker who believed women were disposable the guy whod vowed he wouldnt marry until he was at least forty blair had turned him to mush kyle was astonished at the transformation they eventually tired of their wedding plans and potential honeymoon destinations and the talk turned to careers blair a chatterbox who began every sentence with either i or me or my worked for an advertising agency and spent far too much time detailing some of their latest marketing maneuvers joey hung on every word while kyle began glancing at the clock behind them high above a row of windows as she prattled on kyle worked hard at maintaining enough eye contact to feign interest but his mind drifted to the video is she awake joey asks as baxter has sex with a dangerously intoxicated elaine keenan blair travels to montreal quite often joey said then blair ricocheted onto the subject of montreal and its beauty she was learning french is she awake joey sitting there with his hand under the table no doubt rubbing some flesh had no earthly idea that such a video existed when was the last time joey even thought about the incident ever had he forgotten it completely and what good would it do for kyle to bring it up now after the pittsburgh police quietly closed the file on elaine and her rape the brothers of beta buried it too during his last two years of college kyle could not remember a single instance when the episode was discussed elaine disappeared and was quickly forgotten if bennie wright and his operatives had been snooping around duquesne and pittsburgh in recent weeks kyle wanted to know about it perhaps joey might have seen or heard something perhaps not joey wasnt noticing much these days except for blair have you talked to baxter joey asked when blair finally stopped for air not in a month or so joey was grinning as if a joke was on the way he finally got in a movie you know no kidding he didnt tell me blair giggled like a first grader because she undoubtedly knew the rest of the story thats because he doesnt want you to know joey went on must be a great movie yep he got drunk one night and by the way the drinking is now in nomansland so he called and told me hed made his debut it was a cheap cable flick about a young girl who finds a human leg washed up on a beach and for the rest of the movie she has nightmares about being chased by a onelegged killer where does the great baxter tate fit in well you have to watch real close or youll miss him theres a scene on a boat where the cops are gazing at the ocean presumably looking for the rest of the body though this is never clear the movie has a lot of uncertainties one of the deputies walks over to the sheriff and says sir were low on fuel thats our movie star baxter is a deputy and a bad one he has only that one line and delivers it like a frightened sophomore in the school play was he sober who knows but i would say yes if hed been drunk as usual he wouldve nailed the line i cant wait to see it dont and dont tell him i mentioned it he called the next morning begging me not to watch it and threatening me if i told anyone hes a mess and that reminded blair of one of her friends who knew someone out there who landed a role in a new sitcom and away she went kyle smiled and nodded as his brain switched compartments of the three roommates joey was the only one who could possibly help if indeed help was possible baxter tate was in dire need of intensive rehab alan strock was thoroughly consumed with medical school at ohio state and of the four was clearly the least likely to get involved for joey the stakes were high he was on the tape wondering aloud if elaine was awake and conscious while baxter did the deed then joey himself took a turn he was currently handling accounts at a regional brokerage firm in pittsburgh and had two promotions under his belt he was goofy in love with air blair here and any hint of an old rape charge would upset their perfect lives on the one hand kyle felt as though he was taking the fall for joey he hadnt touched elaine that night yet it was his life and career now getting hijacked by bennie wright and his dirty little video shouldnt joey at least know about it and on the other hand kyle couldnt convince himself that he should drop the bomb on joey at this point if he kyle took the scully pershing job and met the demands of bennie wright and didnt get caught there was a decent chance the video would eventually be forgotten hours later during a break in the game with blair off in the ladies room kyle suggested they meet sunday for breakfast he needed to leave town early he said and might it be possible to get together without blair for an hour or so let her sleep in maybe they met for bagels at a shop owned by a chain a place that had not existed when kyle was at duquesne blair was still asleep somewhere and joey admitted to needing a break sweet girl kyle said more than once and each time felt guilty for lying he could not imagine a life with such a windbag she had great legs though the type joey had always coveted they talked about new york for a long time life in a big firm the grind of the city the sports teams other friends who were there and so on kyle eventually brought the conversation around to the old beta gang and they played catchup for a while they laughed at pranks and hazing and parties and stupid stunts pulled by themselves and others they were twentyfive now far removed from the craziness of their early college days and the nostalgia was fun for a few minutes several times the elaine thing was at the surface waiting for a comment or a question but joey did not mention it it was forgotten when they said goodbye kyle was convinced joey had buried the episode forever and more important no one had brought it to his attention recently he drove north to interstate then headed east new york was not far away neither in time nor in distance a few more weeks in the cozy world of academia then two months prepping for the bar exam and in early september he would report for duty at the largest law firm in the world there would be a hundred associates in his class all bright kids from the finest schools all polished and decked out in their newest clothes all anxious to jumpstart their brilliant legal careers kyle felt lonelier each day but he wasnt exactly isolated not even close his movements to in and around york and pittsburgh were closely monitored by bennie wright and his gang a small magnetic transmitter the size of a mans wallet was tucked away under some mud and dirt in the rear bumper of kyles red cherokee it was hotwired from the left taillight and emitted a constant gps signal that kept track of the vehicle anywhere it went from his office in lower manhattan bennie knew precisely where the jeep was located he was not surprised by kyles visit home but the trip to see joey bernardo was far more interesting bennie had no shortage of gadgets some hightech some lowtech and all very effective because he tracked simple civilians and not real spies corporate espionage was far easier than that of the military or national security variety kyles cell phone had long since been compromised and they listened to every conversation the kid had yet to mention his predicament to anyone on the phone they were also listening to olivias chatter as well as that of mitch his roommate so far nothing they were reading kyles emails he averaged twentyseven a day and almost all were law school related other efforts to listen were far more difficult an agent had eaten at victors in york at a table twenty feet from kyle and his father but heard almost nothing another had managed to land a seat two rows away at the penguins game but it was a wasted effort at boomerangs though one of bennies stars a twentysixyearold blonde in tight jeans managed to secure the booth next to kyle joey and blair she sipped one beer for two hours read a paperback and reported that the girl talked nonstop and about nothing bennie was generally pleased with the progress kyle had abruptly declined the legal services job in virginia he had hustled over to new york and cleared things with scully pershing he was seeing less of olivia and it was obvious at least to bennie that the relationship was going nowhere but the sudden trip to pittsburgh was bothersome had he planned to confide in joey had he in fact done so was alan strock next would kyle attempt to contact him andor baxter tate bennie was listening in all the right places and waiting he had leased two thousand square feet of office space in a building across broad street and two blocks down from scully pershing the tenants name was fancher group a financial services startup domiciled in bermuda its registered agent in new york was aaron kurtz also known as bennie wright also known as a dozen other men with perfect identification to prove any alias he chose from his new perch bennie could glance out his window and gaze down broad street and in a few short months hed be able to actually see their boy kyle enter and leave his place of employment chapter the lawsuit was filed in federal court in the southern district of new york manhattan division at ten minutes before five on a friday afternoon a time chosen so that the filing would attract as little attention as possible from the press a late friday dump the lawyer who signed it was a noted litigator named wilson rush a senior partner with scully pershing and throughout the day he had telephoned the clerk to make sure it would be properly received and docketed before the court closed for the week like all cases it was filed electronically no one from the firm was required to walk into the daniel patrick moynihan us courthouse on pearl street and hand over a thick pile of papers to commence the action of the forty or so civil lawsuits filed that day in the southern district it was by far the most serious most complex and most anticipated the parties involved had been feuding for years and while much of their bickering had been well reported most of the issues were too sensitive to bare in public the pentagon many senior members of congress and even the white house had worked diligently to prevent litigation but all efforts had failed the next battle in the war had begun and no one expected a quick resolution the parties and their lawyers would fight with bare knuckles for years as the dispute crept its way through the federal judiciary and eventually landed at the supreme court for a final ruling the clerk upon receiving the complaint quickly rerouted it to a secure bin to prevent its contents from being exposed this procedure was extremely rare and had been ordered by the chief district judge a barebones summary of the lawsuit was ready and available to the press it had been prepared under the direction of mr rush and it too had been approved by the judge the plaintiff was trylon aeronautics a wellknown defense contractor based in new york a privately held company that had been designing and building military aircraft for four decades the defendant was bartin dynamics a publicly held defense contractor based in bethesda maryland bartin averaged about billion a year in government contracts a sum that represented percent of its annual revenue bartin used different lawyers for its different needs but for the biggest fights it was protected by the wall street firm of agee poe epps scully pershing currently had twentyone hundred lawyers and claimed to be the largest firm in the world agee poe epps had two hundred fewer lawyers but boasted of more offices around the world thus it claimed to be the largest each firm spent far too much time jockeying with the other and boasting of its size power prestige billings partner profiles and anything else that might jack up its rankings the core of the dispute was the latest pentagon boondoggle to build the b hypersonic bomber a spaceage aircraft that had been dreamed about for decades and was now closer to becoming a reality five years earlier the air force had launched a contest among its top contractors to design the b a sleek bomber that would replace the aging fleet of bs and bs and serve the military through the year lockheed the largest defense contractor was the expected frontrunner in the competition but it was quickly outpaced by a joint venture put together by trylon and bartin a consortium of foreign companies british french and israeli had smaller roles in the joint venture the prize was enormous the air force would pay the winner billion up front to develop the advanced technologies and build a prototype and then contract for the procurement of to bs over the next thirty years at an estimated billion the contract would be the richest in the pentagons history the anticipated cost overruns were beyond calculation the trylonbartin design was astounding their b could take off from a base in the united states with a payload the same size as a b fly at seventysix hundred miles per hour or mach and deliver its payload on the other side of the world in an hour at a speed and from an altitude that would defy all current and foreseen defensive measures after delivery of whatever it happened to be hauling the b could return to its home base without refueling either in flight or on the ground the aircraft would literally skip along the edge of the atmosphere after ascending to an altitude of feet just outside the stratosphere the b would turn off its engines and float back to the surface of the atmosphere once there its airbreathing engines would kick on and lift the plane back to feet this procedure a skipping motion much like that of a flat rock bouncing across still water would be repeated until the aircraft arrived at its target a bombing run that originated in arizona and ended in asia would require about thirty skips with the b popping through the atmosphere once every ninety seconds because the engines would be used intermittently significantly smaller amounts of fuel would be required and by leaving the atmosphere and venturing into cold space the heat buildup would be dissipated after three years of intense and often frantic research and design the air force announced that it had selected the trylonbartin design this was done with as little fanfare as possible since the dollar amounts were staggering the country was fighting two wars and the pentagon decided it would not be wise to broadcast such an ambitious procurement plan the air force tried its best to downplay the b program but it was a waste of time as soon as the winner was announced fighting erupted on all fronts lockheed roared back with its senators and lobbyists and lawyers trylon and bartin historically fierce competitors began sniping almost immediately the prospect of that much money splintered any notion of cooperation each corralled its politicians and lobbyists and joined the fight for a bigger piece of the pork the british french and israelis eased to the sidelines but certainly did not go away both trylon and bartin claimed ownership of the design and the technologies efforts to mediate succeeded then failed lockheed loomed in the background waiting the pentagon threatened to yank the contract and have another contest congressmen held hearings governors wanted jobs and economic development journalists wrote long pieces in magazines waste and watchdog groups railed against the b as if it were a shuttle to mars and the lawyers quietly prepared for litigation two hours after the lawsuit was filed kyle saw it posted on the federal courts web site he was at his desk in his office at the yale law journal editing a lengthy article on his computer for three weeks now he had been checking the filings in all the federal courts in new york as well as the state courts during their first wretched session bennie had mentioned the upcoming filing of a massive lawsuit in new york the one that kyle was now expected to infiltrate in meetings since then kyle had repeatedly prodded bennie for information about the lawsuit but each inquiry had been met with a dismissive well talk about it later oddly the online posting of the lawsuit revealed nothing but its title and the name address law firm and bar certification number of wilson rush the word secure was inserted after the title and kyle was unable to access the contents of the complaint in the southern district of new york no other case filed in the past three weeks had been locked away in such a manner red flags began to wave he searched agee poe epps and studied their exhaustive list of corporate clients the firm had represented bartin dynamics since the s kyle forgot about the law journal work piled on his desk and around his chair and lost himself on the internet a search of trylon soon revealed its b hypersonic bomber project and all the problems it had caused and evidently was still creating kyle closed the door of his small office and checked the printer for paper it was almost eight on friday night and though the law journal types were known for their odd hours the crew had cleared out for spring break he printed all available corporate info on trylon and bartin then added more paper there were several dozen newspaper and magazine articles on the b fiasco he printed them all and began reading the most serious ones he found a hundred defense and military web sites and on one for futuristic warfare there were pages of background on the b he checked prior court filings to see how often scully pershing had sued on behalf of or defended trylon and did the same for agee poe epps and bartin on into the night he dug and dug and the thicker his file became the worse he felt there was a chance he was chasing the wrong lawsuit he couldnt know for sure until bennie confirmed it but there was little doubt the timing was on schedule the law firms were in place billions were at stake just as bennie had said two corporations that were old competitors two law firms that hated each other military secrets stolen technology corporate espionage foreign intelligence threats of litigation and even criminal prosecution it was one monumental sordid mess and now he kyle mcavoy was expected to insert himself into the fray in recent weeks he had often speculated about what type of case was worth the high cost of such elaborate espionage two corporate rivals fighting over a pot of gold could describe any number of disputes perhaps it was an antitrust case or a patent dispute or a couple of drug companies brawling over the latest obesity pill the worstcase scenario was the one he had just been handed a goldplated pentagon procurement program complete with secret technologies warring politicians ruthless executives and so on the list was long and disheartening why couldnt he just go back to york and practice law with his father at am he stuffed his notebooks into his backpack and for a few seconds went through the fruitless ritual of straightening his desk he looked around turned off the light locked his door and again realized that any decent operative could intrude whenever he wanted he felt certain bennie and his thugs had been there probably with bugs and wires and mikes and other crap that kyle tried not to think about and he was sure they were watching in spite of his demands that bennie leave him alone kyle knew they were following him hed seen them several times they were good but they had made a few mistakes the challenge he told himself repeatedly was to act as though he had no clue that they were watching just play the role of a naïve unconcerned college kid hauling a backpack around campus and looking at girls he never changed his routines or his routes or parking lots same spot for lunch almost every day same coffee shop where he met olivia occasionally after class he was either at the law school or at his apartment with few diversions along the way and because his habits remained the same so did those of his shadows they became lazy because he was such an easy target kyle the innocent lulled them to sleep and when they nodded off he caught them one face hed seen three times already a young ruddy face with different eyeglasses and a mustache that came and went at a used bookstore near the campus kyle began buying old paperback spy novels for a dollar each he bought them one at a time kept the current one in his backpack and when he finished he tossed it in the wastebasket at the law school and bought another he assumed that none of his communications were confidential his cell phone and laptop were compromised he was certain he increased slightly his emails to joey bernardo alan strock and baxter tate but all messages were quick howdies with almost no substance he did the same for other beta brothers all under the guise of encouraging his buddies to do a better job of keeping in touch he called each of them once a week and talked sports and school and careers if bennie was in fact listening he heard not one word to indicate kyle was even remotely suspicious kyle convinced himself that to survive the next seven years he must learn to think and act like his adversaries there was a way out somewhere bennie was back in town they met for a sandwich on saturday at a pita place north of town away from campus he had promised to drop in every other week or so throughout the spring until kyle graduated in may kyle had asked why this was necessary bennie had offered some meaningless blather about maintaining contact in each of their subsequent meetings bennies personality had softened slightly he would always be the nononsense hardass handler with a mission but he was acting as though he wanted their time together to be somewhat pleasant after all they would spend hours together he said and this always evoked a frown from kyle who wanted no part of any pleasant chitchat any plans for spring break bennie asked as they unwrapped their sandwiches work kyle said the break had started the day before and half of yale was now somewhere in southern florida come on your last spring break and youre not headed for the beach nope ill be in new york next week looking for an apartment bennie looked surprised and said we can help weve had this conversation bennie i dont need your help both took enormous bites and chewed in silence finally kyle asked any news on the lawsuit a quick dismissive nod nothing has it been filed yet kyle asked why cant you tell me about it bennie cleared his throat and sipped his water next week lets meet next week when youre in new york and ill walk you through the lawsuit cant wait another hefty bite and they chewed for a while when do you take the bar exam bennie asked july where new york somewhere in manhattan its not something im looking forward to youll do fine when do you get the results bennie knew the dates and places the exam was given in new york he knew when the results were posted online he knew what happened to young associates if they flunked the bar he knew everything early november did you go to law school a smile almost a chuckle oh no ive always tried to avoid lawyers sometimes though well thats what the job requires kyle listened carefully for the accent it tended to come and go he thought of the israelis and their talent for languages especially among the mossad and the military not for the first time he wondered whom he would be spying for and against they met five days later at the ritzcarlton in lower manhattan kyle asked bennie if he had an office in the city or whether he did all of his work in hotel suites there was no response before the meeting kyle had looked at four apartments all in soho and tribeca the cheapest was a month for an eighthundredsquarefoot walkup and the most expensive was a month for a thousand square feet in a renovated warehouse whatever the rent kyle would be handling it himself because he did not want a roommate his life would be complicated enough without the strains of living with someone else and besides bennie did not like the idea of a roommate bennie and company had followed kyle and the broker around lower manhattan and knew precisely where the apartments were located by the time kyle arrived at the hotel operatives were calling the same realtor inquiring about the apartments and making plans to visit them kyle would indeed live where he chose but the place would be infested by the time he moved in bennie had some thick files on the small table in the suite the lawsuit was filed last friday he began in federal court here in manhattan the plaintiff is a company called trylon aeronautics the defendant is a company called bartin dynamics kyle absorbed this with no expression his file on the case and the litigants now comprised three fourinch spiral notebooks over two thousand pages and was growing by the day he was sure he didnt know as much as his pal bennie here but he already knew a hell of a lot and bennie knew he knew from his comfortable office on broad street bennie and his tech guys kept close tabs on kyles laptop and his desk computer in his office at the law journal they monitored nonstop and when kyle opened his laptop in his apartment to send a note to a professor bennie knew it when he was working and editing a case note bennie knew it and when he was monitoring the court filings in new york and digging through the dirt on trylon and bartin bennie knew it sit there and play dumb son ill play along too youre smart as hell but youre too stupid to realize youre in way over your head chapter as springtime reluctantly arrived in new england the campus came to life and shook off the lingering chill and gloom of winter plants bloomed the grass showed some color and as the days grew longer the students found more reasons to stay outside frisbees flew by the hundreds long lunches and even picnics materialized when the sun was out professors became lazier classes grew shorter for his last semester on campus kyle chose to ignore the festivities he kept himself in his office working feverishly to finish the details for the june edition of the yale law journal it would be his last and he wanted it to be his best work provided the perfect excuse to ignore virtually everyone else olivia finally got fed up and they parted amicably his friends all of them thirdyear students and about to graduate fell into two groups the first concentrated on drinking and partying and trying to savor every last moment of life on campus before being evicted and sent into the real world the second group was already thinking about their careers studying for the bar exam and looking for apartments in large cities kyle found it easy to avoid both on may he sent a letter to joey bernardo that read dear joey i graduate from law school on may any chance you could be here alan cant do it and im afraid to ask baxter it would be great fun to hang out for a couple of days no girlfriend please correspond by regular mail at this address no emails no phones ill explain later best kyle the letter was handwritten and mailed from the law journal office a week later the reply arrived hey kyle whats with the snail mail your handwriting really sucks but its probably better than mine ill be there for graduation should be fun what the hell is so secretive that we cant talk on the phone or use email are you cracking up baxter is hes gone hell be dead in a year if we dont do something oh well my hand is aching and i feel like such an old fart writing with ink cant wait to get your next sweet little note love joey kyles reply was longer and filled with details joeys response was just as sarcastic and filled with even more questions kyle threw it away as soon as he read it they swapped letters once more and the weekend was planned patty mcavoy could not be coaxed from her loft for her sons graduation not that any real effort was made indeed both john mcavoy and kyle were pleased with her decision to stay at home because her presence at yale would complicate things she had skipped the diploma service at duquesne three years earlier just as she had skipped the commencements for both of her daughters in short patty didnt do graduations regardless of how important they might be she had managed to attend both daughters weddings but had been unable to take part in the planning of either john simply wrote the checks and somehow the family survived both ordeals joey bernardo arrived in new haven saturday afternoon the day before the law schools ceremonies and as directed by the written word carried by the us postal service he proceeded to a dark and cavernous pizza parlor called santos a mile from campus at precisely pm on saturday may he slid into a booth in the farright corner of santos and began to wait he was amused and quite curious and he was still wondering if his friend was losing his mind one minute later kyle appeared from the back and sat across from him they shook hands then kyle glanced at the front door far away and to the right the restaurant was almost empty and bruce springsteen was rocking through the sound system start talking joey said now only slightly amused im being followed youre cracking up the pressure is getting to you shut up and listen a teenage waitress paused at the table just long enough to see if they wanted anything both asked for diet colas and kyle ordered a large pepperoni pizza wasnt really that hungry joey said when she was gone were in a pizza place and so we need to order a pizza otherwise well look suspicious in a few minutes a thug wearing faded jeans a dark green rugby shirt and a khaki golf cap will walk through the door completely ignore us and probably go to the bar hell hang around for less than ten minutes then hell leave though hell never look at us hell see everything when you leave either he or one of his teammates will follow you and check your license plates and within minutes theyll know that i had a semisecret meeting with my old pal joey bernardo these guys are friends of yours no they are professional operatives but because im just me and not some highly trained thug myself theyre assuming that i have no clue that theyre following me great that clears things up why old buddy are they following you its a very long story youre not drinking again are you not back on the smack i never did smack and you know it no im not drinking and im not losing my marbles im dead serious and i need your help you need a shrink kyle youre spooky man theres a glow in your eyes the door opened and the thug walked in he was dressed precisely as kyle had said but with the addition of a pair of round tortoiseshell eyeglasses dont stare kyle whispered as joeys jaw dropped the diet colas arrived and they took a drink the thug went to the bar ordered a draft beer and from his stool could see their table in the long mirrors behind the racks of booze but he could not possibly hear what they were saying he just put on the eyeglasses kyle said with a large smile as if they were telling jokes sunglasses would be too conspicuous in here he added the big round ones so he can look around and not get caught please smile please laugh were just two old chums reminiscing here nothing serious joey was flabbergasted and could manage neither a smile nor a laugh so kyle erupted in a loud cackle then pulled off a slice of thin pizza as soon as it arrived he was animated and smiling and with his mouth full he said eat joey and smile and please utter a few words what have you done is that guy a cop or something or something ive done nothing wrong but its still a complicated story youre involved in it lets talk about the pirates the pirates are in last place and theyll be in last place come september pick another subject or another team joey finally took a slice and bit off half of it i need a beer i cant eat pizza without a beer kyle flagged down the lazy little waitress and ordered one beer there was a large screen in one corner espn was running baseball highlights for a few minutes they ate pizza and watched the footage the guy in the rugby shirt was working on a twelveounce draft and after about ten minutes it was gone he paid in cash and left when the door closed behind him joey said what the hell is going on thats a conversation the two of us must have but not here itll take an hour or two and then the first conversation will lead to another and another if we do it here this weekend well get caught the bad guys are watching and if they see us engaged in serious talk theyll know its important for us to finish the pizza walk out the front door and not be seen together alone until you leave town tomorrow thanks for inviting me up i didnt invite you for the graduation joey sorry about that the reason youre here is to give you this kyle slid across a folded sheet of paper put it in your pocket and quick joey grabbed it glanced around as if assassins were moving in and shoved it in a jeans pocket what is it kyle trust me joey please im in trouble and i need help theres no one else but you and im involved too maybe lets finish the pizza and get out of here heres the plan the fourth of july is just around the corner you come up with this wondeiful idea for a rafting trip down the new river in west virginia three days on the river two nights camping out me and you and some of the old gang from duquesne a boys weekend while we can still do it the list there has ten names and emails stuff you already have it also has the name of an outfitter in beckley west virginia ive done all the homework joey nodded as if nothing made sense kyle pressed on the purpose of the trip is to shake the surveillance once were on the river and in the mountains theres no way they can follow me we can talk and talk and not have to worry about being watched this is crazy youre crazy shut up joey im not crazy im dead serious they watch me around the clock they listen to my phone calls and theyve bugged my laptop and theyre not cops no theyre much scarier than cops if we spend too much time together now theyll become suspicious and your life will get complicated eat some pizza im not hungry there was a long gap in the conversation kyle kept eating joey kept watching the espn highlights springsteen kept singing after a few minutes kyle said look we need to go i have a lot to tell you but i cant do it now if youll plan the rafting trip we can have some fun and ill give you the full story you ever been rafting sure you no i dont like the water they provide life jackets come on joey have some fun a year from now youll be married and your life will be over thanks pal its just a boys trip down the river a bunch of old friends from college shoot the emails and put it all together whatta you say sure kyle whatever but when you email me use the diversion the diversion yes its written down in your emails to me were headed for the potomac river in western maryland we cant give these thugs too much notice what are they gonna do follow us down the river in a speedboat no its just a precaution i dont want them anywhere around me this is real strange kyle it gets stranger joey suddenly slid the pizza aside and leaned forward on his elbows he glared at kyle and said ill do it but you gotta give me a clue elaines back with her rape scenario just as quickly as he had leaned forward joey shrunk back to his side of the booth and limply recoiled elaine who hed forgotten her last name if in fact hed ever known it that was five maybe six years ago and the cops had not only closed the file but slammed the damned thing shut and why because nothing happened there was no rape intercourse maybe but with that girl everything was consensual he had a december wedding planned with the woman of his dreams and nothing absolutely nothing could screw it up he had a career a future a good name how could this nightmare be alive with so much to say he managed to say nothing he stared at kyle who couldnt help but feel sorry for him is she awake joey asks no response from baxter tate no response from the girl this is something we can deal with joey its frightening but we can handle it we need to talk for hours but not here not now lets get away sure whatever you say that night kyle met his father for dinner at a greek place called the athenian they were joined by joey bernardo whod had a few drinks in preparation for the evening and was so mellow he was quite dull or maybe he was just stunned or scared or something else but he was certainly preoccupied john mcavoy downed two martinis before he touched a menu and was soon telling war stories about old trials and old cases joey matched him martini for martini and the gin thickened his tongue but did not lighten his mood kyle had invited him because he did not want his father to launch into a lastditch effort to persuade him to resist the evils of corporate law and do something productive with his life but after the second martini and with joey barely coherent john mcavoy made such an effort kyle chose not to argue he ate garlic crackers and hummus and listened red wine arrived and his father told another story about representing some poor soul with a good case but no money and of course he won as is true with the vast majority of lawyers tales john mcavoy was the hero of all of his stories the poor were saved the weak were protected kyle almost missed his mother late that night long after dinner kyle walked the yale campus for the last time as a student he was stunned at the speed at which the last three years had gone by yet he was also tired of law school he was tired of lectures and classrooms and exams and the meager existence on a students budget at twentyfive he was now a fully grown man nicely educated and all in one piece with no bad habits no permanent damage at this point the future should hold great promise and excitement instead he felt nothing but fear and apprehension seven years of school great success as a student and it was all coming down to this the miserable life of an unwilling spy chapter of the two apartments kyle was considering bennie preferred the one in the old meatpacking district near the gansevoort hotel in a building that was years old and had been built for the sole purpose of slaughtering hogs and cows but the carnage was now history and the developer had done a splendid job of gutting the place and renovating it into a collection of boutiques on the first floor hip offices on the second and modern apartments from there upward bennie cared nothing about being hip or modern and could not have cared less about the location what impressed him was the fact that the apartment directly above d was also available as a sublet bennie grabbed it d at a month for six months then he waited for kyle to lease d kyle though was leaning toward a secondstory walkup on beekman street near city hall and the brooklyn bridge it was smaller and cheaper at still an obscene amount for the square footage in new haven kyle had been splitting a month for a dump but one that was three times as large as anything hed seen in manhattan scully pershing had paid him a signing bonus of and he was thinking of using it to secure a nice apartment early in the summer when more were available he would lock himself away in his new digs study nonstop for six weeks and take the new york bar exam in late july when it became obvious to bennie that kyle was ready to lease the beekman apartment he arranged for one of his operatives to suddenly appear badger the real estate agent and offer more money it worked and kyle was headed for the meatpacking district when he verbally agreed to take d for a month for a year beginning on june bennie dispatched a team of technicians to decorate the place two weeks before kyle was scheduled to move in listening devices were planted in the walls of every room the telephone and internet lines were tapped and wired to receivers in computers located directly above in d four hidden cameras were installed one each in the den the kitchen and the two bedrooms each could be withdrawn immediately in the event kyle or someone else started poking around they too were connected to computers in d so bennie and his boys could watch kyle do everything except shower shave brush his teeth and use the toilet some things should be kept private on june kyle loaded everything he owned into his jeep cherokee and left yale and new haven for a few miles he went through the usual nostalgia of saying goodbye to his student days but by the time he passed through bridgeport he was thinking about the bar exam and what was waiting beyond it he drove to manhattan where he planned to spend a few days with friends then move into his apartment on the fifteenth he had yet to sign a lease and the real estate agent was becoming irritated he was ignoring her phone calls as scheduled on june he took a cab to the peninsula hotel in midtown and found bennie wright in a tenthfloor suite his handler was dressed in customary drab attire dark suit white shirt boring tie black shoes but on june he had an additional article or two his suit coat was off and bennie had strapped around his shirt a shiny black leather holster with a ninemillimeter beretta snug just below his left armpit a quick move with the right hand and the pistol was in play kyle ran through all the sarcastic remarks he might make in the presence of such weaponry but decided at the last second to simply ignore it it was obvious that bennie wanted his beretta to be noticed maybe even mentioned just ignore it kyle sat as he always sat with bennie right ankle on his left knee arms folded across his chest wearing a look of complete contempt congratulations on your graduation bennie said sipping coffee from a paper cup and standing by the window that overlooked fifth avenue did things go well you were there you asshole your boys watched me and joey eat a pizza you know what my father had for dinner and how many martinis he knocked back you saw joey stagger out of the greek place drunk as a skunk when they took my photo in cap and gown your goons were probably snapping away too swell kyle said thats great have you found an apartment i think so where why do you care i thought we agreed that you would stay away from me just trying to be polite kyle thats all why it really pisses me off when we get together and you start this happy horseshit like were a couple of old pals im not here because i want to be im not chitchatting with you because i choose to id rather be anywhere else in the world right now im here because youre blackmailing me i despise you okay dont ever forget that and stop trying to be polite it goes against your personality oh i can be a prick you are a prick bennie sipped his coffee and kept smiling well moving right along may i ask when you take the bar exam no because you know precisely when i take the bar exam what am i here for bennie whats the purpose of this meeting just a friendly hello welcome to new york congrats on finishing law school hows the family that kind of stuff im touched bennie set down his coffee cup and picked up a thick notebook he handed it to kyle these are the latest filings in the trylonbartin lawsuit motion to dismiss supporting affidavits supporting exhibits briefs in support of and briefs in opposition to order overruling said motion answer filed by the defendant bartin and so on as you know the file is sealed so what youre holding there is unauthorized howd you get it kyle asked bennie responded with the same silly smirk he always gave when kyle asked a question that could not be answered when youre not studying for the bar exam you can bone up on the lawsuit a question it seems to me that its a long shot for scully pershing to assign me to the litigation section that happens to be handling this case and its even more of a stretch to believe they would allow a green associate to get anywhere near it im sure youve thought about this and the question is what happens if im nowhere near this case your class will have about a hundred rookie associates same as last year and the year before roughly percent will be assigned to litigation the others will go into everything else mergers acquisitions tax antitrust transactions securities finance estates and all the other wonderful services the firm provides youll be the star of the litigation rookies because youre the brightest and youll work eighteen hours a day seven days a week and youll suck up and kiss ass and backstab and do all the right things it takes to succeed in a big law firm youll want to work on this case youll demand it and because its the biggest lawsuit in the firm youll eventually be assigned to it sorry i asked and while youre worming your way onto this case youll be providing us with other valuable information like what its too early to discuss right now you need to concentrate on the bar exam bless you i hadnt thought about it they sniped for another ten minutes then kyle left in a huff as usual from the backseat of a taxi he called the realtor and said hed changed his mind about living in the meatpacking district the realtor was upset but managed to keep her cool kyle had signed nothing and she had no legal ammo to launch he promised to give her a call in a few days and they would resume their search for something smaller and cheaper kyle moved his junk into a spare room in the soho apartment of charles and charles two yale law grads whod finished a year earlier and were now working for different megafirms they had played lacrosse at hopkins and were probably a couple though theyd kept things quiet at least at yale kyle had no interest in their relationship he needed a bed for a while and a place to store his possessions and he needed to keep bennie honest if that was possible the charleses offered him their junk room for free but kyle insisted on paying a week the apartment would be a great place to study because the charleses were seldom there both were being thrashed by hundredhour workweeks when it became clear that bennies operation had just been stiffed for six months rent at per for apartment d in the slaughterhouse plus the costly decoration of d below it plus a month for a year for the apartment on beekman bennie fumed but did not panic the wasted money was not a factor what bothered him was the unpredictability of it for the past four months kyle had done little to surprise them the surveillance had been effortless the trip to pittsburgh in february had been dissected and no longer concerned them but now kyle was in the city where watching him was more challenging a civilian subject is usually easy because of predictable thoughts and patterns why would he try to shake surveillance if he didnt know it was there but how much did kyle know or suspect how predictable was he bennie licked his wounds for an hour then began planning his next project research on charles and charles and a quick inspection of their apartment the second detoxification of baxter tate began with a knock on his front door then another he had not answered his cell phone he had been driven home by a cab at four in the morning from a trendy nightclub in beverly hills the driver helped him into his condo after the fourth knock the door was quietly opened with no effort because baxter hadnt bothered to lock it the two men specialists in retrieving wayward family members with addiction problems found baxter on his bed still dressed in last nights getup white linen shirt stained with some strain of liquor black linen zegna sport coat bleached designer jeans bragano loafers no socks over his very tanned ankles he was comatose breathing heavy but not snoring still alive but not for long not at the rate he was going they quickly searched the bedroom and adjoining bathroom for weapons both men were armed but their handguns were hidden under their jackets then they radioed to a waiting car and another man entered the condo he was baxters uncle a man named walter tate uncle wally brother to baxters father the only one of five siblings who had accomplished anything in life the family banking fortune was now three generations old and declining at a steady but not alarming rate the last time walter had seen his nephew he was in a lawyers office in pittsburgh cleaning up after another drunkdriving episode because his four siblings were unable to make even the most basic decisions in life walter had long since assumed the role of the family boss he watched the investments met with the lawyers handled the press when necessary and reluctantly intervened when one of his nieces or nephews flamed out his own son had been killed hang gliding this was his second intervention with baxter and it would be the last the first had been two years earlier also in la and they had shipped the boy off to a ranch in montana where he sobered up rode horses made new friends saw the light sobriety lasted all of two weeks after he returned to his worthless career in hollywood walters limit was two rehabs after that they could kill themselves for all he cared baxter had been dead to the world for about nine hours when uncle wally shook his leg long enough and hard enough to rouse him from his drunkenness the sight of three strange men standing by his bed startled him he backed away from them scrambling to the other end of the bed then he recognized uncle wally hed lost some hair put on a few pounds how long had it been the family never got together in fact the family strove mightily to avoid one another baxter rubbed his eyes then his temples a skullcracking headache arrived suddenly he looked at uncle wally then at the two strangers well well he said hows aunt rochelle rochelle had been the first of walters wives but she was the only one baxter ever remembered she had terrified him as a child and he would always despise her she died last year walter said thats just awful what brings you to la he kicked off his loafers and wrapped his arms around a pillow it was now obvious where this was going were taking a trip baxter the four of us were gonna check you into another clinic sober you up then see if they can put you back together so this is an intervention yes groovy happens all the time out here its a miracle a single movie ever gets made with all the damned intervening that goes on in hollywood everybodys always getting asked to help with an intervention i mean look youre not going to believe this but two months ago i took part in an intervention a link thats what i was called but i guess you guys know all about that can you imagine im sitting in a hotel room with these other links some i know some i dont and poor jimmy walks in beer in hand and gets absolutely ambushed his brother sits him down then we go around the room and tell the poor boy what a miserable piece of shit he is made him cry but then they always cry dont they i cried didnt i now i remember you shouldve heard me lecturing jimmy about the evils of vodka and cocaine if he hadnt been crying so hard he wouldve come after me could i have a glass of water who are you theyre with me uncle wally said i figured one of the specialists handed baxter a bottle of water he drained it in one long noisy slurp with water splashing down his chin got any painkillers he said desperately they handed over some pills and another bottle of water when he had consumed it all he said where we going this time nevada theres a clinic near reno in the mountains spectacular country its not a dude ranch is it i cant take another thirty days on a horse my ass is still raw from the last detox uncle wally was still standing at the foot of the bed he had not moved a step no horses this time its a different kind of place oh really i hear theyre all the same folks here are always talking about their latest rehab always comparing notes great way to pick up girls in a bar he spoke with his eyes closed tightly as the pain rippled through his head no this is different how so its a bit tougher and youll be there longer do tell how long as long as it takes can i just promise to stop drinking right now and skip the whole damned thing no and im assuming that since youre here and since youre the big chief of this sorry little tribe my participation is not exactly voluntary right because if i say go to hell get out of my house im calling the police because the three of you broke in and that theres no way im taking a trip with you if i say all that then youll simply bring up the trust funds right right the nausea hit like lightning baxter bolted from the bed shedding his sport coat as he stumbled through the door to the bathroom the vomiting was loud and long and mixed with waves of profanities he washed his face looked at his swollen red eyes in the mirror and admitted that a few days of sobriety was not a bad idea but he couldnt imagine a whole lifetime with no booze and no drugs the trust funds had been established by a greatgrandfather who had no idea what he was doing in the days before private jets and luxury yachts and cocaine and countless other ways to burn the family fortune the prudent thing to do was to preserve the money for future generations but baxters grandfather had seen the warning signs he hired the lawyers and changed the trusts so that a board of advisers could exercise a measure of discretion some of the money arrived each month and allowed baxter to survive quite comfortably without working but the serious money could be turned off like a spigot and uncle wally controlled it with an iron fist if uncle wally said you were going to rehab then you were about to dry out baxter stood in the bathroom door leaning on the facing and looked at the three they had not budged he looked at the specialist nearest to him and said you guys here to break my thumbs if i put up a fight no came the reply lets go baxter walter said do i pack no your jet yes last time i was allowed to get hammered the clinic says you can drink all you want on the ride in the bar is stocked how longs the flight ninety minutes ill have to drink fast im sure you can handle that baxter waved his arms and looked around his bedroom what about my place the bills the maid the mail ill take care of everything lets go baxter brushed his teeth combed his hair changed his shirt then followed uncle wally and the other two outside and into a black van they rode in silence for a few minutes but the tension was finally broken by the sounds of baxter crying in the rear seat chapter the bar review course was offered at fordham university on sixtysecond street in a vast lecture hall that was filled with anxious former law students from until each weekday various professors from nearby law schools covered the intricacies of constitutional law corporations criminal law property evidence contracts and many other subjects since virtually every person in the room had just finished law school the material was familiar and easily digested but the volume was overwhelming three years of intense study would be reduced to a nightmare of an exam that ran for sixteen hours over a twoday period thirty percent of those taking it for the first time would not pass and because of this there was little hesitation in forking over the for the review course scully pershing picked up the bill for kyle and its other new recruits the pressure was palpable the first time kyle walked into the room at fordham and it never went away by the third day he was sitting with a group of friends from yale and they soon formed a study group that met every afternoon and often worked into the night during three years of law school they had dreaded the day they would be forced to revisit the murky world of federal taxation or the tedium of the uniform commercial code but the day was at hand the bar exam consumed them scully pershing was typical in that it forgave the first flunking of the exam but not the second two bad tests and youre out a few of the crueler firms had a onestrike policy and there were a handful of more reasonable firms that would forgive twice if the associate was showing promise on all other fronts regardless the fear of failure boiled just under the surface and often made it difficult to sleep kyle found himself taking long walks around the city at all hours to break the monotony and clear his head the walks were informative and at times fascinating he learned the streets the subways the bus system the rules of the sidewalks he knew which coffee shops stayed open all night and which bakeries had warm baguettes at am he found a wonderful old bookstore in the village and resumed his rabid new interest in spy and espionage novels after three weeks in the city he finally found a suitable apartment at daybreak one morning he was sitting on a stool in the window of a coffee shop on seventh avenue in chelsea sipping a double espresso and reading the times when he saw two men wrestle a sofa out of a door across the street the men were obviously not professional movers and they showed little patience with the sofa they practically threw it into the back of a van then disappeared through the door a few minutes later they were back with a bulky leather chair that received the same treatment the men were in a hurry and the move did not appear to be a happy one the door was next to a health food store and two floors above it a sign in a window advertised an apartment available for a sublet kyle quickly crossed the street stopped one of the men then followed him upstairs for a look around the apartment was one of four on the third floor it had three small rooms and a narrow kitchen and as he talked to the man steve somebody he learned that steve had the lease but was leaving town in a hurry they shook hands on an eightmonth sub at per that afternoon they met again at the apartment to sign the paperwork and transfer the keys kyle thanked charles and charles reloaded his meager assets in his jeep and drove twenty minutes uptown to the corner of seventh and west twentysixth his first purchase was a wellused bed and night table from a flea market his second was a fiftyinch flatscreen television there was no urgency in furnishing or decorating kyle doubted he would live there beyond the eight months and could not imagine having guests it was an adequate place to start then he would find something nicer before leaving for west virginia he carefully set the traps he cut several fourinch pieces of brown sewing thread and with a dab of vaseline stuck the threads to the bottoms of three interior doors standing and looking down he could barely see the thread against the oak stain but if anyone entered the apartment and opened the doors they would leave a trail by displacing the threads along one wall in the den he had stacked textbooks notebooks files for this and that generally useless stuff that he wasnt ready to part with it was a haphazard pile but kyle arranged everything in careful order and photographed it all with a digital camera anyone looking through it would be tempted to toss things back into the collection and if that happened kyle would know it he informed his new neighbor an elderly lady from thailand that he would be gone for four days and was not expecting any visitors if she heard anything call the cops she agreed but kyle was not at all confident she understood a word he said his counterintelligence tactics were rudimentary but the basics often worked just fine according to the spy novels the new river runs through the allegheny mountains in southern west virginia its fast in some places slower in others but on any stretch of it the scenery is beautiful with class iv rapids in some areas it has long been a favorite of serious kayakers and with miles and miles of slower water it attracts thousands of rafters each year because of its popularity there are several established outfitters kyle had found one near the town of beckley they met there at a motel the first night joey kyle and four other beta brothers they drank two cases of beer to celebrate the fourth of july and woke up with hangovers kyle of course stayed with diet soda and woke up pondering the mysteries of the bankruptcy code one look at his five friends and he was proud of his sobriety their guide was a rather rustic local named clem and clem had a few rules for the twentyfourfoot rubber raft that was his livelihood helmets and life vests were mandatory no smoking period no drinking was allowed in the boat while it was moving down the river when it stopped for lunch or for the night they could drink all they wanted clem counted ten cases of beer and realized what he was facing the first morning was uneventful the sun was hot and the crew was subdued even suffering by late afternoon they were splashing water and began jumping in by pm they were parched and clem found a sandbar to settle into for the first night after a couple of beers each and one for clem himself they pitched four tents and set up camp clem cooked tbones on a grill and after dinner the crew ventured off to explore kyle and joey followed the river for half a mile and when they were certain they could not be seen they sat on a log with their feet in the backwater lets have it joey said cutting to the chase for weeks even months kyle had struggled with the conversation they were about to have he loathed the idea of upsetting his friends life but he had decided that he had no choice but to tell the story all of it he justified his decision by convincing himself that he would certainly want to know if things were reversed if joey had been the first to see the video and knew of its dangers he kyle would want to know but the bigger reason and one that made him feel selfish was that kyle needed help he had worked on a rough draft of a plan and it was more than he could handle himself especially with bennie lurking in the shadows the plan could easily lead nowhere and it could just as easily lead to something dangerous it could be aborted at any time it could also be rejected outright by joey bernardo the first step involved elaine keenan joey listened in rapt silence to kyles detailed replaying of the initial encounter with a man known as bennie he was sufficiently stunned by the existence of the video he was thoroughly bewildered by the blackmail he was terrified by the thought of some forgotten girl accusing him of rape and producing the evidence to back it up kyle unloaded everything but the background on the lawsuit he had not yet passed the bar and received a license to practice but he had signed a contract with scully pershing and felt an ethical obligation to protect firm business this was silly in light of what he would be forced to do but for the moment his career was unblemished and he felt rather ethical joeys first reaction was a halfhearted attempt to deny any contact with elaine but kyle waved him off youre on the video kyle said as sympathetically as possible youre having sex with a girl whos probably floating in and out of consciousness in our apartment baxter goes first then you and i saw it on a twelveinch laptop screen if its ever seen in court itll be on a big screen a massive one itll be like sitting in the cinema with the images and sounds enhanced so that everybody there especially the jurors will have no doubt that its you im sorry joey but youre there totally nude not a stitch do you remember it it was five years ago kyle ive worked hard to forget it but you do remember with great reluctance joey said yeah sure but there was no rape hell the sex was her idea thats not real clear on the video well the video is missing several important details first when the cops showed up that night we scattered baxter and i ran next door and ducked into thelos apartment where there was a smaller and quieter party elaine was there bombed as usual and having a good time we hung around for a few minutes waited for the cops to clear out then elaine tells me she wants to leave wants to go back to our place for a session as she liked to call it with baxter and me thats the way she was kyle always on the prowl she was the easiest lay at duquesne everybody knew it she was very cute and very easy i remember well i never saw a girl so promiscuous and so aggressive thats why we were stunned when she cried rape and its why the police lost interest exactly and theres something else another little detail not on the video the night before the party you and alan and some others went to a pirates game right yes elaine was in the apartment which was nothing new and we had a threeway me baxter and elaine twentyfour hours later same apartment same guys same everything she passes out wakes up decides she was raped i dont remember this it was no big deal until she cried rape baxter and i talked about it and decided to keep it quiet because she might claim we raped her twice so we buried it when the police started squeezing us we finally told them thats when they packed up and went home case closed no rape a small turtle stopped swimming by a log and seemed to stare at them they stared back and for a long time nothing was said do baxter and alan know about this joey finally asked no not yet it was hard enough telling you thanks for nothing im sorry i need a friend to do what i dont know right now i just need someone to talk to what do these guys want from you its very simple the scheme is to plant me as a spy in my law firm where i can extract all sorts of secrets that the other side can use to win a big lawsuit simple enough what happens if you get caught disbarred indicted convicted sentenced to five years in prison state not federal is that all bankrupted humiliated its a long list you need more than friends the turtle crawled onto the sand and disappeared into the roots of a dead tree wed better get back kyle said we gotta talk some more let me think about this well sneak away later they followed the river to the campsite the sun had dropped below the mountains and night was approaching quickly clem stoked the coals and added wood to the fire the crew gathered around and opened beers and the chatter began kyle asked if anyone had heard from baxter there was a rumor the family had locked him away in a highsecurity rehab unit but this had not been confirmed no one had heard from him in three weeks they told baxter stories for far too long joey was notably quiet obviously preoccupied you got girl trouble clem asked at one point naw just sleepy thats all by they were all sleepy the beer and sun and red meat finally caught up with them when clem finished his third long joke in a row with a lame punch line they were all ready for their sleeping bags kyle and joey shared a tent and as they were arranging two rather thin air mattresses clem yelled across the campsite be sure and check for snakes then he laughed and they assumed it was another attempt at humor ten minutes later they heard him snore the sound of the river soon put them all to sleep at am kyle checked his watch and saw the time after three rough weeks of bar review his nights were erratic the fact that he was essentially sleeping on the ground didnt help matters you awake joey whispered yes i assume you are too i cant sleep lets go talk they quietly unzipped the front tent fly and eased away from the campsite kyle led with a flashlight moving carefully watching for snakes the path led up to a rocky trail and after a few minutes of tentative hiking they stopped near a huge boulder kyle turned off the flashlight and their eyes began to focus in the darkness one more time joey said describe the video since it was seared into kyles memory he had no trouble replaying it exact times camera location angle the people involved the arrival of the police and the presence of elaine keenan joey absorbed it again without a word okay kyle he said finally youve lived with this since february youve had plenty of time to think right now i aint thinking real clear tell me what we should do the big decision has been made im officially employed by scully pershing and at some point ill get around to the dirty work but there are two things i want to know the first concerns elaine i know where she is but id like to know who she is now is she capable of dragging this up again or has she moved on does she have a life or is she living in the past according to bennie she has a lawyer and she still wants justice maybe so maybe not but id like to know the truth why because bennie is a liar by trade if shes still angry or if shes dreaming of squeezing money out of us especially baxter its important to know it could impact what i do at the law firm where is she she lives in scranton but thats all i know for about two thousand bucks we can hire a private investigator to do a background on her ill pay it but i cant arrange it myself because theyre watching and listening so you want me to do it yes but you have to be careful no phones or emails theres a reputable investigator in pittsburgh not too far from your office i give you the cash you give it to him he does the snooping gives us the report and nobody will know about it then what i want to know who bennie is and who he works for good luck its a long shot he might work for an opposing law firm or a client involved in a big lawsuit or he might work for some intelligence operation domestic or foreign if im being forced to spy i would like to know who im spying for thats too dangerous its very dangerous but it can be done how i havent got that far yet great and im guessing that ill be involved in this plan that has yet to be created i need help joey theres no one else i got a better idea why dont you just go to the fbi and tell them everything tell them this creep is trying to blackmail you into stealing secrets from your law firm oh ive thought of that believe me ive spent hours upon hours walking through that scenario but its a bad idea theres no doubt whatsoever that bennie will use the video hell send a copy to the pittsburgh police a copy to elaine and a copy to her lawyer with clear instructions on how to use it to inflict as much misery as possible on me you alan and especially baxter hell put it on the internet the video will become a big part of our lives you want blair to know about it no this guy is ruthless joey hes a professional a corporate spy with an unlimited budget and plenty of manpower to do whatever he wants he would watch us burn and have a good laugh probably from someplace where the fbi cant touch him a real prince youd better leave him alone im not doing anything stupid look joey theres an even chance that i can survive this ill do the dirty work for a few years and when im no longer useful bennie will disappear by then ive violated every ethic in the book and ive broken laws too numerous to mention but i havent been caught that sounds awful and indeed it did kyle listened to his own words and was hit again by the folly of it all and by the bleakness of his future they talked for two hours until the sky began to change and never once thought about returning to the tent it was cooler on the ridge the old joey would have jumped in with both feet looking for a fight this later version was much more cautious he had a wedding to think about a future with blair they had already bought a new condo together and joey without the slightest trace of embarrassment claimed that he was enjoying the decorating joey bernardo decorating breakfast was scrambled eggs with hot sauce and bacon with onions clem cooked over the fire while his crew broke camp and loaded the raft by eight oclock they were off floating leisurely on the new river headed nowhere in particular after a month in the city kyle savored the fresh air and open spaces he envied clem a good ole boy from the mountains who earned little and needed even less clem had worked these rivers for twenty years and loved every minute of it such an uncomplicated life kyle would trade with him in an instant the thought of returning to new york made him ill it was july the bar exam was in three weeks scully pershing was two months away chapter tuesday morning september sharp a hundred and three nicely dressed and quite apprehensive new associates congregated on the law firms fortyfourthfloor mezzanine for coffee and juice after signing in and receiving name tags they chatted nervously introduced themselves and looked for friendly faces at they began to file into the large meeting room and on the way in each was handed a fourinchthick notebook with the bold scully pershing gothic logo printed on the front it was filled with the usual information a history of the firm a directory pages and pages on firm policies health insurance forms and so on in the diversity section there was a breakdown of their class male female caucasian africanamerican hispanic asian other protestant catholic jewish muslim undeclared each member had a small blackandwhite photo with a oneparagraph bio the ivy league dominated but there was fair representation from other top schools such as nyu georgetown stanford michigan texas chicago north carolina virginia and duke there was no one from a secondtier school kyle sat with a group from yale and played with the numbers fourteen from harvard and though they were indistinguishable at the moment it would not be long before the rest of the class knew who they were five from yale none from princeton because princeton had never established a law school nine from columbia with associates at a starting salary of there was now more than million in fresh legal talent sitting in the room a lot of money but over the next twelve months each would bill at least two thousand hours at an hour the hours would vary but it was safe to say that the rookie class would generate at least million for the firm in the coming year these numbers were not in the binder but the math was easy other numbers were missing too of the percent would leave after the second year only percent would survive and make partner in seven or eight years the attrition was brutal but scully pershing did not care there was an endless supply of disposable labor even that of the harvard and yale variety at several older men entered the room and sat in chairs along the narrow stage the managing partner howard meezer stepped to the podium and began an elaborate welcoming speech one he had no doubt memorized from years of use after telling them how carefully theyd been chosen he spent a few minutes touting the greatness of the firm then he outlined the rest of the week the next two days would be spent in that room listening to various talks about all aspects of their new careers and life at good old scully pershing on wednesday they would spend a full day in computer and technology training on thursday they would break down into smaller groups and begin brief orientations in specialized fields the tedium was rapidly approaching the next speaker talked about compensation and benefits next was the firms librarian who spent a long hour on legal research a psychologist talked about stress and pressure and in a nice way told them to remain single as long as possible for those who were already married the top ten law firms in new york currently had a percent divorce rate among associates under the age of thirty the monotony of the lectures was broken by the tech team when they handed out shiny new laptops for everyone a lengthy tutorial followed once the laptops were warmed up the next technical adviser handed out the dreaded firmfone it was similar to most of the current smartphones on the market but it had been designed especially for the hardworking lawyers at scully pershing designed and built by a software and gadget company that the firm had taken public with great success a decade earlier it came with contact and biographical information for every lawyer in the firm in all thirty offices plus every paralegal and secretary almost five thousand people in new york alone the database included detailed summaries of all sp clients a small library of the most commonly used research recent state and federal appellate decisions and a registry of all new york and new jersey judges and court clerks the phone was equipped with highspeed internet access and a dizzying assortment of bells and whistles it was valuable and invaluable and if one was lost stolen or otherwise misplaced bad things would happen to its owner it was to be kept at hand twentyfour hours a day seven days a week until further notice in other words the fancy little firmfone now controlled their lives megafirm lore was replete with outrageous tales of cell phone and email abuse there were snide comments and soft groans from the crowd but nothing too loud none of the class clowns wanted to get too cute lunch was a quick buffet on the mezzanine the afternoon dragged on but interest remained high these were not boring law school lectures these were important the orientation ended at six and as they hurried out there was a lot of chatter about heading to the nearby bars on wednesday kyle passed his first test he and eleven others were assigned to the litigation practice group and led to a conference room on the thirtyfirst floor they were greeted by wilson rush the firms leading litigator and attorney of record for trylon aeronautics in its case against bartin dynamics though that lawsuit was not mentioned kyle had read so much background on mr rush he felt as though hed already met him the great man told a few war stories great trials from his illustrious career then hurried away no doubt off to sue another large corporation more thick notebooks were passed out and the next lecture was on the nuts and bolts of preparing lawsuits responses motions and other filings that either pushed litigation along or tried to bog it down forever the first gunner appeared there is at least one in every class whether its firstyear contracts in law school or a group of fresh recruits on wall street a gunner sits in the front row asks complicated questions sucks up to whoever happens to be at the podium works every angle cuts throats for better grades stabs backs to make law review interviews only at the toprated firms regardless of how bad their reputations might be and arrives at the firm with every intention of making partner before anyone else in his class gunners succeed magnificently most make partner his name was jeff tabor and they immediately knew where he was from because in the midst of his first question he managed to say well at harvard we were taught that not all known facts should be included in the initial lawsuit to which the fifthyear associate handling the lecture quickly retorted this aint kansas toto its our way or the highway everyone laughed but the gunner at pm on wednesday the twelve new litigation associates met at a threestar restaurant in midtown for what was supposed to be a nice dinner with doug peckham the partner who had supervised kyle the previous summer they waited in the bar and had a drink and at the first comment was made regarding doug and his tardiness all twelve had their firmfones in their pockets in fact each had two phones kyles old one was in the right pants pocket the firmfone was in the left at they began to debate the idea of calling mr peckham but decided against it then at he called kyle with a quick apology hed been in trial things had run late and he was now back at the office tending to some urgent matter the associates were to proceed with dinner and not worry about the bill the fact that a partner was working until pm on a wednesday night throttled the enthusiasm for a fine meal it also set the tone of the conversation as the wine flowed they began telling the worst associateabuse stories theyd heard the contest was won by tabor the gunner who when lubricated with alcohol was not the same asshole hed been throughout the day during a recruiting visit a year earlier tabor had dropped in on a friend hed known in college the friend was a secondyear associate with another megafirm and was perfectly miserable in his new profession his office was tiny and while they were chatting tabors friend tried to shove a sleeping bag under his desk out of view tabor ever curious had asked whats that for and as soon as he asked the question he knew the answer his friend sheepishly explained that he often found it necessary to catch a few hours of sleep during the night when he was overworked tabor pressed on and extracted the truth the firm was a lousy place to work most of the rookies were on the same floor and it was nicknamed the campsite on the ninetieth day of baxters recovery at washoe retreat walter tate entered the small conference room and shook hands with his nephew then he shook hands with dr boone baxters chief therapist walter had spoken with boone several times by phone but the two had not met baxter was tanned fit and in relatively good spirits he had gone ninety days with no booze or drugs the longest stretch in at least ten years under the direction of uncle wally he had reluctantly signed the paperwork that allowed the clinic to keep him locked away for up to six months now he was ready to leave uncle wally though was not so sure the meeting belonged to dr boone and he went through a rather wordy summary of baxters progress once properly dried out baxter had proceeded nicely through the initial stages of therapy he was aware of his problem on day he admitted he was an alcoholic and an abuser of drugs however he still would not admit to being physically addicted to cocaine his favorite at all times he had been cooperative with his counselors even helpful to other patients he exercised strenuously each day and became fanatical about his diet no coffee tea or sugar in short baxter had been a model of good behavior his rehab had been successful so far is he ready to be released uncle wally asked dr boone paused and stared at baxter are you he asked of course i am i feel great im enjoying the sober life ive heard this before baxter walter said the last time you stayed clean for what two weeks most addicts need more than one rehab dr boone added that was different baxter said it was only thirty days and i knew when i left that id start drinking again you cant stay clean in la walter said i can stay clean anywhere i doubt that you doubt me yes i doubt you you have a lot to prove son each took a breath and looked at dr boone it was time for judgment for the sentencing for a final word in this horribly expensive facility i want your frank opinion walter said dr boone nodded and without taking his eyes off baxter he began youre not ready youre not ready because youre not angry baxter you must reach a point where youre angry at your old self your old life your addictions you have to hate the way you were and when this hatred and anger consumes you then youll have the determination not to go back there i can see it in your eyes youre not a believer youll go back to la back to the same friends and then parties and then youll take a drink youll tell yourself that one drink is okay you can handle it no problem thats what happened before you start with a couple of beers then three or four and then it spirals down booze at first but the coke quickly follows if youre lucky youll come back here and well try again if youre unlucky youll kill yourself i dont believe this baxter said ive talked to the other counselors were all in agreement if you leave now theres a good chance youll screw up again theres no way then how much longer walter asked that depends on baxter we havent broken through yet because hes not angry at his old self dr boones eyes met baxters you still have this fantasy of making it big in hollywood you want to be famous a star lots of girls parties magazine covers big movies until you get that out of your system you cannot stay clean ill find you a real job walter said i dont want a real job see what i mean dr boone said pouncing youre sitting here now trying to talk your way out so you can hustle back to la and take up where you left off youre not the first hollywood casualty ive seen baxter ive been around the block a few times if you go back there youll be at a party within a week what if he goes somewhere else walter asked when hes finally discharged well certainly recommend a new place of residence away from his old friends of course theres booze everywhere but its the lifestyle that has to change what about pittsburgh walter asked oh hell no baxter said my familys in pittsburgh and look at them id rather die on skid row lets work here for another thirty days dr boone said then well reevaluate at a day walter had his limits what will you do for the next thirty days he asked more intensive counseling the longer baxter stays here the better his chances of success when he reenters reentry i love the term baxter said i cant believe youre doing this trust me baxter weve spent hours together and i know that youre not ready im so ready you dont know how ready i am trust me all right then lets meet again in thirty days walter said chapter the orientation dragged on through thursday and became as dull as most of the litigation files the new associates would soon be assigned to on friday they finally got around to the issue that had been conspicuously ignored the entire week office assignments real estate there was little doubt that their space would be cramped sparsely furnished and hidden from view and so the real question was how bad will it be litigation was concentrated on floors and and somewhere in there far away from the windows were cubicles with the new names mounted on small plates and stuck to the movable walls kyle was shown to his on the thirtythird floor his cube was divided into four equal shares by canvas partitions so that it was possible for him to sit at his desk talk quietly on the phone and use his laptop with some small measure of privacy no one could actually see him however if tabor to his right and dr dale armstrong to his left rolled their chairs back no more than two feet then they could see kyle and he could see them his desk had enough surface area for his laptop a legal pad the office phone and not much else a few shelves finished off the design scheme he noted that there was barely enough room for a man to unroll his sleeping bag by friday afternoon kyle was already tired of the firm dr dale was a female mathematics whiz whod taught at the college level before deciding for some reason to become a lawyer she was thirty single attractive unsmiling and frosty enough to be left alone tabor was the gunner from harvard the fourth member of their little cube was tim reynolds a penn man whod been eyeing dr dale since wednesday she did not seem at all interested among the torrent of firm policies and dos and donts that had been carped on all week the one that rang loudest was a strict prohibition against interoffice romances if a love affair blossomed then one of the two had to go if a casual affair was discovered there would be punishment though its exact nature was not spelled out in the handbook there was already a hot rumor that a year earlier an unmarried associate had been fired while the married partner whod been hounding her got sent to the office in hong kong a secretary was assigned to the four her name was sandra and she had been with the firm for eighteen long and stressful years she had once made it to the major leagues as an executive secretary for a senior partner but the pressure proved too much and she had slowly been demoted down through the minors all the way down to the rookie league where she spent most of her time holding the hands of kids who were just students four months earlier week one was finished kyle had not billed a single hour though that would change come monday he found a cab and headed for the mercer hotel in soho the traffic was slow so he opened his briefcase and pulled out the fedex envelope sent from a brokerage house in pittsburgh joeys handwritten note read heres the report not sure what it means drop me a line kyle found it impossible to believe that bennie could monitor the avalanche of mail in and out of scully pershing every day fifteen hundred lawyers cranking out paperwork because thats what they were supposed to do the mail room was larger than a smalltown post office he and joey had decided to play it safe with snail mail and overnight delivery the report had been prepared by a private security firm in pittsburgh it was eight pages long and cost its subject was elaine keenan now age twentythree who currently lived in an apartment in scranton pennsylvania with another female the first two pages covered her family education and employment history she attended duquesne for only one year and a quick check of her birth date confirmed that she was not quite eighteen when the episode occurred after duquesne she attended classes off and on at a couple of schools around erie and scranton but had yet to finish her degree during the previous spring semester she had taken some classes at the university of scranton she was a registered democrat with two campaign stickers on the rear bumper of her nissan which was titled in her name according to the available records she did not own any real estate firearms or stock in foreign banks there were two minor incidents with the law both involving underage drinking and both handled expeditiously by the courts the second scrape required counseling for alcohol and drug use her attorney had been a local female named michelin chiz better known as mike this was notable since elaine worked parttime in the law offices of michelin chiz associates ms mike chiz had a reputation as a fierce divorce lawyer always on the side of the wives and always ready to castrate wayward husbands elaines fulltime job was with the city of scranton as an assistant director of parks and recreation salary she had been employed there for almost two years before that she had bounced from one parttime job to another her living arrangement was not clear her roommate was a twentyeightyearold female who worked in a hospital also took classes at a local college had never been married and had no criminal record elaine was observed off and on for thirtysix hours after work the first day she met her roommate in the parking lot near a bar favored by the alternative crowd upon meeting the two roommates held hands briefly as they walked to the bar inside they joined three other women at a table elaine had a diet soda nothing stronger she smoked skinny brown cigarettes the women were very affectionate with each other and well the obvious became more obvious scranton had a womens shelter called haven and it advertised itself as a refuge and resource center for victims of domestic abuse and sexual assault it was nonprofit privately funded and staffed by volunteers many of whom claimed to have been victims elaine keenan was listed as a counselor on havens monthly newsletter a female employee of the security firm used a pay phone in downtown scranton called elaine at home claimed to be the victim of a rape and said she needed someone to talk to she was afraid to come forward for all sorts of reasons someone at haven had told her to call elaine they talked for almost thirty minutes during which time elaine admitted that she too was the victim of a rape and that the rapists more than one had never been brought to justice she was eager to help and they agreed to meet the following day at havens office the entire conversation was recorded and of course no meeting occurred the next day still the victim kyle mumbled to himself in the back of the cab the night kyle had sex with her about a month before the alleged rape hed been in his own bed sound asleep when she crawled under the sheets naked and quickly got what she wanted the cab was at the mercer he returned the report to an inside pocket of his briefcase paid the driver and entered the hotel bennie was in a room on the fourth floor waiting as usual with his customary purpose and appearing to have been there for hours they did not exchange pleasantries so how was the first week bennie asked great a lot of orientation i got assigned to litigation kyle said as if hed done something to be proud of he had succeeded already very good news excellent any sign of the trylon case no we havent been near a real case we start work monday this week was just the warmup of course they give you a laptop bennie asked yes what kind im sure you already know no i do not the technology changes every six months id like to see it i didnt bring it bring it next time ill think about it what about a phone a blackberry something like that id like to see it i didnt bring it but the firm requires you to keep it on at all times is this not true true then why dont you have it for the same reason i didnt bring the laptop because you want to see them and youre not going to see them until im ready they are of no value to you at this point and so the only reason you want them is to make sure im compromised right bennie as soon as i give something to you then ive broken the law violated the ethics and you own me im not stupid bennie were going slow here we reached an agreement many months ago kyle have you forgotten you have already agreed to break the law violate the ethics do whatever i want you to do you will find the information and give it to me and if i want something from the firm then its your job to get it now i want the phone and i want the laptop no not yet bennie walked back to the window after a long pause he said baxter tate is in rehab you know i know for some time now thats what i hear maybe hell clean up and get a life bennie turned and walked to within striking distance you need a reminder kyle of who is in charge here if you dont follow my orders then ill provide a little reminder right now im giving serious consideration to releasing the first half of the video plaster it around the internet notify all the folks who might find it interesting have some fun with it kyle shrugged its just a bunch of drunk college kids right no big deal but do you really want it out there kyle for the whole world to see what would your new colleagues think at scully pershing theyll probably think i was just another stupid drunk college kid like many of them when they were younger well see bennie picked up a thin file from the credenza opened it and pulled out a sheet of paper with a face on it you know this guy he asked handing it to kyle who glanced at it and shook his head no white male age thirty coat and tie at least from the shoulders up names gavin meade four years now at scully pershing litigation one of about thirty associates toiling away on the case of trylon versus bartin in the normal course of things youd probably meet him in a few weeks but mr meade is about to be sacked kyle was holding the sheet of paper looking into the handsome face of gavin meade and wondering what sin hed committed seems he too has a little problem from the past bennie was saying relishing the role of executioner seems he too liked to get rough with the girls not rape though i didnt rape anybody and you know it maybe not got another video bennie been crawling through the gutter again looking for someone else to ruin nope no video just some affidavits mr meade doesnt rape women he just beats them in college ten years ago he had a girlfriend who had a problem with bruises one night he put her in the hospital the police were finally invited in things unraveled for mr meade he was arrested jailed formally charged and facing trial then there was a settlement money changed hands the girl wanted no part of a trial and everything was dropped meade walked away but hes got this record now no problem he just lied about it when he applied to law school at michigan he lied on his application when he went through the background check at scully he lied again automatic termination im so happy for you bennie i know how much these little stories mean to you go get him ruin him attaboy everybody has secrets kyle i can ruin anyone youre the man kyle slammed the door and left the hotel at noon on saturday three charter buses pulled away from the scully pershing office building and left the city they carried all members of the firstyear associate class on board each bus was a full bar and plenty of snacks and the drinking was fast and serious three hours later they arrived at a yacht club in the hamptons the first party was under a tent near montauk beach dinner was under another tent on the hotel grounds the second and last party was at the mansion of one of the scully descendants a reggae band played by the pool the retreat was designed to break the ice and make the recruits happy theyd come on board many of the firms partners were there and they got as drunk as the associates the night went long and the morning was not pleasant after an early brunch with gallons of coffee they settled in a small ballroom to listen to the wise old men offer their secrets to a successful career several retired partners legends at the firm told war stories and cracked jokes and offered advice the floor was open and any question could be asked after the old goats were gone a very diverse panel went to the front and continued with the storytelling a black man a white woman a hispanic and a korean all partners talked about the firms commitment to tolerance and equal rights and so on later in the day they ate shrimp and oysters on a private beach then the buses were reloaded and headed back to manhattan they arrived after dark and the weary young lawyers headed home for a short night for them the concept of exhaustion was about to be redefined chapter any hope of pursuing meaningful work was promptly crushed at monday morning when all twelve new litigation associates were sent into the abyss of document review as far back as the first year of law school kyle had heard horror stories of bright and eager young associates being marched into some dreary basement chained to a desk and given a mountain of densely worded documents to read and while hed known that his first year would include a generous dose of this punishment he simply wasnt prepared for it he and dale who was looking better by the day but showing no signs of a personality were assigned to a case involving a client that was being hammered in the financial press their new boss for the day a senior associate named karleen called them into her office and explained things for the next few days they would review some crucial documents billing at least eight hours a day at an hour that would be their rate until the bar results were made known in november and assuming they passed their hourly rate would jump to there was no thought given to a quick word about what might happen if they did not pass the bar exam scully pershing associates posted a pass rate of percent the previous year and it was simply assumed that everyone had passed eight hours was the minimum at least for now and with lunch and coffee thrown in that meant roughly a tenhour day start no later than am and nobody ever thought about leaving before pm in case they were curious karleen billed twentyfour hundred hours last year she had been with the firm for five years and acted as though she were a lifer a future partner kyle glanced around her wellappointed office and noticed a diploma from columbia law school there was a photo of a younger karleen on a horse but none of her with a husband boyfriend or children she was explaining that there was a chance that a partner might need kyle or dale for a quick project so be prepared document review was certainly not glamorous but it was the safety net for all new associates you can always go there and find work that can be billed karleen said eight hours minimum but there is no max how delightful thought kyle if for some reason ten hours a day were not enough the door to document review was always wide open for more their first case involved a client with the slightly ludicrous name of placid mortgage ludicrous in kyles opinion but he kept his mouth shut as karleen rattled off the more salient facts of the case starting in when a new wave of government regulators took over and adopted a less intrusive attitude placid and other huge home mortgage companies became aggressive in their pursuit of new loans they advertised heavily especially on the internet and convinced millions of lower and middleclass americans that they could indeed afford to buy homes that they actually could not afford the bait was the old adjustablerate mortgage and in the hands of crooks like placid it was adjusted in ways never before imagined placid sucked them in went light on the paperwork collected nice fees up front then sold the crap in the secondary markets the company was not holding the paper when the overheated real estate market finally crashed home values plummeted and foreclosures became rampant karleen used much softer language in her summary but kyle had known for some time that his firm was representing placid hed read a dozen stories about the mortgage meltdown and seen the name scully pershing mentioned often always in defense of placids latest setback now the lawyers were trying to clean up the mess placid had been battered by lawsuits but the worst one was a class action involving thirtyfive thousand of its former borrowers it had been filed in new york a year earlier karleen led them to a long dungeonlike room with no windows a concrete floor poor lighting and neat stacks of white cardboard boxes with the words placid mortgage stamped on the end it was the mountain kyle had heard so much about the boxes as karleen explained contained the files of all thirtyfive thousand plaintiffs each file had to be reviewed youre not alone karleen said with a fake laugh just as both kyle and dale were about to resign we have other associates and even some paralegals on this review she opened a box pulled out a file about an inch thick and went through a quick summary of what the litigation team was looking for someday in court she said gravely it will be crucial for our litigators to be able to tell the judge that we have examined every document in this case kyle assumed it was also crucial for the firm to have clients who could pay through the nose for such useless work he was suddenly dizzy with the realization that in just a few short minutes he would punch in and begin charging an hour for his time he was worth nothing close to that he wasnt even a lawyer karleen left them there her heels clicking on the polished concrete as she hustled out of the room kyle gawked at the boxes then at dale who looked as stunned as he did you gotta be kidding he said but dale was determined to prove something so she grabbed a box dropped it on the table and yanked out some files kyle walked to the other end of the room as far away as possible and found himself some files he opened one and glanced at his watch it was scully lawyers billed by tenths a tenth of an hour is six minutes twotenths is twelve and so on one point six hours is an hour and thirtysix minutes should he roll back the clock two minutes to and therefore be able to bill twotenths before the hour of eight or should he stretch his arms take a sip of coffee get more situated and wait until to begin his first billable minute as a lawyer it was a nobrainer this was wall street where everything was done with aggression when in doubt bill aggressively if not the next guy will and then you wont catch him it took an hour to read every word in the file one point two hours to be exact and suddenly he had no reluctance in billing placid for hours or for the review not long ago say about ninety minutes he found it hard to believe he was worth an hour he hadnt even passed the bar now though he had been converted placid owed him the money because their sleaze had gotten them sued someone had to plow through their debris he would aggressively bill the company out of revenge down the table dale worked diligently without any distraction somewhere in the midst of the third file kyle paused long enough to ponder a few things still on the clock he wondered where the trylonbartin room was where were the highly classified documents and how were they protected what kind of vault were they stored in this dungeon appeared to be securityfree but then who would spend money to protect a bunch of mortgage files gone bad if placid had dirty laundry you could bet it wasnt buried where kyle might find it he thought about his life here in the third hour of his professional career he was already questioning his sanity what manner of man could sit here and pore over these meaningless pages for hours and days without going bonkers what did he expect the life of a firstyear associate to be would it be any better at another firm dale left for ten minutes and returned probably a bathroom break he bet she kept the meter running lunch was in the firm cafeteria on the fortythird floor much had been made about the high quality of the food great chefs consulted the freshest ingredients used a dazzling menu of light dishes and so on they were free to leave the building and go to a restaurant but few associates dared the firms policies were prominently published and distributed but there were many unwritten rules one was that the rookies ate inhouse unless a client could be billed for a real lunch many of the partners used the cafeteria as well it was important for them to be seen by their underlings and to brag about the great food and most important to eat in thirty minutes as an example of efficiency the decor was art deco and nicely done but the ambience was still reminiscent of a prison mess hall there was a clock on every wall and you could almost hear them ticking kyle and dale joined tim reynolds at a small table near a vast window with a spectacular view of other tall buildings tim appeared to be shellshocked glazed eyes vapid stare weak voice they swapped stories of the horrors of document review and began joking about their departures from the legal profession the food was good though lunch was not about eating lunch was now an excuse to get away from the documents but it didnt last long they agreed to meet after work for a drink dales first sign of life then headed back to their respective dungeons two hours later kyle was hallucinating and flashing back to the glory days at yale when he edited the prestigious law journal from his own office and managed dozens of other very bright students his long hours led to a product an important journal that was published eight times a year and read widely by lawyers and judges and scholars his name was first on the masthead as editor in chief few students were so honored with such a title for one year he was the man how had he fallen so fast and so hard its just part of the boot camp he kept telling himself basic training but what a waste placid its shareholders its creditors and probably the american taxpayers would get stuck with the legal fees fees being racked up in part by the nowhalfhearted efforts of one kyle mcavoy who after reviewing nine of the thirtyfive thousand files was convinced that his firms client should be locked away in prison the ceo the managers the board of directors all of them you cant jail a corporation but an exception should be made for every employee who ever worked at placid mortgage what would john mcavoy think if he could see his son kyle laughed and shuddered at the thought the verbal abuse would be funny and cruel and at that moment kyle would accept it without firing back at that moment his father was either in his office counseling a client through a problem or in a courtroom mixing it up with another lawyer regardless he was with real people in real conversations and life was anything but dull dale was seated fifty feet away with her back to him it was a nice back as far as he could tell trim and curvy he could see nothing else at the moment but had already examined the other parts slim legs narrow waist not much of a chest but then you cant have everything what would happen he reckoned if he slowly over the next few days and weeks put the move on her he was successful and he made sure they got caught hed be bounced from the firm which at that moment seemed like a great idea what would bennie say about that an ugly involuntary dismissal from scully pershing every young man has the right to chase women and if you get caught well so what at least you got fired for something worthwhile bennie would lose his spy his spy would get the boot without getting disbarred interesting of course with his luck there would probably be another video this one of kyle and dale and bennie would get his dirty hands on it and well who knows kyle mulled these things over at an hour he didnt think about turning off the meter because he wanted placid to bleed he had learned that dale earned a phd in mathematics at the age of twentyfive from mit no less and that she had taught for a few years before deciding that the classroom was boring she studied law at cornell why she thought she could make the transition from the classroom to the courtroom was not clear at least not to kyle right now a class of struggling geometry students would seem like a parade she was thirty years old never married and he had just begun the task of trying to unravel her withdrawn and complicated personality he stood to go for a walk something to get the blood pumping into his stultified brain you want some coffee he asked dale no thanks she said and actually smiled two cups of strong coffee did little to stimulate his mind and by late afternoon kyle began to worry about permanent brain damage to be on the safe side he and dale decided to wait until pm before checking out they left together rode the elevator down without a word both thinking the same thought they were violating another of the unwritten rules by leaving so early but they shook it off and walked four blocks to an irish pub where tim reynolds had secured a booth and was almost finished with his first pint he was with everett a firstyear from nyu whod been assigned to the commercial real estate practice group after they sat down and got themselves situated they pulled out their firmfones all four were on the table much like loaded guns dale ordered a martini kyle ordered a club soda and when the waiter disappeared tim said you dont drink no i had to quit in college it was kyles standard line and he knew all of the followups it would provoke you had to quit yep i was drinking too much so i quit rehab aa all that stuff everett asked no i saw a counselor and he convinced me that the drinking would only get worse i went cold turkey and have never looked back thats awesome tim said as he drained the pint of ale i dont drink either dale said but after today im hitting the bottle from someone with absolutely no sense of humor this declaration was quite funny after a good laugh they settled into a rehash of their first day tim had billed hours reading the legislative history of an old new york law aimed at discouraging class action lawsuits everett had billed hours reading leases but kyle and dale won the game with their descriptions of the dungeon and its thirtyfive thousand files when their drinks arrived they toasted placid mortgage and the foreclosures it had precipitated they toasted tabor who had vowed to stay at his desk until midnight they toasted scully pershing and its wonderful beginning salaries halfway through the martini the gin hit dales mushy brain and she began giggling when she ordered a second kyle excused himself and walked home at on tuesday kyle was wrapping up his second day in the dungeon and mentally drafting his letter of resignation he would happily tell bennie to go to hell and he would happily face elaine and her rape claim in a courtroom in pittsburgh anything would be better than what he was enduring he had survived the day by continually repeating the mantra but theyre paying me a year but by he didnt care what they were paying him his firmfone pinged with an email from doug peckham and it read kyle need some help my office now if possible he forgot his letter of resignation jumped to his feet and bolted for the door to dale he said as he dashed by gotta run see doug peckham a litigation partner hes got a project if this sounded cruel then so be it if it was boasting he didnt care she looked shocked and wounded but he left her there all alone in the placid dungeon he ran down two flights of stairs and was out of breath when he walked through peckhams open door the partner was on the phone standing fidgeting and he waved kyle into a fine leather chair across from his desk when he signed off with a youre a moron slade a true moron he looked at kyle forced a smile and said so hows it going so far document review nothing else needed to be said sorry about that but we all suffered through it look i need a hand here you up to it peckham fell violently into his chair and began rocking thrusting himself back and forth without taking his eyes off kyle anything right now ill shine your shoes theyre shined gotta case here in the southern district of new york a big one were defending barx in a class action filed by some folks who took their heartworm pills and eventually croaked big messy complicated case thats raging in a number of states we go before judge cafferty on thursday morning you know him ive been here two days kyle almost blurted i dont know anybody no caffeine cafferty hes got some chemical imbalance that keeps him up all night and all day and when hes off his meds he calls up lawyers and screams at them because the cases are moving so slowly when hes on his meds he yells too but doesnt swear as much anyway his schedule is called the rocket docket because he moves things along good judge but a real pain in the ass anyway this case has dragged on and now hes threatening to send it to another jurisdiction kyle was scribbling notes as fast as possible at the first break in the narrative he said heartworms actually its a drug that eats away plaque in the major blood vessels including the left and right ventricles from a medical point of view its complicated and nothing you should worry about we have two partners with medical degrees handling that aspect of the case four partners total as well as ten associates im lead counsel he said this with far too much smugness then he jumped to his feet and lumbered over to the window for a quick look at the city his white starched shirt was oversized and did a nice job of hiding his bulbous physique bennies summary had been typically to the point peckhams first marriage broke up thirteen months after he joined scully pershing fresh out of yale his current wife was a lawyer who was a partner in a firm down the street she too worked long hours there were two small children their apartment on the upper west side was appraised for million and they owned the obligatory house in the hamptons last year doug earned million his wife million he was regarded as a top litigator whose specialty was defending big pharmaceuticals though he rarely went to trial six years earlier he was on the losing end of a major case involving a painkiller that caused suicides at least in the opinion of the jury scully pershing sent him to a spa in italy for a twoweek treatment cafferty wants to get rid of the case he said stretching a sore back we of course will fight that but truthfully i would rather see it in another jurisdiction there are four possibilities duval county florida downtown memphis a rural county in nebraska called fillmore or des plaines illinois your mission should you choose to accept it is to research these four jurisdictions he fell into his chair again and began rocking i need to know what juries do there what are the verdicts how do big companies fare in these places now there are several jury research outfits that sell their data and we subscribe to all of it but its not always accurate lots of numbers but not a lot of useful info you gotta dig and dig you gotta call lawyers in these four places and find the dirt are you in kyle as if he had a choice sure sounds great i wouldnt call it great i need this by thursday morning have you pulled an allnighter yet no ive only been here for right right well get to work memo form but nothing fancy well meet here at on thursday with two other associates youll have ten minutes to do your summary anything else not right now ill be here until ten tonight so zip me a note if you need something thanks and thanks for getting me out of document review what a waste the desk phone was ringing as kyle hustled out of the office he went straight to the cube grabbed his laptop and raced off to the firms cavernous main library on the thirtyninth floor there were at least four smaller libraries scattered throughout but kyle had yet to find them he could not remember being so excited over a research project it was a real case with deadlines and an angry judge and strategic decisions in the air the memo he was about to prepare would be read and relied on by real lawyers in the heat of battle kyle almost felt sorry for the poor rookies left behind in document review but he knew hed be back there soon enough he forgot dinner until almost pm when he ate a cold sandwich from a machine while reading jury research with no sleeping bag at hand he left the library at midnight there were at least twenty associates still there and took a cab to his apartment he slept four hours then made the thirtyminute walk back to broad street in only twentytwo minutes he was not about to start gaining weight the firms private gym on the fortieth floor was a joke because it was eternally empty a few of the secretaries used it during lunch but no lawyer would be caught dead there his meter began promptly at am by he was calling trial lawyers and defense lawyers in duval county florida in and around jacksonville he had a long list of cases that had gone to trial and he planned to talk to every lawyer he could get on the phone the more calls he made the longer the list became lawyers in florida memphis and western tennessee lincoln and omaha and dozens in the chicago area he found more cases and more trials and called more lawyers he tracked every barx trial in the past twenty years and compared their verdicts there was no word from doug peckham no text message or email on the firmfone always lying on the table next to the legal pad kyle was delighted to be given such free rein such discretion dale sent an email and asked about lunch he met her in the cafeteria for a quick salad at pm she was still imprisoned in the placid tomb but mercifully three other rookies had been sent in to help with the grunt work all three were thinking about quitting she seemed genuinely pleased that someone she knew had been given a real task save me some placid files kyle said as they left the cafeteria ill be back tomorrow he left the library at midnight on wednesday after billing barx for eighteen hours six the day before he added two more early thursday morning as he polished up the fifteenpage memo and rehearsed his tenminute presentation to peckham and a team of senior associates at precisely he approached the partners door and saw that it was closed hes expecting me at seven thirty he said politely to a secretary ill let him know she said without making a move toward the phone five minutes passed as kyle tried to settle his nerves and appear calm he had a knot in his stomach and there was sweat around his collar why he kept asking himself its just a brief presentation before a friendly audience were on the same team right ten minutes fifteen he could hear voices in peckhams office finally the door was opened by one of the associates and kyle walked in peckham appeared surprised to see him oh yes kyle i forgot he said snapping his fingers and frowning i shouldve emailed the hearings been postponed youre off the hook keep the memo i might need it later kyles mouth fell open and he glanced around two associates were huddled over a small worktable papers everywhere and two more were seated near the desk all four seemed to be amused the false deadline kyle of course had heard of this little maneuver the hapless associate is run through the grinder to produce a useless memo or brief that is time sensitive but will never be used but the client will nonetheless get billed and will pay so even though the research is not needed it is at least profitable kyle had heard of the false deadline but didnt see this one coming uh sure no problem he said backtracking thanks peckham said as he flipped the page of another document see you later sure kyle was at the door when peckham asked say kyle wheres the best place for barx to try the case nebraska fillmore county kyle said eagerly two of the associates laughed out loud and the other two were highly entertained one of them said nebraska no one tries cases in nebraska thanks kyle peckham said patronizing nice work and please get out of here for a year plus treats the job would naturally have its moments of humiliation youre getting paid for this kyle kept repeating as he slowly made his way up the stairs take it in stride be tough happens to everyone back in the dungeon he managed to smile when dale asked how did it go he said its hard to say at the far end of the room two associates were plowing through mortgage files kyle nodded at them then parked himself near dale arranged his pen legal pad and firmfone he opened a box removed a file and reentered the world of placid mortgage it was known territory and he felt oddly safe there he would not be harmed or humiliated a long career as a document reviewer would no doubt be dull but it would also be much less hazardous than that of a litigator chapter when kyle left the office late friday afternoon he considered his first week to be a success though a dismal one he billed placid thirty hours and barx biomed twentysix and though virtually all of this valuable time would eventually mean little to either client he wasnt paid to worry about such things he was there to do one thing bill if he kept up the pace and managed only fifty hours a week he would hit twentyfive hundred for the year a high number for a firstyear and one that would catch the attention of the higherups for the week tabor the gunner billed fifty hours dale fortyfour tim reynolds fortythree it was amazing how consumed they were with the clock after only five days on the job he walked to his apartment changed into jeans stuffed a phone in each pocket and headed for the ballpark the mets were at home against the pirates who were already guaranteed another losing season with seventeen games to go the mets were in first place two games ahead of the phillies and primed for another choke in the stretch kyle had paid cash for two tickets sold by a broker recommended by a paralegal at the firm as he made his way to shea stadium he picked up his surveillance as it was picking up him his seat was fifteen rows behind the thirdbase dugout the night was hot the mets were in first the place was packed he timed his entrance perfectly and sat down just as the first pitch was thrown in the bottom of the first to his right was a young boy holding a baseball glove and eating ice cream to his left was a real fan with a mets cap mets jersey blue and orange sweatbands even goofy mets eyeglasses under the cap and behind the glasses was joey bernardo who had spent his entire life in pittsburgh and hated the mets almost as much as he hated the phillies do not acknowledge me kyle said as he watched the field dont worry right now i hate your guts and i hate the mets almost as much as i hate you thanks i like the glasses can i take them off i cant see a damned thing no they were talking out of the corners of their mouths just loud enough to hear each other shea was alive with every pitch and there was little chance of being overheard joey took a sip of a tall beer are they really following you oh yes every day everywhere do they know that you know i dont think so but why basic espionage tradecraft of course information is crucial the more they watch and listen the more they know about me if they know what i eat drink wear watch listen to and who i talk to and hang out with and where i like to shop and browse and sneak away to then they might one day be able to use it all to their advantage sounds pretty dull to you and me but not to these guys more beer as joey absorbed this a ball bounced off the leftfield wall scoring a run and the crowd was on its feet kyle and joey acted like all the other fans when things had settled down kyle continued for example ive found this wonderful little store in midtown that sells all sorts of spy gadgets tiny cameras hidden mikes phonetapping devices and some hightech stuff that the military has left behind its run by a couple of misfits who claim to be excia but then people who are really excia dont talk about it i found the store online at the office not at the apartment and ive been there twice when i was able to shake surveillance i might need the store one day but if the goons knew i had discovered the place they would really be interested this is too weird a lady in front of joey turned around and offered a curious glance they did not speak for the rest of the first inning how about the report on elaine joey whispered it worries me so whats next i think you should go see her no way its easy just bump into her and see what happens right drive to scranton a town i cant recall seeing in the past ten years somehow find her recognize her assume shell recognize me then what have a friendly little chat about the last time we were together have a laugh for old times sake hell kyle she accused me of rape shhhh kyle hissed softly the word rape sort of hung in the thick air but no one reacted to it sorry joey whispered and they watched the game for a long time a ferocious argument erupted at first base after a close call and all fifty thousand fans had an opinion in the roar kyle said it would be an interesting meeting to see how she reacts will she talk to you is she bitter angry full of vengeance you take the high road and say that the encounter has always troubled you that you want to talk about it see if shell meet you for a drink and a serious conversation youre not going to admit anything you just want to see how she feels maybe you want closure whats there to lose what if she recognizes me pulls out a gun and bam ill take care of blair kyle managed this with a grin though the thought of spending any more time with joeys girl was not pleasant thanks shes pregnant you know thanks for asking why is she pregnant basic biology but were both surprised congratulations daddy getting married is one thing but im not so sure about this fatherhood business i thought her career was at full throttle yep me too she said she was on the pill but i dont know this was not a topic kyle wanted to explore the more they talked the easier conversation became and that was not wise im going to the restroom kyle said bring me a beer no i dont know you remember come on kyle you think someone here is watching you with binoculars at least two of them they followed me here probably bought tickets from a scalper outside the gates and now theyre watching but why basic surveillance joey im a valuable asset yet they dont trust me you should read some spy novels thats your problem too much fiction kyle took his time between innings he visited the mens room then bought a diet soda and peanuts when he returned to his seat he struck up a conversation with the kid on his right a loyal met fan who knew every player and all their stats his father was in advertising and kyle managed to seem intrigued with that career he cracked peanuts scattered the hulls at his feet and ignored joey for a long time joey still halfblinded by the oversized mets eyeglasses suffered in silence the pirates were down four runs after four innings and he was ready to leave kyle eventually reshifted and began studying the scoreboard in center field any word from baxter he said without moving his jaws nothing i think theyve locked him in a cave i know the feeling ive been in a dungeon all week i dont want to hear it for the money theyre paying you no complaints okay okay they know that hes in rehab and they probably know where he is kyle said as a long fly ball was caught on the warning track they the goons their leader told me last week that hes in rehab how often do you meet with this guy too often have you handed over any secrets nope i have not been compromised joey sipped his beer swallowed slowly and with the cup in front of his mouth said if they know about baxter are they keeping tabs on me its possible play it safe vary your movements be careful with all correspondence oh this is just great my apartment is full of cameras and mikes they come and go when they wish i dont have an alarm system dont want one but i know when theyve been there everything i do in my apartment is subject to being watched and recorded but they dont know that i know so i give them nothing of consequence so youre outsmarting these professional intelligence agents i think so another long pause in the conversation as the pirates changed pitchers again whats the endgame kyle i dont have one im taking small safe steps next we make contact with the girl and see how bad things are there pretty bad id guess lets see kyle reached for his vibrating pocket and yanked out the firmfone he scrolled down found the message and felt like cursing what is it joey asked trying not to look at the phone its a partner hes got a project wants me at the office at seven in the morning tomorrows saturday kyle just another day at the office are these guys crazy no just greedy during the seventhinning stretch kyle eased out of his seat and made his way to the gates joey stayed until the eighth and finally he left as his beloved pirates were losing their ninetieth game jeans were allowed on saturdays and sundays the fact that there was a dress code for the weekend however relaxed said much about the practice of corporate law on wall street why were they even there kyle wore jeans as did dale who looked spectacular in a pair of tight ones tim reynolds wore starched khakis all three were dazed at the reality of being in a small conference room on the thirtyfourth floor at am on the second saturday of their fledgling careers they joined four older associates four young men kyle had not had the pleasure of meeting or even seeing during his first two weeks on the job passing introductions were made but only because they were expected the partner who had called the meeting was nowhere to be seen his name was tobias roland toby behind his back and of all the sizzling gossip kyle had heard so far the worst had been about toby toby stories were abundant and very few were even remotely flattering yale undergrad columbia law poor kid from a rough neighborhood with a gigantic chip on his shoulder brilliant ruthless conniving hed made partner in only five years primarily because he worked harder than the rest of the workaholics and never relaxed his idea of time off was a tenminute tryst with a secretary on the sofa in his office most secretaries were terrified of him too frightened to complain or file suit some though found him sexy enough for a quick romp for fun he berated young associates often cursing them in the foulest of language for the smallest of infractions he intimidated the other partners because he was smarter and always better prepared at the age of fortyfour he was the topproducing billing litigator in the firm and had not lost a jury trial in eight years toby was in demand by the inhouse lawyers of many major corporations a year earlier kyle had read and clipped an article in fortune touting the greatness of scully pershings fanciest litigator when toby beckoned you went running albeit with a great deal of trepidation in his place that morning was a senior associate named bronson who as he explained without a trace of enthusiasm was standing in for mr roland who was just down the hall working on another aspect of the lawsuit at hand he might pop in at any moment and this prospect kept everyone wide awake their client was a major oil company that was about to be sued by a dutch firm over some disputed reserves in the gulf of mexico the lawsuit was expected to be filed in new orleans but mr roland had decided to file a preemptive lawsuit in new york the plan was to file it first thing monday morning it was an ambush a daring tactic that could backfire the type of risky maneuver that toby was famous for after a few minutes of listening to a lawsuit described in terms reminiscent of the dday invasion kyle realized that his saturday and sunday were shot to hell and would be spent researching jurisdictional issues in the law library he glanced at his firmfone scrolled down through the emails and something caught his eye at on a saturday morning the firm was sending an email to all lawyers announcing the resignation of gavin meade a fourthyear associate in litigation no details no comments nothing but a quiet and quick exit everybody has secrets bennie said how did he do it perhaps an anonymous package mailed to someone in human resources affidavits police records the works poor meade ten years removed from his crime and hustling through the grind at a year when suddenly he gets a summons to a meeting with closed doors bronson was rattling on about being the hub of a wooden wheel with spokes running down and out to the seven associates below him and several running upward to mr roland and the other litigation partners at the hub he bronson would direct traffic between the big boys and the rookies he would organize the work supervise the research and handle correspondence with the partners everything crossed his desk time was crucial if word leaked the dutch firm and its lawyers might do all sorts of evil things the nations oil supply hung in the balance perhaps even western civilization off they went to the library chapter after a series of phone calls that became more and more tense a deal was finally reached dr boone and uncle wally acquiesced but managed to keep one string attached baxter would leave early but spend three nights in a halfway house in reno before reentry into the real world a hundred and five days after arriving sloppy drunk with a blood alcohol content of and with significant residues of cocaine in his system baxter rode through the gates and left behind the safety of the washoe retreat he was squeakyclean and ten pounds lighter and not only had he kicked booze and drugs he had also quit smoking he was fit tanned and clearheaded and thoroughly believed he had conquered his demons and would henceforth live the sober life he was armed for battle with the teachings of dr boone and the other counselors he had confessed his sins and surrendered to a higher power whatever and whoever that was at the age of twentyfive he was beginning a new life and baxter was both proud and apprehensive even frightened as the miles passed he found himself more uncomfortable his confidence was rapidly disappearing he had failed so many times in so many ways it was a family tradition was it in his dna an orderly drove him from the clinic in the nightingale mountains into reno a twohour drive in which little was said as they approached the city they passed a splashy billboard advertising an imported beer in a cold green bottle the slinky young woman holding it could entice any man to do almost anything fear hit baxter harder it consumed him and beads of sweat lined his forehead he wanted to turn around to run back to the clinic where there was no alcohol and no temptations but he said nothing hope village was in a rundown section of reno abandoned buildings cheap casinos and bars it was the domain of brother manny the founder pastor and leader of hope village he was waiting at the curb outside the churchs front door when baxter stepped onto the hot sidewalk he grabbed baxters hand and shook it violently mr tate may i call you baxter the question suggested its own answer he was baxter not mr tate sure baxter said his spine stiffened from this physical assault im brother manny he said placing his thick left arm on baxters shoulder completing a rather rough howdy do welcome to hope village he was about fifty hispanic bronze skin gray hair pulled back tightly into a long ponytail that fell to his waist warm eyes big toothy smile a small scar beside his left nostril and a larger one on his right cheek his face was adorned with a soft white goatee that had been pampered for many years another escapee from washoe retreat he said with a deep melodious voice how is the good dr boone doing up there fine baxter said brother mannys nose was about five inches from his close contact obviously did not bother him but it made baxter uncomfortable he sends his regards a fine man come ill show you around we have you for just three nights as i understand thats right they began walking slowly brother manny kept one arm across baxters shoulders he was a large man with a thick barrel chest and he wore dungarees and a white linen shirt top two buttons open with a long tail left out so that it swept behind him sandals no socks the church had once belonged to an affluent white congregation that fled to the suburbs as baxter shuffled through the tour he also got the backstory manny lucera had found the lord during his second term in prison armed robbery the proceeds from which were meant to buy drugs for personal consumption and upon his parole he was led by the spirit to reno to start his ministry seventeen years ago and the lord had blessed him mightily the church had grown and now housed a shelter for the homeless in the basement a soup kitchen that fed anyone who showed up a community center for the poor kids in the neighborhood an intake center for women and children fleeing abusive men and there were plans for an orphanage the old buildings next door had been purchased and renovated the complex was crawling with people employees volunteers street people and they almost bowed in deference when they saw brother manny they parked themselves on a picnic table in the shade and sipped canned lemonade whats your drug manny asked coke booze but i didnt say no to anything baxter admitted after fifteen weeks of baring his soul to people who already knew everything he did not hesitate to tell the truth for how long started slow when i was about fourteen picked up steam as i got older im twentyfive now so eleven years where are you from pittsburgh originally background privileged brother manny issued the questions and absorbed the answers with such ease that after fifteen minutes together kyle felt as though he could chat for hours and tell him everything first rehab second i did every drug you can imagine and some youve never heard of for twenty years i bought sold smuggled and manufactured drugs i got knifed four times shot three and went to prison twice for drugs i lost my first wife and two children because of drugs and alcohol i lost my chance for an education i lost eight years because of prison i almost lost my life i know all about addictions because ive been there im a certified drug and alcohol counselor and i work with addicts every day are you an addict yes bless you brother do you know christ i guess my mother took me to church every christmas brother manny smiled and slowly wiggled his large rear end off the table let me show you your room its not the ritz but itll do the homeless shelter was a large basement room with a temporary partition dividing it women on one side men on the other it was open with rows of army surplus cots in neat lines most of these people work during the day theyre not bums brother manny was saying theyll start drifting in around pm heres your room near the showers there were two small private rooms with nicer cots and portable fans brother manny opened the door to one and said you can have this one its for a supervisor to get a private room you must have a job so youll help with the dinner preparation then later when everybodys tucked in youll help with security he uttered these definitive statements in such a way that any thought of protest was immediately cut off and out of the question baxters world was spinning hed begun the day in the cushy confines of a fourstar rehab ranch and done so with giddy thoughts of finally leaving now he was in the hot basement of an old church that was home to fiftytwo of the poorest souls in america and he was expected to live with them for the next three days and to cook their meals and break up their fights baxter tate of the pittsburgh tate dynasty bankers blue bloods who lived in mansions handed down from one miserable generation to the next proud and arrogant people who married into other similar clans thus producing even shallower gene pools how had he reached this point in his young life legally he could leave anytime he wanted hit the door find a cab never look back there was no court order restraining him uncle wally might be disappointed but that would be the extent of baxters worries if he fled are you okay brother manny asked no it was refreshing to be so honest take a nap you look pale he couldnt sleep because of the heat after an hour he sneaked away and found himself roaming downtown reno he had a late lunch in a diner his first burger and fries in months he had the money to get a hotel room for a day or two and that plan consumed him as he zigzagged through the streets he passed and repassed the casinos hed never been a gambler but every casino had a bar didnt it of course the bars were offlimits but he couldnt stomach the thought of returning to hope village at least not now at a blackjack table he pulled out five bills got some green chips and played the game for a few minutes an aging cocktail waitress swept by asked what he wanted to drink a bottle of water he said without hesitation then patted himself on the back the only other player at the table was a cowboy black hat and all with a bottle of beer in front of him baxter drank his water played his hands and occasionally glanced at the bottle of beer it looked so harmless so beautiful when his chips had been taken by the dealer he left the table and wandered around the casino floor it was a dreadful place sparsely filled with people who had no business being there gambling with money they could not afford to lose he walked by a sports bar with wide screens showing old football games the weekends point spreads were posted the bar was empty he settled onto a stool and ordered water what would dr boone say about this not six hours into reentry and he was already at a bar relax dr boone its just water if i can resist the urge here at ground zero then the next place will be easy he sipped water and occasionally glanced at the rows of liquor bottles why were there so many different shapes and sizes so many different types of spirits one entire row was taken by flavored vodkas delicious liquids he had consumed by the barrel back in the days when he was a drunk thank god those days were over in the distance across the floor somewhere a siren squealed and bells erupted a lucky slot player had hit a jackpot and the racket was to remind everyone just how easy it was to win the bartender filled a glass with a draft beer then slammed it in front of baxter on the house he proclaimed super slot jackpot free drinks for everyone at the bar which was nobody but baxter he almost said hey pal take it away i dont drink anymore but the bartender was gone plus it would sound silly how many nondrinkers sidle up to a casino bar at three oclock in the afternoon the glass was frosty the beer icecold it was darker in color and baxter looked at the tap nevada pale ale one hed never tried his mouth was dry so he sipped water for days hed been hammered by dr boone and the other pros at washoe retreat into believing that another drink would eventually lead him back to his addictions hed watched and listened as other patients or guests as they were called struggled through detox and told their stories of repeated failures dont ever be fooled they warned repeatedly you cannot handle a single drink total abstinence is required maybe so small bubbles of water formed on the glass then began to run down to the napkin under it he was twentyfive years old and he never truly believed not even in his purest moment back at washoe that he would live the rest of his life without a drink somewhere deep down in his soul he knew he could find the willpower to have a drink maybe a couple then stop for the night before things got out of hand if he planned to drink why not start now the last time he tortured himself for fourteen days before breaking down for two weeks he lied to himself and especially to his friends about loving the life of sobriety and every single moment he craved a drink why go through the misery again the beer was getting warm he heard the voices of his counselors he remembered the tears and confessions of the other guests he heard himself proclaim the gospel of the sober i am an alcoholic weak and powerless in need of strength from a higher being and they were weak those other losers back at washoe retreat but not baxter he could handle a few drinks because he was stronger he rationalized that he would under no circumstances succumb to the romance and horror of cocaine nor would he indulge in hard liquor just a little beer occasionally and he might get serious about wine no big deal still he could not make himself reach forward and touch the glass it was eighteen inches away well within his grasp just standing there like a coiled rattler ready to kill then it was a luscious treat that delivered a pleasant buzz back and forth back and forth evil versus good you need to make new friends dr boone had said repeatedly and you cant go back to your old haunts find some new places new friends new challenges a different place to live well how about this dr boone sitting here for the very first time in a rundown reno casino he couldnt remember the name of never been here before haha both hands were free and at some point baxter realized his right hand was shaking slightly and his breathing was labored and heavy you okay buddy the bartender asked as he walked by yes no baxter nodded something but couldnt speak his eyes were locked on the glass of beer where was he what was he doing six hours after leaving rehab he was in a bar brawling with himself over whether he should take another drink he was already a loser look where he was with his left hand he reached forward touched the glass then slid it slowly toward him he stopped when it was six inches away he could smell the barley and hops the glass was still cold or cold enough the war shifted from good versus evil to run versus stay he almost managed to shove himself away from the bar and sprint back through the slots to the front door almost oddly it was keefe who helped him make the decision keefe was his best friend at washoe and keefe was from a wealthy family that was paying for the third rehab the first two tanked when keefe convinced himself that a little pot was harmless baxter whispered to himself if i drink this beer now and if things turn out badly i can always go back to washoe and with two failures ill be convinced that total abstinence is required just like keefe but right now i really want this beer with both hands he clasped the glass raised it slowly sniffing as it grew closer he smiled when the cold glass touched his lips the first sip of nevada pale ale was the most magnificent nectar hed ever tasted he savored it eyes closed face serene from over his right shoulder someone yelled loudly there you are baxter he almost choked and he almost dropped the glass he jerked around and there was brother manny closing fast and obviously not happy what are you doing he demanded as he lowered a heavy hand on baxters shoulder and seemed ready to trade punches baxter wasnt sure what he was doing he was drinking a beer one that was definitely offlimits but he was so horrified at the moment he couldnt speak brother manny delicately took the glass and slid it down the bar get rid of this he growled at the bartender then he sat on the stool next to baxter and moved in low until his nose was once again five inches away listen to me son he said in a soft voice i cannot make you leave this place right now that is your decision but if you want me to help you then say so ill get you out of here take you back to my church make some coffee and well tell some stories baxters shoulders sagged and his chin dropped the ale was still attacking his taste buds this could be the most important decision of your life brother manny said right now at this moment stay or go if you stay youll be dead in five years if you want to go then say so and well leave together baxter closed his eyes and said im so weak yes but im not let me get you out of here please brother manny practically lifted him off the stool then put a thick arm around his shoulders they slowly made their way past the slot machines and empty roulette wheels and they were almost to the front door when brother manny realized that baxter was crying the tears made him smile an addict must hit the bottom before he starts his climb the pastors office was a large cluttered room next to the sanctuary the secretary brother mannys wife brought them a pot of strong coffee and two mismatched mugs baxter sat low in an old leather sofa and sipped furiously as if he could rinse away the taste of the beer the tears had stopped for now brother manny sat close by on a wooden rocker and as he talked he moved slowly back and forth i was in prison in california he was saying the second time around in a gang doing worse stuff on the inside than we did on the streets i got careless one day got away from my turf and the rival gang jumped me woke up in the prison hospital with broken bones and cuts and such cracked skull terrible pain i remember thinking death would be welcome i was so sick of living sick of my life sick of the miserable person i was i knew that if i survived and one day got paroled again id end up on the streets playing the same game where i grew up you either went to prison or you died young sounds very different from the way you grew up doesnt it baxter he shrugged in many ways it is in many ways it is not my life was all about myself much like yours i loved the bad things just like you pleasure selfishness pride that was my life and its been yours i suppose oh yes its all sin and it all leads to the same end misery pain destruction ruin then death thats where youre headed son and youre in a hurry to get there baxter nodded slightly so what happened i got lucky and lived and not long afterward i met an inmate a career criminal who would never be eligible for parole and he was the gentlest sweetest happiest person id ever talked to had no worries every day was beautiful life was grand and this from a man whod spent fifteen years in max security through a prison ministry hed been exposed to the gospel of christ and he became a believer he said he was praying for me as he prayed for a lot of the bad guys in prison he invited me to a bible study one night and i listened to other inmates tell their stories and praise god for his forgiveness and love and strength and promise of eternal salvation imagine a bunch of hardened criminals locked away in a rotten prison singing songs of praise to their lord pretty powerful stuff and i needed some of it i needed forgiveness because there were lots of sins in my past i needed peace because id been at war my entire life i needed love because i hated everybody i needed strength because deep inside i knew how weak i was i needed happiness because id been miserable for so long so we prayed together me and those bad boys who were like little lambs and i confessed to god that i was a sinner and that i wanted salvation through jesus christ my life changed in an instant baxter a change so overwhelming i still cant believe it the holy spirit entered my soul and the old manny lucera died a new one was born one whose past was forgiven and his eternity secured what about the drugs forgotten the power of the holy spirit is far greater than human desire ive seen it a thousand times with addicts who try everything to quit rehab clinics state facilities shrinks and doctors fancy meds sold as substitutes when youre an addict youre powerless in the face of booze and drugs strength comes from somewhere else for me it comes from the power of the holy spirit i dont feel very strong right now youre not look at yourself from washoe retreat to a cheap bar in a rundown casino in a few hours that might be a record baxter i didnt want to go to that bar of course not but you did why his voice was soft fading because youve never said no a tear rolled down baxters cheek and he wiped it with the back of his hand i dont want to go back to la you cant son can you help me im pretty shaky here okay i mean im really scared lets pray together baxter ill try chapter six months after the trylonbartin dispute went public with the filing of the lawsuit the battleground had been defined and the troops were in place both sides had filed ponderous motions designed to capture the higher ground but so far no advantage had been gained they were of course haggling over deadlines schedules issues discovery and who got to see what documents and when with the waves of lawyers working in sync the case was plodding along a trial was nowhere in sight but then it was far too early with monthly billings to trylon averaging million why push the case to a conclusion on the other side bartin dynamics was paying just as much for a vigorous and goldplated defense coordinated by the bareknuckle litigators at agee poe epps ape had committed forty lawyers to the case and like scully had such a deep bench that it could send in another wave whenever necessary the hottest issue so far was no surprise to either set of litigators when the forced marriage of trylon and bartin unraveled when their clumsy joint venture blew up there had been a virtual slugfest for the documents hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of documents had been generated during the development of the b hypersonic bomber researchers employed by trylon grabbed all the documents they could researchers for bartin did the same software was routed and rerouted and some of it was destroyed hardware controlled by one company found its way to the other thousands of secured files disappeared crates of printed documents were hoarded and hidden and throughout the melee each company accused the other of lying espionage outright thievery when the dust settled neither knew exactly what the other possessed because of the supersensitive nature of the research the pentagon watched in horror as the two companies behaved outrageously the pentagon as well as several intelligence agencies leaned heavily on trylon and bartin to keep their dirty laundry private but they were ultimately not successful the fight was now controlled by the lawyers and the courts a major task for mr wilson rush and his scully pershing team was to accumulate index copy and store all documents in the possession of trylon a warehouse was leased in wilmington north carolina about a mile from the trylon testing facility where most of the b research had taken place after it was leased it was completely renovated and made fire wind and waterproof all windows were removed and replaced with a sixinch cinderblock wall a washington security firm wired the warehouse with twenty closedcircuit cameras the four large doors were equipped with infrared alarms and metal detectors armed guards patrolled the empty warehouse long before any of the documents arrived when they did arrive they came in unmarked tractortrailer rigs complete with more armed guards dozens of deliveries were made over a twoweek period in midseptember the warehouse nicknamed fort rush came to life as ton after ton of paperwork was stacked neatly in white cardboard boxes all waiting to be organized into a system understood only by the lawyers up in new york the warehouse was leased by scully pershing every contract was signed by wilson rush contracts for the renovations security operations transporting of documents everything once the documents entered the warehouse they were deemed awp attorneys work product and thus subject to a different set of rules regarding disclosure to the other side mr rush selected ten associates from his litigation team ten of the brightest and most trusted these unlucky souls were shipped to wilmington and introduced to fort rush a long windowless hangar of a building with shiny concrete floors and a pungent industrial smell to it in the center was the mountain of boxes along both sides were rows of empty folding tables and beyond the tables were ten large fiercelooking copy machines with wires and cables running everywhere the copiers were of course stateoftheart color and capable of instant scanning collating even stapling far away from their new york offices the associates were allowed to wear jeans and running shoes and they were promised bigger bonuses and other goodies but nothing could compensate them for the dismal job of physically copying and scanning a million documents and in wilmington most were married with spouses and children back home though of the ten four had already suffered through a divorce and it was quite likely that fort rush would be the cause of even more marital problems they began their forbidding task under the direction of mr rush himself every document was copied twice in a split second and instantly scanned into the firms virtual library several weeks down the road when the task was complete the library would be accessible by a secured code and once inside a lawyer could locate any document in a matter of seconds the firms computer experts designed the library and were supremely confident that its security was impenetrable to impress upon the associates the gravity of their seemingly mindless work mr rush stayed for three days and was involved in the unpacking sorting scanning copying and repacking when he left two other litigation partners remained and directed traffic such mundane work was normally contracted out to a copying service and supervised by the firms litigation support staff but that was far too risky with these documents they had to be handled by real lawyers who appreciated their importance the real lawyers manning the copiers averaged about in salary and most had at least one degree from an ivy league school at no point in their graduate or postgraduate studies could they have pictured themselves running copiers but after four or five years with scully pershing they were shockproof the rotation began after the first week eight days in the warehouse then four days in new york then back to wilmington the assignments were staggered and a total of fifteen associates were eventually used all were forbidden to discuss any aspect of fort rush with anyone in new york security and confidentiality were paramount the first project took six weeks two point two million documents were copied indexed and added to the library the associates were freed from fort rush and flown back to new york on a chartered jet by then bennie knew exactly where the warehouse was located and had a general idea of its security features but his interest in these matters was only passing what bennie wanted of course was access to the virtual library access only his spy could deliver chapter for another the security firm in pittsburgh watched elaine keenan long enough to determine her daily routine she usually had lunch with some coworkers at a sandwich shop not far from the parks and recreation complex where she worked a chance encounter would have to be believable and joey couldnt sell the idea of bumping into her in the lesbian bar she and her roommate occasionally frequented he wasnt sure he could sell any encounter with elaine aside from the casual sex five and a half years earlier hed never really known her she had been one of several groupies around the beta fraternity and hed tried to forget all of them the security firm provided three color photos joey had studied them for hours and was not convinced hed ever met the girl kyle however had studied them and claimed to recall her vividly now at the age of twentythree her dark hair was tinted a deep red and worn very short there was no makeup no lipstick nothing but matching tattoos around her forearms if she had any interest in being attractive it was not apparent somewhere under all the attitude was a cute girl but sex appeal was unimportant joey swallowed hard cursed kyle again and entered the sandwich shop he eased behind her as she waited in line to order and after a few minutes as the line moved slowly forward managed to bump into her sorry he quickly said with a wide fake smile she smiled back but said nothing he moved a step closer and said hey you were at duquesne a few years ago werent you her two coworkers glanced back but were not interested briefly she said eyeing him carefully searching for any clue he snapped his fingers as if trying to recall something elaine right cant think of the last name thats right and who are you joey bernardo i was in beta a look of horror swept over her face and she dropped her gaze to the floor for a moment she was frozen unable to speak ready it seemed to erupt then she shuffled a step to keep pace in line she turned her back on the man who once raped her a man who walked away from the crime not only unpunished but completely vindicated joey watched her from the corner of an eye and felt uneasy for several reasons first she was obviously frightened by him but since she considered herself the victim and him the rapist this was not surprising it was also uncomfortable being this close to someone hed once had sex with regardless of how casual or how uneventful it now seemed she turned halfway to him and hissed what are you doing here im eating lunch same as you would you please leave her voice was barely audible but one of her coworkers turned around and glared at joey no im just getting a sandwich nothing else was said as they ordered and moved down to the pickup counter elaine hurried off to a distant table and ate quickly with her two friends joey ate alone at a small table near the front door the note was already prepared it read elaine id like to talk to you about what happened please call my cell at ill be in scranton until tomorrow joey bernardo he hauled his tray back to the counter then walked to her table handed her the note without a word and disappeared two hours later she called at pm sharp as agreed joey returned to the sandwich shop he found elaine at the same table shed used for lunch but instead of sitting with a couple of friends she was accompanied by her attorney icy introductions were made and joey sat down across from them with a knot in his throat and a strong desire to maim kyle mcavoy where the hell was kyle anyway he was the lawyer elaines lawyer was an attractive middleaged woman everything was black pantsuit thick coral necklace boots eye shadow and worst of all her mood this woman went for the throat the business card joey was holding and glancing at proclaimed her to be michelin mike chiz attorney counselor at law she began matteroffactly my first question for you mr bernardo is what are you doing here how many questions do you have joey asked in his finest smartass manner he had been assured time after time by his psuedolawyer and near codefendant one kyle mcavoy that there was no danger in this chance meeting with elaine keenan any legal action she wanted to initiate could have been commenced long ago five and a half years had passed well mr bernardo may i call you joey there was almost no chance that she would allow him to call her mike so he abruptly said no very well mr bernardo i have just a few questions i have represented ms keenan here for some time now she actually works parttime in my office a fine paralegal and im familiar with her story now what are you doing here first of all i dont have to explain a damned thing to you but ill try to be nice at least for the next sixty seconds i work for a brokerage firm in pittsburgh and we have some clients in scranton im here to see these clients i got hungry around noon today i chose this fourstar restaurant at random walked in saw ms keenan here said hello she freaked i wanted to chat and now im taking questions from her lawyer why exactly do you need a lawyer elaine you raped me joey elaine blurted you and baxter tate and maybe kyle mcavoy by the time she finished her eyes were moist her breathing was heavy almost heaving as if she might lunge at him at any moment maybe this maybe that you never got your story straight why did you want to talk to my client ms chiz demanded because it was a misunderstanding and i wanted to apologize for the misunderstanding thats all after she cried rape we never saw her again the cops investigated found nothing because nothing happened and by then elaine had disappeared you raped me joey and you know it there was no rape elaine we had sex me and you you and baxter you and most of the other boys at beta but it was all very consensual elaine closed her eyes and began shaking as if chills swept her body why does she need a lawyer joey asked ms chiz shes suffered greatly i dont know how much shes suffered ms chiz but i do know that she suffered very little during her days at duquesne she was too busy partying to spend time suffering lots of booze drugs and sex and there are lots of boys and girls perfectly capable of refreshing her memory youd better get to know your client before you pursue some bogus legal action theres a lot of bad stuff back there shut up elaine snarled you want to apologize to her the lawyer said yes elaine i apologize for the misunderstanding whatever the hell it was and i think you should apologize for accusing us of something that did not happen and right now i want to apologize for even being here joey sprang to his feet this was not a good idea so long he walked quickly out of the deli strolled to his car and left scranton driving back to pittsburgh when he wasnt cursing kyle mcavoy he was hearing her voice again and again you raped me joey her words were painful and free of doubt she may not have known precisely what happened in their apartment fiveandahalf years earlier but she certainly knew now he hadnt raped anyone what began as consensual sex at her suggestion nonetheless had now been transformed into something far different at least in her mind if a girl consents to sex can she change her mind once things are underway or if she consents to sex then blacks out halfway through the act how can she later claim shed changed her mind difficult questions and joey wrestled with them as he drove you raped me joey the mere accusation carried a heavy dose of suspicion and for the first time joey questioned himself had he and baxter taken advantage of her four days later kyle stopped by the mail room at scully pershing and picked up a letter from joey it was a detailed summary of the encounter complete with their choice of sandwiches and a description of elaines hair color and matching tattoos after setting out the facts joey offered his opinions ek has definitely convinced herself that she was raped by several of us jb and bt for sure and maybe km she is weak fragile emotionally unstable haunted but at the same time carries a certain smugness in her victimhood she has chosen the right attorney a tough broad who believes in her and would not hesitate to start legal trouble if she could find any evidence her finger is on the trigger if that little video is half as damaging as you say it is then by all human means keep it locked away from these people elaine and her lawyer are two cobras pissed and coiled and ready to strike he finished with im not sure what my next little project might be but id rather not go near elaine again i dont like being called a rapist the entire episode was unnerving plus i had to lie to blair to get out of town i have two tickets to the steelersgiants game on october shall i call you with this news so your goons will know about it i really think we should go to the game and hash out our next moves your faithful servant joey kyle read the letter and summary in the main library while hiding between shelves of ancient law books it confirmed his worst fears but he had little time to dwell on it he quietly tore the sheets of paper into a hundred pieces then dropped them in a wastebasket as he left the library immediately destroy all written correspondence hed instructed joey the hotel nearest his apartment was the chelsea garden a fifteenminute walk at eleven that night kyle dragged himself along seventh avenue looking for the hotel had he not been so exhausted he might have enjoyed the cool autumn night with leaves sweeping across the sidewalk and half the city still awake and going somewhere but kyle was numb with fatigue and capable of only one thought at a time and that was often too much bennie was in a suite on the third floor where hed been waiting for two hours because his asset couldnt get away from the office but bennie didnt mind his asset belonged at the office and the more time he spent there the quicker bennie could get on with his work regardless though bennie opened up with a nasty youre two hours late sue me kyle stretched out on the bed this was their fourth meeting in new york since kyle had moved there and he had yet to hand over anything that bennie wasnt supposed to have his ethics were still intact no laws had been broken so why did he feel like such a traitor bennie was tapping a large white poster board mounted on an easel if i could have your attention please he said this wont take long i have some coffee if youd like kyle wasnt about to concede an inch he jumped to his feet poured coffee in a paper cup and sat on the edge of the bed go this is the trylon team as it is now assembled at the top here is wilson rush and below him are eight litigation partners mason bradley weems cochran green abbott etheridge and wittenberg how many have you met kyle studied the eight squares with the names scrawled inside them and thought for a second wilson rush spoke to us during orientation but i havent seen him since i did a memo for abbott on a securities case met him briefly and i had lunch one day in the cafeteria with wittenberg ive seen bradley weems maybe etheridge but i cant say ive met them its a big firm kyle was still amazed at the unknown faces he encountered every day in the halls and elevators the cafeteria and libraries and coffee rooms he tried to socialize and at least say hello but the clock was always ticking and billing was much more important his supervising partner was doug peckham and he was relieved peckhams name was not on the board there were a bunch of smaller squares under the partners bennie tapped an index finger near them there are sixteen senior associates and under them another sixteen younger ones the names are in that binder over there you need to memorize them sure bennie kyle glanced at the binder this one a twoinch blue one the last three were black and thicker then he studied the names on the board how many of these associates have you worked with five six maybe seven he said with no effort at being accurate how would bennie know whom hed worked with and how bennie knew the names of all fortyone lawyers assigned to the trylon case was a question kyle didnt even want to consider a few of the names would appear in the court file but only the big boys how many sources did he have he pointed to a smaller box this is a senior associate named sherry abney you met her no a rising star fast track to partnership two degrees from harvard and a federal clerkship she reports to partner mason whos in charge of discovery under her is a secondyear associate by the name of jack mcdougle mcdougle has a cocaine problem no one at the firm knows it but hes about to get busted so everybody will know it his departure will be quick kyle stared at the box with mcdougles name and thought of so many questions he didnt know where to start how did bennie know this and you want me to take his place i want you to schmooze it up with sherry abney check her out get to know her shes thirty years old single but committed to an investment banker at chase who works as many hours as she does so they have no time for any fun no wedding date as of now at least nothing that has been announced she likes to play squash when she can find the time and as you know the firm has two courts on the fortieth floor beside the gym you play squash i guess i do now kyle had played several times at yale not sure when ill find the time you figure it out she just might be your entrée onto the trylon team go team go kyle planned to avoid trylon and its litigation team as diligently as possible small problem here bennie kyle said nice homework but youre missing the obvious there are no firstyear grunts anywhere near this case a couple of reasons first we dont know anything five months ago we were still in law school and second the smart boys at trylon probably told their lawyers to keep the rookies away from this case that happens you know not all of our clients are stupid enough to pay an hour for a bunch of kids to stick it to them so bennie where is plan b it takes patience kyle and politics you start angling for the trylon case networking with the upper associates kissing the right asses and we might get a lucky break kyle wasnt finished with the discussion about mcdougle he was determined to pursue it when another man suddenly appeared from the sitting room adjacent to the bedroom kyle was so startled he almost dropped the halffilled cup of coffee this is nigel bennie was saying hell spend a few minutes on systems nigel was in his face thrusting forward a hand to shake a pleasure he sang in a cheery british way he then moved to the tripod and mounted his own display the sitting room was twelve by twelve kyle looked through the open double doors into it nigel had been hiding in there and listening to every word scully pershing uses a litigation support system called jury box he began quickly all movements were rapid and precise british but with a strange accent forty years old five feet ten inches pounds short dark hair half gray eyes brown no remarkable features but slightly elevated cheekbones thin lips no eyeglasses how much have they taught you about jury box nigel wanted to know the basics ive used it on several occasions kyle was still reeling from nigels unexpected appearance its your typical litigation support system all discovery is scanned into a virtual library that can be accessed by all lawyers working on the case quick retrieval of documents superquick search of keywords phrases contract language anything really youre up to speed yes its fairly secure pretty standard stuff these days and like all smart law firms scully also uses a more secure system for sensitive files and cases its called barrister you in on this one no not surprised they keep it quiet works pretty much like jury box but much harder to access or to hack into keep your ears open for it kyle nodded as if he would do precisely as he was being told since february on that awful night when hed been ambushed after a youthleague basketball game on the cold streets of new haven he had met only with bennie wright or whoever he really was he had assumed without really thinking about it that bennie as his handler would be the only face of the operation there were other faces to be sure in particular a couple of the street pounders who followed him night and day and whod made enough mistakes so that kyle could now spot them but it had not occurred to him that he would actually be introduced to someone else with a bogus name who worked for the operation and why was he bennie was certainly capable of handling nigels little presentation and then you have the trylon case nigel was singing a completely different matter im afraid much more complicated and secure whole different batch of software really probably written just for this one lawsuit got the docs locked up in a warehouse down south with uzis at every door but weve made progress he stopped long enough to allow himself a quick approving smile at bennie arent we clever we know that the program is codenamed sonic as in b hypersonic bomber not very creative if you ask me but then they didnt did they haha sonic cannot be accessed by the nice little laptop they gave you greenies on day one no sir no laptop can have a peek at sonic nigel bounced to the other side of the tripod there is a secret room on the eighteenth floor of your building heavily secured mind you with a bank of desktop computers some really fancy stuff and there is where you will find sonic pass codes change every week passwords every day sometimes twice a day must have the proper id before logging in and if you log out without quitting to a tee theyll write you up and maybe show you the door show me the door kyle almost said sonic is probably a bastardized version of barrister so it will be incumbent upon you to master barrister as soon as youre given the opportunity cant wait kyle almost said slowly through the shock and the fatigue it was sinking in that kyle was crossing the line and doing it in a way he had not envisioned his nightmare was to walk out of scully pershing with secrets he was not supposed to have and deliver them like judas to bennie for thirty pieces of silver now though he was receiving firm secrets from an outside source he had yet to steal anything but he damned sure wasnt supposed to know about sonic and the hidden room on the eighteenth floor perhaps it wasnt criminal and maybe it wasnt a violation of the canons of ethics but it certainly felt wrong thats enough for now bennie was saying you look exhausted get some rest oh thank you back on seventh avenue kyle glanced at his watch it was almost midnight chapter at am the usual hour now the alarm clock exploded at full volume and kyle slapped it twice before it shut off he hurried through the shower and the shave and fifteen minutes later he was on the sidewalk fashionably dressed because he could certainly afford fine clothes his life had quickly become a harried fatigued mess but he was determined to look nice as he stumbled through the day he bought a coffee a bagel and a copy of the times at his favorite allnight deli then caught a cab at the corner of twentyfourth and seventh ten minutes later hed finished breakfast scanned the newspaper and gulped half the coffee he walked into the broad street entrance of his office building at on schedule regardless of the hour he was never alone during the elevator ride up there were usually two or three other blearyeyed and gauntfaced associates all sleep deprived all avoiding eye contact as the elevator hummed and rocked gently upward and they asked themselves several questions what was i thinking when i chose law school how long will i last in this meat grinder what fool designed this method of practicing law there was seldom a word because there was nothing to say like prisoners riding to the gallows they chose to meditate and put things in perspective at the cube kyle was not surprised to see another young lawyer tim reynolds had been the first to sneak in a sleeping bag a new thermally insulated eddie bauer special that he claimed hed owned for years and taken all over the country but it had a new smell to it tim without shoes tie shirt or jacket and wearing an old tshirt was partially curled under his small desk inside the sleeping bag dead to the world kyle kicked his feet woke him up and began with a pleasant you look like crap good morning tim said scrambling to his feet and reaching for his shoes what time is it six ten what time did you go to sleep i dont remember sometime after two he was pulling on his shirt quickly as if a dreaded partner might appear any second and issue demerits i have a memo due for toby roland at seven and i have no idea what im doing just keep billing kyle said without a trace of sympathy as he unpacked his briefcase and pulled out his laptop tim finished dressing and grabbed a file ill be in the library he said already a wreck dont forget to brush your teeth kyle said when reynolds was gone kyle went online to a web site called quickfacecom there were several sites that allowed amateur sleuths to put together composite sketches of faces and kyle had studied them all quickface was by far the most detailed and accurate he began with nigels eyes always the most important feature get the eyes right and half the identification is over the site offered over two hundred different types of eyes every race color origin and blend kyle went through them quickly found the closest set and began his face nose thin and pointed eyebrows moderately thick and a bit long down the sides lips very thin cheekbones higher and wider chin not long but very flat no dimple ears oval and stuck close to the skull after he added the hair he went back to the eyes tried another pair then another the ears were too high so he lowered them he tinkered and sculpted until a half hour unbilled and wasted unless he chose to pad a bit during the day and when nigel was properly put together and easily identified from forty feet away kyle printed the face and hustled off to the library carrying a thick file because everyone carried a thick file into the library his private spot was a dead end in a dark corner on the third level of stacked tiers a lonesome place where they stored thick tomes of annotations no one had used in decades on the second shelf from the bottom he lifted three of the books and removed an unmarked manila envelope lettersized he opened it and pulled out three other composites a splendid rendering of his archenemy bennie and two others of the goons who were stalking him around new york city to his knowledge he had not been within fifty feet of them and had never made eye contact but hed seen both on several occasions and was confident that his artwork was at least a decent starting point the addition of nigels dreadful face to the collection did nothing to improve its overall attractiveness he hid the envelope and returned to the cube where tabor the gunner was busy making his usual noisy preparations for the day the issue of whose career held the most promise had been settled weeks earlier tabor was the man the star the fasttracked partnertobe and everyone else could get out of the way hed proven his talents by billing twentyone hours in a single day hed shown his skill by billing more the first month than all other litigation rookies though kyle was only four hours behind he volunteered for projects and worked the cafeteria like an old irish ward boss slept in the library last night he said as soon as he saw kyle good morning tabor the carpet in the main library is thinner than the carpet in the twentythird library did you know that kyle i much prefer sleeping on the twentythird but it does have more noise which do you prefer were all cracking up tabor yes we are tim used his sleeping bag last night for what he and dr dale finally getting it on dont know about that i woke him up an hour ago so you went home slept in your own bed oh yes well i have two projects due at noon today both extremely important and urgent and i cant afford the luxury of sleep youre the greatest tabor go superman and with that tabor was gone dale armstrong arrived promptly at seven her usual time and though she looked a bit sleepy she was put together as always evidently the bulk of her fat salary was being spent on designer clothing and kyle along with tim and tabor looked forward to the daily fashion statement you look great today kyle said with a smile thank you prada dolce gabbana killer shoes blahniks jimmy choo five hundred bucks dont ask admiring her each day kyle was quickly learning the names of the high priests of female clothing it was one of the few topics she cared to discuss after six weeks of shared space in the cube he still knew very little about her when she talked which was not very often it was always about law firm business and the miserable life of a firstyear associate if there was a boyfriend he had yet to be mentioned she had dropped her guard twice and agreed to drinks after work but she usually declined and while every rookie was openly grousing about the hours and the pressure dale armstrong seemed to be feeling the strain more than most what are you doing for lunch kyle asked i havent had breakfast yet she replied coolly and withdrew into her little section of the cube chapter the lights in the shelter came on each morning at six and most of the homeless awoke and began making preparations for another day the rules did not allow them to stay past eight oclock many had jobs but those who didnt were expected to be on the streets looking for employment brother manny and his staff were very successful in placing their friends even if the work was often parttime and minimum wage breakfast was served upstairs in the fellowship hall where volunteers manned the small kitchen and prepared eggs toast oatmeal and cereal and it was served with a smile a warm good morning for everyone and a quick prayer of thanks once they were all seated brother manny a notorious late sleeper preferred to delegate the earlymorning duties at his compound for the past month the kitchen had been organized and supervised by baxter tate a smiling young man whod never boiled water in his previous life baxter scrambled eggs by the dozen toasted loaves of white bread prepared the oatmeal real not instant and also restocked the supplies washed the dishes and he baxter tate often said the prayer he encouraged the other volunteers had a kind word for everyone and knew the names of most of the homeless he graciously served after they had eaten he loaded them into three old church vans drove one himself and delivered them to their various jobs around reno he picked them up late in the afternoon alcoholics anonymous met three times each week at hope village monday and thursday nights and at noon on wednesday baxter never missed a meeting he was warmly received by his fellow addicts and quietly marveled at the groups compositions all races ages male and female professionals and homeless rich and poor alcoholism cut a wide jagged path through every class every segment there were old confident drunks who boasted of being sober for decades and new ones like himself who freely admitted that they were still afraid they were comforted though by the veterans baxter had made a mess of his life but his history was a cakewalk compared to that of some of the others their stories were compelling often shocking especially those of the exconvicts during his third aa meeting with brother manny watching from the rear he walked to the front of the group cleared his throat and said my name is baxter tate and im an alcoholic from pittsburgh after he uttered those words he wiped tears from his cheeks and listened to the applause following the twelve steps to recovery he made a list of all the people he had harmed and then made plans to make amends it wasnt a long list and was heavily focused on his family he did not however look forward to a return to pittsburgh hed talked to uncle wally the family knew he was still sober and that was all that mattered after a month he began to grow restless he did not relish the thought of leaving the safety of hope village but he knew the time was coming brother manny encouraged him to make his plans he was too young and smart and gifted to spend his life in a homeless shelter god has big plans for you brother manny said just trust him and they will be revealed when it looked as if they might escape at a decent hour on friday night tim reynolds and others quickly organized a drinking party and hurried out of the building saturday was to be a rare day off no member of the litigation group at scully pershing could be seen at work on saturday because it was the annual family picnic in central park thus friday night was cleared for serious drinking kyle declined as did dale around pm as they were both wrapping up the last details of an endless week and with no one else around she leaned around the canvas partition that separated their tight cubicles and said what about dinner great idea kyle said without hesitation any place in particular my place we can relax and talk and do whatever you like chinese love it the word whatever was bouncing around his addled brain dale was thirty single attractive apparently straight a pretty lady alone in the big city at some point she had to think about sex though kyle was depressed at how little he thought about it was she picking him up it was a startling idea dale was so shy and reserved it was hard to believe she would put the move on anyone why dont you pick up some chinese and bring it over she said great idea she lived alone in greenwich village in a fourthfloor walkup they discussed various takeout restaurants in the neighborhood then left the office together an hour later kyle climbed the stairs with a sack of shrimpandchicken fried rice and knocked on the door dale opened it with a smile and welcomed him to her apartment two rooms a denkitchen combo and one bedroom it was small but nicely decorated a minimalist theme with leather and chrome and blackandwhite photos on the wall she too was wellappointed and pursuing the lessismore approach her white cotton skirt was extremely short and revealed more of the slender legs kyle and the other vultures had been admiring her shoes were short heels open toe no straps red leather highclasstart stuff kyle glanced at them and said jimmy choos prada the black cotton sweater was tight without a bra under it for the first time in far too many weeks kyle began to feel the excitement of sexual arousal nice place he said looking at a photograph four thousand a month can you believe it she was opening the fridge one about the size of a large desktop computer she removed a bottle of white wine yes i can believe it its new york but no one made us come here she was holding the bottle of chardonnay im sorry but i dont have any club soda its either wine or water ill have some wine he said with only a slight hesitation and he decided on the spot that he would not torment himself by arguing back and forth about whether he should take a drink after five and a half years of sobriety hed never been to rehab never been forced to detox never considered himself an alcoholic he had simply stopped drinking because he was drinking too much and now he wanted a glass of wine they ate on a small square table their knees almost touching even at home and completely relaxed conversation did not come easily for dale the mathematician he could not imagine her in a classroom in front of fifty students and he certainly couldnt picture her in a courtroom in front of a jury lets agree that we will not talk about work kyle said taking the lead he took his fourth sip of wine agreed but first theres some great gossip lets have it have you heard about the split no theres a rumor i heard it twice today that toby roland and four other partners all in litigation are about to split and open their own firm they may take as many as twenty associates why a fee dispute the usual law firms are famous for exploding imploding merging and spinning off in all directions the fact that some unhappy partners wanted their own show was no surprise either at scully or at any other firm does that mean more work for the rest of us he asked i sure hope so have you met toby yes and i hope the rumor is true whos the biggest prick youve met so far she took a sip of wine and thought about the question thats a tough one so many contenders too many lets talk about something else kyle managed to shift the conversation around to her background education childhood family college she had never been married one bad romance still stung after one glass of wine she poured another and the alcohol loosened her up he noticed that she ate almost nothing he though devoured everything in sight she pushed the topics back to his side of the table and he talked about duquesne and yale occasionally the law firm would get mentioned and they would find themselves wrapped up in it when the wine and food were gone she said lets watch a movie great idea kyle said as she looked through her dvds he glanced at his watch ten twenty in the past six days hed pulled two allnighters he now owned a sleeping bag and averaged four hours of sleep each night he was physically and mentally exhausted and the two and a half glasses of quite delicious wine hed just consumed were thoroughly soaking whatever brain he had left romance action comedy she called out as she flipped through what appeared to be an extensive collection she was on her knees the skirt barely covering her rear kyle stretched out on the sofa because he didnt like the looks of either chair anything but a chick flick how about beetlejuice perfect she inserted the disc then kicked off her heels grabbed a quilt and joined kyle on the sofa she wedged and wiggled and snuggled and pulled the quilt over them and when she was finally situated there was a lot of contact and then there was touching kyle sniffed her hair and thought how easy this was doesnt the firm have a rule against this sort of thing he said were just watching a movie and they watched it warmed by the quilt the wine and each others bodies they watched the movie for all of ten minutes later they could not determine who fell asleep first dale woke up long after the movie was over she spread the quilt over him then went to bed kyle woke up at on saturday morning to an empty apartment there was a note saying she was around the corner at a coffee shop reading the newspapers so stop by if he was hungry they rode the subway together to central park arriving around noon the litigation section of the firm threw a family picnic on the third saturday of each october near the boathouse the main event was a softball tournament but there were also horseshoes croquet bocce and games for the kids a caterer barbecued ribs and chicken a rap band made its noise there was an entire row of iced kegs of heineken the picnic was to promote camaraderie and to prove that the firm did indeed believe in having fun attendance was mandatory no phones allowed for most associates though the time couldve been better spent sleeping at least they were not subject to being dragged into the office for another allnighter only christmas new years thanksgiving rosh hashanah and yom kippur afforded the same protection the day was clear the weather perfect and the weary lawyers shook off their fatigue and were soon playing hard and drinking even harder kyle and dale anxious to avoid even the possibility of gossip soon separated and got lost in the crowd within minutes kyle heard the news that jack mcdougle a secondyear associate from duke had been arrested the night before when a narc team kicked in the door of his apartment in soho and found a substantial stash of cocaine he was still in jail and likely to remain there over the weekend until bail could be arranged on monday the firm was pulling strings to get him out but the firms involvement on his behalf would only go so far scully pershing took a hard line on such behavior mcdougle would be laid off pending the charges if the gossip turned out to be true he would find himself unemployed in a few weeks kyle paused for a few minutes and thought about bennie his chilling prediction had come true litigation had partners and associates twothirds were married and there was no shortage of young welldressed children running around the softball tournament began with mr wilson rush senior of all seniors announcing the brackets and the rules and declaring himself the acting commissioner several lawyers had the guts to boo him but then anything was permitted on this fine day kyle had elected to play it was optional and he found himself on a ragtag team with two people hed met and seven he had not their coach was a partner named cecil abbott of team trylon who was wearing a yankees cap and a derek jeter jersey and it was soon evident that coach abbott had never run to first base in his life with a cold heineken in hand he prepared a lineup that couldnt beat a decent tball team but then who cared kyle easily the best athlete was stuck in right field in center was sherry abney the fifthyear associate bennie was stalking as kyles entrée into the trylonbartin case as they came to bat in the first inning kyle introduced himself and chatted her up she was visibly upset by the mcdougle arrest they had worked together for two years no she had no idea he had a drug problem mingling was encouraged and after coach abbotts team was finally saved by the mercy rule in the fourth inning kyle plunged into the crowd and said hello to every strange face he encountered many of the names were familiar he had after all been studying the bios for six weeks a notorious partner birch mason also clad in yankee garb and halfdrunk by pm grabbed kyle like an old friend and introduced him to his wife and two teenage children doug peckham took him around to meet some of the partners the conversations were all the same whered you go to school hows it going so far bet youre worried about the bar exam results life gets better after the first year and so on and can you believe mcdougle the tournament was double elimination and kyles team distinguished itself by becoming the first to lose two games he found dale playing bocce and they headed for the food tent with plates of barbecue and bottles of water they joined tabor and his rather homely girlfriend at a table under a shade tree tabor of course was on a team that was undefeated and hed driven in the most runs so far he had urgent work at the office and planned to be there at six the following morning you win kyle wanted to say you win why dont they just go ahead and declare you a partner late in the afternoon with the sun fading behind the towering apartment buildings on central park west kyle eased away from the party and found a park bench on a knoll under an oak golden leaves dropped around him he watched the game in the distance listened to the happy voices smelled the last of the smoke from the grills if he really tried he could almost convince himself that he belonged at that party that he was just another of the many successful lawyers taking a quick break from their hectic lives but reality was never far away if he got lucky he would commit a heinous crime against the firm and not get caught but if luck went against him then one day during this family picnic they would be talking about him the way they were talking now about mcdougle chapter sunday with most of the litigators nursing hangovers kyle was up early with a clear head a tall coffee walking shoes and five hours to do nothing but hike the city the firmfone was in his pocket but the firmfone would not be ringing because the sunday after the picnic was a day off as well a few of the gunners and diehards would be at the office but most of the firms litigators would savor another beautiful autumn day without billing an hour he worked his way south through the village and into tribeca then east into the frenzy of chinatown in soho he managed to get a seat at the bar at balthazar a popular restaurant modeled after a parisian bistro and raved about in all the guides he had eggs benedict and tomato juice and was thoroughly entertained by the rowdy crowd then he found the brooklyn bridge climbed to the top to the promenade and hiked across the east river to brooklyn it took forty minutes and then forty minutes back into manhattan where he made his way to broadway and followed it through the garment district the theater district times square and on to columbus circle brunch was at eleven thirty at the upper west side apartment of doug and shelly peckham it was an old building on sixtythird two blocks off central park and as kyle rode the stuffy elevator to the third floor he caught himself doing what most new yorkers do in their spare time and even while theyre working he pondered real estate doug peckham as a fortyoneyearold full equity partner in the firm earned million the previous year his income was no secret scully pershing like most megafirms published their numbers peckham could expect to earn at least that much for the rest of his career so he could afford a nice place but million a year in new york was not exactly in the big leagues not even close the heavy hitters were the investment bankers hedge fund whizzes hightech entrepreneurs and corporate executives who were worth billions and thought nothing of dropping million for a midtown apartment and of course each had the obligatory weekend home in the hamptons for the summer and one in palm beach for weekends in the winter the peckhams had a place in east hampton kyle hoped shelly and the kids enjoyed the summer house because he knew doug certainly did not he was at the office most saturdays and often on sundays shelly greeted him with a hug another old friend now and welcomed him into their open and unpretentious apartment doug was in jeans sockless unshaven and pushing bloody marys on his guests four other associates were present all under the supervision of partner peckham the brunch was another effort by him and the firm to soften the edges and make scully seem like a humane place after all the goal of the gettogether was to talk doug wanted to hear their problems and concerns their ideas and plans their impressions and their goals he also wanted to hurry up and finish brunch so they could watch the giants versus the ers and drink beer kickoff at shelly did the cooking herself and doug helped serve and pour the wine after an hour of useless chatter about the same boring lawsuits theyd slaved over all last week it was time for the giants kyle the only firstyear associate at the table contributed less than anyone halfway through brunch he was already planning his return hike downtown after dessert they gathered in the den where a small fire made things cozy and doug fiddled with the controls to his highdef flatscreen tv in an effort to liven up a dying party kyle claimed to be an avid ers fan a hater of the giants and this succeeded in generating some trash talk two of the older associates were asleep by the end of the first quarter doug began to nod off too and at halftime kyle made a clumsy exit and hit the streets at five on monday morning he was at the office digging in for another long week the giants next game was on the road at pittsburgh and two hours before game time kyle and joey bernardo settled into their seats at the fortyyard line and tried to stay warm a cold front had chased away autumn and a freezing mist hovered above the new stadium it didnt matter as diehard steelers fans they had shivered through many games at three rivers stadium the old place that was gone now they welcomed the cold this was real football weather mercifully blair had little interest in football now five months pregnant she had gained an enormous amount of weight and was not handling prospective motherhood too well joey was having second thoughts about marriage but for some reason felt trapped kyle had little useful advice if she wasnt pregnant he would tell his friend to run but you cant abandon a pregnant fiancée can you it just didnt seem right what did he know about such matters as the crowd settled in and the teams warmed up kyle was ready to talk speak softly and tell me about elaine keenan he said joey had a flask filled with vodka his antifreeze he took a swig grimaced as if it tasted awful and said nothing but trouble their only correspondence about elaine had been joeys written summary of his encounter kyle needed all the details and they needed a plan she is one bitter young woman joey said but shes not nearly as mean as her lawyer start at the beginning and tell me everything as it happened another swig a good smacking of the lips a glance around to make sure no one cared and then joey launched into a slow thoughtful detailed reenactment of his trip to scranton kyle interrupted with questions but the narrative moved along just before the coin toss with the stadium packed and rocking joey finally finished with the admonition if they have the slightest opening theyll attack us with a fury dont give them the opening lets just bury this little episode they watched the game for a while and talked about nothing but football during a timeout joey said so whats the plan can you come to new york next weekend steelersjets four oclock sunday at the meadowlands ill get tickets oh boy i dont know the problem was blair with money also a concern joey made a nice salary with commissions but he wasnt getting rich now he had a baby on the way and a wife sometime after that or vice versa they couldnt decide one day blair wanted to postpone the wedding until the baby arrived so she could regain her figure the next day she wanted to hurry up and get married so the birth wouldnt be out of wedlock joey was just straddling the fence hanging on by his fingernails and getting whipsawed from both sides they were now paying for an expensive new condo he couldnt afford to spend too much time watching football why do you want me in new york he asked because i want to try to get a photo of bennie and why do you want a photo of this guy these people are dangerous right oh yes lethal so why are we messing with them i want to know who they are joey shook his head and looked away toward the scoreboard then he took a sip and leaned close to kyle i say we leave them alone i say you do what they want you to do play their games dont get caught keep the damned video buried and life will be good for all of us maybe can you come to new york i dont know ill have to figure it out its very important please how old buddy do you plan to get a picture of this guy bennie hes a professional operative right something like that youre a lawyer im a stockbroker we have no idea what were doing and we could easily get ourselves in trouble yes we could kyle took a small package from a pocket of his bulky black and gold steelers parka take this he said keeping it low so that no one could see it joey took it and stuffed it into a pocket of his own black and gold steelers parka what is it its a video camera doesnt feel like a video camera its a video camera but not one youre likely to see in a store window the steelers scored on a long pass the games first touchdown and the crowd celebrated for five minutes during the ensuing timeout kyle continued its not much larger than an ink pen it goes in the pocket of either a shirt or a jacket with a thin wire running to a control switch in your left hand you can talk to someone facetoface and video the conversation without their knowledge so i just walk up to bennie whos probably heavily armed and has several other heavily armed pals nearby and introduce myself and ask him to smile no theres a better way but this week you need to practice with it does it have a name its all there in the paperwork specs instructions all that stuff just bone up on it this week and learn how to use it if things go perfectly youll have about three seconds to video bennie and if they dont go perfectly ill rescue you great a long nervous swig from the flask so kyle lets say we get bennie on video how do you not me but you go about identifying him i havent figured that out theres a lot you havent figured out ill email you tuesday tell you ive got tickets the usual drill are you in joey old pal i dont know i think youre crazy and youre making me crazy come on you need to have some fun while you can kyle was hard at work in the main library when the firmfone rattled softly at four on thursday afternoon the email described itself as urgent and commanded the firstyear associates to congregate immediately on the fortyfourthfloor mezzanine the largest gathering place at scully pershing the message meant only one thing the bar exam results were in and the fact that kyle was being summoned meant that he had passed for weeks they had labored against the clock and suffered the often unbearable pressure of adjusting to life in the big firm and added to that misery was the bar exam hanging over them like a dark cloud it was always there seldom discussed because the exam was over and talking about it only made life worse but it woke them up when they desperately needed sleep it followed them to the table and could ruin a meal in an instant the bar exam what if they flunked the bar exam the ritual varied from firm to firm but scully pershing had a rather pleasant way of breaking the news they gathered the lucky ones together and threw a party though it was supposed to be a surprise by the second week of september every new associate knew the drill the cruel part of the festivities was that the unlucky ones were simply not invited they were left to retreat to sneak out of the building and go wander the streets for the rest of the day as kyle ran up the stairs and raced along the hallways he searched for his friends there were high fives yelps for joy people running in shoes that were not meant for running he saw dale and gave her a hug and they walked quickly together once on the mezzanine the crowd was already in a raucous mood before mr howard meezer the firms managing partner stepped to a small podium and said congratulations lets have a party not another hour can be billed today champagne corks were soon flying bartenders were busy and waiters began passing delicious antipasto the general feeling was one of euphoria even giddiness because the nightmare was over and they were now lawyers forever kyle was enjoying a glass of champagne with dale and a few others when the conversation shifted to their less fortunate colleagues does anybody see garwood and they began searching the party for garwood who was unaccounted for and soon presumed to be on the other list tim reynolds approached them with a nasty smile a drink in one hand and a printout in the other tabor flunked he announced proudly can you believe it a harvard casualty kyle wasnt as pleased sure tabor was obnoxious and opportunistic but he was their cube mate and flunking the bar would kill him he wasnt a bad guy word spread the body count rose in all there were failures out of a pass rate of percent an excellent number for any class at any firm once again it was clear that they were the brightest stars and were now destined for even greater things they got as drunk as possible then rode home in private sedans arranged by the firm kyle had only two drinks and walked to chelsea along the way he called his father with the wonderful news chapter his appointment at noon friday with doug peckham was described as a working lunch to review some discovery but when kyle arrived ten minutes early the partner said lets celebrate they left the building and crawled into the back of a lincoln sedan one of the innumerable black cars that roam the city and keep the professionals out of the yellow cabs the firm had a fleet of black cars on call been to eleven madison park doug asked no i dont get out much these days doug because im a firstyear associate and im either usually too tired to eat or i dont have time or i simply forget whining are we of course not congrats on passing the bar thank you youll like this place great food beautiful dining room lets have a long lunch with some wine i know just the client we can stick it to kyle nodded two months in and he was still uncomfortable with the notion of sticking it to clients padding the file overbilling racking up expenses he wanted to ask what exactly the client was about to get stuck for just the lunch which was a certainty or would the client also get billed for two hours of his time and two hours of peckhams but he didnt ask the restaurant was in the lobby of the old metropolitan life building with views of madison square park the decor was contemporary with high ceilings and wide windows doug of course claimed to know the chef and the mattre d and the sommelier and kyle was not surprised when they were seated at a choice table looking at the park lets get your evaluation out of the way doug said snapping a bread stick and sending crumbs across the pristine white tablecloth evaluation yes its my job as your supervising partner to evaluate you after the bar results obviously if youd flunked we wouldnt be here and i wouldnt have nice things to say wed probably be stopping by one of those carts pushed by a street vendor selecting a greasy kielbasa taking a walk and having a bad conversation but you passed so im going to be nice thank you the waiter presented menus while the water was poured doug chomped on a bread stick more crumbs flying across the table your billing is above average in fact its very impressive thanks no surprise that any evaluation at scully pershing would begin with how much money one was raking in ive had nothing but positive comments from other partners and senior associates drinks something to start with the waiter asked well order some wine with lunch doug said almost rudely and the waiter disappeared at times though you seem to lack commitment as if youre not fully on board fair kyle shook his head and thought about a response doug was a nononsense type so why not level with him i live eat and sleep at the firm like every other firstyear associate because thats the business model some guy came up with years ago the same way medical residents go twenty hours a day to prove their mettle thank god were not treating sick people i dont know what else i can do to prove my commitment good point doug said suddenly much more concerned with the menu the waiter hovered waiting you ready doug said im starving kyle had yet to look at the menu and was still stinging from the criticism of his commitment sure he said everything looked delicious they ordered the waiter approved and the sommelier appeared at some point during the serious wine discussion that followed doug mentioned a first bottle and a second bottle the first was a white burgundy youll love it doug said one of my favorites im sure any problems complaints doug asked as if he were clicking off the items on the evaluation checklist with perfect timing kyles firmfone vibrated funny you should mention it he said as he pulled it from his coat pocket and looked at the email its karleen sanborn looking for a few hours of light lifting in the placid mortgage mess what shall i tell her youre having lunch with me kyle typed the email sent it then asked can i turn this off of course the wine was being presented doug sampled it and rolled his eyes and two glasses were poured kyle pressed on my complaint is this damned phone it has become my life when you were an associate fifteen years ago they didnt have cell phones and smartphones and firmfones and so we worked just as hard doug interrupted with a wave of dismissal stop complaining get tough with his other hand he was raising his wineglass to inspect its contents he finally took a sip then nodded his approval well my complaint is this phone okay anything else another check mark in another box no just the usual complaints of associate abuse youve heard them before and you dont want to hear them now youre right kyle i dont want to hear it look as partners we know whats going on were not oblivious we survived it and now we reap the rewards its a bad business model because everybodys miserable you think i want to push myself out of bed at five every morning so i can spend twelve crazy hours at the office so at the end of the year we can divide the spoils and be at the top of the rankings last year apes partners averaged million we were at million and everybody panicked we gotta cut costs we gotta bill more we gotta hire more associates and grind them into the concrete because were the biggest its crazy no one ever stops and says hey you know i can live on a million bucks a year and spend more time with my kids or more time at the beach no sir we gotta be no ill take a million bucks a year youll get there evaluations over one quick question shoot theres a cute firstyear associate and im growing rather fond of her how big a deal is it strict prohibition how cute getting cuter by the day name sorry you gonna do it at the office havent got that far yet there are plenty of sleeping bags doug took a breath and leaned forward on his elbows theres a lot of sex around the place come on its an office you put five thousand men and women together and it happens the unwritten rule is this dont screw around with the employees secretaries paralegals support staff clerks those who are considered somewhat below us we call them the nonlawyers as for your fellow associates or partners for that matter no one really cares as long as you dont get caught ive heard some great stories theyre probably true careers have been ruined last year two partners both married to other people started a hot affair got caught and were kicked out theyre still looking for jobs but for two unmarried associates come on just dont get caught the first courses arrived and sex was forgotten kyle had a leek and cheese tart doug went a bit heavier with a salad of maine lobster with fennel and black trumpet mushrooms kyle drank less wine and more water doug was determined to polish off the first bottle and get to the second a bit of a shakeup is coming down doug said between bites im sure youve heard kyle nodded with a mouth full its probably going to happen five of our litigation partners are leaving with a bunch of associates and several clients the mutiny is being led by toby roland and its not pretty how many associates kyle asked twentysix as of this morning its a freeforall theyre waving money and twisting arms and no one knows how many will eventually leave but it will knock a hole in litigation well survive how do we fill the gap well probably raid another firm they didnt teach you this in law school they both laughed and returned to their food for a moment will this increase the workload for those left behind kyle asked between bites doug shrugged as if to say yes maybe its too early to tell theyre taking some big clients with some big lawsuits in fact thats why theyre leaving is trylon leaving or staying trylon is an old client and its firmly within the protective custody of mr wilson rush what do you know about trylon doug was eyeing him closely as if they were moving into territory that was offlimits just what ive read in the newspapers and magazines you ever worked for them sure several times kyle decided to push on just a little a waiter removed their plates another poured more wine whats this bartin dispute all about the journal said the court file is locked away because the issues are so sensitive military secrets huge sums of money involved the pentagon is all over it they tried like hell to stop the companies from fighting but it blew up anyway theres a lot of technology involved not to mention a few hundred billion dollars are you working on it no i passed theres quite a team though fresh bread arrived to cleanse the palate the first bottle was empty and doug ordered a second kyle was carefully pacing himself the partners and associates who are leaving kyle said how many are working on the bartin lawsuit i dont know why are you so interested because i dont want to work on it why not because i think trylon is a rogue defense contractor with a rotten history of making cheap products screwing the government and the taxpayers dumping dirty weapons around the world killing innocent people promoting war and propping up nasty little dictators all in an effort to increase the bottom line and have something to show the shareholders anything else lots you dont like trylon no the company is an extremely valuable client good let someone else work for them associates are not allowed to choose who they work for i know im just sharing my opinion well keep it to yourself okay that kind of language will get you a lousy reputation dont worry ill do the work thats assigned to me but as a favor as my supervising partner im asking that you keep me busy elsewhere ill see what i can do but mr rush makes the final decisions the second wine was a pinot noir from south africa and it too caused dougs eyes to roll around their entrées braised pork shoulder and aged prime rib of beef were not far behind and they got serious about eating you know your rate now goes to four hundred an hour doug said chewing are you still at eight hundred yes kyle was not sure he had the spine to bill a client regardless of how large the corporation might be for an hour of his inexperienced legal work not that he had a choice on the subject of billing doug said for the month of october i need you to estimate my hours on the ontario bank case i got busy and lost track kyle managed to keep chewing a small bite of braised pork but he almost choked did he say estimate my hours he certainly did and this was something new there had been nothing at orientation nothing in the handbook nothing anywhere about estimating hours just the opposite they had been trained to treat billing as the most important aspect of their practice pick up a file look at the clock make a phone call record the time sit through a meeting count the minutes every hour had to be accounted for and the billing was done on the spot it was never to be delayed and it had to be precise how does one estimate hours kyle asked carefully look at the file check the hours you billed on it look at my work then estimate my time for the month of october its no big deal at an hour it was indeed a big deal and dont underestimate doug said swirling his wine in the goblet of course not if were going to guess here lets be damned sure we land on the high side is this a common practice kyle asked doug snorted in disbelief and swallowed a hunk of beef dont be stupid boy it happens all the time and since were now talking about ontario bank he said meat visible between his teeth bill em for this lunch i was planning on getting the check kyle said a lame effort at humor of course not ill put it on a credit card and bill the bank im talking about our time two hours for you now at four hundred and two for me the bank had record earnings last year that was nice to hear they would need healthy earnings to continue their relationship with scully pershing twentyfour hundred dollars for lunch and that did not include food wine or tip and now that youve passed the bar doug said as he took another bite you are entitled to use the black cars and bill clients for dinner the rule goes like this if you work until eight oclock at night then call a car ill give you the number and code and be sure the client gets billed for the car and if you choose you can go to a restaurant spend no more than a hundred bucks on yourself and also bill the client you gotta be kidding why because im at the office almost every night until eight and if somebody else is buying dinner then ill be damned sure i stay until eight attaboy seems kinda rich doesnt it what billing the client for expensive dinners and lunches and cars a swirl of the pinot a thoughtful stare at the red liquid a long pull kyle my boy look at it this way our biggest client is bxl the seventhlargest company in the world sales last year of billion very smart businessmen who have a budget for everything they live by budgets they are fanatics about budgets last year their budget for legal fees was one percent of their total sales or about billion we didnt get all of that because they use twenty different law firms around the world but we got our share guess what happens if they dont spend the amount they budget if their legal fees fall short their inhouse lawyers monitor our billings and if our numbers are low they call up and raise hell what are we the lawyers doing wrong arent we properly protecting them the point is they expect to spend the money if we dont take it then it screws up their budgets they get worried and maybe they start looking around for another firm one that will work harder at billing them you follow yes kyle followed it was beginning to make sense expensive meals were necessary not only to keep the hungry lawyers going but also to properly balance their clients financial statements now it seemed almost prudent yes kyle said and for the first time the wine warmed his brain and made him relax doug spread his arms and looked around and look at where we are kyle wall street the absolute pinnacle of success in america were here were on top were smart and tough and talented and we make a boatload of money to prove it we are entitled kyle and dont forget it our clients pay us because they need us and we offer the best legal advice money can buy never forget that john mcavoy had lunch every day at the same table at an old café on queen street in york and from the time kyle was ten years old and hanging around the office he loved having lunch with his father the cafés special was a vegetable plate that varied each day and cost little with homemade rolls and iced tea no sugar the café attracted lawyers bankers and judges but there were also mechanics and bricklayers the gossip roared and the bantering was nonstop the lawyers always joked whos paying for lunch and boasted of wealthy clients who theyd stick with a check kyle doubted that his father ever gave a passing thought to billing a client for lunch doug insisted on dessert two hours after entering the restaurant they pushed themselves out the door and into the black car both nodded off during the fifteenminute ride back to the office chapter for the first time in the ninemonth life of the operation kyle contacted bennie and suggested they meet all prior meetings had been prompted by the handler not the asset kyle gave no reason for wanting to meet but then none was necessary it was assumed that kyle finally had something valuable to pass along it was almost pm on friday and kyle was working in the main library on the thirtyninth floor by email bennie suggested the hotel thompson in soho and kyle agreed kyle always agreed because he was not allowed to disagree or suggest another meeting place it didnt matter he had no intention of showing up not that friday night joey wasnt in town yet four hours later kyle was hiding in the placid mortgage tomb mindlessly flipping through foreclosure files now at an hour when he emailed bennie with the sad news that he wouldnt be leaving the office anytime soon could be an allnighter although he loathed the work and hated the tomb and found it hard to believe he was still at the office so late on a friday night he was slightly amused at the image of bennie waiting impatiently in the hotel room for a meeting that would not take place because his asset was holed up in the office and wouldnt come out the handler couldnt complain if the asset was hard at work kyle suggested a meeting late saturday afternoon and bennie took the bait within minutes he emailed the instructions pm saturday room wooster hotel in soho so far a different hotel had been used for each meeting on a desk phone kyle called joeys new cell number and passed along the details his flight from pittsburgh would arrive at laguardia at on saturday afternoon he would take a cab to the mercer hotel check into his room and kill time while his friend practiced law he would roam the streets walk in the front doors of bars and out the back browse through bookstores dart here and there in cabs and when he was certain he was not being followed he would drop in at the wooster hotel and mill around the lobby he had in his pocket a copy of the bennie wright composite kyle had been perfecting for weeks joey had studied it for hours and was confident he could spot the man anywhere now kyle wanted bennie in complete digital color at kyle walked through the hotel lobby and took the elevator to the fourth floor bennie had a small room no suite this time as kyle tossed his trench coat and briefcase on the bed he glanced into the bathroom just looking for nigel or perhaps another surprise he said as he flipped on a light switch just me this time bennie said he was relaxing in a velvet chair you passed the bar congratulations thanks the inspection over kyle sat on the edge of the bed the inspection had revealed no one but bennie but it had also revealed no luggage no shaving kit nothing to indicate bennie would stay in the room after kyle left youre putting in the hours bennie said again making an attempt at small talk im a fullblown lawyer now so evidently im expected to work even more he noted the shirt light blue cotton no pattern no buttons on the collar no necktie the slacks were dark brown wool pleated the jacket was evidently in the closet next to the bathroom and kyle cursed himself for not noticing it dark socks no distinguishable color black scuffed shoes quite ugly heres the scoop kyle said five litigation partners are splitting off abraham devere hanrahan roland and bradley theyre opening up their own shop and stealing at least three clients in the process as of last count twentysix associates are jumping with them of the partners bradley is the only one working on the trylonbartin case however at least seven of the associates are assigned to the lawsuit im sure you have a memo kyle pulled out a single sheet of paper trifolded and handed it over it was a summary of the names of all the scully pershing lawyers who were leaving he knew bennie would want it in writing something to preserve in the file and keep as evidence of his treachery there hed finally done it hed handed over firm secrets and now there was no turning back except that it was not exactly accurate the gossip was changing by the hour and no one seemed to know precisely who was planning to leave kyle had taken a few liberties with the names especially those of the associates nor was it highly confidential information that he was passing along the new york lawyer the trade daily had carried at least two brief stories about the spinoff in the litigation section of scully pershing given the evershifting nature of law firm personnel it was not headline news and besides bennie already knew as much as kyle and kyle knew he knew the memo gave no details about the business of any client in fact it did not mention a client by name while it appeared to have been put together in a hurry kyle had spent time on it and was convinced it was not a violation of ethics bennie unfolded the sheet of paper and studied it carefully kyle watched him for a moment then said i need to use the bathroom in there bennie said pointing without looking as kyle walked to the bathroom he passed the closet its door halfopen and hanging on a rack was a cheap navy sport coat and a dark gray trench coat im not sure this means anything kyle said when he returned trylons inhouse attorneys are handson and they prefer the more experienced associates those who are leaving will likely be replaced with third and fourthyear people im still a long shot wholl take bradleys place not a clue there are a lot of rumors have you met sherry abney yes we played softball together at the picnic in central park we hit it off but shes not in charge of which associates are assigned to the case that decision rests with mr wilson rush patience kyle patience good intelligence is based on longterm placement and relationships youll get there im sure i will especially if you keep picking off the associates ahead of me howd you get rid of mcdougle plant the drugs in his apartment come on kyle the young man had a serious problem with cocaine he didnt need your help hes on the road to recovery you asshole hes on the road to prison he was dealing coke kyle a menace to society what do you care about society kyle stood and began gathering his things gotta run my old pal joey bernardo is in from pittsburgh for the jets game tomorrow how nice bennie said getting to his feet he knew joeys flight numbers coming and going and he knew their section and seat numbers for tomorrows game you remember joey the second one in your little video its not my video kyle i didnt take it i just found it but you couldnt leave it alone could you later kyle slammed the door behind him and hurried down the hallway he ran down four flights of stairs and entered the lobby not far from the elevators he made eye contact with joey then went straight to the mens room around the corner there were three urinals to the right he straddled the center one waited about ten seconds then was joined by joey on the left there was no one else in the mens room light blue shirt no tie navy sport coat all under a dark gray trench coat blackrimmed reading glasses that come and go probably will not be wearing them when he comes down no sign of a briefcase hat umbrella or anything else he should be alone he is not staying for the night so i expect him to be down shortly good luck kyle pulled the flush handle left the room and left the hotel joey waited two minutes then returned to the lobby where he picked up his newspaper from a chair and sat down his dark hair had been cut short the day before and was almost entirely gray he wore fake eyeglasses with thick black frames the camera slightly larger than a disposable pen but practically indistinguishable from one was in the pocket of his brown corduroy jacket next to a red pocket square a hotel security agent in a smart black suit watched him closely though his curiosity had more to do with the relative inactivity of the lobby than with any real suspicion thirty minutes earlier joey had explained to the agent that he was waiting on a friend who was upstairs two clerks behind the reception desk went about their business with their heads down seeing nothing but missing little ten minutes passed then fifteen each time an elevator door opened joey tensed slightly he kept the newspaper low on his knees so that he could appear to be reading while the camera had a clear shot at the target a bell the door to the elevator on the left opened and bennie the handler was there all by himself in a long gray trench coat the composite of his face was remarkably accurate slick bald head a few strands of black hair greased down about the ears long narrow nose square jaw heavy eyebrows over dark eyes joey swallowed hard his head down and squeezed the on button in his left hand for eight steps bennie walked directly toward him then veered with the marble walkway toward the front door and was gone joey twisted his upper body slightly so the camera could follow then he switched it off breathed deeply and became engrossed in his newspaper he looked up each time the elevator opened and after ten long minutes stood and walked back to the mens room after lingering for half an hour he feigned frustration with his tardy friend upstairs and stomped out of the hotel no one followed joey plunged into the saturday night chaos of lower manhattan strolling aimlessly with the thick foot traffic windowshopping ducking into music stores and coffee shops he was convinced hed lost his tail two hours earlier but he took no chances he hurried around corners and cut through narrow streets at a used bookshop hed scoped out late in the afternoon he locked himself in the tiny toilet and washed his hair with a cleansing rinse that took out much of the gray what was left was covered with a black steelers cap he dropped the fake eyeglasses in the wastebasket the video recorder was stuck deep in his right front pocket kyle waited nervously at the bar in the gotham bar and grill on twelfth street he sipped a glass of white wine and chatted occasionally with the bartender their reservation was for pm the worstcase scenario indeed the only way they could screw up the operation was for bennie to recognize joey and confront him in the lobby of the wooster hotel it was a long shot though bennie knew joey was in the city but he would not recognize him in disguise nor would he expect him to be anywhere near the hotel kyle was assuming that since it was saturday night and since he had done little if anything in two months to arouse suspicions bennie would be traveling light with a skeleton crew on the streets joey arrived promptly at nine his hair was almost natural in fact as he walked through the front door kyle could not see a hint of gray he had somehow exchanged the wellused brown corduroy jacket for a more stylish black one his smile told the story got him he said as he took a stool and began looking for a drink so kyle said softly as he watched the door for anything suspicious double absolut on the rocks joey said to the bartender then to kyle much lower he said i think i nailed him he waited sixteen minutes used the elevator and i shot him for at least five seconds before he passed by me did he look at you i dont know i was reading the newspaper no eye contact remember but he never slowed down no trouble recognizing him no your composite is terrific they drank for a few moments as kyle continued to watch the front door and as much of the sidewalk as he could see without being obvious the maitre d fetched them and led them to a table in the rear of the restaurant after the menus were presented joey handed over the camera when can we see it he asked a few days ill use a computer at the office dont email me the video joey said dont worry ill make a copy and send it snail mail now what good work pal now we enjoy a fine meal with wine as youll notice proud of you and tomorrow we watch the steelers kill the jets they clinked glasses and savored their triumph bennie yelled at the three operatives whod lost joey after his arrival in the city they had first lost him late in the afternoon not long after he had checked in at the mercer and hit the streets theyd found him in the village before dark then lost him again now he was having dinner with kyle at the gotham bar and grill but that was exactly where he was supposed to be the operatives swore he moved as if he knew he was being followed he had deliberately tried to shake them and did a damned fine job didnt he bennie yelled two straight football games one in pittsburgh now one in new york more email chatter between the two joey was the only friend from college kyle was now regularly in touch with the warning signs were there something was being planned bennie decided to beef up surveillance on mr joey bernardo they were also watching baxter tate and his remarkable transformation chapter at on monday morning kyle hurried off the elevator alone on the thirtythird floor and walked to his cube as usual lights were on doors were open coffee was brewed someone was working someone was always working regardless of the day or hour the receptionists secretaries and clerks werent due until but then they only worked a fortyhour week the partners averaged around seventy it was not unusual for an associate occasionally to hit a hundred good morning mr mcavoy it was alfredo one of the plainclothes security agents who roamed the hallways during the weird hours good morning alfredo kyle said as he wadded his trench coat and tossed it in a corner next to his sleeping bag how bout those jets alfredo asked id rather not discuss it kyle shot back twelve hours earlier the jets had drubbed the steelers by three touchdowns in heavy rain have a nice day alfredo said happily as he walked away his day obviously made better because his team had slaughtered the steelers and more important hed found a place to rub it in new york sports fans kyle mumbled as he unlocked his drawer and pulled out his laptop as he waited for it to power up he glanced around to make sure he was alone dale refused to punch in before tim reynolds hated mornings and preferred to arrive around and make up for it at midnight poor tabor the gunner had flunked the bar exam and had not been seen since hed called in sick last friday the day after the results were published and evidently his sickness had continued throughout the weekend but there was no time to worry about tabor he could take care of himself working quickly kyle slid the tiny tklip from the video camera into an adapter which he plugged into his laptop he waited a few seconds clicked twice then froze as the image appeared bennie in perfect color standing at the elevator door waiting patiently for it to open completely then walking forward the steady confident walk of a man with no fears no hurries four steps over the marble floor then a long glance down at joey but no connection five more steps and he disappeared from view screen blank rewind watch it again and again slower and slower after the fourth step when bennie looked casually at joey kyle stopped the action and studied bennies face the shot was clear the best of the video he clicked on print and quickly made five copies he had his man at least on tape how about this little video bennie guess youre not the only one who can play games with hidden cameras kyle quickly fetched the copies from the printer beside sandras desk all printing was supposed to be logged in and charged to a client but no questions were asked by the secretary if a few pages were used for personal reasons kyle held the five copies and patted himself on the back he stared at the face of his tormentor his blackmailer the rotten little son of a bitch who was currently in charge of his life he thanked joey for such a superb job a master of disguise too quick for the bloodhounds behind him and a brilliant cameraman there was a voice somewhere nearby and kyle put away his laptop hid the tklip and walked up six flights to the main library on the thirtyninth floor there lost among the stacked tiers he added four of the prints to his hidden file the fifth he would mail to joey with a note of congratulations from an upperlevel balcony he looked down at the central floor of the library rows of tables and study carrels piles of books scattered around urgent projects he counted eight associates hard at work lost in a world of research for memos and briefs and motions that were past due five oclock on a monday morning in early november what a way to start the week the next step in his scheme had not yet been determined he wasnt certain there was a next step but for the moment kyle was content to take a breath savor a small victory and tell himself there was a way out just minutes after the markets opened monday joey was chatting with a client who wanted to dump some more oil stocks when his second desk phone rang he routinely carried on more than one phone conversation at the same time but when the second caller said hey joey its baxter how are you joey got rid of the client where are you joey asked baxter had left pittsburgh three years earlier after they graduated from duquesne and he seldom returned when he did though he rounded up the old gang those who could not avoid him and threw some wild drunken party that killed a weekend the longer he stayed in la and pursued his acting career the more insufferable he became when he was back home here in pittsburgh he said clean and sober for days now thats great baxter wonderful i knew you were in rehab yes uncle wally again god bless him you got time for a quick lunch i need to talk to you about something they had never had lunch not since college lunch was too civilized for baxter when he met friends it was always at a bar with a long night ahead of them sure whats up nothing much just want to say hello grab a sandwich and meet me down at point state park id like to sit outdoors and watch the boats sure baxter since it was all so obviously planned joey was becoming suspicious noon okay see you then at noon baxter showed up with nothing to eat nothing but a bottle of water he was thinner and dressed in old dungarees a faded navy sweater and a pair of black combat boots all selected from the secondhand shop above brother mannys shelter for the homeless long gone were the designer jeans armani jackets and crocodile loafers the old baxter was history they embraced and swapped insults and found an empty bench near the point where the allegheny and monongahela rivers merge a large fountain spewed water behind them youre not eating joey said not hungry go ahead joey set aside his deli sandwich and studied the combat boots you seen kyle baxter asked and they spent a few minutes catching up about kyle alan strock and a few of the other fraternity brothers when baxter spoke he did so softly and slowly and he gazed across the rivers as if his tongue were working but his mind were engaged elsewhere when joey spoke baxter listened but did not really hear you seem detached joey said blunt as ever its just weird being back you know plus its so different now that im sober im an alcoholic joey a fullblown raging alcoholic and now that ive stopped drinking and all of that poison is out of my system i look at things differently im never going to drink again joey if you say so im no longer the baxter tate you once knew good for you but the old baxter wasnt such a bad guy the old baxter was a selfish pompous egotistical drunken pig and you know it true he wouldve been dead in five years an old barge inched along the river and they watched it for a few minutes joey slowly unwrapped his turkey on rye and began eating im working my way through recovery baxter announced quietly are you familiar with the process in alcoholics anonymous sort of i had an uncle who sobered up a few years ago and is still active in aa its a great program my counselor and pastor is an excon known affectionately as brother manny he found me in a bar in a reno casino six hours after i left the rehab clinic now thats the old baxter indeed hes led me through the twelve steps recovery process under his direction ive made a list of all the people i harmed along the way talk about frightening i had to sit at a table and think of all the people ive hurt because i was drunk and im on the list no you didnt make it sorry darn its mainly family members theyre on my list and id probably be on their lists if they ever got serious about life now that ive made the list the next step is to make amends thats even more frightening brother manny beat his first wife before he went to prison she divorced him and years later when he sobered up he tracked her down to say he was sorry she had a scar above her lip thanks to him and when she finally agreed to meet with him he begged for forgiveness she kept pointing to the scar she was crying he was crying sounds horrible doesnt it it does i assaulted a girl one time shes on my list the turkey on rye froze halfway down the esophagus joey kept chewing but the food wasnt moving you dont say elaine keenan remember her she claimed we raped her at a party in our apartment how could i forget do you ever think about her joey she went to the police scared the hell out of us we almost hired lawyers i tried my best to forget about it and i almost did but now that im sober and my mind is clear im remembering things better we took advantage of that girl joey joey placed the sandwich aside maybe your memory is not as sharp as you think what i remember is a wild girl who loved to party loved to drink and snort coke but what she loved the most was random sex we did not take advantage of anyone at least i did not if you want to revise history then go ahead but dont include me she passed out i went first and while i was doing it i realized shed blacked out then i remember you walked up to the sofa and you said something like is she awake do you remember any of this joey no portions of it were familiar but joey wasnt sure anymore hed worked so hard to forget the episode then hed been shocked back to reality when kyle described the video she claimed she was raped maybe she was right no way baxter allow me to refresh your memory you and i had sex with her the night before evidently she liked it because on the night in question we bumped into her again and she said lets go she consented before we got back to our apartment another long pause as each tried to anticipate what was next you thinking about having a little chat with elaine joey asked maybe i need to do something joey i dont feel right about what happened come on baxter we were all drunk out of our minds the whole night was a blur oh the wonders of alcohol we do things we dont remember we hurt others because of our selfishness and when we finally sober up we are compelled to at least apologize apologize let me tell you a quick story brother baxter i bumped into elaine a few weeks ago she lives in scranton i was passing through on business saw her in a deli during lunch i tried to be civil she freaked out on me called me a rapist i suggested we get together a few hours later for a polite cup of coffee she showed up with her lawyer a real tough broad who thinks all men are scum so lets say you go over to scranton find her and tell her youre sorry because theres a good chance she was telling the truth after all and you want to feel better about yourself because now youre sober and you have this desire to be a good little alcoholic know whatll happen baxter indictments arrests trials lawsuits prison all of the above and not just for you brother baxter but for some of your friends as well a brief gap as joey caught his breath he had baxter on the ropes time to finish him off her lawyer explained that the statute of limitations on rape is twelve years in pennsylvania so time has not expired we got a long way to go you get near her with some halfbaked feelgood apology and youll find out what rape is all about when they lock you away joey jumped to his feet walked across the boardwalk and spat at the rivers he returned to the bench but didnt sit down baxter hadnt moved but he was shaking his head she wanted the sex baxter and we were happy to accommodate her youre blowing this way out of proportion ive got to talk to her hell no youre not going near her until the four of us me you kyle and alan have a long discussion thatll be ugly wont it i need to talk to kyle he has more sense than the rest of us yes he does but he has a crushing workload tremendous stress joey tried to imagine such a meeting between the two kyle thinking about the video while baxter and his amazing new memory confirm the details it would be a disaster ill go to new york baxter said dont do it why not id like to see kyle okay but if you talk to kyle then talk to alan too everybody talks for a good long time before you go blundering into scranton and screw up our lives im telling you baxter this girl is out for blood and her lawyer has a nose for it another long gap in the conversation joey finally sat down and thumped his pal on the knee just a couple of old frat brothers who still cared for each other you cant do this baxter joey said with as much conviction as he could muster at the moment he was thinking about his own skin how would he tell blair who was now five months pregnant hey babes just got a phone call seems they want me downtown something about a rape charge could be serious might not be home for dinner someone said reporters are waiting catch it on channel later hugs and kisses im not sure about what happened joey baxter said softly and slowly as ever but i know what i did was wrong my uncle the alcoholic when he went through aa he made a list too he had stolen a rifle from my father and he saved his money until he could buy another one brought it to the house one night big surprise big scene but if i remember correctly you as the alcoholic working your way through the twelve steps process cannot make amends if doing so will harm others isnt that right thats correct then theres your answer if you approach her and beg forgiveness she and her lawyer will go nuts and drag in me and probably kyle and alan as well you cant do it because it will harm us if you did nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about im confronting what i did and what i did was wrong this is crazy baxter look youre clean and sober and full of the gospel good for you im very proud of you the future looks great yet youre willing to throw it all away and risk twenty years in prison come on this is madness then what should i do get your ass back to reno or somewhere far away and forget about this go live a great life out there just leave us alone two policemen walked by laughing and joey stared at the handcuffs on their belts you cant do this baxter he said give it some time pray about it talk to your minister i have already and what did he say he said to be cautious smart guy look youre in a state of transition right now everything is unsettled youre out of la youre clean and sober all good stuff again im proud of you but its a mistake to rush off and do something foolish lets walk baxter said and slowly rose to his feet they strolled along the river saying little watching the boats i really want to see kyle baxter finally said chapter in the four and a half months kyle had lived in his grim little apartment he had managed to avoid having guests dale had asked about it a few times then let the matter drop kyle described his place as a dump with almost no furnishings lukewarm water bugs and uninsulated walls he claimed to be looking for something much nicer but then what firstyear associate had time to look for an apartment the truth was that he wanted a dump for that very reason he could keep guests away and in doing so avoid the risks of having their conversations listened to and recorded though he had not attempted to rid the place of mikes and electronic bugs he knew they were there he suspected there were cameras always watching and since he had lulled them into believing that he was clueless about their surveillance he went through the motions each day of living pretty much like a hermit intruders came and went at least one per week but there were no invited guests dale was content to meet at her place she had a fear of bugs if you only knew thought kyle my apartment has every kind of bug known to the covert world they eventually managed to sleep together without actually falling asleep beforehand both collapsed shortly afterward they had violated firm policy on at least four occasions and had no plans to stop when baxter called and asked if he could crash at kyles for a few days kyle was ready with a string of lies that were mildly convincing joey had sent a mayday call from his desk phone to kyles just minutes after hed said goodbye to baxter we gotta do something joey said over and over until kyle told him to shut up the idea of baxter lounging around his apartment and talking at length about the elaine episode was almost too much to imagine kyle could see bennie with his technicians clutching his headphones listening to baxter preach about the need to confront the past admit everything and so on if the elaine episode blew up back in pittsburgh kyle would be dragged into it at some level and bennie would risk losing his leverage in new york sorry bax kyle said happily on his cell phone i have only one bedroom if you can call it that and my cousin has been sleeping on the sofa for a month shes in new york looking for a job and well i gotta say the place is cramped baxter checked into the soho grand they met for a late pizza at an allnight joint on bleecker street in the village kyle picked the place because hed been there before and as always had taken notes on its suitability for future use one door in and out large front windows that faced the sidewalk lots of noise and it was too small for one of the bloodhounds to enter without being noticed kyle arrived at fifteen minutes early so he could secure a booth and sit facing the door he pretended to be engrossed in a thick document the tireless associate ever dedicated to his work baxter was wearing the same dungarees sweater and combat boots joey had described they embraced then fell into the booth talking nonstop they ordered soft drinks and kyle said i talked to joey congrats on the rehab you look great thanks ive thought about you a lot in the past few months you quit drinking during our sophomore year right right i cant remember why a counselor told me that the drinking would only get worse i didnt have a serious problem but one was definitely foreseeable so i quit didnt touch a drop until a few weeks ago when i had some wine so far so good if i get worried ill quit again i had three bleeding ulcers when they took me in i thought about suicide but i didnt really want to do it because id miss the vodka and cocaine i was a mess they ordered a pizza and talked for a long time about the past primarily baxters he unloaded story after story about the last three years in latrying to break into the movie business the parties the drug scene the gorgeous young girls from every small town in america doing everything physically possible to either get a break or marry rich kyle listened intently while keeping an eye on the front door and the front windows nothing they talked about their old friends kyles new job baxters new life after an hour when the pizza was gone they eventually got around to more pressing matters i guess joey told you about elaine baxter said of course he did its a bad idea baxter i understand the law and you dont youre walking into quicksand and you could take us with you but you did nothing why are you worried heres a scenario kyle said leaning closer eager to unveil a narrative hed thought about for hours you go see elaine looking for some type of redemption forgiveness whatever you think you might find there you apologize to someone you once hurt maybe she turns the other cheek and accepts your apology and you two have a nice hug and say goodbye that probably will not happen what is much more likely to happen is that she chooses not to take the christian approach doesnt give a rip about this cheekturning business and decides with the advice of a pretty nasty lawyer that what she really wants is justice she wants vindication she cried rape once and nobody listened you with the best intentions will vindicate her with your awkward apology she feels violated now and she likes being the victim her lawyer starts to push and things unravel quickly theres a prosecutor in pittsburgh who not surprisingly likes to see his face on the front page like all prosecutors hes tired of the mundane the gang shootings the daily street crime suddenly he has a chance to go after four white boys from duquesne and one just happens to be a tate not only a great white defendant but four of them talk about headlines press conferences interviews hell be the hero and well be the criminals of course we are entitled to a trial but thats a year away a year of absolutely terrifying hell you cant do it baxter youll hurt too many people what if i offer her money a deal with only two parties me and her it might work im sure she and her lawyer would enjoy those discussions but offering money implies guilt an admission of some sort i dont know elaine and neither do you but given joeys encounter its safe to say she is not too stable we cant predict how she will react its too risky i cant live with myself until i talk to her kyle i feel like i harmed her in some way got that it sounds great in the aa handbook but its a different matter when other people are involved you have to forget about this and put it behind you im not sure i can theres an element of selfishness here baxter you want to do something that you think will make you feel better well good for you what about the rest of us your life will be more complete our lives could be ruined youre dead wrong here leave this girl alone i can apologize to elaine without admitting i committed a crime ill just say that i was wrong and want to apologize her lawyer is not stupid and her lawyer will be sitting there with a tape recorder probably a video camera kyle took a sip of a diet soda and had a quick flashback to the first video if baxter saw it now saw himself tagteaming with joey while elaine was motionless his guilt would crush him i have to do something no you dont kyle said raising his voice for the first time he was surprised at the stubbornness across the table you dont have the right to ruin our lives im not ruining your life kyle you did nothing wrong is she awake joey asks the words rattle around the courtroom the jurors scowl at the four defendants maybe they feel compassion for kyle and alan because there is no evidence that they violated the girl and find them not guilty maybe theyre sick of the whole bunch and send them all to prison ill take all the blame baxter said why are you so determined to get yourself into more trouble than you can imagine youre toying with prison here baxter wake up man ill take the blame he repeated very much the martyr now you guys will walk youre not listening to me baxter this is far more complicated than you realize a shrug maybe so listen to me dammit im listening to you kyle but im also listening to the lord well i cant compete and hes leading me to elaine to forgiveness and i believe she will listen and she will forgive and she will forget he was firm and pious and kyle realized he had little else to throw at baxter let it sit for a month kyle said dont do anything hasty joey alan and i should have a say in the matter lets go im tired of sitting here they roamed the village for half an hour before kyle exhausted finally said good night he was dead to the world when his cell phone rang three hours later it was baxter i talked to elaine he announced proudly tracked her down called her woke her up and we talked for a few minutes you idiot kyle blurted before he could stop himself it went pretty well actually what did you say kyle was in the bathroom splashing water on his face with one hand and holding his phone with the other told her ive never felt right about what happened i didnt admit to anything other than some misgivings thank god for that what did she say she thanked me for calling then she cried and said no one has ever believed her she still feels like she was raped shes always known it was joey and me with you and alan somewhere close by watching the action thats not true were gonna meet in a couple of days have lunch just the two of us in scranton dont do it baxter please dont do it you will regret it forever i know what im doing kyle ive prayed about this for hours and im trusting god to get me through it she promised not to tell her lawyer you gotta have faith she works for her lawyer parttime did she tell you that baxter no she did not youll walk into a trap and your life will be over my life is just beginning old pal faith kyle faith good night the phone snapped shut the connection was dead baxter flew back to pittsburgh the following morning retrieved his car a porsche he planned to sell from the longterm parking area and checked into a motel by the airport credit card records revealed that he spent two nights in the motel and never checked out his cell phone records showed numerous incoming calls and text messages from both joey bernardo and kyle mcavoy with no outgoing calls in return he had two long conversations with brother manny in reno and some short ones with his parents and his brother in pittsburgh there were two calls to elaine keenan on the last day of his life he left pittsburgh before sunrise headed for scranton a drive that would cover three hundred miles in about five hours according to the credit card trail he stopped for gas at a shell station near the intersection of and about ninety minutes north of pittsburgh he then headed due east on and traveled two hours until his journey came to an end near the small town of snow shoe he stopped at a rest area and went to the mens room it was approximately am on a friday in midnovember traffic was light and there were only a few other vehicles at the rest area mr dwight nowoski a retiree from dayton who was traveling to vermont with his wife who was already in the ladies room discovered baxter not long after he had been shot he was still alive but dying quickly from a gunshot to the head mr nowoski found him on the floor by the urinals his jeans unzipped the floor covered with blood and urine the young man was gasping and whimpering and thrashing about like a deer hit by a car there was no one else in the mens room when mr nowoski walked in and stumbled upon the horrible scene evidently the murderer followed baxter into the toilet took a look around to make sure they were alone then quickly placed a ninemillimeter pistol a beretta according to the lab at the base of baxters skull and fired once a silencer muffled the gunshot the rest area was not equipped with surveillance cameras the pennsylvania state police closed the rest stop and sealed the area around it six travelers including mr and mrs nowoski were questioned at length at the crime scene one gentleman remembered a yellow penske rental truck coming and going but he had no idea how long it was there the group estimated that another four or five vehicles had left the rest area after the body was discovered but before the police arrived no one could recall seeing baxter enter the mens room nor did anyone see the murderer follow him in a lady from rhode island recalled noticing a man standing by the door to the mens room when she entered the ladies and upon further reflection she agreed that it was possible he might have been a lookout he was not going in nor was he coming out regardless he was long gone and her description was limited to male white somewhere between the ages of thirty and fortyfive at least five feet eight but no more than six feet four wearing a dark jacket that could have been leather linen wool cotton anything along with the lab reports and autopsy her description was the extent of the physical evidence baxters wallet cash fold and watch were untouched the police inventoried his pockets and found nothing but a few coins his car keys and a tube of lip balm the lab would later report that there was no trace of alcohol or illegal drugs in his system on his clothing or in his car the pathologist did note a remarkable degree of liver damage for a twentyfiveyearold robbery was immediately ruled out for the obvious reasons nothing was taken unless the victim was carrying something valuable that no one knew about but why would an armed thief leave behind in cash and eight credit cards wouldnt a thief consider stealing the porsche while he had the chance there was no evidence that the crime had anything to do with sex it couldve been a drug hit but that seemed unlikely those were usually much messier with sex robbery and drugs ruled out the investigators began scratching their heads they watched the bagged body disappear into the rear of an ambulance for the ride back to pittsburgh and they knew they had a problem the apparent randomness of the act plus the silent gunshot and the clean getaway led them to conclude at least at the scene that they were dealing with professionals the confirmation that a member of such a noted family had met such a strange and brutal end brightened up a dull news day in pittsburgh television crews scampered to the tate estate in shadyside only to be met by private security personnel for generations the tate family had offered no comment to every inquiry and this tragedy was no different a family lawyer issued a terse response and asked for prayers consideration and respect for privacy uncle wally once again took charge and issued orders kyle was at his cube chatting with dale about their plans for the evening when the call came from joey it was almost pm on friday he had eaten a pizza with baxter late on tuesday night then chatted with him a few hours later but had not spoken to him since as far as he and joey could tell baxter had disappeared or at least he was ignoring his phone whats the matter dale asked as she noticed the look of shock but kyle did not respond he kept the phone to his ear and began walking away down the hall past the front desk listening as joey unloaded all the details now being splashed across the television he lost him in the elevator and once outside the building he called joey back and kept listening the sidewalks along broad were packed with the lateafternoon rush kyle plodded along without a coat to layer against the chill without a clue as to where he might be going they killed him he finally said to joey who i think you know chapter a funeral lasts for two hours doug peckham was saying as he glared at kyle i dont understand why you need to take two days off the funeral is in pittsburgh i have to fly there then fly back he was a fraternity brother im a pallbearer ill need to see the family come on doug ive done funerals for a twentyfiveyearold roommate shot in the head i get all that but two days yes call it vacation call it personal time dont we get a few personal days a year sure its somewhere in the handbook but no one takes them then im taking them fire me i dont give a damn a deep breath on both sides of the desk and doug said calmly okay okay when is the funeral two oclock wednesday afternoon then leave late tomorrow afternoon and meet me here at fivethirty thursday morning i gotta tell you kyle this place is a powder keg this toby roland split is getting nastier and larger and those of us who stay behind are about to get dumped on he was my roommate and im sorry oh thank you doug waved off the last comment picked up a thick file and thrust it across the desk can you read this on the airplane while phrased like a question it was an outright command kyle took the file and locked his jaws to keep from saying sure doug ill give it a look on the plane and ill sneak a peek at the wake and ill analyze the damned thing during the service and review my thoughts at the burial when they lower baxter into his grave and then when im flying back to laguardia ill flip through it again and for every minute im even remotely thinking about this file ill bill or double bill or maybe even triple bill the poor client who made the mistake of selecting this fullservice sweatshop for its legal needs you okay doug asked no look im sorry i dont know what else to say theres nothing to say any clue as to who pulled the trigger doug shifted his weight as he attempted a bit of small talk he feigned badly interest in what had happened no if you only knew kyle thought im sorry doug said again and his effort at showing interest was gone kyle started for the door but stopped when he heard i asked you to estimate my hours for the ontario bank case didnt i over lunch remember i need the hours estimate your own damned hours kyle ached to say or better yet just keep up with your time like everybody else almost done kyle said and made it through the door without further abuse the interment of baxter farnsworth tate took place on a damp and overcast day at the family burial plot in homewood cemetery in central pittsburgh it followed a staid and bythebook episcopal service that was closed to the public and especially closed to the media baxter left a brother who attended the service and a sister who did not over the weekend the brother made a gallant effort to restructure the funeral into a celebration of baxters life an idea that fell flat with the ultimate realization that there was so little to celebrate the brother yielded to the rector who led them through the standard rituals of remembering someone whom he the rector had never met ollie guice a beta from cleveland who had lived with baxter for two of their years at duquesne struggled through a eulogy that evoked a few smiles of the eight surviving members of their pledge class seven were present there was also a respectable showing from old pittsburgh some childhood friends and those required to attend because they came from the upper crust there were four longforgotten pals from the secondtier boarding school the tates had shipped baxter to when he was fourteen years old unknown to kyle and the others elaine keenan had attempted to enter the church but was turned away because her name was not on the list no one from hollywood made it to the funeral not a single soul from la baxters clist agent sent flowers a former female roommate emailed the rector a brief eulogy that she insisted be read by someone in attendance she was on the set and couldnt get away her eulogy made references to the buddha and tibet and was not well received in pittsburgh the rector tossed it without a word to the family brother manny managed to talk his way into the church but only after joey bernardo convinced the family that baxter had spoken highly of his pastor in reno the family along with all the other mourners eyed brother manny with some suspicion he wore his standard white uniform baggy bleached dungarees and flowing shirttail and layered it with a garment that was probably a robe of some variety but looked more like a white bedsheet his only concession to the solemnity of the occasion was a black leather beret that adorned his tumbling gray locks and gave him an odd resemblance to an aging che guevara he wept throughout the service shedding more tears than the rest of the hidebound and stoic collection combined kyle shed no tears though he was deeply saddened by such a wasted life as he stood next to the grave and stared at the oak casket he was unable to dwell on the good times they had shared he was too consumed with the raging internal debate over what he should have done differently in particular should he have told baxter about the video about bennie and the boys about everything if he had done so would baxter have appreciated the danger and behaved differently maybe maybe not in his zeal to clean up his past baxter might have gone nuts if he knew hed actually been filmed doing whatever he did to elaine he might have confessed under oath and said to hell with everybody else it was impossible to predict because baxter was not thinking rationally and it was impossible to secondguess now because kyle did not foresee the extent of the danger but he certainly saw it now there were about a hundred mourners huddled around the grave site all pressing close together to hear the final words from the rector a few cold raindrops hurried things along a crimson tent provided shelter for the casket and the family seated near it kyle glanced away at the rows of tombstones where the old money was buried and beyond them to the stone gate at the cemeterys entrance on the other side of the entrance was a large pack of media types waiting like vultures for a glimpse of something newsworthy ready with cameras lights and microphones they had been kept away from the church by the police and private guards but they had dogged the procession like kids at a parade and now they were desperate for a shot of the casket or the mother collapsing as she said goodbye somewhere in their midst was at least one of bennies boys maybe two or three kyle wondered if they had a camera not for a shot of the casket but to record which of baxters friends had bothered to attend useless information really but then so much of what they did made no sense they knew how to kill though there was little doubt about that the state police had nothing to say so far and as the days passed it was becoming evident that their silence was not necessarily of their choosing there was simply no evidence a clean hit a silent bullet a quick getaway and no motive whatsoever brother manny wailed loudly from the edge of the tent and this rattled everyone else the rector missed a beat then droned on kyle stared at the horde in the distance too far away for any one face to be recognized he knew they were there watching waiting curious about his movements and those of joey and alan strock whod driven in from med school at ohio state the four roommates now reduced to three as the rector wound down a few sobs could be heard then the crowd began backing away from the crimson tent inching away from the grave site the burial was over and baxters parents and brother wasted no time in leaving kyle and joey held back and for a moment stood near the tombstone of another tate this will be our last conversation for a long time joey said softly but firmly youre messing around with the wrong people kyle just leave me out of it kyle looked at the pile of fresh dirt about to be packed on top of baxter joey kept on his lips barely moving as if bugs were close by count me out okay ive got my hands full here ive got a life with a wedding and a baby in the future no more of your silly spy games you keep playing if you want but not me sure joey no more emails packages phone calls no more trips to new york i cant keep you out of pittsburgh but if you visit here dont call me one of us will be next kyle and it wont be you youre too valuable youre the one they need so for our next mistake guess who gets the bullet we didnt cause his death are you sure about that no these guys are around for a reason and that reason is you thanks joey dont mention it im going now please keep me out of it kyle and be damned sure nobody sees that video so long kyle allowed him to walk ahead then he followed chapter at on thursday morning kyle walked into doug peckhams office and reported for duty doug was standing at his desk which resembled as always a landfill how was the funeral he asked without looking up from whatever he was holding it was a funeral kyle said he handed over a single sheet of paper here is an estimate of your hours on the ontario bank case doug snatched it scanned it disapproved of it and said only thirty hours at the most youre way off double it and lets call it sixty kyle shrugged call it whatever you want youre the partner if the client could pay for work that wasnt performed then the client could certainly pay another on top of that we have a hearing in federal court at nine well leave here at eight thirty finish the rule memo and be here at eight the prospect of a litigation associate getting near a courtroom during his or her first year was unheardof and for kyle a gloomy day suddenly improved of the twelve in his class no one at least to his knowledge had seen live action he hurried to his cube and was checking emails when tabor appeared with a tall coffee and a haggard look since flunking the bar he had slowly managed to put himself back together and though he was initially humbled the cockiness was returning sorry about your friend he said flinging his overcoat and briefcase thanks kyle said tabor was still standing slurping coffee and anxious to talk have you met h w prewitt litigation partner two floors up he asked no kyle answered still pecking away hes about fifty big texan they call him harvey wayne behind his back get it harvey wayne from texas double first name got it they also call him texas slim because he weighs about four hundred pounds mean as hell went to a community college then am then texas law and hates anybody from harvard hes been stalking me caught me two days ago and gave me a project that any parttime secretary could handle i spent six hours tuesday night taking apart exhibit binders for a big deposition yesterday took them apart then reconfigured them just the way harvey wayne wanted there were a dozen binders couple of hundred pages each a ton of paperwork at nine yesterday morning i put them on a cart raced them down to a conference room where about a hundred lawyers are gathering for this depo and what did harvey wayne do what theres this door that leads to another conference room and it wont stay shut sort of swings back and forth and so harvey wayne fat ass tells me to stack the binders on the floor and use them as a doorstop i do what he tells me and as im leaving the room i hear him say something like those harvard boys make the best paralegals how much coffee have you had second cup im on my first and i really need to crank out this memo sorry look have you seen dale no i left tuesday afternoon for the funeral yesterday something the matter she got nailed with some heinous project tuesday night and i dont think shes slept at all lets keep an eye on her will do at kyle left the office with doug peckham and a senior associate named noel bard they walked hurriedly to a parking garage a few blocks away and when the attendant pulled up in bards latemodel jaguar peckham said kyle you drive were going to foley square kyle wanted to protest but said nothing bard and peckham climbed into the rear seat leaving kyle the chauffeur alone in the front im not sure of the best route kyle admitted with a flash of fear at what would happen if he got lost and the two big shots in the back were late for court stay on broad until it becomes nassau take it all the way to foley square bard said as if he made the drive every day and be careful this little baby is brandnew and cost me a hundred grand its my wifes kyle could not remember being so nervous behind the wheel he finally found the mirroradjustment scheme and eased into traffic cutting his eyes in all directions to make matters worse peckham wanted to talk kyle a couple of names all firstyears darren bartkowski without glancing at peckham in the rearview mirror kyle waited and finally said so you know him sure i know all of the firstyear litigation associates what about him have you worked with him good bad talk to me kyle how would you evaluate him uh well nice guy i knew him at yale his work kyle his work i havent worked with him yet the word is hes a slacker ducks the partners late with projects lazy with the billing i wonder if he estimates his hours kyle thought but kept his concentration on the yellow cabs passing darting turning abruptly violating every known rule of the road have you heard hes a slacker kyle yes kyle said reluctantly it was the truth bard decided to help thrash poor bartkowski hes billed the fewest hours so far of anyone in your class talking about colleagues was a contact sport at the firm and the partners were as bad as the associates an associate who cut corners or ducked projects was labeled a slacker and the tag was permanent most slackers didnt mind they worked less got the same salary and ran almost no risk of being fired unless they stole money from a client or got caught in a sex scandal their bonuses were small but who needs a bonus when you have a fat paycheck career slackers could slide for six or seven years at a firm before being informed they would not make partner and shown the door what about jeff tabor doug asked i know him well definitely not a slacker he has the reputation of being a gunner doug said yes and thats accurate hes competitive but hes not a cutthroat you like him kyle yes tabors a good guy smart as hell evidently not smart enough bard said that bar exam problem kyle had no comment and no comment was necessary because a yellow cab swerved in front of them cutting off the jaguar and forcing kyle to slam on the brakes and hit the horn at the same time a fist shot out from the drivers window then an angry middle finger and kyle received his first bird be cool he said to himself you gotta watch these idiots doug said the sound of important papers being extracted crackled from the backseat and kyle knew something was being reviewed will we get judge hennessy or his magistrate doug asked bard kyle was shut out of the conversation which was fine with him he preferred to concentrate on the street in front of him and he had no interest in assessing the performance of his colleagues after ten minutes of downtown traffic kyle was wet under the collar and breathing heavy theres a lot at the corner of nassau and chambers two blocks from the courthouse bard announced kyle nodded nervously he found the lot but it was full and this caused all manner of cursing in the rear seat peckham took charge look kyle were in a hurry just drop us off in front of the courthouse at foley square then circle the block until you find a spot on the street a spot on which street doug was stuffing papers back into his briefcase bard suddenly had business on the phone i dont care any street and if you cant find a spot then just keep making the block let us out here kyle cut to the curb and a horn erupted somewhere behind them both lawyers scrambled out of the rear seat peckhams final words were just keep moving okay youll find something bard managed to tear himself away from his phone conversation long enough to say and be careful its my wifes alone kyle eased away and tried to relax he headed north on centre street drove four blocks then turned left on leonard and headed west every inch of available space was packed with vehicles and motorbikes an amazing abundance of signs warned against parking anywhere near a potential space kyle had never noticed so many threatening signs he passed no parking garages but he did pass several traffic cops working the streets slapping tickets on windshields after a long slow block he turned left on broadway and the traffic was even heavier he inched along for six blocks then turned left onto chambers two blocks later he was back at the courthouse in which he was supposed to be making his debut as a litigator if only as a reserve left on centre left on leonard left on broadway left on chambers back at the courthouse ever concerned about billing he noted the time the second loop ate seventeen minutes of the clock and along the way kyle again saw nowhere to park he saw the same signs same traffic cops same street bums same drug dealer sitting on a bench working his cell phone nine oclock came and went without a call from peckham not even a quick where the hell are you the hearing was under way but without kyle the litigator kyle the chauffeur though was hard at work after three loops he was bored with the route and added extra blocks to the north and west he thought about stopping for a coffee to go but decided against it out of fear of spilling something onto the fine beige leather of bards wifes new jaguar he had settled into the leather and was comfortable behind the wheel it was a very nice car a hundred thousand dollars and no doubt worth every penny the gas tank was halffull and this was worrying him the stopandgo driving was a strain on such a large engine the hearing that he was missing was an important one no doubt requiring the presence of many highpowered lawyers all anxious to plead their positions and things might drag on for a long time it was obvious that every legal parking spot in lower manhattan was taken and with clear instructions to just keep moving kyle accepted the fact that he had no choice but to burn fuel he began to look for a gas station hed fill the tank bill the client and score a few points with bard once the tank was full he began to ponder other ways to score points a quick car wash a quick lube job when he passed the courthouse for the seventh or eighth time a street vendor selling soft pretzels looked at him spread his arms and said something like are you crazy man but kyle was unperturbed he decided against a wash or oil change now confident in traffic he picked up his phone and called dale she answered on the third ring and in a hushed voice said im in the library are you okay yes thats not what i hear a pause i havent slept in two nights i think im delirious you sound terrible where are you right now im on leonard street driving noel bards wifes new jaguar what do you think im doing sorry i asked how was the funeral terrible lets do dinner tonight i need to unload on someone im going home tonight to bed to sleep you have to eat ill grab some chinese well have a glass of wine then sleep together no sex whatsoever weve done it before well see i gotta get out of here later are you gonna make it i doubt it at am kyle congratulated himself because he could now bill the client for driving in circles then he laughed at himself editor in chief of the yale law journal behind the wheel here making perfect turns clean stops and goes taking in the sights dodging the cabs ah the life of a bigtime wall street lawyer if his father could see him now the call came at bard said were leaving the courtroom what happened to you i couldnt find a parking space where are you two blocks from the courthouse pick us up where you dropped us off my pleasure minutes later kyle wheeled to the curb like a veteran driver and his two passengers jumped into the rear seat he pulled away and said where to the office came the terse reply from peckham and for several minutes nothing was said kyle expected to be grilled about what hed been doing for the past few hours where were you kyle why did you miss the hearing kyle but nothing sadly he began to realize that he had not been missed at all to create some noise he finally asked so howd the hearing go it didnt said peckham what hearing said bard what have you been doing since am kyle asked waiting for the honorable theodore hennessy to shake off his hangover and grace us with his presence bard said it was postponed for two weeks peckham said as they stepped off the elevator on the thirtysecond floor kyles phone vibrated a text message from tabor read hurry to cube problem tabor met him at the stairs so how was court great i love litigation whats the problem they were walking quickly through the hall past sandra the secretary its dale tabor whispered she fainted collapsed passed out something where is she ive hidden the body at the cube dale was lying peacefully on a sleeping bag partially hidden under tabors desk her eyes were open she seemed alert but her face was very pale she woke up at five tuesday morning and she hasnt slept since thats about fiftyfive hours which might be a record kyle knelt beside her gently took her wrist and said you okay she nodded yes but was not convincing tabor the lookout glanced around and kept talking she doesnt want anyone to know okay i say we call the nurse she says no what do you say kyle dont tell anyone dale said her voice low and raspy i fainted thats all im fine your pulse is good kyle said can you walk i think so then the three of us will slip out for a quick lunch kyle said ill take you home and youre going to rest tabor call a car with a hand under each arm they slowly pulled her up she stood took deep breaths and said i can walk were right beside you kyle said they caught a curious glance or two as they left the building one petite welldressed young associate with very pale skin arm in arm with two of her colleagues off for a quick lunch no doubt but no one cared tabor helped her into the car then returned to the cube to cover their trails if necessary kyle halfcarried her up the three flights to her apartment then helped her undress and tucked her in he kissed her forehead turned off the lights and closed the door she did not move for hours in the den he took off his coat tie and shoes he covered the small kitchen table with his laptop firmfone and a file full of research for a memo hed been neglecting once he was fully situated his eyelids became heavier and heavier until he walked to the sofa for a quick nap tabor called an hour later and woke him up kyle assured him dale was sleeping well and would be fine after a long rest theres an announcement coming at pm tabor said big news about the split watch your emails at exactly pm scully pershing sent an email to all of its lawyers announcing the departure of six partners and thirtyone associates from its litigation practice group the names were listed the departures were effective as of pm that day the bulletin then proceeded with the standard drivel touting the greatness of the firm and assuring everyone that the split would have no impact on the firms ability to fully service the needs of its many wonderful and valuable clients kyle peeked through the bedroom door the patient was breathing nicely and had not changed positions he dimmed the lights in the den and stretched out on the sofa forget the memo forget the billing to hell with the firm at least for a few stolen moments how often would he have the chance to relax like this on a thursday afternoon the funeral seemed like a month ago pittsburgh was in another galaxy baxter was gone but not forgotten he needed joey but joey was gone too the vibration of the phone woke him again the email was from doug peckham and it read kyle major realignment in litigation ive been added to the trylon case so have you office of wilson rush am sharp tomorrow chapter for the senior litigation partner and member of the firms management committee the cost of square footage was not a concern wilson rushs office was spread over a large corner on the thirtyfirst floor an area at least four times larger than any kyle had yet seen mr rush evidently liked boats his polished and gleaming oak desk was mounted on four rudders from old sailing yachts a long credenza behind it held a collection of intricate models of sleek clippers and schooners every painting depicted a grand vessel at sea as kyle walked in and did a quick scan he caught himself almost waiting for the floor to rock and the salt water to splash across his feet but he forgot about the decor when mr rush said good morning kyle over here the great man was rising from a large conference table at the far end of his office a crowd had already gathered there and heavy lifting was under way kyle sat next to doug peckham quick introductions were made there were nine others present excluding mr rush and mr peckham and kyle recognized most of the faces including that of sherry abney the senior associate bennie had been shadowing she smiled kyle smiled back mr rush seated at the head of the table launched into a quick review of the current upheaval two of the partners whod mutinied with toby roland and seven of the thirtyone associates had been assigned to the trylon versus bartin case much more about that in a minute and it was imperative that the firms manpower be shuffled immediately because the client trylon was important and demanding therefore two partners doug peckham and a woman named isabelle gaffney were entering the fray along with eight associates mr rush was explaining how uneasy the inhouse boys at trylon were with the defections and how necessary it was to shore up the troops to literally throw more lawyers at ape and bartin dynamics isabelle or izzy behind her back was somewhat notorious because she had once required two associates to wait in the delivery room while she was temporarily sidetracked giving birth to a child firm lore held that no one had ever seen her smile and she wasnt about to smile as mr rush went on about the reshuffling and realigning and deft maneuvering of the unlimited legal talent at his disposal two firstyear associates were being added kyle and a mysterious young man from penn named atwater of the twelve litigation rookies atwater was by far the quietest and loneliest dale was a distant second but she had warmed up nicely at least in kyles opinion hed spent the night on her sofa again alone while she was dead to the world hed slept little there was too much to consider the shock of being assigned to the trylon case caused him to stare at the ceiling and mumble to himself the horror of baxters murder the images of the funeral and burial the harsh words of joey bernardo who could sleep with such nightmares rattling around late that night kyle had called peckham and picked and probed to find out why he had been selected to a case he had been rather vocal in trying to avoid peckham had no sympathy and was not in the mood to talk the decision had been made by wilson rush end of conversation mr rush was now going through the basics of the lawsuit material kyle had committed to memory weeks and months earlier binders were passed around a half hour dragged by and kyle began to wonder how a person as dull and methodical as wilson rush could be so successful in the courtroom discovery was under way with both parties at war over the documents at least twenty depositions had been scheduled kyle took notes because everyone else was taking notes but he was thinking about bennie did bennie already know that kyle had landed the prize position bennie had known every member of the trylon team he knew that sherry abney supervised jack mcdougle was there another spy in the firm another victim of bennie and his blackmail if so was this person watching kyle and reporting to bennie though he hated every meeting with bennie their next encounter would be the biggest challenge kyle would go through the motions and engage in somewhat civilized conversation with the man responsible for the murder of baxter tate and he would be forced to do so without a hint that he was remotely suspicious any questions mr rush asked sure kyle thought more questions than you can possibly answer after a full hour of update and review kyle atwater and the other six new associates were led by sherry abney to the secret room on the eighteenth floor secret to some but bennie and nigel certainly knew about it along the way they were introduced to a nonlawyer named gant a security expert of some variety gant stopped them at the door and explained that it was the only door one way in and one way out and a coded plastic strip smaller than a credit card was required for entry and exit each lawyer was given a card and every time the lawyer came or went it was recorded gant nodded at the ceiling and informed them that there were video cameras watching everything inside the room was about the size of wilson rushs office no windows bare walls drab olive carpet there was nothing in the room but ten square tables with a large computer on each one sherry abney took charge this case now has over four million documents and theyre all right here in our virtual warehouse she said patting a computer like a proud mother the actual paperwork is in secured storage in a facility in wilmington but you can access it all from one of these the main server is locked up in a room next door she kept patting these are pretty fancy computers custom made by a company youve never heard of and never will do not under any circumstances attempt to repair examine or just plain fiddle with the hardware the software is called sonic and it too is customized for this case its really just some home brew that our computer folks put together a variation of barrister with some bells and whistles added for security reasons pass code changes every week password changes every day sometimes twice a day when it changes you will receive a coded email if you try to access with the wrong code or password then all manner of hell breaks loose you could be fired she looked around with as much menace as possible then continued this system is selfcontained and cannot be accessed anywhere else within the firm or outside the firm its online you just cant get to it this is the only place the only room in which you are able to access the documents and this room is closed from pm until am sorry no allnighters in here but it is open seven days a week at her direction each associate sat down before a computer and was given a pass code and password there was nothing on the screen to indicate who manufactured the computer or who wrote the software sherry walked from lawyer to lawyer looking at the monitors and chatting like a college professor theres an extensive tutorial at the beginning and i strongly suggest you go through it today pull up the index the documents are classified in three basic groups with a hundred subgroups category a contains all the harmless junk that bartin has already been given letters emails office memos the list is endless category b has important materials that are discoverable though we have not handed all of them over category r for restricted is where youll find the good stuff about a million documents dealing with the technological research that is the heart of this little dispute its top secret classified and no one but the judge knows if it will ever be shown to bartin mr rush thinks not category r is privileged confidential attorneys work product when you enter category r a record of your entry automatically registers with mr gants computer right next door any questions all eight associates stared at their monitors all thinking the same thing there are four million documents in there and someone has to examine them sonic is amazing sherry said once you master it you will be able to find a document or group of documents within seconds ill be here for the rest of the day for a workshop the sooner you learn your way around our virtual library the easier your life will be at on friday afternoon kyle received an email from bennie it read lets meet tonight at details to follow bw kyle responded i cant bennie responded tomorrow afternoon say or kyle i cant bennie sunday night pm kyle i cant kyle was sleeping when someone rapped on the door of his apartment at ten minutes after seven on saturday morning who is it he yelled as he stumbled through his cluttered den bennie came the reply what do you want kyle demanded at the door ive brought you some coffee kyle unlocked and unchained the door and bennie walked by him quickly he was holding two tall paper cups of coffee he placed them on the counter and looked around what a dump he said i thought you were making some money what do you want kyle snapped i dont like being ignored bennie snapped back as he jerked around ready to pounce his face was taut and his eyes were hot he pointed a finger that came within inches of kyles face you do not ignore me understand he hissed it was the first real display of temper kyle had seen from him be cool kyle brushed by him their shoulders touching solidly and walked to the bedroom where he found a tshirt when he returned to the den bennie was removing the tops from the cups i want an update the nearest weapon was a cheap ceramic table lamp kyle had found at a secondhand store he took the coffee without saying thanks he glanced at the lamp and thought how nicely it would crack over bennies bald head how wonderful it would be to hear them break into pieces both lamp and skull and how easily he could pound away until the little bastard was dead but still bleeding on the cheap rug greetings from my old pal baxter kyle took a sip then took a breath both men were still standing bennie was wearing his gray trench coat kyle was decked out in red boxers and a wrinkled tshirt i got assigned to the trylon case yesterday big news huh or did you already know this bennies eyes revealed nothing he took a sip then said and the secret room on the eighteenth floor tell me about it kyle described it what about the computers manufacturer unknown basic desktop models but supposedly custom built for the project all linked to a server locked away next door lots of memory all the bells and whistles video cameras everywhere and a security expert next door monitoring everything its a dead end if you ask me theres no way to steal anything to which bennie offered a grunt and a smartass smirk weve cracked much bigger vaults i assure you of that everything can be stolen let us worry about that sonic is the software yes have you mastered it not yet ill go in later this morning for another lesson how many documents over four million that brought the only smile of the morning what about access to the room open seven days a week but closed from ten at night until six in the morning theres only one door and there are at least three cameras watching it does someone check you in i dont think so but the key leaves a record of each entry and exit let me see the key kyle reluctantly got the key from his room and handed it over bennie examined it like a surgeon then gave it back i want you to visit the room as often as possible over the next few days but dont arouse any suspicions go at different hours watch everything well meet at ten on tuesday night room four seasons hotel on fiftyseventh got it sure no surprises yes sir chapter with seventyeight thousand lawyers in manhattan the selection of one should not have been so difficult kyle narrowed his list did more research added names and deleted names he had begun the secret project not long after he arrived in the city and had abandoned it several times he was never sure he would actually hire a lawyer but wanted the name of a good one just in case baxters murder changed everything kyle not only wanted protection now he wanted justice roy benedict was a criminal defense lawyer with a twohundredman firm located in a tall building one block east of scully pershing the location of the chosen lawyer was crucial given the attention paid to kyles movements benedict measured up in other important areas as well he had worked for the fbi before law school at nyu and after graduation spent six years with the department of justice he had contacts old friends people on the other side of the street now but people he could trust crime was his specialty he was ranked in the top one hundred of the citys whitecollar defense specialists but not in the top ten kyle needed solid advice but he couldnt afford an ego benedicts firm was often listed as opposing counsel in lawsuits involving scully pershing the icing on the cake was his basketball career at duquesne some twentyfive years earlier on the phone he seemed to have little time for small talk and said he wasnt taking any new cases but the basketball angle opened the door the appointment was at pm on monday and kyle arrived early he found it impossible to walk through the law firm without comparing it with his it was smaller and it spent less trying to impress visitors with abstract art and designer furniture the receptionists were not as cute in his briefcase he had a file on roy benedict old stats and photos from duquesne bios from legal directories newspaper stories about two of his more notorious cases he was fortyseven six feet six and appeared to be in great shape ready for a pickup game his office was busy smaller than most of the partners at scully but nicely appointed benedict was cordial and genuinely pleased to meet another new york lawyer whod played for the dukes kyle explained that he didnt play much the basketball talk dragged on and kyle cut things off by saying look mr benedict its roy okay roy i cant spend too much time here because im being followed a few seconds passed as roy allowed this to sink in and why is a firstyear associate at the biggest law firm in the world being followed i have a few problems its complicated and i think i need a lawyer i do nothing but whitecollar crime kyle have you screwed up in that area not yet but im being pressured to commit a whole list of crimes roy bounced a pencil on his desk tried to think of how to proceed i really need a lawyer kyle said my initial retainer is fifty grand roy said and watched carefully for a response he knew within how much kyle was earning as a firstyear associate his firm didnt try to compete with scully pershing but it came close i cant pay that much i have five thousand in cash kyle yanked an envelope from his pocket and tossed it on the desk give me some time and ill get the rest what does this case involve rape murder theft wiretapping extortion blackmail and a few others i cant give you the details until we reach an agreement roy nodded then smiled theres someone following you now oh yes ive been under surveillance since early february back at yale is your life in danger kyle thought for a moment yes i believe so the air was thick with unanswered questions and roys curiosity got the best of him he opened a drawer and withdrew some papers he scanned them quickly three sheets stapled together added some notes with a pen then slid them across this is a contract for legal services kyle read it hurriedly the initial retainer had been reduced to the hourly rate cut in half from to kyle had just recently accepted the fact that he charged an hour now he would be the client paying that much he signed his name and said thanks roy took the envelope and placed it in the drawer where do we begin he asked and kyle sank deeper into his chair a huge weight was leaving him he wasnt sure if the nightmare was coming to an end or if he was digging a deeper hole but the fact that he had someone to talk to was beyond comforting kyle closed his eyes and said i dont know theres so much ground to cover whos following you government agents of some sort no private thugs very good ones and i have no idea who they are why dont we start at the beginning okay kyle began with elaine the party the accusations of rape the investigation he introduced bennie and his boys his blackmail the video his covert mission to steal documents from scully pershing he produced a file and spread out the photos of bennie along with the composites of nigel and two of the street thugs whod been following him bennie wright is just an alias the guy probably has twenty names he speaks with a slight accent thats probably eastern european just a guess roy studied the photo of bennie is there a way to identify him kyle asked i dont know do you know where he is here in new york i saw him on saturday and ill meet him again tomorrow night hes my handler im his asset keep talking kyle removed another file and went through the basics of the trylonbartin war and in doing so discussed only the facts that had been published in news stories even though roy was his lawyer and sworn to confidentiality kyle was a lawyer too and his client expected the same its the largest pentagon contract in history so its potentially the biggest lawsuit ever filed roy spent a few minutes scanning the articles then said ive heard of it keep talking kyle described the surveillance and eavesdropping and roy forgot about trylon and bartin wiretapping carries five years federal he said wiretapping is nothing what about murder who got murdered kyle raced through joeys involvement then the surprising arrival of baxter and his desire to reach out to the girl he handed over a dozen newspaper reports on the random shooting of baxter tate i saw something about this in the news roy said i was a pallbearer at his funeral last wednesday kyle said im sorry thanks the cops have no clue im sure bennie ordered the hit but the killers have vanished why would bennie kill baxter tate roy alternated between scribbling notes looking at the face of bennie wright and picking through the file but for the most part he just shook his head in confusion and disbelief he had no choice kyle said if baxter succeeded in making some harebrained confession to elaine which certainly appeared likely then the events that follow are out of control i think the girl goes nuts cries rape again and im dragged back to pittsburgh along with joey and alan strock my life is derailed i leave the firm leave new york and bennie loses his asset but with baxter dead doesnt the rape case lose some steam yes but the video is still out there and believe me we want no part of it its brutal but it doesnt implicate you only for being a drunken idiot when the sex begins im nowhere to be seen i dont even remember it and you have no idea how bennie got the video thats the greatest question of all one that ive asked myself every hour for the past nine months the fact that he somehow heard of the video then stole it or bought it is something i cannot comprehend i dont know which is more terrifying the video itself or the fact that bennie got his hands on it roy was shaking his head again he stood and unfolded his gangly frame he stretched and kept shaking his head how many interns did scully pershing hire the summer before last around a hundred so bennie and his group get the names of a hundred summer interns and they investigate them looking for an achilles heel when they get to your name on the list they snoop around pittsburgh and duquesne they probably hear about the rape lean on someone in the police department get the rape file and decide to dig even deeper the file is closed so the cops talk more than they should there was the rumor about a video but the cops could never find it somehow bennie does yep hes got plenty of money and plenty of people obviously so whos he working for roy glanced at his watch frowned and said i have a meeting at three he grabbed his desk phone waited then barked cancel my three oclock and no interruptions he fell into his chair and rubbed his chin with his knuckles i doubt if he works for ape i cannot believe that a rival law firm would spend this kind of money to break so many laws its inconceivable bartin much more probable plenty of money plenty of motive im sure bartin is convinced the documents were stolen from them so why not steal them back any other suspects oh please kyle were talking about military technology the chinese and the russians prefer to steal what they cant develop thats the nature of the game we dazzle with the research they just steal it but using a law firm the law firm is probably just one piece of the puzzle they have spies in other places and there are more people like bennie who have no name and no home and ten passports hes probably a welltrained former intelligence pro who now hires himself out for a zillion dollars to do exactly what hes doing he killed baxter roy shrugged killing doesnt bother this guy great just when i was starting to feel better roy smiled but the wrinkles never left his forehead look give me a few days to digest this we need to move fast i now have access to the documents and bennies much more excited youll see him tomorrow night yes at the four seasons hotel on fiftyseventh care to join the party thanks how long do these little meetings last ten minutes if im lucky we bitch and bark and then i slam the door on the way out i act tough but the whole time im scared to death i need help roy youve come to the right place thanks i gotta go doofus is waiting doofus kyle stood and reached across the desk he picked out a composite and laid it on top of the pile meet doofus probably the worst of the street crawlers whove shadowed me for the past nine months his buddy there is rufus hes bad too but not as bad as doofus i have become so adept at appearing to be so clueless that these clowns think they can follow me in their sleep they make a lot of mistakes they shook hands and said goodbye and long after kyle was gone roy stared at his window and tried to absorb it all a twentyfiveyearold former editor in chief of the yale law journal being stalked on the streets of new york city by a deadly group of professional operatives who are blackmailing him into spying on his own law firm roy was awestruck by the scenario he smiled and reminded himself of how much he loved his job there were a few bright spots in the ugly split among the firms litigators more partners would be needed and sooner advancement opportunities were created with all those gaps to fill and most crucial to the firstyear associates offices had been emptied the jockeying began as soon as the malcontents fled over the weekend tabor nailed down a place of his own and had moved his junk by sunday night kyle gave little thought to a move hed grown accustomed to his little cubicle and he enjoyed having dale close by they groped occasionally when they were completely safe he looked forward to her daily appearance and expected a full rundown on what she was wearing and who designed it discussing her clothes was almost as much fun as removing them he was surprised when sherry abney dropped by late monday afternoon and asked him to follow her they took the stairs one floor up to the thirtyfourth and after walking past a dozen doors she stopped stepped in and said this is yours it was a twelvebytwelve square room with a glass desk leather chairs handsome rug and a window that faced south and allowed real sunlight to pass through kyle was overwhelmed why me he wanted to ask but he pretended to take it in stride compliments of wilson rush she said nice kyle said stepping to the window you share a secretary with cunningham next door im just down the hall if you need anything id get myself moved in because mr rush might stop by for a quick inspection moving took fifteen minutes kyle made four trips back and forth and during his last one dale carried his sleeping bag and laptop she was genuinely happy for him and even passed along a few decorating ideas too bad you dont have a sofa she said not at the office dear then where and when i take it youre in the mood i need to be loved or at least lusted after how about dinner then a quickie how about a marathon then a quick dinner oh boy they sneaked out of the building at pm and took a cab to her apartment kyle was unbuttoning his shirt when his firmfone buzzed with an email sent by an unknown partner to about a dozen grunts all hands were needed on deck immediately for an urgent orgy of work that was absolutely critical to the future of the firm kyle ignored it and turned off the lights chapter for no reason other than sheer obstinacy kyle arrived fortyfive minutes late for the tuesday night meeting at the four seasons he expected to see nigel so he was not surprised when bennies sidekick met him at the door and pretended to be pleased to see him kyle old boy how have you been he chirped with a fake smile marvelous and your name is nigel oh yeah i forgot last name sorry old boy do you have a last name or do you have so many you cant remember which one fits right now good evening kyle bennie said rising to his feet folding a newspaper so nice to see you bennie kyle placed his briefcase on the bed but did not remove his trench coat now who called this meeting he asked tell us about the room on the eighteenth floor bennie said abandoning any more preliminaries ive already described it nigel fired away ten monitors on ten tables right kyle yes and where are the computers themselves on the tables next to the monitors the computers kyle tall and thin short and fat give us a hint here more of a square box to the right of each monitor on the dresser next to the television there was a thin notebook already opened nigel lunged for it and said take a look at these computers kyle all shapes and sizes various makes from around the world see anything remotely similar kyle methodically flipped through it each page had color photos of eight computers ten pages in all eighty machines that varied wildly in design and construction he settled on one that looked more like a color jet printer than a computer yes rather square nigel observed how many disc drives none none are you certain kyle yes these were custom built for maximum security there are no disc drives no ports no way to transfer the data control panel switches buttons lights anything kyle nothing plainvanilla box and the server locked up next door out of sight interesting and the monitors kyle basic lcd flat screens lets take a peek nigel said as he opened the notebook to another section this one filled with an assortment of monitors size kyle fourteen inches fullcolor display im sure yes kyle stopped on the third page and pointed this one is very close excellent kyle and printers none nowhere in the room not a single printer none nigel paused to scratch his face and ponder this suppose youre working on a brief or a memo when its time to produce it what happens you notify your supervisor who then enters the room pulls it up reviews it and so on if it is to be submitted to the court or to the opposing attorneys its printed where i thought there were no printers theres a machine in a room next door with a paralegal who monitors the printing every sheet of paper thats printed is coded and duplicated its impossible to print anything without leaving a trail quite nice really with that nigel took a sharp step back and relaxed bennie took over kyle how many times have you entered the room once a day for the last five days and how many people are normally in the room it varies sunday afternoon i was alone for about an hour this morning there were five or six others have you been there late at night when they close the room no not yet do it okay be there at ten one night i cant go there just to hang out bennie its not a coffee room surveillance is constant cameras watching and all that there has to be a reason to be there other than casing the joint does anyone notice when you come and go theres not a guard at the door the key makes a record of each entry and exit and im sure its all recorded by closed circuit do you take your briefcase in with you no are briefcases forbidden no do you wear your jacket no jackets are not required around the office bennie and nigel studied each other for a minute or so both minds hard at work will you go there tomorrow bennie asked maybe im not sure right now it depends on what im asked to do in the morning i want you to enter the room tomorrow carrying your briefcase and wearing your jacket as soon as youre settled in take off your jacket keep the briefcase under the table will this work kyle nigel piled on quickly oh sure why not anything else and what if i haul in a box of tacos and drop cheddar crumbs on the keyboard where is this going just trust us here kyle nigel said gently we know what were doing youre the last person id trust now kyle look im tired id really like to go what are your plans for the next few days bennie asked ill work tomorrow leave the office around five take the train to philly rent a car and drive to york im having thanksgiving dinner with my father on thursday ill be back in the city late friday afternoon and back at the office early saturday good enough well meet sunday night bennie said your place or mine ill pass along the details happy thanksgiving boys kyle said as he left the room on his new office door kyle hung two waterproof allpurpose trench coats one black and the other one a light brown the black one he wore every day to and from work and when moving around the city the brown one was used rarely only on those occasions when kyle really didnt want to be followed at on wednesday he draped it over his arm and rode the elevator to the second floor from there he took a service elevator to the basement put on the trench coat and ducked through the rows of thick plumbing pipes and electrical cables and heating units until he came to a metal stairway he spoke to a technician one hed spoken to on several occasions he saw daylight in a narrow alley that barely separated his building from the fifty story edifice next door ten minutes later he walked into the office of roy benedict they had chatted briefly on the phone and kyle was uneasy about the plan roy was not at all uneasy he had studied the file analyzed the facts and issues weighed the predicament and was ready to move i have a friend with the fbi he began a friend i trust completely we worked together years ago before i became a lawyer and even though we are now on opposite sides of the street i trust him even more hes a heavyweight here in the new york office kyle flashed back to his last encounter with the fbi fake names fake badges a long night in a hotel room with bennie im listening kyle said with skepticism i want to meet with him and lay everything on the table everything what will he do crimes have been committed crimes are in process crimes are being planned and not small crimes i suspect he will be as shocked as i am i suspect the fbi will get involved so bennie gets nabbed by the feds sure dont you want him locked up for life but he has a vast network out there in the shadows the fbi knows how to lay its traps they screw up occasionally but their record is very good i deal with them all the time kyle i know how smart these guys are if i talk to them now theyll move in quietly and lay the groundwork when they want to they can throw a whole army at the enemy right now you need an army thanks i need your permission to talk to the fbi is there a chance theyll take a look and let it pass yes but i doubt it when will you talk to your friend maybe as early as this afternoon kyle barely hesitated lets do it he said chapter it was almost midnight when kyle quietly slipped through the unlocked kitchen door of his family home in york all lights were off his father knew he would be arriving late but john mcavoy let nothing interfere with a nights sleep zack the ancient border collie whod never met an intruder he didnt like managed to rouse himself from his pillow in the breakfast nook and say hello kyle rubbed his head thankful to see the dog one more time zacks age and exact lineage had never been clear he was a gift from a client partial payment on a fee and he liked to spend his days under the desk of john mcavoy sleeping through all sorts of legal problems he usually ate lunch in the firms kitchen with one of the secretaries kyle kicked off his loafers sneaked up the stairs to his bedroom and within minutes was under the covers and dreaming less than five hours later john practically kicked in the door and boomed lets go knucklehead you can sleep when youre dead in a drawer kyle found an old set of his thermal underwear and a pair of wool socks and in the closet among a collection of dusty old clothes that dated back to high school he pulled out his hunting overalls without a woman in the house the dust and spiderwebs and unused garments were accumulating his boots were precisely where hed left them a year earlier last thanksgiving john was at the kitchen table preparing for war three rifles with scopes were laid out next to several boxes of ammo kyle whod learned the art and rules of hunting as a child knew his father had thoroughly cleaned the rifles the night before good morning john said you ready yep wheres the coffee in the thermos what time did you get in just a few hours ago youre young lets go they loaded the gear into the latemodel ford pickup fourwheel drive johns preferred means of transportation in and around york fifteen minutes after crawling out of bed kyle was riding through the darkness of a frigid thanksgiving morning sipping black coffee and nibbling on a granola bar the town was soon behind them the roads became narrower john was working a cigarette the smoke drifting through a small crack in the drivers window he usually said little in the mornings for a man whose day was spent in the midst of a busy smalltown law office with phones ringing and clients waiting and secretaries scurrying about john needed the solitude of the early hours kyle though still sleepy was almost numb with the shock of open spaces empty roads no people the great outdoors what exactly had been the attraction of a big city they stopped at a gate kyle opened it and john drove through then they continued deeper into the hills there was still no trace of sun in the east so hows the romance kyle said finally attempting conversation his father had mentioned a new girlfriend a serious one off and on shes cooking dinner tonight and her name is zoe zoe zoe its greek is she greek her mother is greek her father is an anglo mix shes a mutt like the rest of us is she cute john thumped ashes out the window you think id date her if she wasnt cute yes i remember rhoda what a dog rhoda was hot you just didnt appreciate her beauty the truck hit a rough section of gravel road and bounced them around wheres zoe from reading why all the questions how old is she fortynine and hot you gonna marry her i dont know weve talked about it the road went from gravel to dirt at the edge of a field john parked and turned off the lights whose property is this kyle asked softly as they gathered their rifles it used to be owned by zoes exhusbands family she got it in the divorce two hundred acres crawling with deer come on true all legal and aboveboard and you handled the divorce five years ago but i didnt start dating her until last year maybe it was the year before i really cant remember were hunting on zoes property yes but she doesnt care ah the smalltown practice of law kyle thought to himself for twenty minutes they hiked along the edge of the woods without a word they stopped under an elm tree just as the first hint of light fell across the valley before them bill henry killed an eightpoint last week just over that ridge there john said pointing there are some big bucks in here if he can get one anybody can a deer stand had been built in the elm twenty feet up with a rickety ladder leading to it you take this stand john said ill be a hundred yards that way in another one nothing but bucks okay got it is your hunting license current i dont think so no big deal lesters still the game warden i kept his son out of jail last month a drug head meth john walked away and as he disappeared into the darkness he said you stay awake now kyle tucked the rifle over his shoulder and crawled up the ladder the deer stand was a small platform made of planks and twobyfours anchored into the elm and like all deer stands it was constructed with little thought to comfort he twisted one way then another and finally situated himself with his rear on the planks his back to the bark his feet dangling hed been in deer stands since he was five years old and had learned the lessons of complete stillness a soft breeze rustled a few leaves the sun was rising fast the deer would soon quietly ease from the woods to the edge of the field in search of fescue and field corn the rifle was a remington a gift for his fourteenth birthday he tucked it firmly across his chest and promptly dozed off the crack of a gunshot jolted him from his nap and he swung the rifle around ready to fire he glanced at his watch a fortyminute nap to his left in the direction of his father he saw several white tails bouncing in a rapid getaway ten minutes passed with no word from john hed obviously missed with his first shot and was still in the stand an hour passed without a sighting and kyle fought to stay awake thanksgiving day the offices of scully pershing were officially closed but he knew that a few of the gunners were there casually dressed in jeans and boots and billing away there were a few partners hard at work all with deadlines screaming at them he shook his head sounds were approaching footsteps unconcerned with making noise john was soon near the elm lets go he said theres a creek just beyond the field a favorite watering hole kyle lowered himself carefully and when his feet were on the ground john said you didnt see that buck nope i dont know how you missed it it ran right in front of you the one you shot at yeah at least a tenpointer i guess you missed it too they returned to the truck and went for the thermos as they sat on the tailgate sipping strong coffee from paper cups and finishing the last of the granola bars kyle said dad i dont want to hunt anymore we need to talk his father listened calmly at first then lit a cigarette as kyle plowed through the rape investigation he expected an eruption a series of sharp and painful questions about why he had not called his father but john listened intently without a word as if he knew this story and had been expecting the confession the first flash of anger came when bennie entered the narrative they blackmailed you he said then lit another cigarette son of a bitch just listen okay kyle pleaded and went full speed ahead the details came in torrents and several times he raised his hand to keep from being interrupted after a while john became stoic absorbing it all in disbelief but saying nothing the video joey baxter the murder trylon and bartin and the secret room on the eighteenth floor the meetings with bennie nigel the plan to filch the documents and hand them to the enemy and finally the hiring of roy benedict and the appearance of the fbi kyle apologized repeatedly for not trusting his father he admitted his mistakes too numerous to recall at that moment he laid open his soul and when he finished hours later it seemed the sun was well into the sky the coffee was long gone the deer long forgotten i think i need some help kyle said you need your ass kicked for not telling me yes i do good lord son what a mess i had no choice i was terrified of the video and the thought of another rape investigation was just too much if you saw the video youd understand they left the rifles in the truck and went for a long hike along a narrow trail through the woods the feast of turkey dressing and all the trimmings had been prepared by a deli that sold the whole package to those who preferred not to be troubled as john set the dining room table kyle left to fetch his mother patty answered her door with a smile and a long hug she was up and properly medicated she escorted kyle through her apartment and couldnt wait to show off her latest masterpieces he eventually led her back to the door and down to his rental car and they enjoyed a quick drive through york she was wearing lipstick makeup and a pretty orange dress that kyle remembered from his teenage years and her hair was clean neat and almost white she chattered nonstop with news about locals shed known years ago bouncing from one subject to another with a randomness that would have been comical under other circumstances kyle was relieved thered been an even chance she would be off her meds and out of her mind his parents greeted each other with a polite hug and the small struggling family worked its way through the gossip about the twin daughters neither of whom had been back to york in over a year one was in santa monica the other in portland they called both and passed around the phone the television was on in the den muted a football game waiting to be watched at the dining table kyle poured three glasses of wine though his mother wouldnt touch it youre drinking wine these days john said to kyle as he sat the small turkey on the table not much the two men served patty fussed over her worked hard to make her comfortable she prattled on about her art and about events in york that happened years earlier she managed to ask a few questions about kyle and his career in new york and he made his life sound enviable the strain from events in new york was palpable but patty did not notice she ate almost nothing but her son and exhusband devoured the lunch as quickly as possible after pecan pie and coffee she announced she wanted to go home to her work she was tired she said and kyle wasted no time loading her up for the tenminute drive one football game blurred into another kyle on the sofa and john in a recliner watched the games between naps and said little the air was heavy with things unsaid questions that came and went plans that needed to be discussed the father wanted to lecture and yell but the son was too vulnerable too dependent at that moment lets go for a walk kyle said when it was almost dark walk where around the block i need to talk cant we talk here lets walk they bundled up and put zack on a leash they were on the sidewalk when kyle said im sorry but i dont like to have serious conversations indoors john lit a cigarette with the ease of a longtime smoker perfect coordination without missing a step im almost afraid to ask why not bugs mikes nasty little twerps listening to conversations let me get this straight you think that my house might be bugged by these thugs they were strolling along the street kyle had roamed as a child he knew the owner of every home at least the owners back then and every home had a story he nodded at one and asked whatever happened to mr polk dead finally lived in a wheelchair for almost fifty years very sad back to my question were not walking down memory lane here okay no i dont think your house is bugged nor your office but theres a chance these guys believe in surveillance and have an unlimited budget bugging is easy ask me im an expert i could make a homemade listening device in half an hour with a few items from radioshack and how did you acquire such knowledge books manuals theres a great little spy store in manhattan and i drop in occasionally when im able to lose my tail this is unbelievable kyle if i didnt know better id say youre cracking up you sound schizophrenic like a few of my clients im not crazy yet but ive learned to play it safe and have the serious conversations outdoors your apartment is bugged oh yes i know of at least three listening devices hidden in the place one is in the ac vent above the sofa in the den theres one hidden in the bedroom wall just above the chest of drawers and theres one in the kitchen in a door facing i cant really examine them because there are also three tiny cameras at least three that watch me continuously when im in the apartment which is not very often ive managed to locate these devices by pretending to do all sorts of routine chores around the place cleaning vents washing windows scrubbing floors the place is a dump but its pretty clean and your phone i still have the old one from law school and theyre listening thats why i havent switched i know theyre listening and so i give them enough harmless crap to make them happy i installed a landline in the apartment and im sure its bugged i havent been able to inspect it though because the cameras are watching i use it just for harmless stuff ordering a pizza bitching at my landlord calling a car service kyle pulled out the firmfone and glanced at it this is one the firm gave us on day one im pretty sure this one is bugfree the question is why is it in your pocket on thanksgiving day habit its turned off for serious stuff i use the desk phone in my office i figure that if they can bug the office phones then were all really screwed oh youre screwed theres no doubt about that you shouldve told me months ago i know i shouldve done a lot of things differently but i didnt have the benefit of hindsight i was scared still am zack stopped at a fire hydrant john needed another smoke the wind had picked up and leaves were blowing and landing around them it was dark and they still had dinner at zoes they made the block and talked about the future chapter the associates whod dared to slack off by leaving for the short holiday break returned with a vengeance early saturday morning the time away was refreshing though the strain of frenzied travel left them even more exhausted and time off also meant no billing kyle punched his clock at am sharp when he entered the secret room on the eighteenth floor and settled himself at one of the workstations four other members of team trylon were there lost in a virtual world of endless research he nodded to a couple but no one spoke he wore jeans and a wool sport coat and he hauled in his black bally briefcase six inches thick and showing some wear hed bought it at a shop on fifth avenue a week before orientation all briefcases at the firm were black he placed it on the floor beside him partially under the table directly under the plainvanilla computer that had so captivated dear nigel he withdrew a legal pad then a file and before long his workstation looked authentic after a few minutes he took off his jacket hung it on the back of his chair and rolled up his sleeves trylon was now paying old scully an additional four hundred bucks an hour a quick look around the room revealed one other briefcase all other jackets and coats had been left upstairs in the offices the hours began to drag by as kyle lost himself in the futuristic world of the b hypersonic bomber and the people who designed it the only good thing about the secret room was the prohibition against cell phones after a few hours kyle needed a break and he wanted to check his messages specifically he was waiting to hear from dale who hadnt bothered to show up on such a beautiful morning he walked to his office closed the door which was a minor violation of firm policy and called her private cell phone as a refuge from the muchhated firmfone every associate carried a private one as well yes she answered where are you im still in providence are you coming back to new york im not sure need i remind you young lady that this is the third consecutive day in which you have not billed a single hour i take it youre at the office yes racking up hours along with every other firstyear grunt everyones here but you fire me sue me i dont care youll never make partner with that attitude promise i was thinking about dinner tonight theres a new restaurant in the east village that just got two stars from frank bruni are you asking me out for a date please we can split the check since we work for a genderneutral firm youre so romantic we could do the romance later so thats what youre really after always i get in around seven ill call you then kyle clipped trylon for twelve hours then called a sedan for the ride to dinner the restaurant had twenty tables a turkish menu and no dress requirement though jeans were preferred after the twostar review by the times the place was crowded kyle got a table only because there had been a cancellation dale was at the bar sipping white wine and looking almost serene they kissed a peck on each cheek then squeezed together and started talking about their thanksgiving holidays as if theyd just had a month at the beach both of her parents taught mathematics at providence college and though wonderful people they had a rather dull existence dales gift for math led to a relatively quick phd but she began to fear shed wind up much like her parents the law beckoned her the law as portrayed in film and on television as nonstop excitement the law as the cornerstone of democracy and the front lines for so many social conflicts she had excelled at law school received offers from the top firms and now after three months of practice she sorely missed mathematics later at their table and still sipping wine she was quick to confess some exciting news i had a job interview this morning i thought you had a job yes but it sucks theres a boutique firm in providence downtown in a beautiful old building i got a job there one summer when i was in college making copies and coffee and doing the general gofer routine about twenty lawyers half women a general practice i talked them into an interview on a saturday morning but you have a cherished associates position with the largest firm in the world what more could you want a life the same thing you want i want to be a partner so i can sleep until am every day until i die at fifty thats what i want look around kyle very few stay more than three years the smart ones are gone after two the crazy ones make a career out of it so youre leaving im not cut out for this i thought i was pretty tough but you can have it the waiter took their orders and poured more wine they were side by side in a narrow half booth with a view of the restaurant kyles hand was between her knees under the table when are you leaving he asked as soon as humanly possible i practically begged for a job this morning if i dont get an offer ill keep knocking this is madness kyle and im checking out congratulations youll be the envy of our class what about you i have no idea i feel as though i just got here were all in shock but itll wear off its boot camp and were still sore from the initial bruising no more bruises for me ive collapsed once it wont happen again im slacking off to fifty hours a week and i dare them to say something go girl a platter of olives and goat cheese arrived and they toyed with it how was york she asked the same i had lunch with my real mother and dinner with my next one a quick deer hunt that killed nothing and some long talks with my dad about what the usual life the past the future nigel was present for the second meeting in a row and long before kyle arrived in the hotel suite preparations had been under way on a small desk nigel had set up a computer that looked very similar to those on the eighteenth floor next to it was a monitor that was identical to the one kyle had stared at for twelve hours the day before are we close here kyle nigel was singing away as he proudly revealed his copycat workstation please have a seat kyle sat at the desk with bennie and nigel watching every move it looks very similar kyle said just the hardware here kyle as you know not crucial but were trying to pinpoint the manufacturer thats all only the software matters we know that are we off the mark neither the computer nor the monitor had markings or names or models or makers they were as blandly generic as the ones they were trying to imitate these are very close kyle said look hard man and find something different nigel pressed he was beside kyle bent and staring at the screen the computer is slightly darker in color almost a gray and its sixteen inches wide and twenty inches tall you measured kyle obviously i used a fifteeninch legal pad bloody brilliant nigel exclaimed and seemed ready to hug kyle bennie couldnt hide a smile it has to be a fargo nigel said a what fargo kyle a specialty computer company in san diego big on government and military machines tons of work for the cia big stout computers with more security and more gadgets than you can believe i assure you of that you wont see one at the local mall no sir and fargo is owned by deene a client of you know who old scully protects its ass at a thousand bucks an hour as nigel chirped away he hit a button on the keyboard the screen became a page unlike any kyle had ever seen nothing from microsoft or apple now kyle tell me what the first page looks like anything remotely similar here no not even close the home page has one icon for the tutorial but thats it no other icons message boards edit bands format options nothing but an index to the documents you turn the computer on get through the pass codes and passwords then wait about ten seconds and presto youre into the library no system profiles no spec sheets no home page fascinating nigel said still staring at the monitor and the index kyle the index is a real challenge it starts with broad divisions of documents then it breaks down into subcategories and subgroups and subthis and subthat it takes some work to find the batch of documents youre looking for nigel took a step back and stretched bennie moved closer and said suppose you wanted to locate the research materials relating to the bs airbreathing engines and the various types of hydrogen fuel that were tested how would you get there i dont know i havent been there yet ive seen nothing about airbreathing engines the statement was true but kyle decided to draw a line at this point with over four million documents in play he could easily claim he had not seen whatever they were curious about but you could find these materials i could find them quickly once i knew where to look the sonic program is pretty fast but theres a ton of paper to sift through bennies movements were quick his words a little more urgent than usual nigel was downright giddy with kyles information it was obvious that his progress had them agitated you were in the room yesterday bennie asked yes all day with a briefcase and a jacket yes both no problem there was one other briefcase no one checks them when will you return to the room bennie asked the team meets in the morning and theres a good chance ill get another assignment monday or tuesday for sure lets meet tuesday night cant wait chapter now that he was an official member of team trylon kyle had the honor of beginning each week with a am monday chalk talk in a huge conference room hed never seen before after three months in the building he still marveled at the meeting areas and balconies and tuckedaway mezzanines and small libraries he was stumbling upon for the first time the firm needed its own guidebook the room was on the fortyfirst floor and large enough to house many smaller law firms the table in the center seemed as long as a bowling alley forty lawyers give or take a few crowded around it gulping coffee and settling in for another long week wilson rush stood at the far end and cleared his throat and everyone shut up and froze good morning well have our weekly session keep your comments brief this meeting will last for one hour only there was no doubt that they would leave at exactly am kyle was as far from rush as possible he kept his head low and took furious notes that no one not even himself could have read afterward each of the eight partners stood in turn and gave succinct updates on such gripping topics as the latest motions filed in the case the latest haggling over documents and experts the latest moves by ape and bartin doug peckham presented his first report on a complicated discovery motion it almost put kyle and the others to sleep but kyle stayed awake and while scribbling on a legal pad he kept telling himself not to smile at the absurdity of the moment he was a spy perfectly planted by his handler and now within reach of secrets that were so important he could not comprehend their value they were certainly valuable enough to cause men to commit murder kyle glanced up as isabelle gaffney took her turn on the floor and ignoring her words he looked at the far end of the bowling lane where wilson rush seemed to be glaring at him maybe not there was so much distance between them and the old man was wearing reading glasses so it was hard to tell exactly whom he was frowning at what would mr rush do if he knew the truth what would team trylon and the hundreds of other scully partners and associates do when they learned the truth about young kyle mcavoy former editor in chief of the yale law journal the consequences were horrifying the magnitude of the conspiracy caused kyles heart to hammer away his mouth became dry and he sipped lukewarm coffee he wanted to leap for the door sprint down fortyone flights of stairs and run through the streets of new york like a madman during lunch he used the basement exit ploy and hustled over to the office of roy benedict they chatted for a minute or two then roy said there were two people kyle should meet the first was his contact in the fbi the second was a senior lawyer in the department of justice kyle nervously agreed and they walked next door to a meeting room the fbi supervisor was joe bullington an affable sort with a big toothy smile and hearty handshake the man from justice was drew wingate a sourfaced sort who acted as though he preferred not to shake hands at all the four sat at a small conference table kyle and roy on one side the government guys on the other it was roys meeting and he took charge first of all kyle how much time do you have about an hour ive laid it all on the table ive had a dozen conversations with mr bullington and mr wingate and its important now for us to review where we are joe talk about the background on mr bennie wright always smiling bullington squeezed his hands together and began yes right well we ran the photo of this guy through our system i wont bore you with the details but we have some very sophisticated computers that store facial images of millions of people when we feed in a suspect the computers search and scan and in general do their thing with mr wright or whoever he is we came up with nothing no hit no clue we then sent it to the cia and they conducted a similar search different computers different software same result nothing were surprised frankly we were pretty confident we could identify this guy kyle was not surprised but he was disappointed hed read about the supercomputers used by the intelligence services and after a lifetime of living with bennie he really wanted to know who he was bullington brightened a bit and went on nigel might be a different story we placed your composite of him into our system and came up empty but the cia got a probable hit bullington opened a file pulled out an eightbyten black and white and handed it to kyle who immediately said thats him good his real name is deny hobart born in south africa raised in liverpool trained as a techie in the british intelligence services got bounced ten years ago for hacking into the confidential files of some rich folks in switzerland generally regarded as one of the most brilliant hackers in the world brilliant but a real rogue a hired gun warrants outstanding in at least three countries how much have you told these people wingate asked it was more of an accusation than a question kyle looked at his lawyer who nodded and said go ahead kyle youre not under any type of investigation youve done nothing wrong ive given them the layout of the computer room general stuff like that enough to keep them happy but no data whatsoever anyway bullington said the other two composites turned up nothing if i understand things these two boys are just part of the surveillance and not that important thats right kyle said your composite of mr hobert is remarkable kyle bullington said its from a web site quickfacecom anybody could do it whats your next step wingate asked we meet tomorrow night for an update the plan is for me to somehow hack into the system either download or divert the documents and hand them over i have no idea how this is supposed to be done the computer system looks completely secure when is this supposed to happen they havent told me but i get the impression it will be soon i have a question for you neither bullington nor wingate offered to take the question so kyle plunged ahead who are these guys who are they working for bullington flashed all of his teeth and said with a boyish shrug we honestly dont know kyle hobart is a whore who travels the world selling himself we have no clue where bennie comes from you say hes not american he doesnt sound like it without an idea as to who he is we cant even begin to guess who hes working for there were at least five agents involved in the first encounter back in february the night i first met bennie all five were definitely americans bullington was shaking his head probably hired guns kyle thugs brought in for the job paid turned loose theres a whole dark world out there of former cops and agents and former soldiers and intelligence types who got shoved out for a multitude of reasons most are misfits they were trained in the shadows and thats where they work theyll hire on with anyone wholl pay them those five probably had no idea what bennie was up to what are the chances of catching the ones who killed baxter tate the smile went away for a moment both government faces looked sad and perplexed bullington finally said first we have to catch bennie then we work our way up to the big boys who are paying him then well work our way down to the street thugs who do his dirty work if hes a pro though and its quite obvious that he is the chances of squeezing him for names are pretty slim how do you catch bennie thats the easy part youll lead us to him and you arrest him oh yes well have enough warrants to arrest him ten times wiretapping extortion conspiracy take your pick well throw him under the jail with hobart as well and no federal judge in the world will bond him out well probably move him to a secured facility far away from new york so we can begin the interrogation the image of bennie chained to a chair as a couple of pit bulls screamed at him was rather pleasant roy cleared his throat glanced at his watch and said if youll excuse us i need to talk to kyle ill call you later and with that kyle stood shook their hands again and followed his lawyer back to his office roy closed the door and said what do you think you trust those guys kyle shot back yes you dont would you trust them with your life yes try this scenario currently there are at least eighteen intelligence outfits in this country and those are just the ones on paper there are probably a few more we know nothing about what if bennie works for one of them suppose his project is just one of several to procure and protect all the secrets what if the supercomputers couldnt find his face because they werent supposed to thats a pretty ridiculous scenario kyle a rogue operative working for the united states spying on a us law firm killing us citizens i dont think so sure its ridiculous but when your skull might be the next target it does wonders for the imagination take it easy this is your only way out theres no way out yes there is lets take it one step at a time dont panic i havent panicked in nine months but im getting close no youre not be cool we have to trust those guys ill call you tomorrow kyle grabbed his brown trench coat and left the office chapter the cessna was owned by a retired doctor who flew it only in clear weather and never at night he had known john mcavoy for over forty years and had flown him several times around the state for legal matters their little trips were as much pleasure as business with john wearing a headset and taking the controls and thoroughly enjoying his time as the pilot they always haggled over the rate john wanted to pay more than just the fuel costs and the doctor demanded less because flying was his hobby and he didnt need the money once they agreed on the cost of the trip they met at the york airport early on tuesday morning and took off in perfect weather seventyone minutes later they landed in scranton john rented a car and the doctor left in the cessna to drop in on his son in williamsport the law office of michelin chiz was on the second floor of an old building on spruce street in downtown scranton john walked in promptly at am and was greeted coolly by a secretary he had never met ms chiz never heard of her but that was not unusual in a state with over sixty thousand lawyers a scranton lawyer he did know had told him that she ran an allwoman shop with a couple of associates a couple of paralegals and the usual assortment of secretaries and parttime help no men need apply ms chiz specialized in divorce custody sexual harrassment and employment discrimination all from the female side and had a busy practice her reputation was solid she was a tough advocate for her clients a good negotiator and not afraid of the courtroom not bad looking either the lawyer had informed john and he was right about that ms chiz was waiting in her office when john walked in and said good morning she was wearing a black leather skirt not too short with a tight purple sweater and a pair of black and purple spikedheeled platform sling backs that most hookers would shy away from she was in her midforties with according to johns source at least two divorces under her belt she wore a lot of jewelry and makeup far too much for johns taste but he wasnt there to evaluate the talent for his part he was wearing a boring gray wool suit and a plain red tie nothing anyone would remember they settled around a small worktable in a room adjacent to her office and the secretary was sent for coffee they played a few minutes of whodoyouknow kicking around the names of lawyers from philadelphia to erie after the coffee was served and the door was closed ms chiz said lets get down to business great idea mr mcavoy said please call me john sure and im mike dont know if thats the correct nickname for michelin but it stuck a long time ago mike it is so far she had exuded nothing but charm and hospitality but john could already tell that just behind the smile was a very tough lawyer would you like to go first john asked no you called me you traveled here theres something you want so lets have it very well my client is my son not the best arrangement in the world but thats the way it is as you know he works for a law firm in new york law school at yale undergrad at duquesne im sure you know the details of the alleged rape indeed i do elaine works here parttime and were very close she wants to go to law school someday i hope she succeeds as you know the police in pittsburgh closed the investigation not long after they opened it frankly i knew nothing about it until very recently her surprise was obvious and john continued no kyle did not tell me when it happened he was planning to but the investigation was closed this is upsetting because we are very close but its not important i understand that you and ms keenan met with joey bernardo here in scranton a few weeks back and the meeting did not go well according to joeys version i also know that baxter tate contacted your client and was evidently on his way here to talk to her when he was murdered thats correct they were planning to meet yes so it appears mike that the episode five and a half years ago will not go away my client would like to resolve things to close this matter its a dark cloud hanging over these kids and im here to explore ways to get rid of it im representing only my son the others know nothing of this meeting the tate family of course has no clue and you can imagine what theyre going through right now joey has a child on the way and is about to get married alan strock as far as we know has forgotten the episode mike had yet to lift a pen she listened intently as she softly tapped all ten fingertips together most fingers were adorned with rings and both wrists were laden with inexpensive bangles her hard hazel eyes did not blink im sure you have something in mind she said content to listen im not sure what your client wants she might be thrilled if all three surviving roommates admitted there was a rape got themselves convicted and were sent off to prison she might be satisfied with a quiet apology or she might entertain the idea of a financial settlement perhaps you could help me here mike licked her lipstick and rattled some bracelets ive known elaine for two years she has a troubled past shes frail vulnerable and at times subject to some very dark moods it might be depression shes been sober for almost a year but shes fighting those demons she has become almost like a daughter to me and she has insisted from day one that she was raped i believe her she is convinced that the tate family got involved leaned on their friends who leaned on the cops who quickly backed off john was shaking his head thats not true none of the four boys told their parents maybe but we dont know that for sure regardless many of elaines problems stem from that episode she was a healthy funloving vibrant coed who loved college and had big plans shortly after the rape she dropped out and has been struggling ever since have you seen her grades from duquesne no her first semester she flunked one course dropped out of another and made horrible grades in the other three how did you gain access to her student records she improved slightly the second semester and made straight cs she took all four exams after the alleged rape then went home and never returned to duquesne mikes eyebrows arched and her spine stiffened how did you gain access to her student records she snarled again ah the woman had a temper after all i didnt and its not important how often do your clients tell you the entire truth are you suggesting elaine is lying the truth is a moving target here mike but whats certain is that well never really know for sure what happened that night these kids had been drinking and smoking pot for eight straight hours and they were far more promiscuous than wed like to believe your client was known to sleep around they were all sleeping around thats no excuse for rape of course not money was in the air there were a few other obstacles to clear but both lawyers knew they would eventually discuss the possibility of a financial settlement what does your client say about the episode mike asked her tone cool again the flash of anger was gone but there was a lot more where that came from they had been by the pool all afternoon then the party moved indoors into the apartment there were about fifteen kids more boys than girls but elaine was not in the group evidently she was next door at a different party around eleven thirty the cops showed up and the party ended nobody was arrested the cops gave them a break mike nodded patiently this was all in the police report after the cops left john continued elaine showed up she and baxter started making out on the sofa and one thing led to another my client was watching television in the same room as was alan strock my client was intoxicated to say the least and at some point he passed out he is certain he did not have sex with elaine that night and at the time he was not certain if anyone else did either he was too drunk to remember much the next morning and as you well know no accusation was made by your client until four days later the police investigated the matter all four boys were on the verge of talking to their parents but the investigators soon realized that they simply could not put together a case in recent weeks my client has talked to baxter tate and to joey bernardo and both boys admitted to having sex with your client on the evening in question both are were adamant that it was consensual then why was baxter so anxious to apologize i cant answer that i dont speak for baxter why did joey apologize he did so in my presence you know did joey apologize for raping elaine or did he apologize for the misunderstanding he apologized thats whats important theres still no case and his apology adds nothing to the evidence theres no way to prove rape occurred there was sex sure but you cant prove anything else she finally wrote something lavender legal pad elegant strokes noisy wrists she took a deep breath and seemed to gaze out the window for a moment for team mcavoy it was time for the biggest gamble they would never reveal every fact because successful negotiation does not hinge on full disclosure but the one bomb that could wreck any deal had to be addressed have you talked to the detectives in pittsburgh john asked no but ive read the entire file anything mentioned about a video yes there were notes in the file but the cops couldnt find one elaine even heard the rumor its not a rumor there is such a video she took this without the slightest flinch nothing in her eyes hands or body registered surprise what a great poker face john admitted quickly she simply waited i havent seen it he said but my client saw it in february of this year dont know where it is now and dont know how many others have seen it probably very few theres a chance it might surface perhaps on the internet perhaps in your mailbox and what would this video prove it would prove that your client was drunk and smoking pot when she sat down on the sofa with baxter tate and began kissing and groping the angle of the camera does not allow a full picture of the two engaged in sex but its obvious from the knees down that theyre having a fine time baxter is followed by joey at times elaine is not active at other times shes obviously engaged my client thinks it proves that she was in and out of consciousness but hes not certain nothing is certain except that neither he nor alan strock had sex with her where is the video i do not know does your client no who has the video i do not know okay who showed it to your client he does not know the persons real name he had never met the person until the person showed him the video gotcha i take it theres a complicated story behind this extremely complicated a stranger pops up shows your son the video then disappears right except for the disappearance part the stranger is still in contact extortion something close is that why youre here your client is scared of the video you wanna make peace with us so the extortion scheme goes away youre very astute she still had not blinked she seemed to be reading his mind at this point must be a helluva video she said my client found it troublesome though he was not present during the sex portion of it the video clearly shows your client happily getting involved in a good romp on a sofa whether she blacked out at some point is not clear at least on the video she is seen walking and talking and moving around clearly these boys didnt drag her in off the street mike she had been in their apartment many times drunk and sober poor thing mike said her first false move poor thing was having a wonderful time she carried a purse full of drugs along with her collection of fake ids and she was always looking for a party mike slowly stood and said excuse me for a moment she walked into her office and john admired the black leather every step of the way he heard her low voice probably on the phone and then she was back with a forced smile we could debate this for hours she said and not settle anything i agree baxter was in new york three weeks ago today to see my client in the course of a long discussion about what happened he told my client that he believed that he had forced himself on elaine the guilt was heavy maybe there was a sexual assault and the rapist is dead exactly however my client was there when it happened it was his apartment his friends his party and his booze he wants this thing off his back mike how much john managed a nervous laugh such bluntness she however did not crack a smile he made a note and asked is it possible to reach a financial settlement and have your client release all civil claims and agree not to prosecute yes assuming the settlement is sufficient a pause as john made some more notes then my client does not have a lot of money i know how much your client earns ive been practicing law for twenty years and he earns more than me and me after thirtyfive years but he has student loans and its not cheap living in new york city ill probably need to chip in a little and im not a wealthy man i dont owe anything but a busy street practice in downtown york is not the road to riches his honesty disarmed her for a moment and she smiled and seemed to relax they enjoyed a nice diversion swapping stories about the challenges of practicing law in smalltown america when the time was up john said warmly tell me about elaine job salary finances family and so on well as i said she works parttime here for peanuts she makes a year as an assistant director of parks and rec for the city not exactly a career job she rents a modest apartment that she shares with her companion beverly and drives a nissan with a monthly note her family is from erie and i dont know how prosperous they once were but things have taken a bad turn shes on her own twentythree years old surviving she still has dreams of something beyond where she is now john made a few notes then said yesterday i spoke with an attorney for the tate family big firm in pittsburgh baxter had a trust that sent him six thousand a month which was never enough that sum would increase over time but all the tate trusts are now tightly controlled by an uncle who has a rather heavy hand baxters trust folded when he died theres very little in his estate so any contribution from his family would fall under the category of charitable giving these people are not known for their charity and its hard to imagine them entertaining notions of writing checks to baxters old girlfriends mike was nodding in agreement what about joey she asked hes working hard trying to provide for a growing family hes probably strapped and will be for the rest of his life my client would like to keep both joey and alan strock out of this thats admirable we propose two payments one now and one in seven years when the statute of limitations expires on the rape charge if your client puts this behind her gives up the idea of pursuing these guys then she gets a nice payment at the end twentyfive thousand now and for the next seven years my client will add ten grand to an investment account that will render when elaine is thirty years old same poker face twentyfive up front is ridiculous she said he doesnt have twentyfive thousand itll come from me were not too concerned about where it comes from were much more interested in the amount well right now you have zero and if we dont reach an agreement then its very likely youll stay at zero your chances of recovery are slim at best then why are you offering anything peace of mind mike come on lets put this baby to sleep so these kids can get on with their lives kyle had almost forgotten the incident hell hes working a hundred hours a week then joey bumps into elaine then baxter shows up all consumed with guilt because he remembers more now than he did before this is crazy they were just a bunch of drunk kids yes they were and mike couldnt argue the point she recrossed her legs and john was compelled to glance at the high heels just a quick down and up but she noticed it let me talk to elaine and well make a counteroffer she said fine but theres not much wiggle room here mike the upfront money will be a loan from me to my client and he is obviously nervous about taking on a sevenyear obligation hes twentyfive and cant see three years down the road ill call elaine and shell probably want to run over and discuss this facetoface im not leaving town until we have a deal ill just walk down to the coffee shop and kill some time an hour later he was back they took their same positions picked up their pens and continued the negotiations i assume youre not taking our offer john said yes and no the sevenyear scheme is okay but elaine needs more up front she is two years away from her degree at the university of scranton her dream is law school and without some help it will be impossible how much help a hundred thousand now shock disbelief amazement rejection john grimaced and squirmed and allowed a lungful of air to whistle over his teeth it was all an act the longpracticed pretense of utter incredulity when the other side puts its first demand on the table exasperation near defeat look mike were trying to reach an agreement here you guys are trying to rob a bank in two years elaine will still be earning a year your client on the other hand will be earning about with guaranteed increases this is not a stretch for him john stood as if he were leaving end of negotiations i need to call him sure ill wait john walked outside the building put a cell phone to his head and called no one the amount they would pay had less to do with what elaine needed and much more to do with keeping her quiet a hundred thousand dollars was a bargain under the circumstances well go seventyfive grand and thats it john said back at the table her right hand rattled pleasantly as it came across deal she said they shook on their agreement then spent two hours haggling over the paperwork when it was finished he offered to buy lunch and she readily accepted chapter nigels latest workstation had been hastily assembled on a fine mahogany desk in the center of the sitting room in a spacious suite at the waldorfastoria on park avenue the computer was a sixteenbytwentyinch exact replica of the ten models on the eighteenth floor the monitor too was a perfect match next to it was an ominous navy blue box the size of a larger laptop as nigel proudly went through a detailed description of the various cords and cables the spaghetti as he called it bennie and kyle watched without a word there was a power cord audio monitor and printing cables audio kyle do we have noise from these bad little boys no no audio kyle replied and nigel carefully rolled up the audio cable and put it away he bent low behind the computer and pointed to the magic spot here we are kyle the promised land the usb port almost hidden but i know its there because i have a contact with fargo it has to be there trust me kyle grunted but said nothing heres the plan kyle he said excitedly thoroughly enthralled by his work from his neat little hackers hightech tool kit he produced two small devices identical in shape and length threequarters of an inch wide and about an inch and a half long this is the wireless usb transmitter hot off the press state of the art not yet available to the public no sir he said then quickly plugged it into the port that was under the power inlet once it was inserted about a half an inch could be seen you plug it in just so and presto were in business its virtually invisible he waved the other and explained and this little bugger is the usb receiver that goes in the blue box there with me kyle got it the blue box goes inside your briefcase you park the briefcase on the floor directly under the computer flip a switch and the docs get themselves downloaded in a jiffy how fast sixty megabytes per second about a thousand documents assuming you get the receiver within three meters of the transmitter which should be easy the closer the better kyle are you with me hell no kyle said as he sat in the chair in front of the monitor im supposed to somehow reach behind the computer plug in the transmitter leave it there download et cetera while there are other people in the room and the video cameras are watching how exactly do i pull that off drop a pen bennie said spill some coffee throw some papers around create a diversion go when the place is empty and keep your back to the camera kyle was shaking his head its too risky these people are not stupid you know theres a security tech on duty in a room next door names gant but does he work sixteen hours a day i dont know when he works thats the point you never know whos in there watching we know security kyle and the grunts who are paid to watch closedcircuit screens all day are usually halfasleep its terribly boring work this is not a coffee room bennie im supposed to be working in there stealing may be a priority for you boys but the firm expects me to be plowing through the documents ill have a project due and a partner waiting on it nigel charged in it could be over in two hours kyle assuming you can find the documents quickly bennie shook off all concerns priority one is the airbreathing engines that trylon and bartin developed together the technology is so sophisticated that the pentagon is still orgasmic priority two is the fuel mix do a search for cryogenic hydrogen fuel and follow it up with one for scramjet there should be a ton of research in the files priority three is called waveriders do a search these are aerodynamic designs used to increase the bs lifttodrag ratio heres a memo bennie handed over a twopage summary any of this sound familiar kyle nigel pleaded no its there bennie insisted its the heart of the research the crux of the lawsuit and you can find it kyle oh thank you for practice nigel withdrew the transmitter and handed it to kyle lets see you do it kyle slowly got to his feet leaned over the computer shoved away some cables and with some effort finally managed to insert the transmitter into the usb port he sat down and said theres no way of course there is bennie scoffed use your brain its dead nigel bounced around to the blue box the software is some of my home brew when you have inserted the transmitter you reach down and flip this little switch and the script automatically locates the computer and begins downloading the database it will happen very quickly kyle and if you like you can take a break leave the room go for a pee act like nothing at all is happening and all the while my little gizmo is sucking up the documents bloody brilliant kyle said bennie produced a black bally briefcase identical to kyles a standup model with a short leather flap that latched on one side there were three compartments with the middle one padded for a laptop the substitute was complete with a few scuff marks and kyles scully pershing business card firmly in the leather tag youll use this he said as nigel carefully lifted the blue box and placed it in the center compartment of the briefcase when you unzip this divide nigel said the receiver will already be in place if for some reason you need to abort just close the case and punch this button and it locks automatically abort just in case kyle let me get this straight something goes wrong somebody notices me maybe some alarm goes off in a supercomputer we know nothing about as soon as i start dickering with the database and your plan is then for me to lock the flap on the briefcase grab the transmitter thats almost hidden and then do what sprint from the room like a shoplifter whos been caught where do i go nigel any help here bennie relax kyle bennie said with a fake smile this is a piece of cake youll do fine no alarms kyle nigel said my software is too good for that trust me would you please stop saying that kyle walked to a window and looked out at the manhattan skyline it was almost on tuesday night he had not eaten since he and tabor had enjoyed a fifteenminute lunch in the firm cafeteria at hunger though was only a minor concern on a long sad list are you ready kyle bennie called from across the room not a question but a challenge as ready as ill ever be he answered without turning around when as soon as possible i want to get it over with ill stop by the room a few times tomorrow check the traffic my best guess is that itll be about eight tomorrow night late in the day but with enough time to download assuming i dont get shot any questions about the equipment kyle nigel asked kyle walked stiffly back to the workstation and stared at the machines he finally shrugged and said no its pretty straightforward super one last thing kyle the blue box has a wireless signal so that i know precisely when youre downloading why is that necessary monitoring well be very close by another shrug whatever the blue box was still in the center compartment with nigel handling it as if it were a bomb kyle then added the materials from his own briefcase and when he grabbed the handle and lifted it off the table he was surprised at the weight a bit heavier kyle nigel quizzed watching every move yes quite a bit not to worry weve reinforced the bottom of the bally its not going to drop out as youre walking along broad street i like the other one better when do i get it back soon kyle soon kyle pulled on his trench coat and made his way to the door bennie followed and said good luck kyle its all come down to this we believe in you go to hell kyle said and left the room chapter the briefcase grew heavier during the short sleepless night and when kyle lugged it out of the rear of the taxi early wednesday morning he halfwished the bottom would indeed fall out the blue box would crash onto broad street in a thousand pieces and nigels precious home brew would be sent down the gutter he wasnt sure what would happen after that but any scenario was far better than what was planned twenty minutes after he rode the elevator to the thirtyfourth floor roy benedict entered the same elevator with two young men who were undoubtedly associates at scully pershing the signs were obvious they were under thirty it was in the morning they appeared to be fatigued and miserable but they wore expensive clothes and carried handsome briefcases black he was prepared to see a familiar face though felt it unlikely it was not at all unusual to see attorneys from other firms in the building roy knew half a dozen partners at scully but with fifteen hundred lawyers arriving for work he figured the odds were slim and he was right the two zombies riding up with him were just a couple of faceless souls who would be gone in a year or so the briefcase in roys hand was also a black bally identical to the one kyle bought back in august the third one required for this mission he left the elevator alone on the thirtyfourth floor and walked past the vacant reception desk down a hall to the right four five six doors and there was his client sitting at his desk sipping coffee waiting the exchange was brief roy swapped briefcases and was ready to go where are the feds kyle asked very softly though no one was in the hall and the secretaries were just getting out of bed around the corner in a van theyll do a quick scan to make sure there are no tracking devices if they find one ill bring it back in a sprint and well concoct a story if not then theyll take it to their lab in queens this thing is heavy the blue box specially designed by some evil geniuses when do you need it lets say pm thats twelve hours should be enough right thats what they say according to bullington they have a small army of geeks just itching to unwrap it they cant screw it up they wont you good great do they have arrest warrants oh yes wiretapping extortion conspiracy lots of good stuff theyre just waiting on you if bennie is about to be arrested then im a motivated young man good luck roy was gone leaving behind the bally with the same scuff marks and name tag kyle quickly stuffed it with files and legal pads and pens and went to find more coffee twelve long hours later roy was back with the second briefcase he took a seat as kyle closed the door so he said it is what it is its a customized computer built along the lines of those used by the military everything is heavyduty designed for nothing but downloading two hard drives with gigabytes each basically enough memory to store everything in this building and the three next door highly sophisticated software that the fbi geeks have never seen before these guys are good kyle tell me about it and there is indeed a wireless signal so they can monitor you dammit so i have to download something im afraid so the wireless signal cannot indicate what you are downloading or how much it just lets them know that youre inside and that youve started moving the database shit you can do it kyle that seems to be the consensus do you know where youll meet these guys no itll be a lastsecond notice assuming i download without setting off alarms ill call bennie with the happy news and hell tell me where to meet im going to the room in an hour and i plan to quit at nine regardless of the download so by nine fifteen if im lucky i should be on the street ill stay at my office if you get a chance please call pretty exciting stuff kyle exciting how about terrifying youre the man with that roy exchanged briefcases again and disappeared for sixty minutes kyle stared at the clock did nothing but bill trylon for an hour and finally made a move he loosened his tie rolled up his sleeves tried to look as casual as possible and took the elevator to the eighteenth floor sherry abney was in the room and he had to say hello from the looks of her table shed been there for hours and the research had not gone well kyle chose a station as far away from her as possible her back was to him despite his bitching and moaning he foresaw little danger of being noticed by another member of team trylon all ten chairs faced the outside walls away from the center so that while doing research he could see nothing but the monitor the computer and the wall behind it the danger was up above lurking in the lenses of the video cameras still he preferred to have the room to himself after fifteen minutes he decided to visit the mens room on the way out he asked sherry can i get you a coffee no thanks im leaving soon perfect she left at a nice breaking point that always made billing easier kyle placed a legal pad on top of the computer then a couple of pens things that could roll and slide and need retrieving he scattered a couple of files beside the monitor and in general made a mess of things at he knocked on the locked metal door that led to the small printing room and there was no answer then he tried a second metal door that led to places unknown but he suspected it was the room where gant hung out and secured things he saw gant occasionally and figured he worked close by there was no answer at kyle decided to plunge ahead before another associate arrived for one last hour of work he walked to his table and bumped the legal pad on top of the computer sending the pens flying against the wall he threw up an arm said shit as loudly as possible then leaned over as if to retrieve things he found one pen couldnt find the other but kept searching on the floor behind the monitor under the chair then again behind the computer where he deftly inserted the tiny transmitter into the usb port just as he found the missing pen and held it up so the cameras could see it settled down now composed not cursing he took his seat and began clicking away at the keyboard he slid the briefcase closer under the table directly under the computer now then he flipped the switch no alarms no virus warnings screaming from the screen no sudden entry by gant with armed guards nothing kyle the hacker was downloading files stealing at a dizzying rate of speed in nine minutes he transferred all category a documents letters memos a hundred different varieties of harmless information that had already been submitted to ape and bartin when he was finished with the category a documents he repeated the process and downloaded them again and again and again an hour after he entered the room he again went through the charade of searching for lost pens and while bumbling about he plucked the transmitter from the usb port then he cleaned up his mess and left he hurried to his office got his jacket and trench coat and made it to the elevators without seeing another person as he rode down without a single stop he realized that this was the moment he had always feared he was leaving the office as a thief with enough stolen files in his briefcase to get him convicted of numerous crimes and disbarred for life as he stepped into the raw december night he immediately called bennie mission accomplished he said proudly great kyle oxford hotel corner of lex and thirtyfifth room fifteen minutes away im on the way kyle walked to a black sedan one duly registered to a wellknown car company in brooklyn and jumped into the backseat the small asian driver said where to and your name is al capone where were you born al tutwiler texas youre the man al oxford hotel room al the agent immediately called someone and repeated the information he listened for a few minutes drove very slowly then said heres the plan mr mcavoy we have a team on the move and they should be at the hotel in ten minutes well take our time here when the supervisor is in the hotel he will call me with more instructions would you like a vest a what a vest bulletproof theres one in the trunk if youd like kyle had been too preoccupied with his thievery to contemplate the actual events surrounding the arrest of bennie and hopefully nigel too he was sure he would lead the fbi to his handler but he had not given much thought to the details of his betrayal why exactly might he need a bulletproof vest to stop bullets of course baxter flashed through his overheated brain ill pass kyle said realizing how ill equipped he was to make such decisions yes sir al looked for traffic for detours anything to burn some clock his cell phone rang and he listened then said okay mr mcavoy ill stop in front of the hotel and youll walk into the lobby alone go to the elevators to the right and punch the button for the fourth floor get off on the fourth turn left walk to the door leading to the stairs in the stairwell you will meet mr bullington and several other agents they will take over from there sounds like fun good luck mr mcavoy five minutes later kyle walked into the lobby of the oxford hotel and followed his instructions in the stairwell between the fourth and the fifth floors he met joe bullington and two other agents all dressed exactly like the ones whod snatched him some ten months earlier after a youth basketball game in new haven except these were real and he had no desire to inspect their credentials tensions were high and kyles weary heart was pounding furiously im agent booth this is agent hardy one said and kyle was impressed with how large they were go to the door of booth said the second it starts to open kick it very hard then jump back out of the way well be right behind you we do not anticipate gunfire we assume theyre armed but theyre not expecting trouble once were inside youll be removed from the scene what no gunfire kyle started to crack a funny but his knees were suddenly weak got it booth growled at him got it lets go kyle entered the hall and walked with as much confidence as possible to room he pressed the button took a deep breath and glanced around booth and hardy were fifteen feet away ready to spring shiny black pistols drawn from the other end of the hall two other agents were approaching also with guns visible maybe i shouldve opted for the vest kyle thought he pressed the button again nothing not a voice from within not a sound his lungs had ceased working and his stomach was a mess the briefcase weighed a ton much heavier now that it contained the stolen files he frowned at booth who looked perplexed as well kyle pressed the button for the third time then tapped on the door and yelled hey bennie its kyle nothing he rang the doorbell for the fourth time then fifth its a single room booth whispered then he motioned for some type of wellrehearsed formation and said to kyle please step aside go right down there and wait hardy whipped out an electronic room key and inserted it the green light came on and the four fbi agents stormed in high and low right and left barking guns aimed in all directions joe bullington was running toward them and behind him were more agents the room was empty of suspects anyway and if anyone had been there recently hed left nothing behind bullington reappeared in the hall and commanded lock the building into a phone or walkietalkie he shot kyle a look of complete astonishment and kyle began to fade agents hustled about frantic with indecision and confusion some ran to the stairs others to the elevators an old woman in stepped into the hall and shouted quiet but quickly lost her spunk when two frowning agents spun around with weapons she retreated quickly unharmed but awake for the night kyle here please bullington said waving him into room kyle clutched the briefcase and entered the room stay here for a few minutes bullington said these two will remain with you kyle sat on the edge of the bed briefcase between his feet as his two guards closed the door and put away their guns minutes passed as he thought of a hundred scenes and scenarios none particularly appealing he thought of roy and called him he was still at his office waiting for the news they got away kyle said his voice slow and weak whatta you mean were in the hotel room and its empty theyre gone roy where are you room oxford hotel under guard i guess the fbi is searching the hotel but they wont find anybody ill be there in fifteen minutes while the hotel was being searched three fbi agents entered kyles apartment in chelsea using his key they entered quietly and began a sweep that would take four hours and produce three hidden cameras a wiretap on his wall phone and six other eavesdropping devices plenty of evidence to support indictments a strong case for the feds but what they really needed was some suspects chapter roy arrived at pm he was met by joe bullington at the front door and escorted through the lobby the hotel was still locked down a roombyroom search under way with lots of unhappy guests and the front desk was chaos roys first question was hows kyle pretty rattled bullington said lets take the stairs the elevators have been stopped hell were all rattled the second question was the most obvious one what happened i do not know roy its confusing kyle was seated on the edge of the bed briefcase still between his feet trench coat still on staring blankly at the floor and ignoring the two agents who were guarding him roy put a hand on his shoulder then knelt down to face level and said kyle you okay sure it was somewhat helpful to see a trusted face bullington was on the phone he slapped it shut and said look theres a suite on the second floor its easier to secure and much larger lets make a move as they filed out kyle mumbled to his lawyer did you hear that roy easier to secure im being protected now its okay kyle the suite had three rooms one of which would work well as an office desk fax wireless internet several comfortable chairs and a small conference area at the far end thisll do bullington said as he ripped off his trench coat then his jacket as if they would be there for some time and kyle and roy did the same they took their seats and settled in two younger agents stayed by the door heres what we know so far bullington began very much the special agent in charge the room was reserved this afternoon by a mr randall kerr who used both a bogus name and a bogus credit card around mr kerr shows up to check in alone one small carryon and a black briefcase and in chatting up the desk clerk tells her that he just flew in from mexico city weve watched the video its bennie with no effort at disguise he went to his room and according to the electronic entry grid he opened the door to room at he opened it again eighteen minutes later leaving evidently because the door was never used again no one remembers seeing him exit the building there are some video cameras in the hallways and lobby but so far nothing hes vanished of course hes vanished kyle said you wont find him were trying what did you download kyle roy asked the category a documents five or six times i didnt touch anything else and this went smoothly as far as i know there were no problems inside the room what time did you start downloading bullington asked about and what time did you call bennie just before bullington thought for a second then stated the obvious so bennie waited until they got your signal and once he knew you were downloading he checked into the room eighteen minutes later he fled that doesnt make sense it does if you know bennie kyle said i dont follow bullington said someone informed bennie of our little plan that much is obvious it wasnt me it wasnt my lawyer and the only other parties involved would be you mr bullington the fbi and mr wingate and his gang over at justice we have no idea at this point and we probably never will regardless bennie got the tip and decided to have some fun he knew i would lead you here to catch him so this is all a setup bennies probably down the street watching a hundred fbi agents swarm around the hotel and laughing his balls off bullingtons cheeks turned a dark red he suddenly had a call to make and left the room take it easy kyle roy said softly kyle locked his fingers behind his head and bent over the briefcase was still wedged between his feet he closed his eyes and tried to control his thoughts but that was impossible roy watched him but said nothing he went to the minibar and pulled out two bottles of water we should talk roy said handing a bottle to kyle well have to make some quick decisions okay what do we do with this damned thing kyle asked patting the briefcase scully doesnt need it because the documents are not confidential i just stole a copy they havent lost anything yet their files will appear to be untouched im sure the fbi will want it for evidence evidence against who bennie bennie bennies gone roy listen to me theyll never find bennie because hes a helluva lot smarter than they are bennie wont be arrested bennie wont go to trial bennies on an airplane right now probably a private one looking at his fifteen passports and deciding which one to use next dont be so sure and why not bennie outfoxed us tonight didnt he bennie has pals in high places maybe not here in new york maybe in washington too many people got involved roy the fbi the department of justice and the network of gossip spread plans here authorizations there meetings at high levels more and more intelligence people in the loop it was a mistake you had no choice my choices were limited looks like i made the wrong one what about the law firm im sure ill screw that up too whats your advice god knows im paying for it if even at a discount both managed smiles but very brief ones roy gulped his water wiped his lips with a shirtsleeve and leaned even closer the two guards were still in the sitting room within earshot you could say nothing just report tomorrow for duty and act like none of this happened the files are safe nothing has been compromised look kyle you never planned to hand over anything to bennie you were forced to download some stuff to facilitate his arrest the arrest didnt happen the firm has no clue assuming there wont be a prosecution the firm will never know but the plan was to bust bennie tell the firm everything and beg for mercy sort of like the bank robber who brings back the cash and says hes sorry cant we just forget about it with a few more twists of course do you want to stay at the firm kyle my exit from scully pershing was a foregone conclusion the day i walked into your office there might be a way to save the job i took the job because bennie had a gun to my head that gun has now been replaced by a different one but at least the threat of blackmail is gone theres a chance the video may still cause some embarrassment but nothing more id like to get out of here a radio squawked in the sitting room jolting the agents it came and went with no further news kyle finally abandoned the briefcase and stretched his legs he looked at his lawyer and said youre a big partner in a big firm what would you do if an associate pulled this stunt fire him immediately exactly on the spot with little patience for a lot of talk how can the firm ever trust me again there are a thousand rookies out there ready to replace me and theres something else here roy something that scully needs to know kyle glanced at the sitting room where his bodyguards were now watching tv im not the only spy bennie knew too much someone else is planted there passing along information to bennie i have to tell them there was a commotion at the door and the two guards quickly muted the television and hopped to attention kyle and roy stood as bullington swept in with a small important group the center of which was a man of about sixty with short gray hair a fine suit and the air of someone in complete control of all things around him bullington introduced him as mr mario delano director in charge of the new york office of the fbi he addressed both kyle and roy gentlemen mr bennie wright has obviously left the building and we have a serious problem i have no idea where the leak was but i assure you it was not my office i doubt thats very comforting right now we are searching frantically around the city train stations airports subways heliports toll roads every agent under my authority is on the streets if kyle was supposed to be impressed he was not he simply shrugged as if to say big deal the least you could do delano pressed on its urgent that you get out of town mr mcavoy i suggest that we take you into protective custody for a few days let the dust settle give us some time to track down bennie wright and if you dont find him kyle asked lets talk about that later we have a small jet waiting at teterboro airport well have you there in thirty minutes youll have protection around the clock until something changes the crisp precision of delanos plans left no doubt that the dangers were indeed substantial kyle could not argue he was now the double agent as well as the governments star witness in the event bennie got caught if they would murder baxter to keep him away from elaine it was hard to imagine what they would do to kyle lets go delano said i need a minute with my client roy said certainly said delano as he snapped his fingers and the room emptied roy closed the door and when they were alone he said ill call scully and put them off kyle withdrew his firmfone and said no need ill check in with doug peckham and tell him im sick bennie never got his hands on my little phone here fine its best if i keep the briefcase and the computer just dont let the fbi have it i wont they shook hands roy said you did the right thing right or wrong it didnt work you didnt hand over anything kyle you didnt breach a clients confidence lets argue later be safe chapter john mcavoy was enjoying a peaceful thursday morning at his desk when a secretary rang in with the news that two gentlemen from the fbi had dropped by for a surprise visit they were quickly shown in introductions were made badges flashed coffee declined is he all right john asked hes fine the agent named halsey said the one named murdock agreed nodding with smug assurance whats happened kyle has informed us that you are aware of the plans he had to help apprehend his handler halsey said yes i know the background and i know what he had in mind whats happened both agents shifted weight murdock took over well things didnt go as planned kyle secured the documents and he was supposed to meet the handler around ten last night in a midtown hotel the handler didnt show fled at the last moment as of now we have not apprehended him john closed his eyes removed his reading glasses and lit a cigarette wheres kyle hes with us in protective custody hes safe and hes anxious to talk to you that will not be possible at this moment a blast of blue smoke escaped from johns side of the desk protective custody he repeated the smoke drifted over and began settling on halsey and murdock afraid so he could be in danger who botched the operation not sure it was botched or how or why lets just say there is a lot of investigating going on right now when can i talk to him soon halsey said were out of philly murdock said but were here in york for the next few days our job is to relay messages to you both agents withdrew business cards cell numbers on the back please dont hesitate to call kyle slept late into the morning and awoke to the sounds of waves rolling onto a beach he was adrift in the clouds a thick white comforter puffy white pillows a thick white bedspread piled at his feet the queensized bed was topped with a white canopy he knew where he was but it took a few minutes to convince himself he was really there the walls were adorned with cheap pastels of beach scenes the floor was painted wood he listened to the ocean and heard the distant calls of seagulls there were no other sounds quite a contrast to the early bustle of chelsea no alarm clock startling him at some obscene hour no rush to shower and dress and hurry through the frantic rituals of getting to the office none of that at least not today this was not an unpleasant way to begin the rest of his life the bedroom was one of three in a modest twostory beach rental an hour east of destin florida on the gulf two hours and fortyeight minutes by learjet from teterboro airport in new jersey they he and his new friends had landed at destin just before am a van with armed drivers had scooped them up and raced along highway passing miles of empty condos and beach houses and small hotels there were a few vacationers judging by the parking lots and many of the cars had canadian license plates the two windows were halfopen and the breeze blew the curtains it was a full three minutes before kyle thought about bennie but he fought the temptation and concentrated on the distant squawking of the seagulls there was a slight knock at the door yes kyle answered with a scratchy voice it opened slightly and todd his new best friend wedged through his chubby face and said you wanted a ten oclock wakeup call thanks you okay sure todd had joined the escape in destin and was now assigned to guard their witness or snitch or whatever kyle was considered to be he was from the pensacola office went to auburn was only two years older than kyle himself and talked far more than any other fbi agent real or fake that hed met so far in this ordeal kyle in boxers only left the softness of the clouds and went next door to the large kitchenden combo todd had been to the grocery store the counter was covered with boxes of cereal breakfast snacks cookies chips all manner of boxed foods coffee todd asked sure there were a few items of folded clothing on the kitchen table kyles other new best friend was barry an older quieter type with premature gray hair and more wrinkles than any fortyyearold should have barry said good morning weve been shopping bought you a couple of tshirts shorts a pair of khakis deck shoes really nice stuff from the local kmart dont worry uncle sam paid the bill im sure ill look fabulous kyle said taking a cup of coffee from todd todd and barry both in khakis and polos were unarmed but not far from their weapons there was also a nick and a matthew somewhere close by i gotta call the office kyle said check in you know tell them im sick and cant work today by now theyre already looking for me todd produced the firmfone and said be our guest were told its secure just dont give a hint as to where you are agreed where am i western hemisphere close enough with his coffee and his phone kyle stepped outside onto a wide deck that looked over some dunes the beach was long and beautiful and deserted the air was light brisk but far warmer than frigid new york with great reluctance he looked at the phone emails texts and voice mails from doug peckham dale sherry abney tim reynolds tabor and a few others but nothing to alarm him he scanned them quickly just the usual daily barrage of communications from very wired people with too much access to each other dale asked twice if he was okay he called doug peckham got his voice mail and reported that he was down with the flu flat on his back sick as a dog and so on then he called dale who was in a meeting he left the same message one useless advantage of working with workaholics was that they had no time to worry about each others minor ailments got the flu take some pills and sleep it off but do not spread your germs at the office roy benedict seemed to be waiting by the phone where are you kyle he asked almost in a pant western hemisphere im doing well how about you fine youre safe safe im hidden stashed away and im guarded by a posse of at least four all anxious to shoot someone any news on our man bennie no theyll have indictments by noon and theyre adding one for murder theyll splash these around the world and hope for a break you were right your apartment had more bugs than a landfill good stuff too the latest in wiretapping technology im honored and they found a transmitter in the rear bumper of your jeep i never thought of that anyway all this is being presented to the grand jury as we speak so at least bennie will have a thick indictment on record should he ever make a mistake dont bet on that have you talked to the law firm i left a message with peckham the flu routine hell buy it for a couple of days no alarms nothing strange no its weird roy im a thousand miles away now and looking back i cant believe how easy it was to walk in with the right gear and walk out with the files i couldve taken every single document in the database four million plus and handed them over to bennie or another thug and i couldve gone back into my office this morning as if nothing happened scully has got to be warned so who tells them i do i have a few things to get off my chest lets talk about that tomorrow ive been on the phone with bullington all morning twice hes mentioned the witness protection program the fbi is pushing it hard they are pretty nervous about you kyle im nervous about me too but witness protection sure youre convinced they cant find bennie theyre convinced they can if they do and they haul him back for a trial with an incredible list of charges then youre the star if youre not around to testify then the governments case falls flat a pleasant morning at the beach was becoming complicated and why not nothing had been simple for a long time now thatll take some serious thought and consideration kyle said then start thinking ill call you later kyle dressed in the khakis and a tshirt not a bad fit then ate two bowls of cereal he read the pensacola news journal and the new york times the times had nothing about last nights excitement at the oxford hotel of course not kyle said to himself it happened far too late and it was far too clandestine then why was he looking for it after breakfast and the papers todd joined him at the kitchen table we have a few rules he said with a jovial face but a hard smile what a surprise you can make calls obviously but only on that phone cant reveal your whereabouts you can walk on the beach but we have to follow at a distance youre kidding im walking down the beach and theres a guy with a machine gun tagging along how relaxing todd caught the humor and enjoyed a laugh no machine gun and we wont be conspicuous youre all conspicuous i can spot an agent a mile away anyway stay close to the house how long will i be here todd shrugged and said i have no idea am i in protective custody or witness protection custody i think you dont know todd come on custody implies that im a suspect of some variety doesnt it todd another shrug but im not a suspect im a witness but i have not agreed to enter the witness protection program so according to my lawyer the one i just talked to im free to walk out that door anytime i want whatta you think about that todd that machine gun you just mentioned we have at least six on the premises so i should stay here right right okay its noon what are we going to do barry had been hovering nearby not missing a word he walked to the table with a large basket of the usual board games the owners of all beach rentals leave behind barry said we have monopoly risk rook scrabble chinese checkers your call kyle kyle studied the basket scrabble chapter the flu raged unabated into friday doug peckham while claiming to be sympathetic was curious about any improvement they were getting hammered with motions in the trylon case and everyone was needed his sympathy did not extend to a curiosity about where kyle was staying who if anyone was tending to him what medications he was taking and so on part of kyles ruse was the forbidding diagnosis that his particular strain of the flu was hotly contagious since new york was going through its annual december flu warning his story was easily digestible dale believed it too though she was much more sympathetic the temperature hit eighty degrees in the early afternoon and kyle was bored with the beach house he said to todd id like to take a walk would you please prepare the beach my pleasure which way are you going east toward miami ill round up the gang theyre getting bored with you kyle walked for an hour and passed fewer than ten beachcombers going the opposite way thirty yards behind him were two of his guardians a male and a female a happy couple with receivers in their ears and handguns in their pockets he heard music and saw a small crowd under a fake thatched roof it was the gator hotel a sstyle momandpop motel with a small pool and low rates a depressing little place but it had the only action on the beach just for the hell of it and to torment his followers he sauntered away from the water walked between two small dunes and pulled up a chair at pedros bar jimmy buffett was singing softly about life in a banana republic the bartender was mixing rum punch specials the crowd numbered seven all over the age of sixty all overweight all chatting in crisp northern accents the early snowbirds kyle sipped a rum punch and ordered a cigar between the dunes he saw his trailing couple stop and gawk and try to figure out what to do within minutes another agent appeared from the front of the motel he walked through the open bar winked at kyle and kept going were here buddy he drank and smoked for a while and tried to convince himself that he was relaxed no worries just another overworked professional enjoying a few days at the beach but there was too much unfinished business in new york after three days of thorough protection kyle was fed up the lear landed at teterboro just after pm on saturday december at kyles insistence he was booked into a suite at the tribeca grand hotel between walker and white near the village and at his request all fbi agents remained below in the lobby and atrium he was tired of their overkill and silly rules silly in his opinion dale arrived promptly at eight she was driven over by two agents and sneaked in through a service entrance when they were alone kyle started with the fake flu and worked his way backward it was a long journey and she listened with the same disbelief that had been shared by roy benedict and john mcavoy they ordered room service lobster and a fine white burgundy compliments of the government and kept talking he was leaving the firm and not sure where he was headed she was leaving the firm a nice lateral transfer to a better life in downtown providence he wanted to talk about her future but she was determined to finish up with his past she found it fascinating incredulous frightening and said over and over why didnt you tell me the best response he could offer was i didnt tell anyone they talked until well past midnight the backandforth was more a conversation between two good friends than between two casual lovers they said goodbye with a long kiss and a serious promise to meet in a few weeks as soon as kyle settled some issues at am he called downstairs and informed the boys that he was going to sleep kyle mcavoy entered the opulent offices of scully pershing for the last time at noon on sunday he was accompanied by roy benedict mr mario delano of the fbi and mr drew wingate with the department of justice they were led to a conference room on the thirtyfifth floor yet another room kyle had never seen they were met by half a dozen of the firms partners all with very somber faces all offered stiff introductions only doug peckham showed the slightest trace of warmth to kyle and only for a second they took seats on opposite sides of the table like enemies glaring across the battlefield howard meezer the managing partner peckham wilson rush who looked particularly upset a retired legend named abraham kintz and two slightly younger partners from the firms management committee men kyle had never laid eyes on late saturday evening roy benedict had sent them a twenty fivepage detailed summary of kyles big adventure and there was little doubt that every word had been read more than once by all six of the partners attached to the narrative was kyles letter of resignation meezer kicked things off with a pleasant mr mcavoy your resignation is unanimously accepted not just accepted but unanimously so kyle nodded but said nothing weve read the summary prepared by your lawyer meezer said slowly methodically it is fascinating and troubling and it raises a number of questions i suggest we address them in order of priority fine fine yes agreed all around the table the first issue is what to do with you mr mcavoy we understand the reasons behind your theft but it was a theft nonetheless you took the confidential files of a valuable client for purposes that had not been authorized by this firm a criminal prosecution is in order do you agree kyle had been told to keep his mouth shut unless roy approved a response a criminal prosecution is possible roy admitted but there is nothing to be gained the firm lost nothing loss is not a requirement mr benedict agreed technically but lets be practical kyle had no intention of turning over the documents once hed taken them he did so only to stop a conspiracy to seriously harm this firm and its client the fbi will not cooperate in a criminal prosecution mr meezer delano said the heavy hand of the federal government nor will the department of justice added wingate thank you meezer said but we dont need your help theft can be a state charge and we have some nice contacts with the authorities here in the city however we are not inclined to pursue this as a criminal matter heavy emphasis on the word criminal there is little to be gained and much to be lost we dont want our clients worried about confidentiality and this little episode would make a wonderful story in the press wilson rush was glaring at kyle but doug occupied himself with a legal pad he was there because kyle fell under his immediate supervision and because the firm needed bodies a grim show of force at this unfortunate moment kyle watched doug ignored rush and wondered how many of the six partners over there were billing trylon at a double rate since theyd been dragged in on a sunday billing billing he hoped he never saw another time sheet never again glanced at his watch and divided an hour into tenths never again tallied things up at the end of the month to make sure hed gone over two hundred hours padding here and there if he came up a few hours short as to the matter of ethics meezer was saying this is a serious breach of a clients confidence the state disciplinary committee should be notified he paused long enough for someone on the other side to respond i thought you were trying to avoid publicity roy said these matters are supposed to be private but we know that theyre often leaked and if kyle gets reprimanded or disbarred it becomes public record a scully pershing associate disbarred for taking confidential files is that the story you want splashed in the new york lawyer at least four of the six were slowly shaking their heads and it dawned on kyle that they were as nervous as he was their vaunted reputation was on the line a major client might pull its business others could follow scullys competitors would use the breach of security as a piece of delicious gossip to spread all over wall street do you plan to stay in new york mr mcavoy meezer asked roy nodded and kyle said no i cant very well if you agree to forgo the practice of law in the state of new york we will agree to forget the ethical violations agreed kyle said and maybe a bit too quickly because he couldnt wait to leave the city meezer shuffled through some notes as if there were a dozen tough topics to cover but the meeting was practically over the meeting was important so that the firm could officially dismiss kyle perhaps flog him a bit listen to his apology and then both sides could say good riddance where is this blue box wilson rush asked locked in my office roy said and it has nothing but the category a files thats correct roy said id like for our security people to see it anytime but we would like to be present delano added if this bennie character is caught the box is exhibit no any progress on the search meezer asked veering off script delano could never say there was no progress when searching for a suspect so he gave the standard we are pursuing leads were still confident in other words no more shuffling of paper more shifting of rear ends in your summary mr mcavoy you allude to additional security issues within scully pershing care to expand on this a nod from roy and kyle began yes but first i want to apologize for my actions i hope you understand the reasons behind what i did but i was still wrong and i apologize as far as security i met with these thugs ten times while i was in new york the first meeting was in february the tenth meeting was last tuesday night i took meticulous notes of each meeting dates places duration who was present what was said everything i could remember afterward my attorney has these notes the fbi has a copy on three occasions i was given information that could only be known by someone within this firm i think theres another spy for example bennie and i hate to use that name because its just an alias but its all we have but bennie knew about the warehouse full of documents down south as he said during one meeting he and nigel another alias hinted that they were making progress in breaching the security of the warehouse they knew about the secret room on the eighteenth floor bennie knew every name of every partner and associate assigned to the lawsuit bennie knew that a young lawyer named mcdougle was leaving that he worked under a senior associate named sherry abney on the trylon case and bennie told me to start playing squash because sherry enjoyed the game bennie handed me copies of pleadings motions rulings i have over six hundred pages of the court file that as you know is locked away and kept from the public three of the six jaws had dropped on the other side not down to their chests not the kickmeinthegut shock of sudden horrific news but a stunning blow nonetheless the nightmare of one lowly associate tapping into their impenetrable defenses was bad enough now there might be another and just to give them more heartburn kyle added something he truly believed but couldnt prove and i dont think its an associate he said then withdrew from the fray and settled back into his chair all six partners had the same thought if its not an associate then it must be a partner doug peckham swallowed hard cleared his throat and attempted to speak are you saying next to him wilson rush quickly raised his right hand partially in dougs space like a king calling for silence a quick lifting of the hand and all was quiet for the moment roy finally said anything else i believe thats all meezer said after an awkward few seconds roy stood followed by kyle and delano and wingate the six partners did not budge they sat frozen with matching scowls as kyle and his little entourage left the room chapter in the lobby of the building they were met by the same three large young men whod brought kyle from the hotel the group made it safely outside onto broad street then walked one block east to the building next door where roy worked sixteen floors up the three agents bodyguards really camped in a reception area and began waiting again inside roys office drew wingate decided that his job was over he excused himself and promised to help in any way possible after he left kyle roy and delano gathered around roys small conference table some poor secretary beckoned on a sunday served them coffee with a smile what are your plans kyle delano asked well looks like i wont be practicing law in the state of new york thats for sure ill go home for a few weeks take some time off enjoy the holidays im not sure thats a wise thing to do thank you mr delano i appreciate your concern but im not about to go into hiding thanks for the offer to enter the dark little world of witness protection but no thanks im twentyfive years old stumbling but not falling and ill do just fine on my own roys coffee cup froze in midair halfway to his mouth kyle you cant be serious dead serious roy no pun intended ive just survived three days of protection guards all around me hiding and watching for bad guys no thanks theres more to my future than fake names and nonstop scrabble scrabble dont go there listen ive been under surveillance for the last ten months you know what that does to you you get real paranoid you suspect everyone you seize upon every new face because it might belong to a bad guy you notice every corner alley every bum on a park bench every guy wearing a dark trench coat you pick up a phone and you wonder whos listening you send an email and change the wording because the wrong eyes might see it in your own apartment you change clothes in a hurry back to the camera trying to hide your crotch you walk in a coffee shop and go straight to the front window to see whos on the sidewalk behind you you learn all sorts of stupid little tricks because the more you know the more you might need to know and the walls close in the world becomes a small place because somebody is always watching im sick of it im not going to live on the run these guys killed baxter tate without the slightest hesitation roy said what makes you think they wont do the same to you the operation was still hot when baxter came barging in the operation at least that part that involves me is now over bennies gone the operation failed he might return with another plan im sure he will delano said but it wont involve me what does bennie gain by taking me out he takes out a material witness roy said only if hes caught which i seriously doubt if bennie gets hauled back for a trial then we can talk about hiding oh itll be too late then kyle delano said believe me the moment bennie gets nabbed therell be a few guys headed your way bring em on we have at least five deer rifles at home ill carry a luger in my briefcase if they show up well have a regular gunfight get serious kyle roy pleaded the decision has been made the fbi cannot force me into witness protection and so i hereby officially and respectfully say no thank you mr delano but the answer is no i hope you dont regret this delano said so do i kyle said and please dont follow me around i might go berserk and shoot the next person i see lurking in the shadows oh dont worry we have plenty of work elsewhere delano stood and all hands were shaken he said to roy ill check in once a week with an update roy walked him to the door and the fbi left kyles life with the door closed roy took his seat and looked at kyle as if he couldnt believe it youre awfully brave he said brave or stupid the line is often blurred why not disappear for a few months maybe a year let everything cool off a year means nothing these guys have long memories if bennie wants revenge hell find me sooner or later and it wont matter where i happen to be you dont trust the fbi no i trust you me my father a girl named dale and thats about it so it was an inside job well never know will we i have a hunch that bennie works for the same government you and i send our taxes to thats how he got away thats why hell never be found i still dont believe that kyle shrugged and for a long time nothing was said finally kyle glanced at his watch look roy its sunday afternoon and you have a family go home what about you me im walking out the door taking a long hike to my apartment not once looking over my shoulder and when i get there ill load up my clothes and as much junk as possible cram all of it into my jeep that has miles on the odometer and drive home i should get there in time for a late dinner with my father tomorrow he and i will draw up a partnership agreement mcavoy mcavoy attorneysatlaw and ill make partner faster than any graduate in the history of the yale law school i like it the editor in chief of the yale law journal practicing law on main street in york pennsylvania i like it too real clients real people real cases deer hunting on saturdays steelers on sundays a real life youre not kidding are you i have never been more serious come on ill walk you out they rode the elevator to the lobby and walked out of the building they shook hands and said goodbye and roy watched his client stride nonchalantly along broad street and disappear around a corner
