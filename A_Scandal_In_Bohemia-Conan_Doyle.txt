chapter one the kings mistake for sherlock holmes there was only one woman in the world he did not love her because he never loved women but after their meeting he never forgot her her name was irene adler one night in march i visited my old friend at his home in baker street i was married by now so i did not often see him come in watson he said sit down im happy to see you because ive got something to show you what do you think of this it arrived in the last post it was a letter with no date name or address it said tonight someone will visit you to talk about some very secret business you have helped other important people and you can we hope help us be in your room at pm the paper what do you think about the paper asked holmes i tried to think like holmes its expensive so this person is rich its strange paper yes its not english if you look at it in the light you can see that it was made in bohemia and a german i think wrote the letter ah here comes our man now we could hear the horses in the street shall i leave holmes i asked no no i need your help this will be interesting my friend answered there was a knock at the door come in called holmes a tall strong man came into the room he was wearing expensive clothes and a mask over his face you can call me count von kramm i come from bohemia he said my business is most important before i tell you about it do you agree to keep it a secret i do we said together a very important person who belongs to a royal family has sent me to ask for your help he went on i wear a mask because nobody must know who that person is i must explain how important this business is if you cannot help there will be difficulty and trouble for one of the most important families in europe and perhaps a very big scandal i am talking about the famous house of ormstein kings of bohemia i know your majesty said holmes he quietly smoked his cigarette the man jumped up from his chair what he cried how do you know who i am then he pulled the mask off his face and threw it on the ground you are right why do i hide it i am the king i am wilhelm von ormstein king of bohemia i came to see you myself because i could not ask another person to tell my story it must be a secret you understand very well go on said holmes he closed his eyes and listened five years ago i met a woman called irene adler we ah said holmes irene adler born in singer lives in london a very beautiful woman i hear he looked at the king you and she you loved her for a while and then left her but before you left her you wrote her some letters perhaps and now you want to get these letters back thats right did you marry her no if she asks you for money and shows you the letters you can say that you didnt write them but mr holmes she also has my photograph you can say that you didnt give her a photograph we were both in the photograph oh dear that was a mistake your majesty i know i was stupid but i was very young you must get the photograph back can you steal it from her house i have tried five times but my men couldnt find it what can i do holmes laughed this is very interesting what does she plan to do with the photograph soon i am going to marry clotilde lothman von saxemeningen daughter of the king of scandinavia you know of course that we are two of the most important royal families in europe clotilde will never marry me if she learns that i have been a friend of irene adler you do not know irene adler shes a beautiful woman but she can be as hard as a man she was angry when i left her and so she doesnt want me to marry another woman i know that she will send this photograph to the saxemeningen family and then there will be a terrible scandal we must find the photograph before she sends it i am sure that we will find it said holmes you are of course staying in london i will write to you to tell you what happens and the money the king put a large heavy bag on the table i must have that photograph he said there is one thousand pounds here if you need more you must ask at once the money is not important and the young womans address asked holmes briony lodge serpentine avenue st johns wood london good night your majesty said holmes i hope to have some good news for you soon the king left and holmes turned to me and good night watson please come back tomorrow at three oclock in the afternoon chapter two a servant finds out when i arrived the next day holmes was not there so i waited in his room at four oclock the door opened and a very strange servant came in he wore old dirty clothes and i had to look very hard before i saw that it was my old friend holmes i cried where have you been ive had a very good day he replied with a smile ive been outside miss irene adlers house servants are always happy to talk and so i have heard a lot about the young woman for example she has a goodlooking man friend called godfrey norton a lawyer who often visits her now why if hes her lawyer perhaps shes already given him the photograph but if he loves her she wont show him the photograph most interesting holmes i said while i was there mr norton himself suddenly arrived i watched them through the windows when he left he jumped into a taxi to the church of st monica as fast as you can he shouted two minutes later miss adler ran out of her house jumped into another taxi and called to the church of st monica quickly i couldnt miss this watson so i jumped into a third taxi when i arrived i went into the church godfrey norton looked round and saw me thank god he shouted come here quickly why i asked come on man we need you and so i helped godfrey norton to marry irene adler they needed a witness and a servant from the street was better than nobody so shes married him what shall we do now i asked well tonight my dear watson i need your help will you do what i ask without questions of course holmes if you think that its important i answered later well go to briony lodge irene adler or irene norton will arrive home at seven oclock and she will ask me to go into the house you must wait outside near the sittingroom window and when it opens watch me inside when i hold up my hand throw this thing into the room and shout fire i took the small thing out of his hand what is it holmes i asked its a smokestick the room will very quickly be full of smoke after that wait for me at the corner of the street right ill do what you want i said chapter three fire that evening holmes again wore different clothes and a large black hat but it was not just the clothes that were different he changed his face his hair everything he was a different man we walked together to serpentine avenue outside the house there were a lot of people who were smoking laughing and talking holmes and i walked up and down in front of the house you see said holmes to me i think she doesnt want her new husband to see the photograph but where is it at her bank no women like to keep important things themselves im sure its in her house but the kings men tried to find it i said yes but they didnt know where to look said holmes but how will you know i asked i wont look shell show me shell have to just then a taxi arrived one of the men in the street ran to open the door then another man pushed him other men were also pushing and shouting and a fight began irene norton was in the middle of it but sherlock holmes ran to help her then suddenly he fell to the ground with blood running down his face irene norton hurried to her front door but she looked back how kind of him to help me is the poor man hurt she called hes dead cried some voices no hes only hurt cried others bring him into the sittingroom she said some people carried holmes into the house i waited outside the window and watched i saw how beautiful irene norton was then holmes put up his hand and i threw the smokestick into the room immediately the people in the street and in the house all began to shout fire very loudly the house was full of smoke i walked away and ten minutes later holmes came to meet me well done watson he said have you got the photograph i asked i know where it is she showed me he answered but why did she show you its easy he said and laughed you saw all those people in the street i paid them to help us it wasnt a real fight and the blood wasnt real when people shout fire a woman runs to the most important thing in her house her baby her gold or a photograph mrs norton ran to find her photograph which is in a cupboard in the sittingroom i saw it but i did not take it tomorrow we will go to her house with the king well go very early before she gets up the king himself can take the photograph from the cupboard and then well go while holmes was talking we were walking home to baker street when we arrived at my friends house a young man hurried past us and said good night mr sherlock holmes ive heard that voice before said holmes to me he looked down the street but who was it chapter four a photograph the next day we went to irene nortons house with the king an old servant opened the door mr sherlock holmes she asked and smiled yes said my friend he looked very surprised mrs irene norton and her husband left england this morning they will never come back to this country what cried holmes his face white and angry and what about the photograph cried the king we all hurried into the sittingroom holmes ran to the cupboard and opened it inside was a photograph not of irene adler and the king but of the beautiful irene alone there was also a letter for sherlock holmes we all read it together my dear mr sherlock holmes you did it very well i thought that it was a real fire and that you were just a kind old man but after i opened the cupboard i began to think i knew about the famous sherlock holmes i knew your address and i knew that the king asked you to find the photograph so i quickly dressed as a young man and followed you home to baker street i wanted to find out if you really were sherlock holmes i said good night to you outside your door my husband and i have decided to leave england please tell the king that i shall not show the photograph to anybody i love my husband and he loves me and he is a better man than the king but here is a different photograph and the king can keep this photograph if he likes what a woman cried the king why didnt i marry her what a woman a very very clever woman said sherlock holmes coldly i am sorry your majesty that this business has not finished well no no said the king she writes that she will never show the photograph to anybody i need nothing more than her word there is no danger for me now how can i thank you dear mr holmes i would like just one thing your majesty tell me at once what it is said the king this photograph the king looked at him in surprise irenes photograph he cried but of course it is yours and so there was no terrible scandal in the royal families of europe and sherlock holmes still has the photograph of the woman who was cleverer than he was the end
