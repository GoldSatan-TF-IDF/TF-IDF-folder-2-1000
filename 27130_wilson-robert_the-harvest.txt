the harvest by robert charles wilson for devon the best i can do right now and belatedly for my parents prologue tonight the president of the united states said as we gaze at the sky and wonder at what we see there our minds are crowded with questions it was an everest of understatement matt wheeler thought he regarded the presidents solemn face as it flickered in the blue aura of the tv screen the man had aged in office as presidents often do much of that aging it seemed to matt had occurred in the past two weeks he turned up the volume and opened the patio doors cool air spilled into the living room the thermostat kicked over and the baseboard heaters began to warm up matt listened to the tick of hot metal in the presidents long pauses the air outside was cold but the night sky had cleared for the first time this rainy march for the first time matt would get his own look at the phenomenon that had been terrifying the rest of the world for most of a week hed seen pictures of course on the screen of his nineteeninch sony but that was tv this was his backyard this was the sky above buchanan oregon moonless dark and cut with bright scatters of stars he checked his watch five minutes after ten oclock back east in the nations capital it was past one in the morning the president had delivered this speech hours ago marts daughter rachel had been at band practice during the first broadcast rehearsing sousa marches at the announcement of what might after all be armageddon matt had taped the whole thing the networks were running excerpts at the top of every hour but he thought she should hear all of it especially tonight when the sky was clear he turned back briefly into the warm shell of the house rachel about time honey rachel had been holed up in her bedroom since dinner rearranging photos in the family album whenever she was unhappy rachel would deal out these old photographs across her bedspread stare at them for a time then shuffle them back into the vinylbound album in some new and presumably meaningful order matt had never interfered although it troubled him when she disappeared into the past like thisunfolding family history like a road map as if shed taken a wrong turn somewhere but it was a soothing ritual too and he didnt want to deny her any scrap of consolation rachel had been seven when celeste died and matt supposed the memory of her mother sad as it might be might also help sustain her through this crisis he hoped so she came out of her room dressed for bed a nightie and a pink flannel robe comfort clothes rachel was sixteen and he was occasionally startled that she had matured so fastit was every parents lament but he felt as if shed grown up in an eyeblink not tonight though tonightin this old robeshe could have passed for twelve her eyes were shadowed maybe a little resentful as she looked at him maybe she felt twelve dont make me see this im only a kid they stepped out together into the night air for the first time in human history the president said we stand in the light of a new moon sky sure looks big rachel observed bigger than it had ever looked matt thought more hostile but he couldnt say that its a pretty night chilly she hugged herself the house stood at the crest of a hill and matt had always appreciated this downslope view he pointed east across a dozen dark rooftops to a ridge where a stand of douglas firs tangled with the stars we should see it about there many of us have reacted to recent events with fear i have on my desk reports of rioting and looting perhaps this is unsurprising but it does us all a great disservice we are traditionally a strong and levelheaded nation if we survived pearl harbor if we kept our wits about us at bull run it would be absurdit would be unamericanto surrender to hopelessness now but the pacific fleet had been decimated at pearl harbor the union army had panicked at bull run and anyway matt thought this wasnt a war it was something else something unprecedented rachel pressed tight against his side he said are you scared she nodded its okay were all a little scared she gripped his hand fiercely and matt felt a cold rush of anger goddamn you he thought at the empty sky goddamn you for frightening my daughter like this the presidents voice was clangorous and strange under all these springtime stars our scientists tell us weve travelled a long evolutionary road from the beginning of life on this planet whoever our visitors are they must have travelled a similar road perhaps we seem as strange to them as they seem to us or perhaps not perhaps they recognize us as their own kin distant cousins perhaps perhaps unimaginably distant but not entirely foreign i hope this is the case but you dont know matt thought it was a pious happy sentiment but nobody knows a screen door wheezed open and clattered shut nancy causgrove their neighbor stepping outside the yellow buglight in the causgroves backyard made her skin look pale and unhealthy she poured out a saucer of milk for sookie a fat tabby cat sookie was nowhere to be seen hi rachel said unhappily mrs causgrove nodded then paused and looked up when i was a child the president said we took our family vacation one summer in the adirondacks we owned a cabin by a river there it was a wide slow riveri dont recall its name that summer when i was ten years old i believed we were all alone about as far from civilization as it was possible to get but that river took me by surprise it wasnt crowded but every once in a while someone would come by a hiker along the shore or a canoe out in the river where the current ran fast i was shy about these visitors but in time i learned to smile and wave and they always smiled and waved back sometimes they stopped and we would offer them a cup of coffee or a bite of lunch the president paused and for a moment there was only the creak of frogs from the cold marshland down in the valley i am convinced our earth is like that cabin we have been alone a long time but it seems a river runs past our habitation and there are people on that river our first instinct is to shrink backwe are a little shy after such a long time by ourselves but we also feel the impulse to smile and say hello and trust that the stranger is friendly and i think that is a strength i think that impulse is what will carry us through this crisis and i urge all of you to cultivate it in your hearts i believe that when the story of our time is written historians will say we were generous and we were open and that what might have seemed at first like the end of the world was simply the beginning of a new friendship i urge you all but the presidents words were lost in rachels gasp nancy causgrove fumbled her grip on the milk bottle it shattered on the stone patio a wet explosion matt stared at the sky above the western horizonstark behind the silhouette of the douglas firsthe bonewhite orb of the alien spaceship had begun to rise there were three things in this world matt wheeler loved above all else his daughter his work and the town of buchanan oregon gazing at this blank and unimaginably large structure as it glided above the trees as it eclipsed orion and wheeled toward gemini he was struck with a sudden conviction all three of those things are in danger it was a thought born in the animal fear of this new thing in the sky and matt worked to suppress it but the thought would recur everything he loved was fragile everything he loved might be forfeit to this nameless new moon the thought was persistent the thought was true a year passed part one new moon chapter august the crisis some people call contact continues to preoccupy congress and the administration as elections approach we call it contact but as senator russell welland r iowa observed last week contact is the thing most conspicuously lacking the spacecraftif it is a spacecrafthas circled the earth for more than a year without attempting any kind of signal on the sole occasion when it displayed a sign of lifewhen it emitted the structures that occupy our major cities like so many monuments to the ineffectiveness of our air defensesit was an event impossible to interpret its as if we have been invaded by a troop of extraterrestrial mimes deranged but very powerful or so the conventional wisdom would have us believe in the city of rumors nothing is taken for granted recent highlevel international summitsincluding several underreported jaunts by the secretary of statehave sparked suspicion that genuine contact of some kind may be imminent according to unofficial white house sources backchannel lines to the germans the russians and the chineseamong othershave been buzzing with traffic for at least a week coincidence who knows clearly however something is afoot and congressional leaders of both parties are demanding to be let in on it august installment of the nationally syndicated column washington insider from the scrapbook of miss miriam flett buchanan oregon a year and some months after the immense alien artifact parked itself in a close orbit of the earth matt wheeler spent an afternoon wondering how to invite annie gates to the party he was hosting friday night the question was not whether to invite herobviously he wouldbut how more precisely what would the invitation suggest about their relationship and what did he want it to suggest pondering the question he washed his hands and prepared to see the last two patients of the day in a town the size of buchanan a doctor ends up treating the people he sees at backyard barbecues his last patients were beth porter daughter of billy a sometimespatient and lillian bix wife of his friend jim the two women beth and lillian were posed at opposite ends of the waitingroom sofa like mismatched bookends lillian paged through a readers digest and dabbed her nose with a hankie beth stared at the far wall absorbed in the music that seeped from the headphones of her walkman like the rhythmic rattling of a pressed tin pie plate a few more years of this matt thought and hed be treating her for hearing loss the teenager was first up beth he said she gazed into space beth beth she looked up with the resentment of someone startled out of a dream the resentment faded when she recognized matt she thumbed a switch on the cassette player and pried the phones out of her ears thank you he said come on in as he turned annie gates stepped out of her consulting room with a file folder in hand she glanced at beth shot him a look good luck matt returned a smile annie gates wore medical whites and a stethoscope around her neck unlike beth and lillian annie and matt were a matched set they were business partners they were professionals he was sort of in love with her he had been sort of in love with her for most of a decade matt wheeler had been practicing primarycare medicine in this building for fifteen years he had grown up in buchanan developed what he thought of as the medical impulse in buchanan and after serving his residency in a seattle hospital and passing his general boards he had hightailed it back to buchanan to open a private practice his partner then had been bob scott a darkhaired and highstrung denverite who had interned with him together they had rented this suite a waiting room and three consulting rooms on the seventh floor of the marshall building a sandstone legacy of the hoover era planted firmly at the intersection of marina and grove matt and his partner had understood the perils of family practice or thought they did the real money was in specialties in doing procedures the hassles were in family practice not just patient hasslesthose they had been prepared for but insurance hassles medicare and medicaid hassles paperwork hassles in time a crippling skyrocketing overhead dr scott professing a nostalgia for city life bailed out and left for l a in last matt heard he was working at the kind of corporate storefront clinic sometimes called a docinthebox byebye hassles byebye independence matt persevered he couldnt imagine a life outside of buchanan and he couldnt imagine any work more satisfying than the work he did at least when he was allowed to do it celeste had died around the time bob left for california and the new demands on his time had been perhaps a blessing in disguise bob scotts replacement showed up in june of that year a young female internist named anne gates matt had not expected a woman to show interest in the partnership particularly not a young blond woman in a businesslike skirt and a pair of blackrimmed glasses that amplified her eyes into something owlish and fiercely solemn he told her shed have to put in long hours make house calls cover at the local er and expect nothing spectacular in the way of remuneration its not city work he said thinking of bob scotts defection and the cut of that perry ellis skirt whereupon anne gates informed him that she had grown up in a farm town on the prairies of southern manitoba she knew what small towns were like and buchanan didnt look so damn small to her though it did look decent she had survived a residency in an innercity hospital where most of the er patients had been gunshot wounds knife wounds and drug ods she had emerged from this ordeal still believing in the fundamental value of primarycare medicine and as far as remuneration went she would be happy to live in the absence of cockroaches get more than five hours sleep in a given week and treat at least the occasional patient who didnt initiate the relationship by vomiting on her whereupon matt wheeler discovered he had a new partner they had worked together for nearly a year before they discovered each other as human beings he was recovering from celestes death and what interested him about anne gates in that unhappy time was for instance her remarkable finesse with fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy a procedure he loathed and dreaded or her uneasiness with cranial injuries of any kind they shifted patients according to each others weaknesses and strengths anne ended up with many of his geriatric patients and he took an extra share of pediatrics but she was also a woman and matt was a widower and there were days when the vector of that equation did not escape him on the first anniversary of her arrival in buchanan he took her to dinner at the fishin boat a restaurant by the marina softshell crab shallots in butter margueritas and a prearranged ban on docspeak by the end of the evening he was calling her annie they went to bed for the first time the week after that they were passionately involved for most of that year the year after they seemed to drift apart no arguments but fewer dates fewer nights together then the pace picked up for another six months then another hiatus they never talked about it matt wasnt certain whether these peaks and valleys were his fault or hers whether they were even a bad thing he knew for a fact however that a pattern had been established nearly ten years had passed since annie gates stepped through that office door for the first time marts hair had grayed at the temples and run back a little from his brow and annie had developed frown lines at the corners of her eyes but ten years was an eyeblink really and at no point in that time had they ever been entirely separate or entirely together lately they had drifted through another vacuum and he wondered how she would take this invitation for friday evening as a courtesy or as a suggestion to spend the night and which did he prefer the question lingered he showed beth porter into his consulting room down the hall from annes the consulting room was marts enclave a space of his own creation its centerpiece was a set of authentic victorian oak medical cabinets purchased at a rural auction in behind his desk was a creaking leather chair that had formed itself to the precise contour of his behind the window looked crosstown beyond the sweltering marina to the open sea beth porter took her place in the patient chair while matt adjusted the blinds to keep out the afternoon sun annie had recently equipped her office with vertical blinds covered in cloth which looked exactly sideways to matt his consultancy announced tradition annies replied progress maybe that was the invisible hand that conspired to pull them apart she was on his mind today though wasnt she he took his seat and looked across the desk at beth porter he had examined her file before he called her in matt had been beths regular doctor since her eleventh birthday when her mother had dragged her into the waiting room a sullen child wearing a cardboard party hat over a face swollen to the proportions of a jackolantern between rounds of birthday cake and ice cream beth had somehow disturbed a hornet nest in the cherry tree in the porters backyard the histamine reaction had been so sudden and so intense that her mother hadnt even tried to pry off the party hat the string was embedded in the swollen flesh under her chin nine years ago since then hed seen her only sporadically and not at all since she turned fifteen here was another trick of time beth wasnt a child anymore she was a chunky potentially attractive twentyyearold who had chosen to wear her sexuality as a badge of defiance she was dressed in blue jeans and a tight tshirt and matt noticed a blue mark periodically visible as her collar dipped below the left shoulder a tattoo he thought god help us all what brings you in today beth a cold she said matt pretended to take a note years in the practice of medicine had taught him that people preferred to make their confessions to a man with a pen in his hand the lab coat didnt hurt either bad cold i guess not especially well youre hardly unique i think everybodys got a cold this week this was true annie had come to work snuffling lillian bix in the waiting room had been doing her polite best to suppress a runny nose matt himself had swallowed an antihistamine at lunch theres not much we can do for a cold is your chest congested she hesitated then nodded a little lets listen to it beth sat tensely upright while he applied his stethoscope to the pale contour of her back no significant congestion but matt was certain it wasnt a cold that had brought her in the ritual of listening to her lungs simply established a doctorly relationship a medical intimacy he palpated her throat and found the lymph nodes slightly enlargedhard pebbles under the fleshwhich raised a small flag of concern he leaned against the edge of his desk nothing too much out of the ordinary beth inspected the floor and seemed unsurprised maybe it isnt a cold youre worried about beth is that a possibility i think i have gonorrhea beth porter announced matt made a note she surprised him by reciting her symptoms without blushing she added i looked this up in a medical book it sounded like gonorrhea which is kind of serious so i made an appointment what do you think i think you made a reasonable diagnosis maybe you ought to be a doctor she actually smiled well know more when the test comes back the smile faded test annie came in to chaperon and distract beth while matt took a cervical culture there was the inevitable joke about whether he kept his speculum in a deepfreeze then annie and beth chatted about beths job at the eleven which was beth said as boring as you might think selling frozen pies and microwave burritos until practically midnight and catching a ride home with the manager usually when there was nothing on the highway but logging trucks and semitrailers matt took the cervical swab and labeled it beth climbed down from the table annie excused herself beth said how soon do we know probably tomorrow afternoon unless the labs stacked up i can call you at home matt understood the question beth still lived with her father a man matt had treated for his recurring prostatitis billy porter was not a bad man but he was a reticent and oldfashioned man who had never struck matt as the forgiving type i can phone you at work if you leave the number how about if i call here all right tomorrow around four ill have the receptionist switch you through that seemed to calm her down she nodded and began to ask questions what if it was gonorrhea how long would she have to take the antibiotics would she have to tellyou know her lover she paid careful attention to the answers now that she had popped the cassette out of her walkman beth porter began to impress him as a fairly alert young woman alert but to use the old psychiatric rubric troubled enduring some difficult passage in her life and tired of it by the pinch of weariness that sometimes narrowed her eyes she was twenty years old matt thought and seemed both much older and much younger he said if you need to talk dont ask me to talk i mean thank you ill take the medicine or whatever whatever i have to do but i dont want to talk about it a little bit of steel there he said all right but remember to phone tomorrow youll probably have to come by for the prescription and well need a followup when the medication runs out she understood thank you dr wheeler he dated the entry in her file and tucked it into his done basket then he washed his hands and called in lillian bix his last patient of the day lillian had skipped a period and thought she might be pregnant she was the thirtynineyearold wife of marts closest friend the conversation was genial rendered a little awkward by lillians tonguenumbing shyness she came to the point at last matt gave her a sample cup and directed her to the bathroom lillian blushed profoundly but followed instructions when she came back he labeled the sample for an hcg lillian sat opposite him with her small purse clutched in her lap it often seemed to matt that everything about lillian was small her purse her figure her presence in a room maybe that was why she took such pleasure in her marriage to jim bix a large and boisterous man whose attention she had somehow commanded they had been childless for years and matt had never commented on it to either of them nowarmored in medical whiteshe asked lillian whether that had been deliberate more or less she spoke with great concentration well more jims doing than mine he always took care of you know contraception and you didnt object no but contraception has been known to fail yes lillian said how do you feel about the possibility of being pregnant good her smile was genuine but not vigorous its something ive thought about for a long time really thought about diapers midnight feedings skinned knees stretch marks its never real till its real i know matt but yes ive imagined it often talked to jim about any of this havent even mentioned the possibility i dont want to tell him until were certain she looked at matt with a crease of concern above her small eyebrows you wont tell him will you he said i cant unless you want me to confidentiality confidentiality even between doctors honor among thieves matt said she showed her brief smile again it was there and gone but you have lunch with him all the time jim was a pathologist at the hospital they had done premed together they liked to meet for lunch at the chinese cafe two blocks up grove it could make for an uncomfortable lunch sure but its a quick test we should have a verdict before very long he pretended to make a note you know lillian sometimes in a woman whos a little bit older there can be complications i know i know all about that but ive heard there are ways of finding certain things out in advance he understood her anxiety and tried to soothe it if youre having a baby well keep a close eye on everything i wouldnt anticipate trouble that wasnt all there was to it but at the moment it was all lillian needed to know thats good she said but her frown had crept back she wasnt reassured and she was far from happy he wondered whether he ought to probe this discontent or leave it alone he put down his pen somethings bothering you well three things really she rucked her handkerchief into her purse what we talked about my age that worries me and jim of course i wonder how hell react im afraid it might seem to him like i dont know giving up his youth he might not want the responsibility he might not matt said but it would surprise me if he didnt adapt jim likes to shock people but he comes into work every day hes serious about his work and he shows up on time that sounds like responsibility to me she nodded and seemed to draw some reassurance from the thought matt said the third thing im sorry you said three things bothered you your age and jim andwhat isnt it obvious she looked at him steadily across the desk some nights i open the window and i see that thing in the sky and it frightens me and now what theyve put in the cities those big blocks or buildings or whatever they are i see that on television it doesnt make any kind of sense matt whats the name of that shape an octahedron a word you shouldnt have to use after you leave high school an octahedron the size of an ocean liner sitting in central park i cant turn on the tv without seeing that and no one knows what it means they talk about it and talk about it and none of the talk amounts to more than a whistle in the dark so of course you wonder i mean what happens next maybe getting pregnant is just a kind of wishful thinking or a new way to panic she sat with her purse nestled in her lap and looked fiercely at him youre a parent matt you must know what i mean he did of course the same doubts were written in beth porters withdrawal into her walkman in the way his daughter rachel came home from school and watched the network newscasts with her knees pulled up to her chin he calmed lillian bix and sent her home did a little tidying up while anne finished with her own last patient then he opened the blinds and let the sunlight flood in a long bright beam of it across the tiled floor the oak cabinets he peered out at the town from the seventh floor of the marshall building buchanan was a long flat smudgepot in a blue angle of ocean still a fairly quiet lumber port not as small as it had been when he opened the practice fifteen years ago many changes since then fifteen years ago hed been fresh out of residency rachel had been a toddler celeste had been alive and the community of buchanan had been smaller by several thousand souls time cruel son of a bitch had revised all that now marts fortieth birthday was three months behind him his daughter was looking at college brochures celeste was ten years in her grave at the brookside cemetery and a spacecraft the color of cold concrete had been orbiting the earth for more than a year it occurred to matt also not for the first time how much he hated that ugly damoclean presence in the night sky how much he still loved this town he believed he had always loved it that he had been born loving it it was funny how that worked some people have no sense of place at all they can park at a motel and call it home and some people many of them his friends had grown up hating the provincialism of buchanan but for matt buchanan was a map of himselfas essential as his heart or his liver he had been a solitary often lonely child and he had learned the intimate secrets of the marina the main street and the little duncan river long before he acquired a best friend he had folded this town its potholed roads and douglas firs its foggy winters and the gold rush facades of its crumbling downtown deep into the substance of himself his wife was buried here celeste had been committed to the earth at brookside cemetery a stones throw from the estuary of the little duncan where the chapel rang its small carillon of bells every sunday noon his parents were buried here he had always believed that one day he would be buried here but lately that conviction had begun to falter he had deposited flowers on celestes grave at brookside just last week and as he passed through the cemetery gates he was possessed of a dour conviction that some wind of destiny would sweep him elsewhere that he would die in a very different place like lillian bixlike everybody elsematt had fallen prey to premonitions that ugly white ghost ship floating on the deep of every clear night of course lillian was scared who the hell wasnt scared but you go on matt wheeler thought you do what you do and you go on it was the decent thing he heard annie dismissing her last patient and he was about to step into the hallway and offer his invitation when the phone rang an afterhours call from jim bix that did nothing to dispel his uneasiness we need to talk jim said marts first thought was that this had something to do with lillians visit he said cautiously whats the problem i dont want to talk about it over the phone can you stop by the hospital after work this wasnt about lillian jim sounded too disturbed not havingababy disturbed there was a darker note in his voice matt checked his watch rachels home from school and she said shed fix dinner tonight maybe we could have lunch tomorrow id prefer tonight pause im working shift hours but how would it be if i stopped by on my way home how late eleven say eleventhirty its important yes not maybe or sort of matt thought flat yes it made the small hairs on his neck stand up well yeah he said ill be looking for you good jim said and promptly hung up the phone he caught annie as she headed out the door when he told her about the party friday night she smiled and said shed be there it was the familiar annie gates smile she thanked him touched his arm he walked her to the parking lot by god matt thought we may be onagainoffagain but i do believe at the moment we are definitely on he was surprised by the pleasure he took from the thought she gave him a brief hug as she climbed into her honda the touch was therapeutic it wasnt good to be alone matt thought when the world had taken such a curious turn chapter brookside in december when the explorer john fremont was mapping what would become the state of oregon he descended in a single day from a howling snowstorm in the high cascades to a lake surrounded by soft green grassfrom winter into summer winter rim he called his starting point and summer lake where his party pitched camp for the night a century and a half later the state was still defined by its geography the willamette valley heartland and breadbasket ran between the cascades and the coast range for miles south of portland east of the cascades was a parched cold desert west of the coast range was coastal oregon x miles of farmland forest land and isolated fishing villages buchanan was the largest of the coastal towns a forest port situated on a broad shallow bay it had grown with the dunsmuir pulp and paper mill est to a population approaching at the end of the twentieth century its shipping docks handled a respectable pacific rim trade and its fishing fleet was the largest south of astoria buchanan had begun to cross the demarcation point between town and city with all the possibilities and problems that implied diversity employment anonymity crime but the municipality still held its fishing and logging festival every july and the local radio station still broadcast tide tables and salmon bulletins between sessions of softcore c w like every town on the oregon coast buchanan was accustomed to rain each winter the ocean seemed to infiltrate the air there was not just rain there was a complex palette of mist drizzle fog woodsmoke and low clouds winter was the slow season the melancholy season but even buchanan occasionally saw a blue sky and this summer had been drier than most ever since independence day the town had basked under a dome of clear pacific air reservoirs were low and a fire watch had been declared in the deep coastal forests crickets ratcheted in the brown fingers of dry lawns afternoons evolved into long summer evenings matt wheelers thoughts had turned to brookside cemetery that afternoon lingered a moment and turned away tonight he sat down to a meal of panfried steak and pondered a more immediate problem that troublesome phone call from jim bix brookside had fled his attention it lingered in the minds of others miriam flett for one beth porter and joey commoner for two more speech promised on spacecraft announced the headline in the buchanan observer miriam flett spread the front page across the kitchen table and attacked it with the pocket razor she had purchased this morning at delisles stationery in the ferry park mall miriam appreciated these disposable pocket cutters a tongue of stainless steel that slid in and out of a round plastic sheath as you touched a button on the side they were each in a bin on the counter at delisles and they came in different colors miriam bought one every week this week she had chosen bluea calming color the blade not calming was as bright and sharp as a claw miriam attacked the newspaper four neat slashes separated speech promised from the lesser shellfish poisoning suspected and lumber industry foresees slump she inspected the bottomright corner of the article for a continued p or similar wordscontinueds were always annoying but there was no such notice good miriam thought a good omen miriam did not precisely understand the nature of the work she had undertaken but she understood two things about it one it was important and two neatness counts if beth porter and joey commoner had come roaring along bellfountain avenue on joeys yamaha motorcyclebut they didnt not until laterthey might have seen miriam outlined in the window of her small bungalow clipping newspapers as the sun eased down a compact grayhaired shape hunched over a scarred kitchen table miriam had lived all her fiftysix years in the town of buchanan for nearly half of those years she had presided over the reception desk in the principals office at the james buchanan public school last year miriam had been reprimanded for handing out religious tracts to the children waiting to be scolded by principal clay principal clay whose first name was marion and heaven help him if the truth behind m jonathan clay ever escaped into the playground had hinted to miriam that early retirement might be a wise option miriam flett didnt have to be told twice once upon a time she might have held on to that job with both handsgripped it until her fingernails tore free miriam was not fond of changes in her life but she supposed the miriam who couldnt tolerate time and change had died last year when the eye of god appeared in the sky the message in that advent had seemed quite clear places change people pass on love dies the world becomes in time almost uninhabitably strange faith abides she seldom attended church it was miriams opinion that the local churcheseven the truth baptist which people thought of as a fundamentalist churchmisrepresented the bible miriam believed in god but she did not have what the television evangelists called a personal relationship with him the very idea frightened her the churches made much of redemption and forgiveness but miriam had read the bible three times through without discovering much evidence in those pages of a loving god mercifulperhaps on occasion but miriam believed most profoundly in the scary god of abraham and isaac the god who demanded his sacrifices in flesh and blood who swept aside humanity when humanity displeased him the way a farmer might spray his crops with malathion to eradicate a persistent infestation of beetles these thoughts were vaguely on her mind as miriam directed her eyes to the clipping before her the white house announced today that the president would address the nation amidst growing rumors of a new breakthrough in communication with the socalled alien spacecraft orbiting the earth similar announcements have been made by the leaders of several major powers including president yudenich of the russian republic and prime minister walker of britain these announcements have led to accusations of a highlevel conspiracy to conceal information in a speech to congress republican whip robert mayhew accused the president of but miriam sighed and pushed the scrap of paper away tonight she seemed to have no relish for the news particularly political news she settled her bifocals on the table and rubbed her eyes the kitchen table had been much eroded by miriams work over the course of a year her cutter bladesbearing down a little too hard on this clipping or thathad stripped away slivers of formica the table had come to look like a butcher block and miriam regretted it the kitchen otherwise was quite tidy she had always believed in a tidy kitchen she picked up her eyeglasses and pulled her scrapbook closer this was the current volume volume ten the other nine were stacked on a hutch beside the table the upper shelf held spice bottles and cookbooks the lower shelf her work it was not long after she left the school boards employshortly after the eye of god appearedthat miriam began to understand that she was quite alone in the world friendless in buchanan considered an eccentric even by the churches of her family only her father had remained aliveand that barely he had been living in the mount bailiwick care community incontinent and incoherent but miriam had visited him every day had talked to him even when his pupils dilated with foggy disinterest she told him about her project ive started clipping the papers she said and watched him carefully for some tic of surprise or discouragement there was none unshaven he sat in bed and looked at miriam with the same passive stare he directed at the tv set as soon as miriam left the room or before she arrived emboldened she went on i think its what im supposed to do i cant explain how i know that i dont suppose anybody told me to do it but i will take all the newspaper writing about the eye of god and ill put those clippings in a book and at the end of all this it will remind someone what happened i dont know what the end will be or who will need to be reminded but thats what ill do in the old days daddy would have had some answer he used to have quite a lot to say about miriams projects almost always disparaging miriam had never quite lived up to daddys expectations since the stroke however daddy had had no expectations whatsoever miriam could say and do what she wishedeven in this room she had wished to quit her job when principal clay accused her of fanaticism she had done so she had wished to keep a scrapbook so miriam had done so she pulled down volume one from the shelf it was little more than a year old but the newsprint inside had already begun to turn brittle and yellow all these clippings were from the observer mostly labeled upi or reuters miriam could have had more clippings if shed taken a portland paper or gone down to duffys for the new york times but the point of the exercise wasnt more the point was enough nasa mystified by object in sky her first and fondly remembered miriam turned a page not necessarily hostile says un committee fear sweeps world mobs topple governments in jordan angola miriam turned a whole sheaf of pages new york city rescinds curfew panic has subsided says mayor such a sweep of history enclosed in these books she skipped ahead to volume three by volume three the screaming headlines were more sparse many of the clippings were from the features section socalled opinion pieces in miriams opinion worthless but she had collated them faithfully life in universe inevitable sagan astronomer and popular writer carl sagan argues that the events of the past six months were inevitable in one form or another given overwhelming odds that life has evolved elsewhere in the galaxy we ought to be grateful that this has happened in our lifetime sagan does not see the artifact as a threat its true that no attempt at communication has been made but recall that any journey between stars must take an immensely long time the entities responsible must be capable of exercising an enormous patience we should try to do the same but miriam recognized that song it was a lullaby whistled in the dark clipping the observer miriam had grown tired of sagan and all the other pundits to whom the media had so eagerly flocked in the end they were as plainly ignorant as everyone else and as plainly misguided it is an eye miriam thought and was there any question just who was peering through it and an eye must have a hand of judgment volume six april and may of this year a very fat volume indeed alien artifacts in major cities but the photographs told the tale best here was a telescopic view of the socalled artifact starry dots emerging from it like so much confetti or winter snow a snow of some two hundred flakes dispersed equivalently across the world then in the later pictures not flakes of snow any longer but faceted obsidian structures hanging above all the worlds proud hives new york los angeles london and moscow and mexico city and amsterdam and johannesburg and baghdad and jerusalem and too many others all marked on a newsprint map of the world dated april grim octahedral slabs inhumanly perfect they did not fly veer dash dart or glide simply fell through the atmosphere like so many precisely aimed bubbles they landed with the gentility of butterflies in available open spaces and when they had landed they did not move no visitors emerged having arrived the octahedrons did nothing more spectacular than cast their own immense shadows miriam supposed mr sagan was continuing to advise patience it was not the eye but these several fingers of god that seemed to have worked an effect on the people of buchanan miriam knew people had begun to take the eye for granted as people will take anything for granted if it stands still long enough but the fingers were a message they said yes ive come for a purpose no im not finished with you and i move slowly but inexorably and you may not lift a hand against me it was a truth that penetrated the idiotic cheerfulness of her neighbors a truth that bent the backs of the proud and softened the voices of the mighty the town of buchanan seemed to acknowledge at last that this was the endtime or something like itthat nothing predictable would happen anymore miriam opened volume ten to the first blank page and installed speech promised on spacecraft with a few dabs of her glustik also from delisles she hoped this was the only clipping from the observer tonight miriam was tired she had shopped for the weeks groceries today and felt worn out maybe even a little feverish lightheaded the checkout girl at delisles had sneezed three times into her hankie as miriam was purchasing her cutter blade today miriam had paid with a onedollar bill and hoped she hadnt been handed a case of influenza along with her change what were they calling it taiwan flu that was all she needed what with the difficult times ahead of her but miriam was dutiful and didnt go directly to bed instead she turned the pages of the observer and frowned through her bifocals at every article there was nothing more for her collation in the first section she observed with pleasure that perdys the big department store at the ferry park mall had stopped running their new moon madness sale ads with that ridiculous drawing of the eye of god beaming at a kenmore washing machine maybe perdys advertising department had been talked out of this sacrilege or maybe they were just nervouslike everybody else skimming section two the only other section the observer possessed miriam was startled by something she had not expected it was her fathers obituary silly to be surprised she had arranged for it herself daddy had been a respected instructor in lathe mechanics at the community college and miriam thought his passing deserved notice in the observer but the impending publication of the obituary like so many of the other occasions and observances surrounding his death had slipped from miriams mind like a dew drop falling from a leaf seeing the notice brought it all back she had marked appointments on her calendar a meeting saturday with rev ackroyd to arrange details of the memorial service a check to the funeral director at brookside notices to daddys friends and colleagues of whom only a handful were still living he had died monday night in his sleep the doctor at mount bailiwick said daddys heart had simply stopped like a weary soldier surrendering the flag but she had not witnessed the death and still couldnt encompass the simple fact of his absence there would be no more painful wordless visits to his room no more of the awful suspicion that his body had been vacant since the strokethat he had been replaced by some respirating automaton but no more daddy calling her name either not even the hope of it ever again no smell of shaving soap and the razor white of starched collars no more his try to do better today miriam as she trudged out the door to school woman and child since the stroke daddy had been a ghost in a hospital bed in death he had evolved when the man at mount bailiwick called to tell her daddy died miriam had been startled by an involuntary memory of places the house on cameron avenue where they had lived so many years her room in it her bedspread and her books the way the lace curtains moved and sighed when she opened the windows on summer nights things she had not thought about for thirty years in death daddy had entered into the world of all those lost things sorely missed by his daughter miriam said the obituary but that was only half a truth all the unfulfilled expectations that had dogged her even in his hospital roomall those were gone too she had mourned him with tears the night he died but mourned him also with secret relief and a childish hidden glee she kept these feelings to herself of course but the eyeof coursecould see she put the eviscerated newspaper in a pile to be bundled for the garbage she filed volume ten in its place on the shelf she made a cup of tea the sun was well down now the sky was a transparent inky blue the eye already peeking through the big back window miriam pulled the drapes she turned on the television and watched the ten oclock news show a portland program on cable but the anchors a man and a woman looked like children to her children playing dressup where were the adults dead probably she touched her forehead with the back of her hand i really am feverish miriam thought at least a little she turned out the lights checked the lock on the front door and retired to bed she was asleep as soon as she pulled the quilt around her shoulders she stirred only onceafter midnight when joey commoners motorcycle sped past the house the sound of beth porters laughter mingling with the roar of the engine miriam turned once restlessly and went back to sleep as the noise faded but her sleep was not dreamless she dreamed of brookside cemetery at sunset as miriam flett was gazing absently into the many volumes of her work beth porter stood at the south end of the parking lot of the ferry park mall wiping her nose and waiting for joey commoner to show up she wondered whether she ought to be here at all she felt hot and stupid in her leather jacket she probably should be home lying down she was sick after all dr wheeler had said so the parking lot was emptya lonely vastness in the last blue daylight the air was still hot but the sky had a deep and vacant look and by midnight there would be a cool wind running in from the sea beth checked her watch he was late of course joey commoner she thought you asshole be here but she still didnt know what to do when he came tell him to fuck off maybe go with him maybe to brookside in the dark with a motorcycle and this can of spray paint she had bought for no better reason than because he told her to well well maybe ten minutes later she recognized his bike making a noisy exit from the highway he zoomed across the parking lot driving gleeful scurves leaning with the motorcycle until it looked like his elbows would scrape the blacktop he wore a black helmet and a black tshirt the shirt was from larrys gifts and novelties on marina downtown larrys had been what used to be called a head shop until they took away all the drug paraphernalia a few years ago no more waterpipes no more growyourown manuals now larrys specialized in leather pants tshirts illustrated with the gaudy iconography of heavy metal bands and a few brass belt buckles in the shape of marijuana leaves joey commoners tshirt showed a neonblue screaming skull on a bed of bloodred roses beth couldnt remember which band it was supposed to represent she wasnt into heavy metal or the dead neither was joey really she was willing to bet hed chosen this shirt because he liked the picture it was the kind of picture joey would like he came to a stop a yard away with the engine roaring and bucking what struck beth as really bizarre was the combination of that shirt and his helmet the helmet was gloss black and the visor was mirrored it made him look utterly insectile for lack of a face to focus on your attention strayed to the shirt to the skull then he pried the helmet off his head and beth relaxed just joey his long blond hair was matted by the helmet but it came free in a gust of wind and trailed around his shoulders he was nineteen years old but his face looked younger he had round cheeks and a lingering case of adolescent acne joey would have loved to look dangerous beth thought but nature hadnt cooperated nature had conspired to make joeys anger look like petulance and his hostility resemble a pout he stood with his bike between his legs and the setting sun behind him waiting for her to say something beth discovered her heart was beating hard she felt as if shed had too much coffee lightheaded nervous the silence stretched until joey took the initiative you sounded pissed off on the phone beth summoned all the blistering accusations she had rehearsed since she left dr wheelers office eloquence fled she struck to the heart of the matter you gave me the clap you asshole incredibly he smiled no shit yeah no shit you made me sick no shit he stood there absorbing the information with his lip still curled in that faintly insolent smile you know i wondered you wondered well it kind of hurts what hurts he was beginning to sound like a twelveyearold when i pee beth rolled her eyes he was hopeless he was really completely hopeless it hurts when pee well damn was she supposed to feel sorry for him so who have you been screwing joey he looked faintly hurt nobody nobody you dont get the clap from nobody he thought about it last year he said my cousin took me to a place in tacoma a place what a whorehouse i guess a whorehouse in tacoma yeah i guess do we have to talk about this she felt she could only repeat these verbal impossibilities he was pronouncing she nearly said do we have to talk about this instead she gathered what was left of her composure joey you screwed a prostitute in tacoma and gave me gonorrhea im not happy it was before i met you he said he addedgrudgingly beth thoughttm sorry sorry doesnt pay for the antibiotics she looked away its degrading im sorry all right what am i supposed to say im sorry he pushed forward on the yamahas seat climb on no she wanted to tell him its not that easy not just im sorry climb on you cant get away with that but maybe it was that easy and maybe he could get away with it she felt something shift inside herself the tumbling of a weight in the hollow of her stomach you got the paint joey asked she was condemned by the weight of the bag in her hand she held it up to show him good he stepped on the starter until the motor caught and screamed he lowered his helmet over his head there was a second helmet strapped to the bike beth put it over her head and tucked her hair underneath climbing onto the bike she felt a sudden burst of something she realized was joy the mysterious dizzying pleasure of doing something she knew was wrong making a serious mistake making it deliberately hurry up joeys voice was muffled by his visor and the roar of the bike almost dark she put the motorcycle between her legs and her arms around the bone and sinew of his hips he smelled like leather and grease and sweat and wind beth remembered schoolgirl gab sessions steamy telephone conversations the inevitable question but do you love him the same question rattled in her head now highpitched and girlish and embarrassing but do you love him do you love him do you love him her first instinct was that the whole idea was ridiculous even offensive love joey commoner the words didnt connect it seemed to beth that he was an inherently unlovable object like oh a garter snake for instance or a bait shop or a can of motor oil something only a grubby little boy could approach with affection but that was not the whole answer if the question had truly been asked beths truest answer would have been something like yes i do love him but only sometimes and i dont know why she had met him last year during her first month at the eleven up the highway beth had divided the clientele into five basic types little kids highschoolers suburban family types bikers and pickup petesthe guys who drove pickup trucks with strange accouterments roll bars or banks of what looked like kleig lights and who wore those duckbill caps day and night joey didnt fit any of these categories not even biker he didnt ride a muscle bike and he didnt travel with the bike crowd he always came alone he shopped for snack food quarts of ice cream and frozen pies usually and almost always on a friday night she learned to expect him one friday he got into an argument with a pickup pete who had parked his rig practically on top of joeys yamaha no damage had been done to anything but joeys sense of dignity and proportion but joey called the guy a crosseyed asshole and spat out the words with such acidic clarity that beth was able to hear him quite clearly through the window glass next to the checkout counter the pickup guys response was inaudible but obviously obscene she had watched with startled interest as joey hurled himself at the man who must have been twice his age and nearly twice his weight suicide she thought hes fucking crazy but the b oy moved like a whirlwind by the time she remembered to ring for the night manager the fight was over joey needless to say had lost when she went offshift at midnight he was still sitting on the cracked sidewalk outside his upper lip was split and dripping blood onto the dusty concrete in the greenandwhite glare of the illuminated eleven sign the spatters of blood looked both ghastly and unreallike alien blood she could not say why she stopped and spoke to him it had seemed like a bad idea even at the time but like many bad ideas it had a powerful momentum of its own her feet paused and her mouth opened no ice cream tonight huh he looked up sullenly you saw that guy she nodded he was fat joey said with a shudder of distaste she learned later that this was one of joeys pet horrors he was disgusted by fat people yeah beth said he was she remembered the guy as a steady customerremembered the distinctive way his jeans sagged below the cleavage of his rump gross she contributed joeys look turned to cautious gratitude later beth would realize that she had seen both sides of joey commoner that night joey the authentically dangerous joey who had called that impressive wall of flesh a crosseyed asshole and leapt at him like a crazed monkey attacking a rhino joey had been all fingernails and spit and bony knees and her first fear had been for the bigger man and joey the vulnerable joey the little boy joey bleeding on the sidewalk she wanted to mother him and she wanted to offer herself to him the combination of impulses made her feel like the sidewalk was spinning how about a ride home she said what ride me home and ill fix up those cuts for you i have bandaids and things my name is beth porter he climbed onto his motorcycle i know ive heard of you well beth thought that fucks that up same story all over again she was inured to it nevertheless it hurt but he scooted forward climb on he said she didnt hesitate and she concealed her surprise she climbed on and felt the leather seat press up between her legs joey commoner he said hi joey zoom tonight he took her south along the highway and across the bridge that spanned the little duncan river he turned off the highway and circled back through a raw development of frame houses to the rivers edge beth hopped off the bike joey cut the motor and wheeled the vehicle down the embankment behind the concrete pilings of the bridge the air was quiet here beth listened as the crickets resumed their creaking along the riverside the little duncan followed this stony bed to the sea south across an open field beyond the hydroelectric towers the lights of the houses looked too far to reachthe last margin of civilization north beyond the river was only weeds and the greasy back lots of businesses fronting on the highway east the duncan river cutting back into the foothills of mt buchanan west the cemetery joey knew what most high school graduates in the south end of buchanan knew that if you followed the little duncan beyond this rockfall and through the duckweed flats you could sneak into brookside cemetery after the main gates were locked joey took the can of cherryred aerosol spray paint out of the bag he balled up the bag and threw it into the moonlit flow of the creek he tucked the can under his belt to keep his hands free beth followed him along the riverbank she understood joey well enough to know that talking was over there would be no talking now only motion she had the idea that joey was a reservoir of motions that he did much of his thinking with his body she had to work to stay close to him as he scrambled among the weeds and rocks up to the grassy margin of the cemetery he moved with a feverish agility if his motions were ideas beth thought they would be strange onesdeft delirious and unexpected maybe they would be dreams the night had begun to seem dreamlike even to beth the artifact had risen in the sky like a big backward moon it looked faintly yellow tonight a harvestmoon color beth was as frightened of the artifact as everybody else but she took from it too a curious exaltation hanging in the sky above her casting its light across the trim grass and gravestones the artifact was a refutation of all things safe and secure people lived their stupid lives in their stupid houses beth thought but this new moon had come to remind them that they lived on the edge of an abyss it restored vertigo to everyday life that was why people hated it joey had gotten ahead of her he moved in the shadows of the trees uphill to the three stone mausoleums where buchanans best families had once interred their dead too good for burial the bodies had been enclosed in these stone boxes to beth it seemed doubly macabre she had stood once on a hot spring afternoon and peered through the small barred opening into the darkness inside one of these tombs a garagesized building inscribed with the name of the jorgenson family the mausoleum had been frigid with undisturbed winter air she felt it on her face like a breath it must be winter in there always she thought and backed away with a shuddery instinctive reverence it was a reverence joey obviously didnt share he raised the can of cherryred spray paint to the wall of the building and began to work the nozzle he worked fast beth stood back and watched he covered the east exterior wall of the mausoleum with a motley collection of words and symbols like a machine printing some indecipherable code the symbols were commonplace but joey made them his own swastikas skulls stars of david crosses ankhs peace symbols she couldnt guess what they meant to him maybe nothing it was an act of pure defilement empty of meaning the hiss of the spray can sounded like leaves tossing in the night wind he turned to the gravestones then moving along the hillside so fast that beth had to run to keep up he made red xs across the engraved names and dates now and then he would pause long enough to make a skull or a question mark in the light of the artifact the red paint looked darkerbrown or black on these chill white slabs it must be like sex for him beth thought this frantic motion this ejaculation of paint it was a funny thought but truer than she realized when the can was empty joey threw it at the skyat the artifact maybe the can looped high up and came down noiselessly among the graves beth approached him and as he turned she saw the outline of his erection pressing against his jeans she felt a shiver that was both attraction and revulsion he pushed her downshe let herself tumbleinto the high grass at the edge of the woods it was late they were alone and the air was full of scary electricity a cool wind came in from the ocean with the battery odor of midnight and salt she let him pull up her skirt he was like a shape above her something out of the sky she lifted up for him as he tugged her underpants away he breathed in curt hard gasps his penis was as hard and as chilly as the night it hurt for a minute and then didnt was this what she wanted from him was this why she had adopted joey commoner the way an alcoholic adopts the bottle no not just this not just this push and shove and brief oblivion and sticky aftermath joey was dangerous she wanted himnot in spite of thatbut because of it this was a bad and troubling thought allowable only in the neutral calm that came after fucking he pulled his pants up and sat beside her suddenly embarrassed by her own nakedness beth smoothed her skirt fucking in a graveyard she thought christ she followed joeys gaze out across the night from this hill she could see the lights of downtown buchanan and the night shimmer of the sea someday well do something big joey said joey often made this ponderous statement beth knew what he meant by it something really dangerous something really bad he put his arm around her you and me he said hes like some kind of wild animal beth thought a wild horse maybe a wild horse you befriended and who lets you ride him ride him at night to some wild place to the edge of a cliff she closed her eyes and saw it saw herself riding joey the wild horse to the brink of a limestone butte long drop to the desert floor some starry night like this just beth and her wild horse and that soaring emptiness and she spurs him with her heels and he jumps later they saw the lights of the little golf cart the security guard rode through brookside every night and they ran down the hill and across the graves to the duckweeds and into the dark ravine where the river flowed beth imagined she could hear the guards hoots of surprise as he discovered the vandalism but that was probably her imagination still the idea was funny she laughed joey sped away past these houses full of sleeping people wending a crooked path down buchanans side streets past the house of miriam flett who turned in her bed at the sound of a motor and beth porters wild laugh and thought in her sleep of how strange the town had lately become chapter machines jim bix was ugly the way president lincoln was said to have been ugly profoundly distinctively his face was long and pockmarked his eyes when he focused the full beam of his considerable powers of attention resembled poached eggs cradled in cups of bone and skin he wore a brush cut that emphasized his ears which stood out not merely like jug handlesthe image that sprang to mindbut like the handles on a kindergarteners clay jug or the discarded work of a tremulous potter it was also a face transparent to emotion when jim bix smiled you wanted to smile along with him when he grinned you wanted to laugh he was conscious of his own guilelessness matt knew and oddly ashamed of it he avoided poker games he told lies seldom and never successfully matt had once witnessed jim bix attempting a lie he told lillian he had broken one of her hummel figurines protecting the guilty party the family dog whom lillian despised the lie had been so incoherent so patently manufactured and so blindingly obvious that everyone present had laughedincluding lillian but excepting jim himself who blushed and clenched his teeth jim bix in other words was a nearly unimpeachable witness matt kept that in mind as he listened to what his friend had to say from anyone else it would have been unbelievable absurd from jim belief that cautious juror withheld a verdict matt opened the door a quarter of an hour before midnight that august evening and welcomed in this ugly and obvious man his friend who was also one of the best and most scrupulous pathologists matt had encountered jim accepted marts offer of coffee and settled leadenly into the living room sofa he was from toe to crewcut and he dominated any room he inhabited but tonight matt thought he looked smallera sag had crept into his shoulders and his frown hung on his face like a weight he took the coffee wordlessly and cradled the cup in his hands matt interpreted all this as fatigue early in the year buchanan general had been certified as a regional trauma center this was good news for the administration it meant prestige and more reliable funding among staff the reaction was mixed they were handed a wishlist of technological goodiesrespirators bronchoscopes a new pediatric icu but they also inherited a number of difficult cases that would ordinarily have been transferred to portland for pathology it had meant a huge new work load without the prospect of additional staff jim had been working evenings for most of two months now of course he was tired rachel had gone to bed and the house with its curtains drawn against the dark seemed uneasy in its own silence jim cleared his throat matt said how is lilliandisguising the fact that hed seen her this afternoon seems fine jim said kind of quiet he ran a large hand through his stubble hair we dont see much of you and annie lately lousy hours yours and mine i hope you can make it on friday friday friday night a little gettogether i called about it last week yeah of course im sorry matt yeah well try to be here matt said you look punchdrunk no argument is it that serious a nod then you better tell me about it and drink your damn coffee before it gets cold somethings fucked up at the hospital jim said and nobody wants to listen to me it had all happened he said very quickly it started earlier in the week he took a couple of complaints from the staff doctors that hematology results were coming back funny standard tests smack s red counts white counts patients with borderline anemia were showing radically low hemoglobin totals for instance new blood was drawn new tests ordered and he promised to oversee the results personally everything was kosher i made sure of it but the results were worse matt said significantly worse i couldnt go to staff with these numbers what was i supposed to say im sorry doctor but according to the lab your patient is dead when the patient is actually sitting in the dayroom watching days of our lives and the bad thing is its not just a few samples nownow everything is coming up fucked hematology hemostasis immune response blood typing suddenly we cant run any kind of blood assay without getting completely martian numbers out of it a lab problem matt said can you think of any kind of problem that would screw up all these results neither could i but i thought about it i talked to the chief resident and he agreed we should farm out the most urgent tests to other labs until we track down the problem okay we do that this was a couple of days ago we start looking at everything some weird contamination coming through the air ducts bad sterilization voltage spikes on the ac lines we clean it all up we try some basic tests on a sample of whole blood from the freezer and everything comes out within reasonable limits so far so good exactly but im not entirely convinced so we draw some fresh blood from a healthy donor and we put it through the cell counts hemoglobin counts reticulocyte countsplasma fibrinogen platelet counts onestage assays and it comes up fucked matt guessed it not only comes up fucked jim said it comes up so completely fucked that we might as well have been running tests on a glass of tepid well water matt felt a touch of fear as tentative as a cold hand stroking the back of his neck if there was some new pathology out there and if it was common enough to be manifesting in all of jims blood samples but why hadnt anyone else seen it what about the tests you farmed out theyre not back we phone the private labs theyre sorry but the results dont seem quite plausible they want to know if the samples were damaged in some way maybe contaminated in transit meanwhile the chief resident gets a call from the hospital in astoria are we having bloodcount problems because they are and so is portland jesus matt said thats the situation this morning everybodys going crazy of course phone lines to the cdc are jammed this afternoon i take some fresh blood and i put it under a microscope has anything changed well yeah suddenly theres foreign bodies there like nothing ive ever seen before matt put aside his coffee cup which had grown cold in his hands foreign bodies whatviral bodies bacteria on a slide they look kind of like platelets roughly that dimension youre sure youre not looking at platelets maybe deformed in some way im not that stupid they dont aggregate they stain differently im not questioning your competence fuck go ahead i would in your place the weird thing is that these organisms werent there the day before i mean do they reproduce that fast or what were they hiding its just so bizarre if you were looking at blood from patients with a common pathology okay butthe patients are healthy far as i can tell the condition is not making anyone particularly sick how could it not white counts are low white counts are missing this is ludicrous obviously i know that ive been reminded of it at great length if you want me to make sense of it for you i cant but its harmless im not saying that im not saying that at all its an ongoing situation it scares the shit out of me actually you know what i notice everybody i run into seems to have a case of the sniffles you see that in your work matt nothing serious but everybody every individual walk into a crowded room and count the kleenex check out a drugstore big run on otc decongestants my pharmacist says he cant keep aspirin in stock is this a coincidence matt said well christive got a bottle of dristan halfempty in the bathroom cupboard uhhuh jim said me too annie had been sniffling at work and lillian come to that beth porter and rachel my god he thought rachel the two men looked at each other in the sudden silence of shared fears matt said what do you want i just want to talk everybody i talk to at the hospital everybody on staffeither they want a quick fix or they just dont want to know period and i want us to drink not this fucking coffee either ill break out a bottle matt said thank you jim seemed to relax minutely you know why i really came here why because there are very few sane people on this planet and you happen to be one of them you got a head start drinking i mean it i always thought that about you matt wheeler one sane individual never said it why wait why wait this was more of an admission than he might have intended matt did not pause on his way to the liquor cabinet but he asked as casually as he could manage you think were all dying its a possibility jim bix said they talked it through several rounds of drinks covering the same territory deciding nothing speculating probing perhaps the limits of each others credulity it was jim drunk and tired who first used the word machines matt thought hed misunderstood machines youve heard of nanotechnology they move around atoms make little gears and levers and things they can do that now you have some reason to think thats what youre looking at who knows it doesnt look like a machine but it doesnt look like a cell either looks kind of like a spiky black ball bearing theres no nucleus no mitochondria no internal structure i can look at with the equipment at the hospital i wonder what a good research lab would find if they took one apart he showed a thin smile gears and levers betcha or little computers little subatomic integrated circuits running algorithms on nucleotides or something we cant even see circuits smaller than the orbit of an electron machines made out of neutrinos held together with gluons he grinned not a happy expression matt said sounds like jack daniels talking two advantages to getting drunk you can say ridiculous things and you can say the obvious thing whats the obvious thing that this is not entirely unconnected with that rucking unnatural object in the sky maybe matt thought but he had heard everything from hot weather to diaper rash blamed on the artifact and he was wary of that line of thinking theres no evidence i know what organic disease looks like this is something altogether else this didnt happen over the course of a month matt were talking about days practically hours bacteria can reproduce that quickly but if these were bacteria they would have killed us all by now but if that were trueno he said uhuh i dont want to think about that you and the rest of the world i mean it its too frightening he looked into his glass vaguely ashamed i accept what youre telling me but if its somehow connected with the artifactif these things are already inside usthen its game over isnt it whatever they wantits theirs were helpless there was a silence then jim put his glass on the side table and sat up im sorry matt i did a shitty thing i came here and dumped my problems in your lap not fair id rather be scared than ignorant but it was late they had gone beyond productive conversation matt was afraid to check his watch he had office hours to keep in the morning plague or no plague i need to sleep i can let myself out you can sleep on the sofa you asshole is lillian waiting up i told her i might spend the night at the office spend some time with her tomorrow jim nodded matt gave him a blanket from the closet in the hall were in some pretty deep shit here arent we pretty deep jim stretched out on the sofa he put his glasses on the table and closed his eyes his unhandsome face looked pale matt hm the blood i took the fresh sample the blood i looked at under the microscope what about it it was mine matt allowed his alarm clock to wake himsavoring a long moment of twilight sleep when the things jim had told him were still submerged a presence felt but not explicit then woke to a raw headache and terrible knowledge it was a fine sunlit morning he forced himself through a shower and put on clothes that felt like grit sandpaper rachel was in the kitchen fixing breakfast fried eggs matt looked at his plate only looked are you sick his daughter asked no unless we all are she sniffled dr bix is asleep on the sofa hes not due at the hospital until noon we should let him sleep he needs it she shot him a quizzical look but let the subject rest rachel believed in the power of a homecooked breakfast and she insisted on cooking it herself the pattern had been established during celestes illness and continued after her death when matt had been inclined to leave breakfast and dinner in the hands of mcdonalds and pizza hut respectively matt had supposed it was rachels way of mourning packaging her grief in these daily rituals by now it had become simply habit but she did the work solemnly and always had more than solemnly sadly since last year that sadness had seemed to infect all the other aspects of her lifethe way she walked the way she dressed the mournful music she played on the stereo matt had given her for christmas in her final year of high school she had pulled a perfunctory b averageher aptitude for schoolwork tempered by a blossoming despair he picked at the eggs while she dressed for the day when he saw rachel again she was heading out the door meeting some friends she said at the mall she smiled distantly dinner the usual time maybe well go out matt said dos aguilas or maybe the golden lotus she nodded i love you he said he told her so often today it came out sounding awkward and ineffectual she gave him a curious look you too daddy she said and smiled again it wasnt a happy smile it said are things really as bad as that matt tried to smile back he guessed it was an appropriate answer a brave but unconvincing grin yes rachel things are at least as bad as that chapter headlines coup attempt rumors denied white house sources and a spokesman for the joint chiefs of staff issued a statement today denying that a military coup detat against the administration was in the making unusual movements of airborne and infantry battalions around washington dc had roused speculation in some quarters publication in the washington post of a document allegedly leaked from the office of air force general

and left several monuments defaced with spray paint swastikas and skulls were among the crude emblems left behind cemetery director william spung told the observer that cleaning the headstones will take at least a week and will be very costly police chief terence mckenna admits such cases are often difficult to solve acts like this are usually committed by adolescents mckenna said police are

stocking up on kleenex a spokesman said chapter dc the president adopted a posture of calm reposeelbows on desk fingers steepled beneath his chinas the secretary of defense was admitted into the oval office youre looking well charlie the president said and yourself sir charles atwater boyle responded perhaps the president thought with just a touch of genuine surprise the truth was that charlie boyle did not in fact look remotely well his cheeks were patchy red as if he were running a mild feverno doubt he was and he appeared to be nervous about this nighttime meeting to which the president had summoned him without explanation charlie boyle had matriculated through two bastions of pokerfaced reserve the marine corps and the banking industry and had kept his political balance as well as any member of the cabinetat least until nowbut the blank exterior was itself a clue to the struggle beneath his notoriously chilly blue eyes darted periodically to the left as if he was consulting

want to talk to you about your coup detat to his credit the secretary of defense did not so much as blink sir charlie said mildly sit down the president said charlie sat i shouldnt call it your coup should i i know your position is ambiguous and i dont expect you to admit complicity in a plot to overthrow the civilian government it was general chafee wasnt it who approached you with the idea that you might act as president pro tern a cabinet member a civilianan ideal front man youd lend them an air of legitimacy in a country where the words military junta still have a nasty ring to them the president put his palms flat on the desk and leaned forward the gesture he knew was aggressive imperial quite honestly charlie my sources dont know how you responded to the offeronly that it was made and that general chafee was smiling when he shook your hand for the record charlie boyle said i deny all this noted but thats beside the point your loyalty is in question but its also immaterial the secretary of defense frowned he cant decide the president thought whether hes been insulted but hes curious too in that case charlie said stiffly what is the purpose of this meeting its late the president admitted you probably want to be home with evelyn and the kids i cant say i blame you but in times like these i think we can be forgiven for some long hours he tapped his desk with the point of a fountain pen while charlie squirmed ive known you for five years and ive studied your career you were the cabinet appointment i was most proud of charlie did you know that im not suggesting youre a scoundrel only that your loyalties may be divided is that so far off the mark youre asking for a statement i cant make for the record i resent the implication forget the record there is no record this is in camera im supposed to believe that youre supposed to listen the president allowed an edge into his voice the essential fact about charlie boyle was that he recognized authority his life was a long hymn to authority recognizing it respecting it acquiring it i know you the president thought i know your poorboy tidewater roots and i know what the marine corps must have meant to the rootless child you once were more than a steppingstone into civilian respectability though it had been that too all the old totems retained their magic charlie may have decided the man in the presidents office was expendable but the office itself the idea of the office the commander in chief still carried a ponderous symbolic weight and for the moment at least the president thought that weight is mine to wield he chose his words carefully i want you to consider that this effort might be futile worse doomed i want you to consider that the impressive people the jcs may have lined up are not the only impressive people in the country military or civilian there is still a powerful sentiment on behalf of representative government your uprising would not be unopposed and it would not be bloodless and it would not be worthwhile charlie boyle sat for a long time in the ticking silence when at last he spoke he spoke cautiously people say youre in contact with the artifact they say you know something youre not telling and there are rumors about some kind of disease theres been a lid on the cdc since last week you and the brass at the nih and nobodys talking maybe i do know something maybe im preparing to communicate that knowledge in my own good time thats my prerogative is it not you havent said one fucking word to the cabinet even your own advisors the nsc given the climate of the times is that surprising people want to know whos governing the country damn it charlie i am people debate that people think you might be a fifthcolumnist people who are compelled to seek power are prone to say any damn thing political campaigns arent conducted without lies neither are military uprisings you could put these rumors to rest im addressing the nation in two days isnt that sufficient maybe not lured into too many tacit admissions charlie sat stiffly in his chairthe offended puritan you admit you know something thats right i know insubordination when i see it and i know how to respond to it charlie wavered but did not quite abandon his hostile stare you have no allies sir are you banking on that there was no response tell them im aware of whats happening the president said thats your task charlie tell general chafee and general weismann and that pentagon cabal that their plans have been under scrutiny in this office for quite a while tell him they cant get what they want without a great deal of bloodshed the president focused on the secretary of defensecaught his eyes and held them youve served this country faithfully for most of your life do you really want to plunge it into civil war do you really want to be the next jefferson davisand go down the same way the secretary of defense opened his mouth and closed it tell general chafee this was the hardest part tell him negotiation is not out of the question but violence will be met with violence and charlie sir thank you for your time the secret service contingent had been doubled in the halls of the white house the president wondered if that was a good idea too many unfamiliar faces about it was a risk in itself and it created an atmosphere of crisisbut perhaps that was unavoidable he thought of lincoln arriving in disguise for his inauguration sharpshooters stationed around the capitol dome times were bad but times had been worse though it was true times had never been stranger much of what he had said to charlie boyle was bluff and the generals would know it but it might be enough to cast doubt in certain quarters it was a delay he was after here not a resolution the next few days were vital it would be tragic if internecine squabbles such as this one caused unnecessary bloodshed because those lives well they would be unrecoverable if it came to that the president had decided he would issue the necessary orders and surrender his office minimizing losses but there were those who would fight on for the best of reasons and fighting they would die and dead they would not be resurrected the crises we administer the president thought are never the ones we expect he did not consider himself a man especially wellequipped to administer this one his career had been enormously successful but in every other respect ordinary scion of a new england political family groomed from childhood for public service he had graduated from harvard with a law degree reliable connections and enough ambition to light up a city block but it was an ambition hoarded he was not impatient he had moved through the ranks of the democratic party with grace made more friends than enemies he had run for public office first in his home state defeating an incumbent republican so decisively that the party seriously began to consider his presidential mettle and still he bided his time he cultivated acquaintances in the party hierarchy and among the baronial eminences of oil law manufacturing he had lost the nomination by a narrow margin in one primary but won it handily four years later western oil interests had defected from the complacent republicans that year and the south reeling from the flight of industry to mexico had come back into the democratic fold and at the level of the ballot box perhaps personalities had something to do with it the president was a large man easy with a crowd ebullient humorous his opponent had been lean to the point of emaciation prim and too easily confused television debates had amounted to a rout the republican campaign tried to withdraw from the last of the three there was no suspense on election night only the pleasure of watching cnn commentators find new ways to repeat the basic datum that a long republican ascendancy over the white house had come to an end then the artifact had arrived in orbit and every other issue dissolved in the immediacies of that almost incomprehensible event he had spent most of his time in office struggling with it ineffectually of course it was a crisis that couldnt be addressed its secondary effectsthe political instability the sinking national moralecould in that respect he felt he had done some good what an unexpected opportunity for a twentiethcentury political figure to do good how victorian but he had grasped the unlikely nettle and there was still a chance to save some lives and perhaps his interview with charlie boyle had helped the next few days were critical well see he thought beyond that well it was a new world wasnt it he could feel the shape of the future but only dimly he suspected it did not contain a place for kings conquerors aristocrats nor even parliaments congresses presidents elizabeth was awake reading a book as he entered the bedroom she looked up sleepily how did it go the president began to undress you know charlie stiffnecked a little dim selfpreservation at all costs but i think hell be more cautious now is that good enough he shrugged its good it may not be enough poor charlie he just doesnt understand were privileged the president reminded his wife we were approached first were among the few he had a curious thought the last aristocracy the world will see i suppose we are but if we had charlie too and general chafee that will come though i wouldnt count on chafee he strikes me as the type who might refuse i wish it would all happen faster its happening as fast as it can i only hope that no one dies even the generals would come to regret that i think they dont realize what theyre fighting against the death of death the president slipped into bed beside his wife he had brought a slender intelligence document this mornings for the president only meaning to reread itbut what was the point he took his wifes hand and turned off the light when he married elizabeth bonner she had been trim attractive connected to a powerful eastern family in the thirty years since she had grown ebulliently fat there had been jokes during the campaignunkind jokes cruel jokes but elizabeth had not seemed to mindshe did not deign to acknowledge such peccadilloes and the president was only mildly perturbed perturbed because he loved her not because he objected to her exuberant size he understood the secret she had gained weight as she had gained wisdom it was the weight of their marriage an alliance wellanchored and substantial the bedsheets were pleasingly cool the death of death he said thats an odd thought but thats what it is elizabeth said the idea was comforting and true of course trust her to find the most succinct way of putting it and death shall have no dominion was that the bible tennyson he couldnt recall in any event the president thought the time has come chapter fever matt was a doctor because he had been seduced by the idea of healing a dozen tv series and a handful of movies had convinced him that the heart of the practice of medicine was the act of healing he managed to carry this fragile idea through med school but it didnt survive internship his internship drove home the fact that a doctors purpose is bound up with deathits postponement at best its amelioration often its inevitability always death was the gray eminence behind the caduceus healing was why people paid their doctors death was why they were afraid of them contrary to myth the med degree conferred no emotional invulnerability even doctors feared deatheven successful doctors feared it and avoided it sometimes neurotically during his residency matt had worked with an oncologist who hated his patients he was a good doctor unflaggingly professional but in a lounge or a cafeteria or a baramong colleagueshe would explain at length what weaklings people were they invite their tumors theyre lazy or fat or they smoke or they inebriate themselves with alcohol or lie in the sun with their skin exposed then they bring their abused bodies to me cure this please doctor sickening maybe theyre just unlucky matt had ventured some of them at least the more time you spend on my floor dr wheeler the less inclined you will be to believe that maybe so matt thought the contempt was not reasonable but it served a purpose it kept death at arms length open the door to sympathyeven a crackand grief might crowd in behind it it was not an attitude matt could adopt however which helped steer him into family practice his daily work was leavened with mumps measles minor wounds stitched infections knocked out with antibiotics healing in other words small benevolent acts he was a bit player in the minor dramas of ordinary lives a good guy not a death angel presiding at the gateway to oblivion seldom at least but cindy rhee was dying and there was nothing he could do about it he had told the rhees he would stop in to see their daughter friday morning david rhee was a forklift driver at the mill south of town his parents were korean immigrants living in portland david had married a pretty buchanan girl named ellen drew and twelve years ago ellen had borne him a daughter cindy cindy was a delicate thin child with just a touch of her fathers complexion her eyes were large mysterious brown she was suffering from a neuroblastoma a cancer of the nervous system she fell down walking to school one autumn morning she stood up brushed the leaf debris off her jacket carried on next week she fell again and the week after then twice in a week twice in a day finally her mother brought her in to see matt he found gross anomalies in her reflexes and a pronounced papilledema he told mrs rhee he couldnt make a diagnosis and referred cindy to a neurologist at the hospital but his suspicions were grave a benign and operable tumor of the brain might be the girls best hope there were other possibilities even less pleasant he attended her while she was admitted for tests cindy was immensely patient in the face of the unavoidable indignities almost supernaturally so it occurred to matt to wonder where such people came from the obviously good and decent souls who endure hardship without complaint and cause dutyhardened nurses to weep for them in the hallways he was with the rhees when the neurologist explained that their daughter was suffering from a neuroblastoma david and ellen rhee listened with ferocious concentration as the specialist described the hardships and benefits the pluses and minuses of chemotherapy david spoke first but will it cure her it might prolong her life it might send the tumor into remission we dont use the word cure we would have to keep a close watch on her even in the best case david rhee nodded a gesture not of acquiescence but of brokenhearted acknowledgment his daughter might not get well his daughter might die i could have been a plumber matt thought an electrician an accountant anything dear god not to be in this room at this moment he couldnt meet ellens eyes when she left with her husband he was afraid she would see his craven helplessness cindy responded to the chemotherapy she lost some hair but recovered her sense of balance she went home from the hospital skinny but optimistic she was back six months later her tumor inoperable to begin with had disseminated her speech was slurred and her eyesight had begun to tunnel matt canvassed the hospitals specialists surely some kind of operation but the malignancy had colonized her brain too deeply the xrays were eloquent merciless surgery if anyone had been mad enough to attempt it would have left her speechless sightless possibly soulless now she was home to die the rhees understood this in a way the prognosis was kind she was functional enough to leave the hospital and with any luck she wouldnt end up dnr in some pitiless white room now cindy was blind and could form only the most rudimentary words but ellen rhee continued to care for her daughter with a relentless heroism that matt found humbling he had promised he would stop by this morning but he didnt relish the task it was hard not to care about cindy rhee hard not to hate the disease that was torturing her to death there was a state of mind matt called being the doctor machine in which he kept his emotions filed for later reference but that was a difficult balancing act at the best of times and this morning he was feverish and disoriented he popped a decongestant and drove to the rhees house in a grim mood there was the question too of what jim bix had told him he carried it like a stone a weight he could neither dislodge nor easily bear jim was sincere but he might still be mistaken or crazy or maybe this really was the beginning of the end in which case as indecent as the thought sounded maybe cindy rhee was the lucky one he parked in the driveway at the rhees modest twobedroom house ellen rhee opened the door for him she wore a yellow housedress with her hair tied away from her neck the air in the living room smelled of pinesol an old upright vacuum cleaner stood sentinel on the carpet it was marts experience that in the homes of the dying housework is performed religiously or not at all ellen rhee had taken to frantic cleaning in the last few months he had seldom seen her without her apron on but she was smiling that was odd matt thought and the radio was playing some am station cheerful pop music come in matt ellen said he stepped inside the house was not as dim as he remembered it she had opened all the blinds and pulled back all the drapes a summermorning breeze swept the odor of antiseptic past him and a more delicate waft of roses from the backyard garden im sorry she said the house is kind of chaotic im in the middle of cleaning up i guess i forgot you were coming she sniffed and dabbed her nose with a kleenex the taiwan flu matt thought wasnt that what the papers were calling it he said i can come back another time no please come in her smile had not faded the clinical word for this kind of behavior was denial but maybe it was simply her way of coping carry on smile and welcome the guest a new wrinkle in the etiology of ellen rhees grief but it seemed to matt she looked different less burdened was that possible is david home early shift at the mill would you like a coffee no thank you ellen he looked toward cindys bedroom how is she today better ellen said marts surprise must have been too obvious no really shes feeling much better you can ask her yourself it was a macabre joke ellen her smile softened she touched his arm go see her matt go ahead cindy was sitting up in bed a small miracle in itself marts first astonished thought was she did look better she was still brutally thinthe delicate boneandparchment emaciation of the terminal cancer patient but her eyes were wide and appeared lucid the last time he stopped by she hadnt seemed to recognize him matt parked his medical bag on the bedside table and told her hello he made it a point to talk to her though the neurologist had assured him she couldnt understand she might still take some solace from the tone of his voice i came by to see how youre doing today cindy blinked thank you dr wheeler she said im doing fine you look like youve seen a ghost ellen said when he emerged from the girls bedroom come on sit down he sat at the kitchen table and allowed ellen to pour him a glass of up she really is better ellen said i told you so matt struggled to form his thoughts she spoke he said she was lucid she understood what i said to her shes weak and a little feverish but i believe she may even have gained some weight he looked at ellen none of that should be possible its a miracle ellen said firmly at least thats what i believe she laughed im a little feverish myself ellen listen im pleased about this i couldnt be happier but i dont understand it and truly he did not yes there was such a thing as a remission he had once seen a lung tumor remit in a way that could be called miraculous but cindy was a vastly different case brain tissue had been destroyed even if the tumors had somehow vanished she should not have been able to speak that part of her brain was simply missing even without the tumors she would have been in the position of someone who had suffered a severe stroke some recovery of faculties might be possible certainly not a complete cure certainly not what he had witnessed in the bedroom he did not say any of this to ellen instead he offered i want to be sure i want the hospital to look at her ellen frowned for the first time this morning maybe when shes stronger matt i dont know though i hate to put her through all that again i dont want us to have false hopes you think she might get worse ellen shook her head she wont i cant tell you how i know that but i do the sickness is gone dr wheeler he couldnt bring himself to argue i hope youre right cindy said something similar did she the girl had spoken with deliberation as if the framing of the words still required enormous effort but succinctly and clearly poor dr wheeler this emaciated child had said to him were putting you out of business strange as the incident was here was something even stranger he did not dwell on it or even think about it much after he left the rhees house he drove downtown along promenade street where the road followed the curve of the bay there wasnt much traffic it was an easy drive the ocean still and blue under a feathery wash of sky hot august noon and nothing stirring he felt as strangely placid as buchanan looked matt had blamed it on the feverthis empty calm his own the townsbut then it occurred to him to wonder maybe jim is right he thought were all infected machines in the blood a sort of plague the taiwan flu hadnt he dreamed about it but these thoughts too slipped away beneath the glassy surface of the day it turned out that jill the receptionist hadnt shown up for workphoned in sickbut annie was at the office sitting in reception fielding calls mainly cancelled appointments she put down the receiver and transferred queries to the service for an hour so she could break for lunch matt brought up food from the firstfloor coffee shopwhich was understaffed plasticwrapped salads and ham sandwiches on white annie gates picked at hers eyes distantly focused strange day she mused matt told her about cindy rhee but the story felt distant curiously immaterial even as he told it annie frowned wrinkle of brow and purse of lips trying to fathom all this but meeting some internal resistance maybe thats why nobodys keeping their appointments theyre allwell better poor dr wheeler were putting you out of business maybe not better matt thought maybe sicker he told annie what jim bix had said about foreign bodies in the blood of his hospital samples in his own blood he hadnt intended to tell her this at least not yethadnt wanted to worry her needlessly but she nodded i heard something about it at the hospital had lunch with a staff nurse from the path lab she was scared spitless so was i by the time she finished so i called the hematology resident at the dallas hospital where i interned he didnt want to talk about it but when i told him what id heard he pretty much confirmed it so we were keeping this from each other matt thought it was like an o henry story how many other people were in on this secret he said that means its not local no are you surprised no the cdc must have known about it at least as long as jim bix she sipped her pepsi i guess the clamps came down hard there hasnt been a hint of it in the papers i suppose the thinking is why worry people a disease with no symptoms a disease with no epidemiology because everybody already has itso why start a panic surely they cant keep it a secret much longer maybe they wont have to he felt enclosed in a dome of feverish tranquility part of him was conducting this conversation quite reasonably another part was encapsulated silent but frightened by what annie had said these were thoughts he had not yet allowed himself a distant dreamy note crept into her voice if this infection has a purposeand i think it doeswell all know pretty soon what it is he gave her a sharp look what makes you think it has a purpose just a feeling she shrugged dont you think that not a question he wanted to answer annie can i ask you something you said when you heard about this from your friend you were scared at the time yes but not now her frown deepened no not now im not scared now why not i dont know matt she regarded him solemnly across the remains of lunch i dont honestly know he spent the afternoon cleaning up paperwork and attending a single patient a thirtyyearold housewife keeping an appointment to monitor her blood pressure yes she was sticking to her diet yes she was taking her medication her pressure was a textbooknormal over despite a degree and a half of fever she seemed absentminded but she smiled as she left thank you dr wheeler matt pulled his chair to the window and watched shade and light mark time in the street beyond were being sedated the town was quiescent every motion seemed isolated a unique event a car crawled along the hot blacktop in slow motion an elderly man his collar open and his suitcoat over his shoulder stepped out of the bargain cuts unisex barber shop and paused to run a bony hand across his stubbled head sunlight winked on windshields softened road tar and lifted haze from the blank and distant ocean i should be terrified matt thought and im not and that should be terrifying too but it wasnt sedation what else to call this clinical calm we should be screaming we should be outraged we should feel violated because this was was what the end of the world yes matt thought probably the end of the world that was probably what this was at three oclock a courier came upstairs with a folder of test results from the private med lab on the third floor the blood results might be skewed but apparently they could still sort out gonadotropin from a few ccs of urine matt gave the dossier a quick perusal then he phoned lillian bix and told her she was pregnant they closed the empty office at four i walked to work annie said maybe you can drive me back to your place matt looked blank your dinner party remember he almost laughed the idea was ludicrous how was he supposed to conduct a dinner party serve salt peanuts and play nearer my god to thee annie smiled its okay matt some cancellations phoned in this morning check your memo pad there are probably more on your machine at home you can call it off if you want ill get dinner at a restaurant he shook his head no annie i want you to come home with me but there might not be anybody else i know nothing to celebrate i know matt maybe we can have a drink watch the lights id like that matt said she was right about the party of course everybody had canceledmost citing the fluexcept for jim and lillian bix who showed up with a bottle of wine the mood was not celebratory though lillian had announced her pregnancy to jim and jim announced it to annie it was obvious from their slightly dazed expressions that his friends felt the way matt did fenced off somehow from the significance of all these strange events like a patient etherized upon a tablet s eliot if matt recalled correctly the phrase echoed in his head as the four of them fumbled around the kitchen improvising dinner while rachel watched a tv newscast in the next room the president rachel said had canceled his friday night speech but everything was quiet in washington later matt switched off the air conditioning and the adults adjourned to the backyard deck lawn chairs in a cooling breeze wine in stemmed glasses sunset faded the first stars emerged the breeze swayed the big douglas fir at the back of the yard and matt listened to the sound of its branches stirring as gentle in the dusk as the rustling of a womans skirt my god he said itsquiet jim looked quizzical what do they say in the movies too quiet seriously matt said listen you can hear the trees now they crooked their heads at the evening and grew attentive i can hear the frogs annie marveled from the river i guess my gosh way down the valley and that ringing sound lillian said i know what that is the flagpole over at the elementary school i walk by there some mornings the rope bangs against the staff when the wind blows it always reminds me of a bell a distant random tolling matt heard it too jim said is all this so odd friday night matt said the highway runs along the river you can usually hear the traffic usually nothing but people going to the movies guys out at the bars maybe a lumber truck roaring by its the kind of sound you can put out of your mind but you notice it when its gone theres always some kind of noise up here even after midnight a train whistle a siren once in a while or tv annie said everybody in the neighborhood with their tv turned up on a summer night like this with the windows open she shivered a tiny motion matt felt it when he took her hand she said i guess hardly anybodys watching tv tonight matt glanced back at the house where rachel had switched off the tv and was standing at the window of her room the light behind her gazing moodily into the twilight so everybody went to bed early jim offered the flu this offended lillian who sat upright in her chair you dont have to protect me i know whats happening matt and jim exchanged glances matt said gently if you know whats happening lillian youre one up on the rest of us her voice was raw her eyes mournful everythings changing thats whats happening thats why theres nobody here tonight but us there followed a silence which matt guessed was acquiescence then jim raised his glass to us then the hardy few lillian drank to show she wasnt angry but i shouldnt she said wine puts me to sleep oh and the baby its bad for the baby isnt it but i suppose just a sip tang clang said the distant flagpole matt stopped to say goodnight to rachel and found her already dozing tucked in a pink bedsheet the window open to admit a breath of night air he pulled up a chair beside the bed mindful of its creak as he sat rachel hadnt changed her room significantly since her mother died it was still very much a childs bedroom lace blinds on the window and stuffed animals on the dresser matt knew for a fact that she still owned all her old toys a vanity chest full of my little ponies and jem of miniature stoves tv sets refrigerators a complete barbie camper set neatly folded and stored the chest was seldom opened but he supposed it served its purpose as a shrine to rachels mother or just to childhood security the kingdom of lost things he looked at his daughter and the thought of the toy chest made him suddenly inconsolably sad i would give it all back if i could rache everything the world stole from you everything the world is stealing she turned on her side and opened her eyes daddy yes rache i heard you come in just wanted to say goodnight is annie staying over i think so good i like it when shes here in the morning she yawned matt put a hand on her forehead she was a little warm a troubling thought seemed to hold her attention for a moment daddy is everything going to be all right lie to her matt thought lie and make her believe it yes rache he said she nodded and closed her eyes i thought so he unwound the studio bed in the basement for jim and lillian who had both had too much wine or were otherwise etherized too dazed in any case to drive i know how they feel matt thought bound up in cotton buoyant but sleepy there had been occasions as a college student when he had smoked marijuana in a friends dorm room it had sometimes made him feel like this encased in a protective and faintly luminescent fog afloat after he had found his way home on the gently undulating surface of his bed tonight he climbed into bed beside annie it had been a while since theyd slept together and now he wondered why hed missed this the presence of her her warmth and what he thought of as her annieness she was a small woman all her vivid energies and enigmatic silences packaged tightly together she rolled on her side but snuggled closer he curled himself around her the first time annie came home with him matt had been guiltriddenthis had still been very much celestes house and annie an intruder in it an insult he worried to her memory and he had wondered how rachel might take it a rivalry between annie and his daughter was a complication he had dreaded but rachel had taken to annie at once accepted her presence without question because she mourned annie suggested later she mourned for her mother and i think in some ways shes still mourning but she isnt hiding it from herself shes letting go of it she knows its all right for me to be here because celeste isnt coming back matt winced annie said but you matt you dont like letting go youre a collector you hoard things your childhood this town your idealism your marriage you cant bear the idea of giving any of it up this was both true and maddening i gave celeste up he said i didnt have a choice its not that simple theres a certain way you shouldnt let her goshes a part of you after all and theres the giving up you couldnt help which is her dying and theres the space in between not a very big space right now but thats the space where i fit in matt wondered holding annie close to him what had provoked this old memory youre a collector you dont like letting go he guessed it was true clinging to annie now clinging to rachel clinging to jim and lillian and the practice of medicine and the town of buchanan everythings changing lillian had said but it was too much to let go of a cool finger of air touched the skin of his shoulder and matt pulled up the bedsheet and closed his eyes in the summer dark and then like annie like rachel like jim and lillian and everyone else in buchanan and in the sleeping world he began to dream a wave of sleep crossed the globe like the shadow of the sun a line of dreaming that lagged only a few hours behind the border of the night it was a sleep more complete than the planet had known since the human species migrated out of africa sleep tracked across north america from the tip of labrador westward and it possessed almost everyone equally possessed the shift workers the insomniacs the wealthy and the homeless possessed the alcoholic and the amphetamine addict alike it possessed farmers fishermen the inmates of penitentiaries and penitentiary guards it possessed methedrinesaturated truckers spinning waylon jennings tapes in the cabs of eighteenwheelers who pulled into the breakdown lanes of empty highways and slept in their rigs possessed airline pilots who landed s on the tarmac of sleeping airports under the direction of airtraffic controllers who methodically emptied the sky and then slept there were isolated and temporary exceptions medical emergencies were rare but telephone lines were maintained by a few dazed workers who slept later ambulances evacuated injuries to hospitals where a few residents functional but dazed beyond wondering at the events that had overtaken them stanched the few wounds of a few sleeping patients whose injuries in any case seemed to heal without much intervention fire crews remained functionally alert though curiously sedated no one slept until they had attendedwithout much conscious thoughtto the obvious dangers cigarettes were extinguished ovens switched off fireplaces damped chapter the quiet the fires that did break out were accidents of nature not humanity in chicago a welfare mother named aggie langois woke from a powerful and incomplete dreamwhich was not a dreamto find flames licking out of a vintage wall socket and kindling the paper curtains of her tworoom apartment she took her sleeping baby and her wakeful but calm threeyearold and hurried them downstairs two flights to the sidewalk and was surprised to find the other occupants of the building calmly filing out behind her the crack dealer from a was carrying the legless old man from b and aggies personal nemesis the neighbor girl who was a cocktail waitress and who liked to party after hours when the children were trying to sleep had brought out a score of blankets and handed three of them to aggie without comment someone had paused long enough to dial the fire engines arrived not just promptly but in eerie silence the crew hooked up their hoses with an easy economical motion it was as if only a part of them was awake the fraction necessary to do this job and do it efficiently a man from the building next doora strangeroffered aggie a sofa to sleep on and a bedroll for her babies aggie accepted its an unusual night the man said and aggie nodded mute with wonder before an hour had passed the fire was extinguished and the occupants of the building had been dispersed to new locations all in a strange and dignified silence safe and with her children safe beside her aggie began once more to dream apart from the telephone exchanges local communications dwindled and international networks began to fail within hours the earth had dimmed appreciably in the radio and microwave frequencies night overtook the western cities of lima los angeles and anchorage and began to darken the ocean while israelis watched their cnn satellite feed shutting down due to unexpected staff shortages according to one weary atlanta announcer and then there was only a static logo then only staticas overseas subscribers blinked at the horizon and guessed something was wrong something must be seriously wrong and it was odd how calm they felt and later sleepy some resisted longer than others by some quirk of will or constitution a few individuals were able to shake off their sedation or at least postpone it a few moments a few hours a sales rep for the benevolent shoe company of abbotsford michigan driving a rental chrysler northbound on from the denver airport pondered the miracle that had overtaken him in the darkness he was due to check in at a marriott in fort collins and face a convention of western footware retailers beginning with a reception buffet at seven for christs sake in the morning the miracle was that some kind of formless disaster had spared him the necessity of scrambled eggs and bacon with a bunch of sleepy entrepreneurs wearing hello my name is stickers the miracle had seemed to commence sometime after sunset when his flight landed at stapleton the airport was nearly empty despite the fact that its gates were crowded with motionless aircraft at least half the passengers on his flight stayed aboard curled up in their seats flying on to some other destination he supposed but it struck him as peculiar nonetheless the terminal itself was cavernous and weirdly silent his luggage was a long time arriving and the woman at the hertz booth was so spaced out he had trouble holding her attention long enough to arrange a rental driving north he was startled by the emptiness of the highway cars pulling over into the emergency lane until his was the last mobile vehicle on the road humming along like a sleepy wraith listening to a eurythmics tune that seemed to rattle in his head like a loose pea then the denver oldies station abruptly signed off and when he tried to find something else there was only one other signal a countryandwestern station which promptly faded not normal he admitted to himself no more than that this was way past not normal and it should have been scarier than it was he pulled into the emergency lane like everybody else and climbed out of the car then he climbed up on top of the car and sat on the roof with his heels kicking at the passenger door becausewell why not because he understood in a feverish flash that the world was ending ending in some strange and unanticipated and curiously sedate fashion but ending and he was alive at the end of it sitting on top of this dungcolored chrysler in a cheap suit and hearing for the first time the quiet of an abandoned night a night without human noises his own scuffles on the car top seemed achingly loud and the wind made a hushed sound coming over farmland through the grain and the smell of growing things mixed with the hotengine smell of his car and his own rank sweat and a dog barked somewhere and the stars were bright as sparks overhead and it was all a single phenomenon the quiet he named it and it was awesome frightening he thought of his wife of his sevenyearold son he knewanother sourceless knowingthat whatever this was it had overtaken them too which made it a little easier to cooperate with the inevitable he felt suddenly lightheaded too much alone on this immense table of sleeping farmland so he climbed down and scurried back inside the womb of the car where the silence was even louder and curled up on the upholstery and obeyed a sudden and belated urge to sleep among many other things he dreamed that a mountain had begun to grow from the prairie not far from his cara mountain as big as any mountain on the earth and as perfectly round as a pearl a thousand miles south maria montoya an expensive private escort as she thought of herselfor whore as her customers were occasionally unwise enough to whisper or shout in the transport of their passionsattempted to keep an appointment with a german businessman at one of the tourist hotels on avenida juarez in the zocalo district of mexico city keeping the appointment proved mysteriously difficult for one thing there were no taxis that evening which was as the americans would say a bitch she depended on taxis she had an arrangement with one company taxi metro she took a percent fare cut in exchange for leaving the companys business card on her clients hotel bureaus tonight the taxis were absent the dispatchers failed to answer their phones and the streets in any case were full of traffic that had parked along the sidewalks like clotted blood in an aging artery the whole city was in this stalled condition as bad as an earthquake of course there hadnt been an earthquake or any other discernible disaster the nature of this confusion was much more mysterious but maria didnt care about the details she felt feverish dazed uneasy she fixed her attention entirely on the need to meet this client an important man a wealthy man she tried phoning to say shed be late the phones seemed to work but the hotel switchboard refused to answer at last maria cursed and went out from her rented room into the unpleasantly hot night the air glutinous and stagnant and walked ten long blocks to the hotel district past all these stalled cars but not stalled exactly because the drivers had pulled to the side of the road sometimes onto the sidewalk leaving a neat lane down the middle of the street and they had turned their engines off and all the lights the cars had become dark caverns and through their windows mostly open maria saw the slumped shapes of sleeping passengers not deadthat would have worried herjust sleeping how did she know it was impossible to say but the knowledge was inside her it was a harrowing journey she almost fell asleep on her feet she took a wrong turn and found herself wandering past the palacio nacional its ugly tezontle masonry brooding over the motionless plaza and a hundred stalled cars her shoes clicked on the sidewalk and an echo came rattling back she arrived at the hotel an hour late and with a broken heel her determination had wavered during the long walk and she was sleepy herself but she rode the elevator to the fourteenth floor negotiated the pinesmelling and airconditioned hallway to the room marked knocked and then opened the unlocked door when no one answered her client was insideasleep of course a fat german snoring on the bedspread in his underwear skin pale as eggshell and unpleasantly hairy she felt a wave of contempt an occupational hazard and suppressed it obviously she wasnt needed here not a chance of waking this man who had made such an issue of her promptness she ought to go home but the thought of the journey made her weary conscientious to the last maria placed a taxi metro card on the nightstand and lay down beside the sleeping german a stranger with whom she chastely slept and with whom she dreamed dreaming marched westward dreaming crossed the aleutians from alaska into siberia dreaming descended on ancient asian cities on hanoi hong kong bangkok tokyo slept with such condensed uniformity that it seemed to hiroshi michio the last traffic cop to close his eyes on the cloistered neon of the akihabara that so much sleep like a fog might rise up and obscure the stars sleep followed night across the russian steppes across rusting collective farms and lightless arctic forests across the urals and the caucasus sleep like an army moving west until it crossed the finnish border marched into ukraine and then romania then poland where it met no opposition but the cool night air sleep conquered china and rolled into tibet pakistan india swept from calcutta across two longitudes to hyderabad sleep took africa in a space of hours it moved westward from the gulf of aden into the dry hinterlands took the dying children in the refugee camps and suspended them in darkness followed the equator through jungles and grasslands and consumed the stony deserts of egypt libya algeria took its final subject in a fish shop in dakar dreaming unwound the cities of europe interrupting a river of human night noise that had run without surcease since the founding of rome dreaming silenced berlin and leipzig captured naples and milan shut down the humming grids of paris and amsterdam crossed the english channel and conquered finally london where a few frightened individuals had monitored the systematic dysfunction of the world with their shortwave radios silent now but who slept at last with everyone else and with everyone else dreamed it was the same dream for everyone the dream was complex but the dream in its most fundamental form was a single thought a question posed in six billion human skulls and more than three thousand languages the question was do you want to live part two one in ten thousand chapter buchanan awake simon ackroyd dd rector of st james episcopal church since his appointment to buchanan in woke from a long sleep thinking about the aztecs by the end of the fifteenth century the aztec empire had brought the practice of ritual sacrifice to such a pinnacle of efficiency that on one occasion in eighty thousand individualsprisoners of warwere systematically killed their beating hearts extracted with obsidian knives the lines of victims stretched for miles they had been caged fattened and sedated with a plant drug called toloatzin so they would endure the nightmare without struggling the aztecs when simon read about them in college had been the first real test of his faith he had grown up with what he recognized now as a sanitized christianity a pastel sunday school faith in which a gentle jesus had redeemed humanity from the adoration of similarly pastel pagan idolsathena and dionysus worshiped in a glade the problem of evil in this diorama was small and abstract there was the holocaust of course but simon had been able to rationalize that as a terrible aberration the horrendous face of a world in which christ commanded but did not compel the aztecs however the aztecs had lodged in his mind like a burning cinder he could not dispel the persistent horrible vision of those lines of prisoners snaking through angular stone colonnades to the temple at tenochtitlan it suggested whole worlds of unredeemed history centuries fathomless christless and unimaginably cruel he envisioned the sacrificial victims and thought these were men these were human beings these were their lives alien and terrible and brief and then one night in episcopal seminary he had dreamed himself talking with an aztec priesta bony nutbrown man in a feathered headdress who had misunderstood his horror as religious awe and who responded with his own attempt at a compliment our knives are trivial the priest had said see what your people have achieved all your missile silos your invisible bombers each one an obsidian knife aimed at the hearts of tens of millions of men and women and children each one a temple painstaking ingenious the work of an army of engineers contractors politicians taxpayers we have nothing to compare the aztec priest had said and simon had awakened with the chilly suspicion that his own life his own culture everything familiar and dear might in its essence be as twisted and cruel as the stone altars and kaleidoscopic deities of the aztecs his faith sustained him through college through his divinity degree through his appointment to this parish he was a thoughtful christian and on his good days he suspected his doubts only made him stronger other timeswhen the winter fogs enclosed buchanan or on moonless summer nights when the pines seemed to take on the barbed and thorny aspect of tlaloc the aztec god of the underworld in the repulsive mural of tepantitlahe wished his doubts could be abolished annihilated in a light of faith so intense it would wash away all these shadows thenlast nighthe had had a very different dream he woke tentatively as if exploring a world made new and unpredictable which perhaps it was simon felt the world wake up around him it was waking he knew from a very dramatic and peculiar kind of sleep but the immediate world his world was still the same same bed same bedroom same creaking wooden floors the fair weather had not broken simon opened the bedroom drapes the rectory was a woodframe house erected in the boom years after the second world war next door to the church in the old part of buchanan riding up the foothills from the bay a modest house its luxury was this view the morning sky was luminous above blue ocean water wind stirred up foam on the crests of the waves the world was transformed but not new simon thought or rather it was the human landscape that had been transformed they are at work inside us now he shaved and wondered at his reflection in the bathroom mirror here was a gaunt fortyfiveyearold man receding hair and graying beard quite ordinary but all of us he thought have become remarkable underneath he dressed and padded downstairs in his bare feet it was simons special indulgence to go barefoot around the house on pleasant summer mornings his housekeeper mary park disapproved she would glare at his feet as if they were a display of obstinence or bad taste then shake her head in fact simon rather admired his feet his feet were unpretentious unadorned unbeautiful they appealed to his protestant impulses they were plain feet as the amish might say mrs park knocked and entered as simon was tuning his small television set in the parloractually the churchs television set usually appropriated by the sunday school for audiovisual displays the rectory had been connected to cable last june at simons expense and for the purpose of indulging his addiction to news broadcasts and pbs he tuned in cnn this morning where a dazed female announcer was describing the events of the last thirtytwo hours in baffled generalities apparently western europe was still asleep simon had a momentary vision of the earth as an animal a bear perhaps groggy after a winters hibernation stumbling toward the light mrs park offered a distracted good morning she ignored his bare feet for once and began to assemble his breakfasttwo eggs bacon and buttered toast it was a cholesterol sin he could never bring himself to renounce in any case he was hungry this morning he had slept for a night a day and another night he thought with some awe of the morning he had missed of the silent afternoon no human being had seen mrs park seemed to be keeping an eye on the television through the kitchen doorway simon turned up the volume for her evidence of this enforced sleep is inescapable the newswoman was saying reports of injuries remarkably are nil reports of the subjective experience suggest a direct almost telepathic contact with the orbiting artifact and so on simon wondered how long this pretense at objectivity would be maintained good grief he thought we know all this no one wanted to name what was looming in the future elysium he thought jerusalem the illud tempus he adjourned to the kitchen when mrs park summoned him had breakfast ever smelled this good before or was his body already different in some way she hovered at his shoulder dr ackroyd yes mary you had the dream we all did his housekeeper confessed i told themi told them yes yes mary so did i she was obviously surprised but you were religious why mary i still am i think i still am but then how could you answer them yes if its all right to ask i mean he considered the question not a simple one many of his deepest beliefs had been challenged in the last thirtyodd hours some had been abrogated had he been tempted had he yielded to temptation he pictured the temple at tenochtitlan the arc and fall of the obsidian knives because of the aztecs he said sir because there wont be any aztecs in the world anymore the rector said thats all finished now the question had been posed in democratic fashion and it was becoming obvious that the yeas outnumbered the nays mary park had said yes and so had her husband ira and they had known this about each other as soon as they woke and exchanged glances across the bedsheets ira was sixty this year seven years older than mary all spring and all summer his emphysema had kept him housebound and weak as a childhis day a slow rotation of morning game shows afternoon movies evenings rereading the sports magazines that came in the mail this morning he sat up and took a deep experimental breath then coughed but not as deeply or painfully as the morning before the air felt good sweet summer morning air fresher than hospital oxygen it was like a memory long forgotten and suddenly recalled do you want to live yes by god this morning he wanted very much to live even if it meantin the long runa certain strangeness lingering in bed ira park thought briefly about the possibility of going back to work at harvest hardware where he had labored behind the counter for twentyfive years then he figured not he had spent twentyfive years in retail sales and that was enough for one lifetime find something new to do for the next twentyfive years or twentyfive hundred he had been replaced at harvest by ted keening eighteen who had been described by his highschool guidance counselor in a private joke in the teachers lounge as not exactly college material too dumb for an academic scholarship too fat for a sports scholarship and too poor to buy his way in ted was a television junkie and still some twenty pounds bigger than hed like but hed lost weight since he started working at the store there was a fair amount of physical labor involved hauling stock up from the basement and so forth but ted was beginning to realize that his future contained more than a career in measuring chain and weighing nails he had awakened this morning with the knowledge that he didnt have to die and that pretty soon no one would be liable to call him fat or stupidwhich was how he had thought of himself even before he paused by the east window of the teachers lounge and overheard his guidance counselors joke his reaction to this mornings revelation wasnt triumphant or gloating just he guessed astonished might be the best word he didnt completely understand what was happening it was too big to understand but he felt the future his own the worlds the future had become a curious and wonderful thing it shimmered on the horizon like a heat mirage as hard to see as achingly bright but much more real he told his boss he might not be working at harvest much longer mr webster who had also said yes to an unvoiced question during his long sleep told him he understood and that as far as he could tell there might not be hardware stores much longer which would be kind of a shame given the years and money he had invested in this place but what the hell im sixtyfive years old id have to give up the store one way or another i guess id sooner walk away from it than get shut in a coffin ted i think were all bound for something we cant even guess at its as strange a thing as i have encountered and you probably feel the same but unless youre done with us already would you mind ringing up these items for mr porter billy porter beths father was a fairly steady customer usually he came in for car parts from the automotive section billy was always fiddling with his tenyearold subaru a car that stalled at intersections no matter what he did to the choke or the idle or any other part he could get his hands on or he came in to buy shells for his hunting rifle billy being an occasional hunter whenever his friends offered to drive him up into the mountains today he had bellied up to the checkout with a selection of garden tools which mr webster found vaguely amusing the idea of billy down on his hands and knees in the mulch planting tulips maybe but maybe it wasnt so funny becky always kept the garden in such fine shape billy said im ashamed how i let it go i thought it wouldnt take much cleaning up a little work what the hell taking the day off mr webster asked taking an easy shift anyhow i dont know how much longer theyll need me down at the mill billy had also said yes some few had not billys daughter beth had answered nohad understood the offer and rejected it she couldnt say exactly why something in her had grown sullen and hard and had drawn away from this alien touch no not me you wont steal from me my dying but she woke knowing what she had turned down and it made her a little sad the real question was what next what threats and possibilities lurked in this soontobenew world she hiked down to the mall and called joey commoner from a pay phone joey didnt want to talk about it but beth understood from his cryptic responses to her careful questions that joey had also said no wouldnt you know it birds of a feather thought beth well damn the last real people the last aztecs rector ackroyd might have said there were others miriam flett who woke that morning with her agonies and virtues intact but with a new idea of whose hand had touched her during the night tom kindle who had lived on the slopes of mt buchanan for five years in a cabin without city electricity he came into town summer weekends when he operated a private ferry to the bay islands but he spent his winters alone and liked it that way what he didnt like was the shape of the miracle he had been offered in the night a lemming future kindle thought no damn privacy one junior member of the city council and one city clerk a salesman at highway five buick matt wheeler chapter many mansions when he woke marts first observation was that his fever had broken he felt clearheaded and alertthere was nothing left of the sedation of the night before but something was wrong he rolled over and reached for annie but his hand touched empty sheets like everyone else he had spent the night dreaming his dream had seemed vividly real was real some part of him insisted but matt was equally determined that it must not be real and he screwed down that determination like a carpenters clamp over all errant and contrary thoughts a dream he instructed himself was only a dream the house smelled of frying bacon and buttered toast matt dressed in weekend clothes levis and a sweatshirt and headed for the kitchen a bar of sunlight crossed the tiled mosaic floor a window stood open and morning air plucked at the curtains annie and rachel were collaborating on breakfast matt stood in the doorway a moment before they noticed him they were giggling at some joke heads together rachel in shorts and an old khaki shirt annie still in her nightgown they cracked eggs into a blue plastic bowl it was annie who turned and saw him her smile didnt fade exactly but there was a hitch in ita blink of uncertainty breakfast coming up she said for late risers jim and lillian left early by the way they said thanks for the party and theyd stop for food at mcdonalds wasnt much of a party matt said some wine some friends what else do you need annie shooed him toward the table go on matt sit down if you try to help youll just get in the way he watched her move around the kitchen touslehaired and pretty in her nightgown they hadnt made love last night blame it on the taiwan flu but it had been much much too long since the last time matt recalled five separate occasions when he had considered asking annie to marry him and each time he had shied away from the question diverted by some lingering guilt or just a fear of disturbing the status quo their fragile dalliance should have asked her he thought wed have had more of these mornings more nights in bed rachel was curiously cheerful serving up the scrambled eggs it was a rare pleasure to see her smiling when she was a toddler that grin had been big and infectious celeste would take her shopping and strangers would offer complimentssuch a happy baby shed been a happy baby happy toddler happy little girl it had taken celestes death to erase that smile and matt was surprised at the depth of his own reaction now that he was seeing it again how long since shed smiled like that not a brave smile or a halfhearted smile but a big rachel grin but this was a thought both maudlin and dangerous and matt suppressed it and focused his eyes willfully on the varnished tabletop rachel joined him at the table annie did not he said youre not eating i ate i have to dress you two take your time she left the room but not before matt noticed a glance that traveled between annie and rachel like a semaphore signal he looked at his watch and saw that the date crept ahead an extra day how had that happened in his dream he had seemed to sleep much too longbut that was only a dream focus matt thought he suffered a momentary fear that the world might fade around him the walls of reality shatter to reveal a void want to hear the radio rachel asked christ no matt thought noplease he was afraid for reasons he could not admit of what the radio might say she recoiled a little sorry daddy its all right she picked at her eggs the silence in the room was suddenly weighty and rachels smile had faded daddy she said im okay really of course you are youre worried about me but im fine i really am daddy she looked at him intently daddy did you dream last night he would not endure the weight of the question he fought a childish urge to close his eyes and cover his ears he looked away from rachel and said through a wave of shame that seemed to thicken his tongue no honey i didnt i didnt dream at all he drove annie home along the bay shore buchanan was quiet again today but it was a normal saturday quiet not yesterdays odd and uneasy tranquility folks were out in the morning cool mowing lawns weeding making grocery runs matt allowed himself a moments appreciation of all this suburban peace a blue haze rode up the slope of the mountain the air through the wing window carried a rich bouquet of pine resin and sunwarmed asphalt matt followed the lazy curve of the road past the commercial dock where a trawler stood in rustcolored repose through the business district and beyond a high bluff of land to the apartment complex where annie lived he had never understood why she chose to live in this downattheheels corner of town in an old walkup building with pasteboard walls she had never explained there were a lot of things annie had never explained where she disappeared to the second saturday of every month for instance or why she had never replaced her genteel but ancient furniture but she invited him up and he accepted the invitation for all its apparent poverty this was still very much an annie kind of place a bedroom and a big living room overlooking the bay sparsely furnished clean wooden floors the elderly tabbycat beulah snoozing in a patch of sunlight the apartment was as economical as a haiku every detail mattered annie spooned out coffee into the basket of her coffee maker beulah had been fed by a neighbor she paid no attention to the kitchen noises the machine began to burble annie said we have to talk matt he knew that we have to talk was polite code for an impending emotional meltdown and he didnt like it he stood at the window and watched the ocean roll out blue and calm to the horizon did they have to talk was silence such a bad thing matt she said did you dream last night it was almost possible to hate her for the question he said rachel asked me the same thing oh what did you tell her i told her no i dont think she believed you she didnt say j dont believe you he turned away with enormous reluctance from his view of the sunlit sea whats this about annie i had a dream she said rachel had a dream i think every living human being on the surface of the earth had that dream even you he fought an urge to bolt for the door he was sweating he was tense and he couldnt resist his own diagnosis denial announced the premed hotshot inside him youre denying what you dont want to face he sat down at annies lacquered pine dinner table and closed his eyes beulah bumped against his leg he picked her up beulah began to purr all right he said flatly tell me what you dreamed but it wasnt a dream annie said not really it was a visitation and the agency of that visitation had been the microorganismsor machinesjim bix had warned him about no matt dont ask me how i know these things i just do let me finish the microbes were neither organism nor mechanism annie said they were an amalgam of both or something beyond either they were capable of reproduction and were even in their own dim way intelligent they had been distributed into the atmosphere by the trillions upon trillions had ridden the jet stream to the extremities of the earth and by the end of july they had colonized every human organism on the surface of the planet within the last week they had begun to reproduce their growth and their activity was what had produced the alarming hematology results their job was to function as the voice of the artifact that is of the travellers annie called them travellers because that was their name for themselves it defined them like the microbes they created they were not organic beings unlike their creations they once had been they had been both organic and planetbound creatures like ambulatory sponges building their cities in the methanerich tidal sinks of an earthsized moon orbiting a jovian planet of an unimaginably distant star they had outgrown their world they had poisoned it with organic and machine wastes a catastrophe averted only by their abandonment of both organism and mechanism in the wake of that crisis they became travellers planetless bodiless the artifact was their world now it was both a physical structure and a much larger virtual environment they inhabited it a greater number of souls than the earth contained human beings but only a few of them occupied physical bodies at any given time and then only for the purpose of repairing and maintaining the artifact itself they were she told matt not a hive or a computer or any such easily imagined thing they were separate creatures individuals uniquebut capable of so much more being immaterial of complex joinings and indefinite sleeps of enduring the long journeys between stars without boredom or decline of learning without ending their lifespan was indefinite unlimited they had achieved a kind of immortality they had been travellers annie saidknowing some of these things only as she said themsince the earth was a whirl of dust and the sun a hot new star and they had forgotten nothing of what they had seen in those millennia they were a vast library of inconceivably ancient wisdom and they had arrived at the earth at what they considered a critical and fortuitous moment because annie said we are what they had once been intelligent planetbound and poisoning a world with our waste products it was obvious she said why they hadnt communicated with governments or world leaders they had a better means of communication the cybernetic microbes a kind of arm of themselves with which they could touch each human being individually this more intimate contact was the only communication worthy of the word the microbes which might be called neocytes interfaced with nervous tissue touching but not changing it at the brink of contact they had soothed the frightened population of the earthsedated us annie said yes but only long enough and deeply enough to prevent panic then they had induced a kind of long deep sleep and in that sleep the travellers had spoken they had spoken to six billion human beings over the course of the next thirty hours and what they spoke was not merely language but a complex of for lack of a better word understandings deeper and more profound than language could ever be and they had explained all this and more much more than annie could tell but matt she said you must have felt it all the possibilities the literally infinite possibilities the lives they led and their place the artifact like a nautilus shell not dead as it had seemed but filled with lives strange and various beyond belief they must have showed you that they must have offered it to you annie said because they offered it to me they said i could have it too do you want to live they had asked live without dying live in effect forever and annie had said yes do you want to live they had asked even if you change even if you become in time something no longer entirely human and that had given her pause but she thought again of their long complex interesting lives she understood that everything changed that death itself was a kind of change that of course it was impossible to live forever without changingchange was to be expected and again she said yes she poured coffee and put the cup in front of matt matt examined the cup it was a solid thing gratifyingly real a familiar thing beulah yawned and jumped out of his lap preferred apparently the sunlit floor annie put her hand on his shoulder what did you tell them matt he pulled away from her touch i told them no chapter etiquette the president whose given name was william did what he had not done in quite this way for many years he took a walk he left the white house by the main portico and crossed pennsylvania avenue into lafayette square he walked alone it was a fine september morning the air was cool but a gentle sunlight warmed his hands and face the president paused as he entered the park then he smiled and shrugged off his jacket he unbuttoned his collar and pulled off his tie he folded the black silk tie into a square and tucked it absentmindedly into his hip pocket no etiquette in the new world he thought he was reminded of the story about calvin coolidge who had shocked the fashionable guests at a white house breakfast by pouring his heavily creamed coffee into a saucer shocked but unfailingly polite coolidges guests had done the same they waited wideeyed for the president to take the first sip at which point coolidge picked up the saucer leaned over and presented it to the white house cat the story was funny but it seemed to william there was something ugly about it tootoo much of the ancient vertebrate politics of dominance and submission after all what was a president that anyone should be frightened of one only a title a suit of clothesand not a particularly comfortable one he was ashamed that there had been times when he thought of himself as the presidentas a sort of icon less man than emblem he supposed that was how the roman emperors might have felt anointed by the gods or their chinese counterparts ruling under the mandate of heaven these are dreamnames we give ourselves he thought indeed much of his life seemed like a dream a dream he had been dreaming too deeply and for too long a dream from which he had been awakened by a dream the morning air made him feel young he remembered a summer his family had spent at a beach resort in maine not the riverside cabin he had recalled in that longago address to the nation that had been an isolated july in the adirondacks much embroidered by his speechwriter the familys summer place in williams twelfth year had been a fabulous old resort hotel erected in the gilded age and preserved against the solvent properties of salt air and progress its attractions were its fine linens its european cuisine and its two miles of wild atlantic beach williams mother had admired the linen william had admired the beach he had been allowed to explore the beach by himself as long as he promised to stay out of the water which was in any case too chilly and violent for his liking he loved the ocean from a cautious distance but he loved it nonetheless all that summer every morning he would choke down breakfast and bolt from the hotel like a wild horse vaulting a fence he ran where the sand was packed and hard ran until his side stitched and his lungs felt raw and when he couldnt run anymore he would take off his shoes and explore the wetter margin of the beach where water oozed between his toes and odd things lived in the tide pools and among the rocks when he tired of that he would sit in the high salt grass and gaze at the juncture of ocean and sky for as much as an hour at a time england was across that water england where american flyers had gone to join the battle against the luftwaffe beyond england vichy france europe under the heel of the nazis embattled stalingrad he watched the great clouds roll along the ocean rim clouds that might have come from wartorn europe but more likely from the tropics from seas that still carried a whiff of joseph conrad and h rider haggard when he saw their names on a map the indian ocean the arabian sea the bay of bengal he would dream in such a fashion and then he would eat his lunch cold roast beef from the hotel kitchen and a thermos of sweet iced tea i was once as alive as that what fairy tales our lives are william thought how strange that that child could have conceived an ambition to rule the united statescould have pursued his ambition so relentlessly that he became something stony and patrician it seemed to him now that he had fallen into a kind of trance though he could not say exactly when in law school when he first ran for office he had folded himself into the cloak of his career until it dimmed his urge to run away down some sunny summer beach what a shame he drifted into sleep sunwarmed on a park bench by the statue of rochambeau but the touch of the pistol barrel on his neck woke him instantly the steel barrel was pressed against a space two inches below his left ear sliding minutely against a knot of muscle under the skin william turned his head cautiously away from the pressure and looked up he did not immediately recognize the man who was holding the pistol he was a tall man with a neat brush of white hair a strong man but not a young manon the shy side of sixty the president guessed he was wearing an immaculate threepiece suit with the jacket open william saw all this in the blink of an eye the face was startlingly handsome and not completely unfamiliar he probed his memory ah he said at last colonel tyler john tyler kept his body tight against the weapon to disguise it from the few tourists strolling in the park he slid the barrel across williams collarbone and into his belly as he sat beside him on the bench john tylers name had cropped up every so often in the national intelligence daily or the presidents ftpo briefings tyler had been a minor player in the planned coup detat which had been derailed of course by contact he was one of those exmilitary men who lead odd little careers in the defense lobby the socalled iron triangle revolvingdoor connections withwho was it ford aerospace general dynamics in exchange for some groundfloor lobbying with the house armed services committee or the subcommittee on procurement a man with contacts at the pentagon and langley and at certain banks tyler was an educated man and a convincing public speaker and his prospects might have been brighter if not for the hint of a scandal that had ended his military careersome sexual impropriety as william recalled he knew one other thing about john tyler a small piece of intelligence from a loyalist air force general the architects of the coup had had a particular role in mind for colonel tyler if william had refused to retire peaceably to some country dacha it was john tyler who was to put a bullet in his brain i watched you tyler said his voice was quiet but bitter i watched you leave the white house my god its startling to see a president in public without a secret service escort did you think it was all over you didnt need the bodyguards anymore it is over the guards all went home colonel he looked at tylers pistol an ugly little machine is this your revolution i thought that was over too keep your hands down tyler said i should kill you right now is that what you mean to do most likely what would be the point colonel tyler the point sir would be that a dead president is better than a live traitor i see in fact william understood several things from this small speech he understood that the coup was a thing of the past that colonel tyler had come here representing no one but himself he understood that tyler had said no to the travellers and was only beginning to grasp the significance of contact and he understood that beneath his rigid calm the colonel was teetering on the brink of panic and madness would tyler shoot him he might or might not it was an open question it would be decided by impulse choose your words carefully william told himself you had friends he said to tyler but they all changed their minds they woke up and saw that the world is a different place now not you colonel you can bank on that that was a week ago did you wait all this time to see me william nodded at the white house behind its spiked fence you could have walked in the front door colonel no one would have stopped you i talked to your friend charlie boyle yesterday he told me the same thing i didnt believe him tyler shrugged but maybe its true i mean if youre out taking a goddamn stroll charlie boyle has only been my friend since he woke up immortal william thought but yes charlie had been telling the truth the white house was open to the public like any other museum there was a twitch of impatience from tyler a slight pursing of the lips william drew a slow breath colonel tyler surely you know whats happening even if you dont want any part of it even if you said no to it this isnt an alien invasion the flying saucers havent landed the earth hasnt been occupied by a hostile military force look around tylers frown deepened and for a space of some seconds his finger tightened on the trigger william felt the barrel of the gun pulse against his body with the beating of tylers heart death hovered over the park bench like a third presence that shouldnt frighten me anymore william thought but it does yes it still does what i think tyler said is that everybody has been infected with a hallucination the hallucination is that we can live forever that we can cohabit like the lamb and the lion in a baptist psalm book i think most people succumbed to this disease but some of us didnt some of us recovered from it i think im a well man mr president and i think youre very sick not a traitor just sick maybe both you collaboratedfor whatever reason youre not qualified to hold office any longer am i sick youre the one with the pistol colonel tyler a weapon in the right hands is hardly a sign of illness how strange it was to be having this conversation on such a gentle day he looked away from colonel tyler and saw a tenyearold attempting to fly a kite from the foot of the statue of andrew jackson the breeze was fitful the kite flailed and sank the boys skin was dark and gleaming in the sunlight the kite was a beauty william thought a blackandyellow bat wing for a moment the boys eyes caught his and there was a flash of communicationan acknowledgment in the greater world of each others difficulties j may yet talk my way out of this william thought colonel tyler suppose i admit im unqualified to hold the office of president of the united states i have a gun on you you might admit any damn thing nonetheless i do admit it im not qualified i say it without reservation and ill continue to say it when you put the gun away ill sign a paper if you like colonel would you care to help me nominate a successor for the first time tyler seemed uncertain im quite sincere william hurried on i want your advice whom did you have in mind charlie boyle but hes not trustworthy anymore is he hes diseased the vicepresident the same im afraid the speaker of the house this is contentious bullshit tyler said but he looked suddenly miserable and distracted colonel tyler it would not surprise me if you were the highestranking military officer not under the influence of what you call a disease i dont know how the chain of command operates in a case like this its something the constitution doesnt anticipate but if you want the job my christ youre completely insane tyler said but the gun wavered in his hand its a question of constituency thats the fundamental problem colonel do you know how many people turned down the opportunity to live forever roughly one in ten thousand you cant possibly know that for the sake of argument lets assume i do the population of the earth is roughly six billion which yields six hundred million individuals who are not as you say diseased quite a number but not all of them are americansnot by a long shot colonel tyler do you recall the last census estimate of the american population its vague in my mind something on the order of three hundred million that would give you a constituency of roughly thirty thousand people the size of a large town quite an amenable size for a democracy in my opinion under ideal circumstances you could establish direct representative government if you mean to continue holding elections colonel tylers eyes had begun to glaze i cant accept that i cant accept what my argument or the presidency you cant confer that on me you cant hand it to me like some kind of cracker jack prize but you were willing to take it away with a gunyou and your allies thats different is it its not exactly due process im not the fucking president youre the fucking president you can shoot me if you want colonel tyler he stood up a calculated risk and made his voice imperious he became the president of the united statesas tyler had insistedone more weary time if you shoot me once or twice i might survive i understand this body of mine is a little tougher than it used to be if you shoot me repeatedly the body will be beyond repair though it seems a shame toclutter lafayette square with a corpse on such a fine sunny morning colonel tyler stood up and kept the pistol against williams belly if you can die youre not immortal the body is mortal im not there is a portion of the artifact that contains myi suppose essence is the best word i am as much there as i am here i am awake here colonel and i am asleep there but if you shoot me youll only reverse the equation a wind swept through the park a dozen yards away the boys kite flapped and hesitated pull william thought work the string the kite soared black and yellow in a blue sky lets take a walk colonel william said my legs cramp if i dont stretch them once in a while they walked along th toward potomac park past the corcoran art gallery and the offices of the oas the blind jumble of washington architecture the citys most revealing buildings were still its monuments william thought the lincoln memorial the jefferson memorial an american idea of a british idea of a roman idea of the civic architecture of the greeks but the athenians had operated their democracy in the agora we should have copied their marketplaces not their temples should have moved in some fruit stands william thought a rug vendor or two called congress to session among the peanut carts on constitution avenue he had once loved the idea of democracy he had loved it the way he loved his beach in maine like his love of the beach he had misplaced his love of democracy in the long journey to the white house oh he mentioned the word in speeches but all the juice had gone out of it he wondered if colonel tyler had ever really loved democracy he suspected the colonel had never loved a beach you gave all this away tyler was saying it went without a battle not a raised fist mr president its a crime worth a bullet dont you think the gun had retreated into a holster under the colonels jacket but william was still acutely aware of its presence what are you suggesting i gave away colonel america tyler said the nation its sovereignty hardly mine to give up but you collaborated only if you persist in seeing this as an invasion well i suppose i did collaborate in a certain way it was true the presidents significant dream had come a few nights before the rest early contacts fell into two categories the very ill and the very powerful the ill so their diseases wouldnt carry them off at the eleventh hour the powerful so dangerous mistakes might not be made i think of it as cooperation not collaboration i think of it as treason tyler said flatly is it what choice did i have was there some way to resist would a panic have changed anything well never know no i dont suppose we will but colonel the process has been democratic i think you have to admit that much the questionthe question of living forever and all that it entailswas asked of everyone you think i should have spoken for america but i couldnt and i didnt have to america spoke for itself colonel its obvious you were able to turn down that offer others could have made the same choice by and large they didnt absurd tyler said do you really believe that you think creatures who can invade your metabolism and occupy your brain cant lie about it but did they you were as invaded as everyone else and yet here we are i said i might be immune to the compulsion but not to the asking its an odd kind of immunity colonel they settled on a bench in the constitution gardens where pigeons worried the grass for crumbs william wondered what the pigeons had made of all these sweeping changes in the human epistemos fewer tourists but the few were more generous he should have brought something to feed the birds think about what youre telling me tyler said they approached everyone every human being on the surface of the earth including infants senile cripples in rest homes criminals the feebleminded im given to understand colonel that the children always said yes they dont believe in death i think an infant a baby might not have the languagebut the question was not posed entirely in language the infants and the senile share a will to live even if they cant articulate it similarly the mentally ill there is a nugget of self that understands and responds even the criminals colonel though it is a long journey for them even if they accept this gift because it comes with the burden of understanding and they have many terrible things they may not want to know about themselves some of the worst of them will have turned down the offer the colonel laughed a wild and unpleasant laugh you know what youre saying youre telling me im the unelected president of a nation of homicidal maniacs hardly people have other reasons for not wanting immortality such as your reason i presume the colonel scowled here was dangerous territory william thought he took a breath and persisted its like looking into a mirror isnt it when the travellers talk they talk to the root of you not the picture of yourself you carry around in your head the heart the soul the self that is everything youve done and wanted to do and refrained from doing ones truest self isnt always a handsome sight is it colonel mine was not certainly colonel tyler had no response except a haggard exhalation of breath the pigeons didnt like this sound and they rose up in a cloud to settle some distance away by the reflecting pool where the image of the sky was pleasant in the cool windrippled water over the past week traffic inside the beltway had been light official washington had begun to close up shop in a mutual consensus that required no debate capitol hill had become a ghost townjust yesterday william had stood in the rotunda and listened to his footsteps echo in the dome above his head but there were still tourists in the city if you could call them touristspeople who had come for a last look at the governing apparatus of a nation some of these people passed quietly along the mall william did not feel misplaced among them though they seemed to make colonel tyler nervous i want to ask you a question tyler said im a politician colonel were notorious for dodging the hard ones i think you ought to take this more seriously mr president tyler touched the bulge of the pistol almost absently his eyes were unfocused and william reminded himself that the colonels madness might not be new it might be an old madness that contact had simply aroused and let loose it was as if tyler generated a kind of heat the heat was danger and the temperature might rise at any provocation im sorry if i seemed flippant go on what happens next according to your scenario i mean william pondered the question colonel dont you have anyone else to ask a wife a girlfriend some member of your family i have no official standingmy information is no better than anyone elses im not married tyler said i have no living family and here was another piece of the john tyler puzzle a grievous ancient loneliness tyler was a solitary man for whom contact must have seemed like a final exclusion from the human race it was a bleak and terrible thought in all seriousness colonel its a difficult question you dont need me to tell you everything is changing people have new needs and theyve abandoned some old onesand were all still coming to terms with that i think in time these cumbersome bodies will have to go but not for a while yet it was an honest answer tyler fixed him with a terrible lookequal parts fear outrage and contempt and after that i dont know it needs a decisiona collective decision but i have an inkling i think our battered planet deserves a renewal i think very soon it might get one they had made a circle they stood now outside the gates of the white house and the day had grown warm as it edged toward noon despite the threat william was tired of dueling with john tyler he felt like a schoolboy waiting for some long detention to grind to an end well colonel he looked tyler in the eye have you decided to shoot me i would if i thought it would help if i thought it would win back even an inch of this countrydear god id kill you without blinking tyler reached beneath his suitcoat and scratched himself but youre not much of a threat as quislings go youre merely pathetic william concealed his relief immortal i may be he thought but im not finished with this incarnation besides how would he have explained his death to elizabeth she would accuse him of clumsinessperhaps rightly so you think this conflict is over tyler said i dont grant that some of us are still willing to fight for our country but why fight william thought the country is yours colonel tylertake it but he kept these thoughts to himself i only hope tyler said as he turned away the rest of the geldings are as docile as you william watched the colonel walk away tyler was a man on a terrible brink william thought he was alone and vastly outnumbered and carrying some ghastly cargo of old sin the world he lived in was receding beyond the limits of his comprehension and it need not have been that way maybe that was the worst part you could have said yes colonel and you know that whether you choose to admit it or not william experienced this sadness for colonel tyler then folded it into memory the way he had folded his silk tie into his pocket he might not have seen the last of colonel tylerbut that was tomorrows worry today was still pretty and fresh he had fifteen minutes to spare before lunch and no one had killed him he considered the white house lawn scene of countless easter egg hunts diplomatic photo opportunities presentations of awards had he ever really looked at it the groundskeepers did excellent work the grass was verdant and still sparkling with morning dew he wondered how it would feel to unlace his shoes and peel off his socks and walk barefoot over that green and gentle surface he decided it was time to find out chapter kindle the dream in tom kindle s opinion was just what it appeared to be an invitation to submerge himself in a cozy communal immortality and while kindle found the idea repulsive he harbored no illusions about the attraction it would hold for his fellow men therefore in the two weeks and some days since that peculiar night kindle had stayed out of town he wasnt sure what buchanan would look like when he saw it again he wasnt sure he wanted to know he had hoped to postpone any journey into town as long as possible but that desire became academic when he slipped on a muddy hiking trail and came to rest twenty vertical feet down the west slope of mt buchanan his left leg broken at the hip maybe he shouldnt have been on the trail at all nothing had forced him out here his cabin was wellstocked and he had plenty to read currently he was working his way through gibbons history of the decline and fall of the roman empire the book was not much more entertaining than yesterdays dishwater but kindle had bought it as part of a fivefoot shelf of the classics of western literature and he was determined to get his moneys worth nor had claustrophobia driven him out the cabin was spacious enough he had bought this little propertysome miles from buchanan up an old logging roadin the cabin itself was a kitbuilt project he had put up with the help of a few friends one a building contractor with access to quality tools since then every penny that didnt maintain his boat or buy food had gone into improving the property he paid for town water since the municipality had run a public works line up here during the realestate rush of the eighties but his only electric power came from a gasoline generator in a shed out back winters were sometimes snowy but kindle had insulated the building and installed a woodstove to keep himself warm no need for that this time of year not just yet it was a cabinnot quite big enough to be called a housebut it was a comfortable cabin and he wasnt suffering from cabin fever the impulse to take a long walk up these back trails had been only that an impulse obviously a stupid one the dry spell had broken last week rain had fallen for three consecutive days and the trails were wet the trails were also in places steep and kindle was he hated to admit not awfully young anymore when asked he gave his age as about fifty in truth he paid little attention to his age and disliked doing the calculation when you live alone and work alone who gives a doughnut hole about birthdays who counts em but he had turned fiftythree in january and wasnt as agile as he used to be consequently when he came up a muddy switchback where a fallen pine had carried off a square yard of the hiking trail he wasnt quick or canny enough to grab at the nearest root or sapling as his boots rolled under him and the world turned suddenly vertical he lost consciousness when the leg snapped when he woke again some vital instinct kept him immobile he did not dare to move only blinked up at a sky crowded with moist conifers and worked at interpreting this sensation of something gone terribly wrong he was lightheaded and not ashamed of talking to himselfnot that he ever had been you fell down the basic datum you slipped off the trail you asshole he swiveled his head and saw his own flight path traced in broken saplings and churned topsoil long way down he had fetched up here in a sort of gully in the hillside his ass soaking in a cold stream and his legs curled at the trunk of a mossy old hemlock he took particular note of something he did not like at all the way his left knee had rotated at such a peculiar crooked angle well shit kindle said the sight of his broken leg made him feel both frightened and angry of the two the anger was more vocal he cursed eloquently and loudly and when he was finished the forest fell silentblushing perhaps and then there was the new and essential question that had to be faced like it or not tom kindle have you killed your idiotic self maybe he had the cabin was a quartermile downslopemore like a mile by trail suppose he made it back the cabin lacked a telephone help was in buchanan or anyway no nearer than the closest neighboranother three miles downhill on a dirt and gravel road and there was no guarantee he could move even as far as the next sapling without passing out again he shifted his body experimentally and nearly did pass out the pain when he moved was a brandnew thing a burning stick thrust into his leg all the way up to the small of his back he let out a shriek that sent birds wheeling from a nearby tree when he was still the agony subsided but did not entirely retreat it was concentrated in his left leg between hip and knee everything below that was numb the leg needed a splint it needed to be immobilized or he simply could not move he raised his head and inspected the injury there seemed to be no blood no exposed bone and that at least was good kindle had once worked at a logging camp in british columbia and he had seen a man suffer a leg injury that left his femur projecting from his thigh like six inches of bloody chalk the bad news was that this might not be a simple fracture the knee might be involved if kindle recalled his first aid correctly you dont try to realign a joint injury you immobilize it and transport to medical care he scanned the immediate area and located the burled walnut walking stick he always carried on these hikes good old stick friendly presence sturdy enough to splint a bad break itll do he thought but it was about a foot and a half out of easy reach he pulled himself toward it screaming he screamed throughout the process of binding his leg an act that seemed to progress in waves the waves were of pain and when they crestedwhen he felt consciousness begin to slip awayhe would lie still panting and dazed until his vision cleared then he would work at the splint a while longer in the end after a measureless time the walnut walking stick was lashed around his thigh and lower leg with torn strips of his cotton shirta job he admired as if someone else had done it and if he moved the splint kept the leg more or less still and minimized the pain kindle dragged himself a short distance along the wet bed of the stream the water was only a trickle inches deep but very cold not too bad on a warm afternoon like this but it was late afternoon and some of these endofsummer nights got chilly when the sky was as clear and high as it was today all this heat would leak away after the sun went down and then hed be wet and cold hypothermia kindle said out loud not to mention shock maybe he was in shock already he was shivering and he was sweating both at once he inched downhill along the bed of the stream the stream crossed a trail some yards down then he could get out of the water but not until then there was no way he could drag his fiery useless leg through the undergrowth of this dense pacific coast forest it occurred to him as he crawled along the rocky creek bed that if he had accepted the offer of the aliens he might not be in this position he would be immortal there would be a place prepared for him as kindles mother used to say his mother had been religious dakota baptist cold winter baptist her philosophy went something like kick me till i go to heaven kindles natural father had died of a heart attack while he was driving a snow plow for the municipality two years later his mother married a carpet installer who got drunk every saturday night oscar was his name on the coldest saturday night of a cold dakota winter oscar had been seen and become famous for pissing out the secondstory bedroom window while singing the hank williams tune i heard that lonesome whistle blow which was all well and good and nothing kindle would hold against a man but oscar was also a mean and petty drunk who used his fists more than once on kindles mother it was all right she said marriage was always a rough road and anyhow there was a place prepared for her kindle who was fifteen put up with six months of this before he decided that if there was a place prepared for him it was somewhere outside the city limits he rode to new york city on a greyhound bus lied about his age and served an apprenticeship as a merchant seaman five years later he took a trip back home oscar was unemployed drinking tokay on the steps of the armory not worth beating up even for the cold comfort of revenge his mother had left long since no forwarding address which was probably a smart move on her part thus kindle was alone and suspected there was no place prepared for him a suspicion the following thirtythree years had done nothing to dispel he did not believe in heaven and he had turned it down when it was offered now however he wondered if hed been too hasty a place prepared might be better than this damp forest which was getting darker now that he noticed the sky had turned a deep and luminous blue had the sun set yes it had but only just these old firs and hemlocks were heavy with shadow and he was on the trail now inching along the dirt caked with mud when had that happened and his throat was raw with screaming though he did not remember screaming he wasnt screaming now the sound he was making was more like a moan it was a kind of song not entirely tuneless it reminded him of the song the flying monkeys sang in the movie the wizard of oz this thought made kindle feel almost jaunty he looked up at the starsnow there were starsand wondered if he could sing a real song somewhere under all this pain he had developed a conviction that everything was actually very funny this was a funny position to be in singing would make it even funnier the trouble was he didnt know very many songs oscars bedroom aria aside he had never paid attention to songs he had learned jesus loves me at the baptist sunday school but he was damned if hed sing a sunday school song when there wasnt even a place prepared for him he knew the streets of laredo but only one verse maybe one verse was enough as i went out walking the streets of laredo mind you he shouldnt have gone out walking as i went out walking in laredo one day no longer day but night i met a young cowboy all dressed in white linen he began to wonder if he liked the direction this song had taken all dressed in white linen and cold as the clay no it was the wrong song entirely but he went on singing it and his sense of giddy detachment failed him and he grew miserable with the thought that he couldnt even decide for himself what song he ought to sing he came within sight of his cabin as the artifact rose in the western sky a kind of moon it cast a little light that helped but the sight of it was a fearful thing for kindle he couldnt say he hated the artifact it hadnt given him any cause for hatred but he had always been suspicious of it well so had everyone else but kindles suspicions had been broader than most most people suspected it was an alien spaceship come to wage war or blow up the earth or some such thing kindle had doubted that his experience of the passage of time was that the thing that happened was never the thing you expected whatever came of this artifact kindle had thought it would not be the monstermovie scenario everyone feared it would be something certainly not better but surely differentnew unexpected and hadnt events proved him right no one had expected this visitation in the dark this whisper in the ear about life eternal certainly kindle had never guessed that tiny machines in his nervous tissue would ask him whether he wanted to give up his body and certain habits of mind and grow beyond kindle into something that was both kindle and much more than kindle his answer had been immediate no by god he had clung to his aging body and intemperate ego all these years and he wasnt eager to give them up he disliked the idea of his soul mingling with other souls he was alone by choice and by nature and he wanted to keep it that way but he wanted to live too it was not a love of dying that made him turn down the offer he wanted desperately to survive but on his own terms he wanted to live and that was why he was here prostrate at the door of his thirteenyearold ford pickup truck singing the streets of laredo in a faint raw voice and wondering how to endure the thing he must do next to enter a vehicle one must stand up even a onelegged man can stand kindle thought unless his pain prevents him unless the act of pulling himself up by the door handle of an old pickup truck grinds bone against ragged bone and causes him to stop singing and makes him scream again instead unless he passes out but kindle remained conscious even as the landscape performed a pirouette around the fiery axis of his spine his useless leg bound and curled at the knee like the leg of a dead fly flopped against the door of the truck key kindle shrieked to himself he carried his keys with him always he braced himself with his right hand and fished in his pocket with his left maybe it was stupid to lock up his truck when he lived this far from people who would come out here to steal such a wreck but it was his habit to lock up the things he owned his truck his boat his cabin he found the key transferred it to his right hand somehow fumbled it into the lock without moving the rest of his body then he took a deep breath slid away from the door and opened it a crack good work but his left leg was splinted and he dared not tamper with the splintso how was he supposed to cram himself behind the wheel once behind the wheelwhat then he took the key from the door and clasped it tight in his right hand tom he said in a hoarse whisper this is the hard part that other part was easy this is the hard part easier still to lie down and go to sleep drive in the morning or die before dawn more likely that second possibility kindle thought dying would be the easiest thing of all maybe he could even drag himself to the cabin and die on his own sofa which would at least lend some dignity to the event people would find him after a while maybe they would find his wormtrack leading down from the mountain goddamn they would say look at what this man did what an admirable man whose corpse is lying on this sofa was this his sofa nope kindle realized this was the front seat of the old ford pickup and he was stretched out across the length of it these memory lapses were disturbing but he imagined he could hear the echo of his own screams fading down the hillside so perhaps it was better not to dwell on the past he pulled himself into a sitting position with his back against the driversside door and both legs stretched out across the seat he could see over the dash well enough but there was no way to get a foot down to the floor pedals at least he was out of the wind that was no mean accomplishment he looked around for a way to push the pedals his resources were meager within reach an empty styrofoam cup a snow brush and a copy of guns and ammo not too helpful oh and one other thing the walking stick he had used to splint his leg the leg had swollen enormously from crotch to knee it looked like a cased sausage the rags he had used to bind the splint were deeply embedded the knots pulled tight by the pressure dont make me do this kindle thought no this is too much i cant even begin to do this but his traitorous hands were already fumbling against the feverish flesh down there when he came to himself again he found the walking stick clutched in his trembling left hand it was still nighttime though the artifact had set maybe it was coming on toward morning kindle didnt know he didnt wear a watch the stars looked like morning stars he was shaking like a sick animal this shaking was a bad thing it seemed to him made it hard to keep the broad end of his walking stick secure against the floor pedals and it would only get harder when the truck was moving he put the key into the ignition pumped the gas pedal twice and turned the key the engine coughed but didnt catch that was normal kindle sometimes thought of this old ford as his hiccup truck for the way its engine fought him it would catch run stall or nearly stall misfire rattle and bounce for a time before it settled down come on you sack of shit kindle whispered come on you lazy turd the engine caught and lurched and kindle screamed as the truck jogged on its ancient shocks his broken leg was braced against the seat but there was nothing to hold it and no way to prevent it flopping around in that sickening loose way kindle tried to sing the streets of laredo as he put the truck into gear and pressed the gasa terrible stagger forwardand steered out of this dirt turnoff away from the cabin toward the logging road he switched on the lights the pines crowding the roadside loomed in eerie grids of shadow he was sitting sideways and a little low he wasnt accustomed to steering with his left hand and his reflexes were shot but he managed to aim the ford approximately midway down this column of spookylooking trees god help anybody coming uphill but who would be at this hour from here into the outskirts of buchanan was mainly a downhill ride and kindle found he didnt have to work the gas pedal much it was struggle enough to keep the walking stick pressed against the brake to impede the acceleration of the truck it occurred to him hed be in some profound trouble if he passed out again so stay awake he told himself he remembered that a place had been prepared for him in the regional hospital as long as he didnt run his hiccup truck off the streets of laredo he passed two other cabinsthe property of men as solitary as himselfbut he didnt stop if he stopped nobody might be home and kindle did not relish the prospect of starting up this truck again better to drive as far as possible toward buchanan or at least down to where the streetlights began but thenin a wash of fear that took him by surprisekindle remembered that buchanan might not be the buchanan he remembered last week the monsters had come to buchanan curious ambulatory spongethings who had infected everybodys blood was this a real memory or some kind of trauma hallucination well kindle thought it sure felt like a real memory still monsters and if that was true he did not summon the images but here they came monsters out of comic books tentacleheaded things unloading from a flying saucer or the zombieeyed human eunuchs out of a dozen movies slaves of the overmasters and hungry for human flesh they had prepared a place for him on the communal barbecue kindle shook his head he couldnt decide whether this was funny or scary maybe it would be smart just to press on the brakes and die in the dark up this mountain he did in fact apply a sudden pressure there because the truck had picked up a great deal of speed without his noticing no kindle told himself sternly no dying allowed go for help follow the plan see the monsters if you must the truck rattled on he had reached the suburban margin of the town just inside the citylimits sign when his pain and fatigue crested and the truck rolled into an embankment and came to rest with its headlights pointed at orion the impact dashed kindle against the steering wheel causing the horn to emit a squawk then he rolled back semiconscious into the seat the trucks motor rumbled on the sound of the horn and the grinding engine woke a thirtyyearold insurance investigator named buddy winkler who had recently become immortal but who still liked to get a good nights sleep he went to the window of his twoyearold tract house and gazed with sleepy astonishment at the semivertical ford riding a dirt bank in the vacant lot next door then he phoned he gathered up a blanket and hurried out to the accident where he quickly surmised there was nothing he could do to help the injured man insidea screaming and broken mortal man whose eyes rolled wildly at the sight of him monsters kindle thoughtdimly when he thought at all monsters leering down at him he screamed until he was mute and after a dark time he recognized hospital corridors and understood for one lucid moment that he was lying on a gurney cart with medical staff bustling around him a frowning face lofted into proximity and kindle reached up with what remained of his strength and took this person by the collar of his gown get me kindle gasped a human doctor relax the entity pronounced i am human you know what i mean you alien shitsack get me a human doctor you monster kindle fell back gasping the man looming over him turned away can we have some sedation here the patients hysterical oh and somebody call matt wheeler now i think maybe i am safe kindle thought and embarked upon a sleep that would last for two days running giddy lightheadedness and fog kindle awoke once again he was in bed his leg was bound and in traction it hurt but only a little kindle guessed he was sedated and that right now nothing would hurt very much he felt distant and vague and he supposed if you tore off his arm and beat him with it that would be okay too probably a nice opiate drip on that iv but the main thing was that he had made it to the hospital he took a certain pride in that his memory was fuzzy but he recalled that it had been a long and harrowing journey a man in medical whites approached kindle watched this process with languorous detachment he managed you must be the doctor thats right mr kindle i asked for a human being you got one my name is matt wheeler matthew wheeler was an ordinarylooking man with a woebegone face hes too young kindle thought idly for all those frown lines youre human dr wheeler as human as you are mr kindle not one of them no but they can treat you as well as i can theres no need to worry maybe kindle said has the town changed much ive been up in the hills since since since what was it called contact not much dr wheeler looked uncomfortable not yet hows my leg it should mend reasonably well in time may i ask how you broke it walking out back of my cabin fell in the fuckin mud how did you get into town dragged my ass down to my truck the memory was a little clearer now then i drove he shrugged thats remarkable thats quite an accomplishment kindle was alert enough to recognize a compliment i guess im hard to kill huh i guess you are you were a sorry mess when the ambulance brought you in or so im told the leg will heal mr kindle but youre going to be here for a while the doctor made a notation on his clipboard i understand your attitude about human beings but i cant be in the room twentyfour hours a day youll have to cooperate with the hospital staff will you do that for me youll be around though ill be around ill make a point of it kindle nodded agreement youll probably want some more sleep the doctor turned to leave the room kindle closed his eyes then opened them dr wheeler yes mr kindle how many of us are there i meanthere are more of us in town arent there the doctor looked even wearier a few i want to get us all together in a couple of weeks kind of a town meeting maybe you can be there if you lie still and let that bone mend kindle nodded but vaguely he had already forgotten the question was already easing back into sleep chapter brookside ii for the memorial service miriam picked out what she still thought of as her church clothes though she hadnt been to church for years black dress and hat white gloves an unscuffed pair of orthopedic shoes she adjusted the hat a final time in the mirror by the front door then stepped out into a hazy summer morning more than two weeks had passed since the night she was touched by the thing no longer the eye of godwhat a mistake that had been it was miriam supposed still the agency of god as a plague of locusts might be his agency but it was alien insinuating false and quite ungodlike in its offer of unconditional absolution miriam supposed she would recognize god easily enough when she faced him god was justice and carried a sword the thing contrarily had spoken in the plangent and intimate voice of a lover it offered too much and did not hate sufficiently but the world was a different place for its coming even over the course of two weeks miriam had seen the changes the news for instance the news wasnt worth the paper it was printed on or the time it displaced on tv in a handful of days the buchanan observer had shrunk to a few negligible pagesmostly cooking columns gardening tips and a few syndicated columns large stories had made small headlines undeclared but universal ceasefire in all the worlds wars presidents and premiers unavailable for comment no film at eleven what they ought to have miriam thought is a generic headline nothing happens nobody cares at least the memorial service was still on schedule her fathers body had been committed to the earth a day before contact but the service had been postponed to allow miriams uncle a man she had never met to fly in from norway where he worked naturally the flight had been canceledthere had been something in the news about civilian aircraft commandeered for relief flights into the african famine zones so the service would go on this afternoon with or without uncle edward or so miriam hoped was anything certain these days dr ackroyd had been willing to go ahead with the service but even the rector had changed last week simon ackroyd had confessed to being one of them the rector was engaged in the same transformation that had overtaken the rest of the world and miriam was not at all sure she would like what the man had turned into or that he would like her or that she would be safe at the end of the worlds strange new evolution she didnt think of herself as an episcopalian but her father had called himself that even though he seldom attended services she suspected hed picked the episcopalians because they were the most upscale congregation in town barring the catholics whom daddy had regarded as a fanatical sect like shiites or communists the episcopal church squatted like a gray stone bulldog on its acre of lawn and peered across a long slope of rooftops to the sea miriam parked and climbed the stairs to the parish office dr ackroyd had said he would meet her here and they would drive together to brookside cemetery the rector was waiting in his office with a concerned expression on his homely face sit down miriam he said she listened as he explained how the memorial service would proceed though they had arranged all this in advance does he think im senile miriam wondered or had the ministry lowered his expectations perhaps he often dealt with stupid people the ceremony would be outdoors at the graveside it was to be simple and brief above all miriam hoped brief she hated all mumbling over the dead and would never have agreed even to this much if uncle edward the hypocrite hadnt insisted i didnt know your father very well the rector was saying but there are people in my congregation who did and they tell me he was a good man a loss like this is never easy i know youre going through a difficult time miriamfor this and other reasons i want you to know im here if you need to talk the offer struck miriam as both laughable and strange her response was spontaneous all i want to know ishow you can do this tm sorry after what happened that night you know what i mean he drew back this is my job that hasnt changed you were touched by the thing he looked bewildered you mean contact nobody calls anything by its right name doesnt matter im a christian woman rector when the thing touched me i knew it was nothing a christian should have anything to do with and i gave it a christian response i dont see the point of immortality outside the throne of god but you you shook hands with itam i right and yet there you sit prepared to read scripture over the body of my father how can you do that dr ackroyd seemed dismayed he took a long time answering miriam he said finally you may be right he paused as if to summon thoughts im not sure i know what a christian is ive thought about this a great deal since contact the harder i look for christianity miriam the more it evaporates before my eyes is it martin luther or is it johann eck is it augustine or is it john chrysostom is it constantine is it matthew and mark and luke and did they write the scriptures we call by their names or was christianity buried along with the apocrypha at nag hammadi now it was miriams turn to be bewildered i simply dont know the rector confessed i think i never did know i think there is something in the artifact nearly as rich and strange as all our earthly religions put together nearly miriam when i spoke with the travellers i put some of these questions to them i have a sense of what their spirituality consists of and i think it may not be incompatible with ours they dont claim to have unraveled every mystery in fact theyre quite humble about their ignorance they think consciousness might have some special relationship to the hidden order of the universe even a persistence after absolute death im not sure whether this ought to be called religion or cosmology but they acknowledge that some subtlety of mind may be bound into the functioning of stars and time they didnt ask me to abandon my christianity miriam its only that ive had to be more honest with myself about the things i know and the things i dont the divinity of christ the extrinsic nature of god maybe i was never really convinced of those things only wanted to believe them so youre right miriam i dont guess im entitled to call myself a christian any longer but i can perform the memorial service i can help you say goodbye to your father and i can mark the mystery of death and i can honor itperhaps more sincerely than ever before i would be pleased to perform that service for you but if you feel im unqualified ill step aside maybe we can find someone else maybe even here in town miriam was stunned she gazed at the rector then shook her head no thats all right you do it thank you miriam its not a vote of confidence i dont think it matters who says the words if theres a heaven its beyond our commanding and if theres a hell our prayers wont keep us out of it she looked at her watch shouldnt we leave its getting late she drove with him to brookside cemetery through the gates and up a winding road to the graveside she had wanted an outdoor service miriam hated chapels they smelled like overripe sachets like decaying lavender mist still lingered in the lowlands and across the water but the sun had burned the sky blue overhead mt buchanan rose up behind the cemetery like the shoulders of a green and granite colossus this was a hillside plot and it was pleasant to see the rows of graves running down to the main gate and the road from this hillside miriam watched the crowd begin to gather she had mailed an announcement of the memorial service to those few of daddys friends still living mainly retired staff from the community college and the members of the bridge club whose company he had enjoyed before his stroke she was surprised by the relative youth of the crowd beginning to gathertoo many strangers faces she did not recognizeand by its size cars had filled the chapel parking lot at the foot of the hill and more cars had begun to park along the road all the way down to the intersection and out of sight troubled and vaguely frightened miriam turned to rector ackroyd daddy didnt know all these people the service was announced in the observer she knew that she had clipped the announcement but why are they here what for to mark a solemn occasion miriam your father was the last man in buchanan to die before contact do you know what that means his was the last involuntary death in this town but it was a reasoning that made miriam hostile for reasons she didnt wholly understand i dont want strangers here im sorry you feel that way but its not a joke theyre sinceretheir feelings are genuine how could you possibly know that i know the rector said simply miriam frowned but acquiesced she was beginning to feel numbed by the mornings events rector ackroyd read the service and miriam listened distantly unable to associate this ceremony with her father he had become intangible a fading memory of a pleasanter time im here to mourn she reminded herself sternly but what about all these other people the hillside was covered with people all silent and attentive even those who must be too far away to hear the service half the population of buchanan must have come here miriam thought maybe they had also come to mourn not for her father for something they had lost or given up for what they couldnt have back for a way of life for the town the countryfor the planet miriam thought chapter arguments and unwindings when lillian refused to see him for a physical examdespite his nudging his cajoling and at last his illconcealed angermatt decided enough was enough extraterrestrial mysticism was one thing jeopardizing her health and the health of her unborn child was quite another he arranged to have lunch with jim see if he could attack the problem from that angle a few weeks ago it might have been hard to fit lunch into his schedule today free time was easy to come by his office consultations had dropped to a trickle he spent most of his time at the hospital doing shifts for absentee residents and much of that time convincing tom kindle to submit to physical therapy he had not seen a new patient nor more than a handful of his reliables since what they were starting to call contact nor despite the hours at buchanan general had he seen much of jim bix jimlike lillian like annie gates like so many othershad accepted the promise of immortality that night in august matt had still not developed a strategy for talking to such people jim had been his closest friend contact had turned him into a stranger they met in the cafeteria the staff cafeteria was a basement room the size of a basketball court and today it was almost deserted the ventilators hummed like meditating monks and the air smelled faintly of cabbage jim sat at a corner table picking at salad and rice pilaf matt pulled up another chair and regarded his friend same old ugly son of a bitch he ever was matt thought but the conversation was like an old car on a cold day hard to start and hard to keep running you dont look like youre sleeping much jim said in fact he hadnt been too much to think about too many things he didnt want to think about his days were either empty or surrealistic and his nights were often sleepless but he didnt want to say that i didnt come to complain actually i wanted to talk about lillian she refused to come in for monitoring i wondered if you knew that i dont anticipate any problems with the pregnancy but it seems like a bad precedent jim listened carefully then he wiped his chin with a paper napkin and shrugged if she says she doesnt need to see you and theres no pressing problem maybe we ought to leave it at that there isnt currently a problem but shes pregnant and forty and thats hardly a riskfree scenario and you know it jim if she wants to change doctorsfor whatever reasonokay fine well set her up with a specialist but she has to see somebody does she christs sake jim his exclamation echoed around the empty room all im saying matt is that she has more access to her internal condition than she used to it sounds strange but its true she knows things you might not expect her to know im skeptical of that i guess i would be too in your position i dont know what i can say to convince you if it means anything tm convinced convinced of what that lillian doesnt need medical care that she knows whether she needs it or not if she did matt im sure shed come to you he folded the napkin we miss seeing you why dont you stop by the house sometime talk to her yourself shed be happy to talk can she perform an ultrasound on herself can she diagnose an ectopic pregnancy i believe she can jesus matt would you calm down i can explain it but not if youre raving he wondered if he ought to simply leave the table but jim was his friend or had been his friend maybe he was obliged to listen a while longer it feels like a century since we talked about this that night at your house less than a month ago remember that just before contact we got drunk you were talking about machines in the blood neocytes is that what you call them its the consensus name matt let this pass the point is jim said theyre still here not in you you sent em packing your blood is original stockand i guess you know that since i havent seen you down in the path lab doing your own smears true the travellers as annie called them had told matt they would leave his body and he had believed ithe had never questioned the matter but the rest of us are still carrying neocytes jim said and theyre doing some work nothing too obvious yet but take lillian if she was ectopic or preeclamptic or anything like that the neocytes would deal with it or they would let her know so she could take the appropriate steps im not sitting here telling you lillian should go through this pregnancy unmonitored the point is she is monitored shes getting better attention than you or i could give her and shes getting it twentyfour hours a day and thats he couldnt contain his horror thats okay with you its a benevolent process matt theres nothing wrong with it my god my god what about the fetus were talking about your child are they working on it too is the child full of neocytes yes it is matt stood up too quickly the table rocked and an empty cafeteria glass dropped and shattered on the floor jim bent to pick up the pieces he put two daggerlike shards on the table out of harms way he said i didnt mean to upset you youre bleeding matt said hed cut his hand the blood that oozed out was thick it was the color and consistency matt thought of hot blackstrap molasses later in the afternoon he stopped by tom kindles room the floor nurse called kindle a handful her code word for a patient who was uncooperative but goodhumored about it kindle who had lived alone on the slopes of mt buchanan for some years seemed to be adjusting fairly well to the new situationhis injury contact matt guessed he had the advantage of not feeling suddenly like an outsider he had been an outsider all along when matt entered the room kindle was watching tv when he noticed matt he hit the mute button on the remote control they moved in the tv this morning i said i didnt want to pay for it they said i didnt have to nobody else using it its been years since i watched tv much kindle shook his head now i get a chance and theres nothing good on nothing but the news last time i looked matt said there wasnt any news not the kind of news im used to all the armies went home and nobody robbed the grocery store i think that is news kindle said seems like its a more peaceful world shit on that the graveyard is peaceful kindle turned back to the tv screen have you seen this matt looked at the picture it was the octahedron in central park there was a cnn logo in the lowerleft corner of the screen ive seen it before he remembered when the octahedrons came out of the sky last spring all those dark and ominous shapeshow rachel had watched the videotape replays almost obsessively everybody had been afraid of the octahedrons which had functioned as far as matt knew mainly as monuments or at most as a diversion the real war had been microscopic and brief why invade the earth when you can invade the bloodstream a question of scale ive seen the fuckin thing a dozen times too kindle said thats not the point watch and with a deep reluctance matt took a second look at the tv screen this was videotape but recent kindle said hed been watching it all day over and over again matt stared without comprehension as the octahedronthat vast black shape featureless and tall as a tenstory buildingsomehow unwound itself the motion was difficult to focus on even in slowmotion playback it reminded him of a spring uncoiling it was that kind of action but multidimensional and terrifyingly fast nothing decent moved like that it made him think of a trap sprung a cannon fired a rattlesnake striking every fast and deadly thing he blinked at the screen with his mouth open kindle laughed amazing isnt it no it was frightening he felt nauseated the octahedron unwound into countless smaller shapes the cnn camera zoomed closer and matt was able to see that each shape was the same a bulbous saucer mounted on a truncated cone perhaps about the size of a person though it was difficult to judge he couldnt tell whether these devices touched the ground or hovered above it thousands of em kindle said more they began to move radiating away from their point of origin through the trees and along the bike paths like an obscenely strange mass of strolling tourists like a nest of ants matt thought swarming out of its hole one for every town and city in north america kindle said how do you know that the guy on the newscast said so dont ask me how he knows what are they kindle shrugged helpers so the tv says helpers thats what cnn is calling them dont blame me matthewi dont write the news he looked at the screen there was a helper in close focus now it was a featureless matteblack object and it looked about as helpful as a mace a claymore or a ballistic missile sit down matthew kindle said gently you dont look too well laterwhen the shock wore offmatt told kindle some of the things jim bix had said about neocytes and the possibility of physical changes in the body kindle absorbed all this with a thoughtful expression matthew he said did you ever hear of a nurse log matt said he hadntdid it have something to do with the floor nurse miss jefferson no not that kind of nurse back in the eighties i worked for a while in canada logging on the west coast of vancouver island i got to know some of the forest there what they call climax forest meaning a forest that hasnt been burned for a long time centuries they have some yearold cedars over there amazing trees and it rains nonstop half the year so in places you get what they call a temperate rain forest very dense vegetation very wet decay is one of the main things that happens in a place like that every time one of these huge hemlocks falls down or a cedar say or an amabilis fir its not just a dead tree its food it turns into whats called a nurse log because its nursing new trees among other things when its rotting that log might contain more organisms than there are people on the surface of the earth its so full of life it actually heats upas much as five or six degrees warmer than the air this is interesting matt said but im almost finished shit you doctors are impatient people all i mean to say is that it strikes me maybe the earth is like a nurse log all that talk about pollution global warming and so on people used to say are we killing the earth my theory is we already killed it its dead like a nurse log so all these decay organisms just arrowed in on it maybe humanity was already the first stage of decay like a fungus growing in the heartwood then the insects move in to eat the wood rot and the birds eat the insects thats disgusting matt said a little its how nature works though why should it be different when were talking about the whole planet this thing in space the artifact the octahedrons these helpers kindle shrugged they just smell a rotting log thats all matt wasnt cheered by these speculations and he left the room sourminded and unhappy it was almost six oclockhed wasted an afternoon staring at the horrors on tom kindles tv set time to go home dinner with rachel another evening to endure he had come to dread this time of day worse kindles forest analogy haunted him during the drive home maybe the earth was a nurse log maybe the old hermit was right but he thought about jim bix his smile fixed in place his blood the color of thirtyweight motor oil a worse thought maybe jim was a nurse log something new growing in the hollow shell of him maybe lillian was a nurse log maybe they all were chapter b e beth porter was accustomed to seeing the artifact suspended in every clear night sky and seldom gave it much thought it was something people talked about on tv like war or the economy about as insubstantial as that there had never been a war in buchanan the economy just meant people getting laid off or not at the pulp mill and the artifact was a light in the sky as alarming as a streetlamp or so she had thought now beth had to admit things were changing now things were beginning to get well scary she spent friday night at joey commoners before they decided to do the b e joey lived with his father who was divorced and worked parttime for a building contractor but joeys father had taken off in july to spend a couple of months on a seattle job and to shack up for a while with his girlfriend a canadianborn typesetter who used to secretary for a drywall firm in buchanan so joey had had the house to himself for the summer labor day had come and gone but joey wasnt sure when his father would be back his old man had telephoned three times since contact but joey wouldnt talk about what he said joey beth knew was also a little scared of what had been happening since that feverish friday night so they sat in the basement which was joeys private apartment with its own bathroom and even a little kitchenette and they watched a rental movie and smoked dope joey was a cautious doper he was wary of drugs in a strange way and limited himself to a onceaweek smokathon usually friday night that was why he always showed up at the eleven friday nights buying frozen pies and ice cream marijuana microwave cherry pies and vanilla ice cream were joeys customary vices after they got to know each other he had invited beth to join him in the ritual when she was transferred to the day shift she did beth herself was careful about drugs contrary to her highschool reputation she was not keen to break the law or hadnt been in those days but she soon learned that this friday night dope binge wasnt the scariest thing about joeyin a way it was the least scary thing about him joey commoner in a stoned condition was accessible in some ways even a little more human hed kick back and laugh at some tv movie and they would feast on reconstituted cherry pie and ice cream until their lips looked rouged and sooner or later they would make love stoned joey made love to her other times they simply fucked so beth learned to look forward to friday nights and would have enjoyed this one except for what they saw on tv the rental movie ended and when joey hit the rewind button the network came back on a picture of an octahedron unwinding this one somewhere in europe beth set aside her eleven cherry pie and joey put down the svintage blue plastic bong he had ripped off from one of his cousins and the two of them gawked at the screen holy shit joey said with what sounded to beth like a combination of awe and deep discomfort beth thoroughly stoned was especially impressed with a closeup still of what the announcer called a helper she remembered her last year of highschool biology peering through a microscope at a bread mold black pinshaped structures called sporangiophores a word that had eluded her during the final exam but that came back now with the odd precision of a dope revery thats what these helpers looked like a crowd of sporangiophores spreading over the landscape coming soon to your town if she understood the commentary correctly it was too much joey hit the off button and turned his back on the screen joey was very much into not believing what was happening around him for instance joey did hobby electronics built hifi gear and radios and things and this had fascinated beth at first becauselike everybody elseshe had joey pegged as being a little stupid it turned out he read circuit diagrams better than he read english there was always a tangle of wire and junk parts in one corner of the basement and often the air reeked of solder which was okay it was interesting but beth had come to realize that electronics wasnt just a skill joey hadit was a wall a moat a hiding place it shut out everything scary it even shut out beth and now scared by what theyd seen on tv he began to look restlesslike if beth cleared out he might dip another circuit board in aluminum sulfate or something fuck not tonight beth thought she didnt want to be alone tonight that was when the idea of the b e occurred to her she thought of it strictly as a means of holding his attention in the old days beth had been more or less indifferent to joeys attention now suddenly helplessly she was hungry for it not that there was anyone competing with her joey had never shown much interest in other women perhaps excluding that night with the hooker in tacoma what she was competing with was the dense forest inside joeys own head where he liked to get lost where she couldnt go but the cemetery vandalism last month had seemed to keep him interestedso why not a similar adventure similar but more daring why not a b e in fact she posed the question joey looked thoughtful where he asked the newcomb house beth said sudden inspiration you know the place house up on view ridge with two lawn jockeys in front bob newcomb used to be my fathers boss at the mill hes been on vacation since august first some place in mexico my father thinks anybody who goes to mexico in august is an idiot long vacation joey said they might not be coming back at all because of contact but she didnt say that two lawn jockeys and a garden with a sun clock joey said that house right stupid fuckinlooking house beth there might be something inside he shrugged what do we want i dont know we cant fence anything do you know how to fence stolen property she didnt we could just mess it up or take whatever we liked the stereo or cameras joey said warming to the idea or even a videocamera or something like that except if theyre on vacation they probably took it with them suddenly he was hooked switched on like a light there was a well of restless anger inside joey and she had tapped it but it was a strange talent the ability to wind up joey commoner toward petty crime and something she was only intermittently proud of the horse the spur dangerous beth did she really want to do this maybe it was an idea that only made sense in dopelogic one of those smokering thoughts with no real beginning i or end or just a dumb transient impulse too late for second thoughts however joey was already putting on his motorcycle jacket he drove north along the coast in a misty rain the night had turned cool the motorcycle stitched through valleys of fog beth with her visor down and everything blue with rain streetlights seemed dim the white line tentative there was no traffic since contact people didnt go out so much they stayed inside especially in bad weather the things in their brains had made them cautiousmeek in beths opinion wasnt it the meek who were supposed to inherit the earth now is the hour joey wasnt meek the sound of the motorcycle bounced around these sodden hillsides like an announcement of armageddon he drove recklessly fast she tightened her grip on his waist and squeezed her thighs around the saddle wet face wet hair joeys leather jacket wet and slippery in the rain he drove to the top of view ridge and killed the engine r beth still stoned was suddenly absorbed in the view tumbling clouds and the foggy ocean downslope to the west everything in shades of night gray or night blue except the buzzing amber streetlights a paper flapped on a telephone pole a wet photocopied announcement of a meeting of regular human people at the hospital next wednesday night dr matthew wheeler presiding an event beth had already marked on her calendar she thought she might attend might bring along joey see who was left but that was a daylight plan for the daylight world joey wheeled his motorcycle down the rainslick sidewalk quietly not talking beth felt alternately conspicuous and foghidden paranoid and fuzzily excited no one seemed to be watching there were only a few lights in these big hillside houses but these werent normal houses anymore or at least not normal homes the people inside werent normal maybe beth thought they can see us with some kind of third eye maybe they dont need to look joey took the yamaha up the newcombs long driveway and stood it in the shadows behind the garage the newcomb house had a light in it too the token light people leave on when theyre out of town supposed to frighten burglars who are supposed to be that stupid beth followed joey into the backyard nothing but shadows and wet grass here smell of lawn clippings garden loam rain beths paranoia began to peak the trouble with getting stoned was that sometimes it opened a moment of great clarity like a window too much clarity was a bad thing she didnt always like what she saw tonight she saw herself alone she felt herself alone on this dark lawn and alone on the planet as alone as she had ever been she knew about being alone she had known about it ever since her fourteenth birthday when her mother sent her to a clinic in portland to defuse a little ovarian timebomb set ticking by martin blair her thenboyfriend fifteen saved from reproach by the status of his family the blair realty blairsmartin who had actually bragged some to his friends yeah he got a girl pregnant alone on the suction table and alone when she came back to school buchanans youngest suburban slut according to martins schoolyard testimony alone sitting by herself at an empty cafeteria table alone but daggered with stares sniggered at in hallways propositioned in corners by boys who lacked the courage to speak to anyone real alone with shame so intense that after a while she lost the ability to blush but that was one kind of alone and this was another all these houses beth thought empty of families empty of people full of something else something that only looked human joey broke a pane of glass in the back door of the newcomb house and reached inside to open the lock to beth it sounded like a cymbal crash a shrieking announcement of their presence suddenly this wasnt what she wanted not at all maybe to have a normal life do normal things she had never let herself even imagine that but it would be better than this better than breaking into an empty house on a rainy night better than riding joey commoners motorcycle down some dark highway better than any future she could imagine for herself now that the monsters had taken over the world the house smelled like a strangers house broadloom air freshener old cooking she felt uninvited unwanted criminal joey seemed to thrive on the sensation his eyes were alert his steps small and agile the light the newcombs had left burning was a lamp in the downstairs bedroom it made long shadows through the doorway joey headed for this room first where he pulled open dresser drawers and tossed their contents picking out nothing in particular a handful of twenty dollar bills probably mrs newcombs mad money an empty keychain with a volvo tag beth was mute immobilized by her own guilty presence in a bedroom where she didnt belong her eyes registered details she wished she could forget the japanese print over the bed birds on inkline trees the oak dresser with cigarette burns clustered at one end worst of all mrs newcombs nightgowns and mr newcombs jockey shorts tumbled together and soaking in the contents of an overturned perfume bottle seeing all this was the real theft beth thought she said this is too weird i dont like this it was your idea i know but but it didnt matter he wasnt listening he was gone vanished into the dimmer light outside the bedroom and beth was forced to hurry after or be left here with no company but her conscience the worst part was yet to come she lost track of time as joey rummaged through the house he turned on no lights seemed to navigate by instinct or animal vision he wasnt robbing the house so much as possessing it beth thoughtmaking it his own through an act of violation he was fucking it no raping it he left his mark everywhere tables overturned doors flung open closets stripped she followed in a daze inarticulate even in the space of her own skull waiting for him to finish waiting until they could leave in a hallway closet joey found his prize a palmsize camcordersince when had he cared about videosmall enough to slip into his leather jacket which he zipped up around it take it she thought then christ lets go she turned away turning she saw red light wash shadows of raindrops against the wall saw this light blink on and off and on again her terror began before she could pin a word on it and name the dreaded thing she tugged joeys arm almost pulled him off balance joey the policea police car he took her by the wrist and pulled her away from the window things were happening too quickly now there wasnt time to think she followed joey out the back door into the rainy yard joey inched along the wall toward the corner of the garage she kept a hand on his jacket well be arrested beth thought put on trial sent to jail or or something worse something new please let it be prison beth thought not some unhuman thing bugs in the brain alien punishment her breath hitched and she wondered if she might begin to cry but joey took her hand and pulled her forward and she was suddenly too busy for that he jumped onto the motorcycle and kicked over the engine while beth scurried on behind from here in the shadow of the garage protected from streetlights perhaps invisible beth had a clear view of the cop car it was parked at an angle in the street not blocking the driveway a buchanan sheriffs department blackandwhite there was no sound only that relentlessly whirling dome light it lit up the street red light under dripping eaves red light spidering up tree trunks and disappearing in the leaves nobody had come out to watchnone of the neighbors in their yards or standing in open doorways maybe they already know whats happening beth thought maybe they dont have to look the yamahas engine screamed beth clung desperately to joey and the saddle as they roared down the newcombs driveway now beth saw the man inside the cruiser at least the shadow of his face as he turned to track their motion the cop car had been silent not even idling beth expected its siren to howl motor gun tires squeal perhaps the beginning of a chase dangerous on these steep wet streets but the car remained silent and joey leaned into the curve as he pulled out of the driveway came up short and stopped with one foot on the road engine idlingwhat was he doing go beth thought and then she understood it was a dance between joey and the cop beth looked at the cop through his car window and knew from his joyless but placid expression that nothing more was going to happen no chase no trial no jail only this shadowy gaze this observation we know you we know what youre doing a raw shiver ran up her spine arrest us she aimed the thought at the cop car wave your gun yell but there was only a dreadful silence behind the idling of the motorcycle engine then joey twisted the throttle and the yamaha roared downhill crime and punishment in the new world chapter meeting matt found tom kindle waiting in the empty hospital boardroom when he arrived he had staked out a place by the window lean and patient in his wheelchair youre early kindle observed so are you nurse wheeled me down before she went off shift theres hardly any staff in this building anymoreyou notice that matthew ive noticed gets to be like a ghost town at this hour kind of scary after the sun goes down makes you wonder what theyre all doing with their time watching dallas reruns and eating popcorn i guess matt wasnt in the mood he took a notebook out of his briefcase and propped it on the podium open to the page on which he had outlined every potential emergency and worstcase scenario he had been able to imagine and there was no shortage in the last month or so he checked the clock meeting was set for eight kindle followed his look almost time assuming anybody shows up well theres us matt said uhhuh you know i asked nurse jefferson how many people you know how many made the decision she did she said almost everybody i said well then who didnt she said about one in ten thousand really how would nurse jefferson know shit matthew how do any of these people know the things they say my theory is theyre all hooked into the same library esp or something but im only humani have to guess last night i asked the janitor the same thing when he came down the hall how many people turned down this wonderful offer of eternal life he leaned on the waxer and said oh about one in ten thousand tom the night janitor on your floor is eddy lovejoy hes mute and nearly deaf mm well he isnt anymore they looked at each other kindle said what do you really expect to accomplish here tonight one in ten thousandso we get maybe five people if everybody who ought to show up really does maybe six or seven if the notice got as far as coos bay or pistol river a pitiful handful in other words so whats the point the point matt said is that i mean to save buchanan kindle winced and shifted in his chair the worlds been hijacked matthew the whole fuckin world in the face of that how do you propose to save one piddling little town i dont know matt said but i mean to do it kindles estimate had been pessimistic but not by much at fifteen minutes after the hour eight people had shown upsix from buchanan two from outlying farms one in ten thousand was that really possible matt supposed it might be he was reminded that one in ten thousand was roughly the number of als cases in the general populationwhat people commonly called lou gehrigs disease he had heard of two such cases in all of morgan county which included buchanan and three smaller towns if the numbers were correct this turnout was a testimony to the effort matt had expended placing ads in the observer posting leaflets even cadging a few minutes on the local radio news the radio session had been especially difficult since no one seemed to know a polite word to differentiate the humans in the audience from the recently immortal shoot dr wheeler were all human the station manager had insisted well perhaps anyway no one had made much mention of contact even in the local news it was still too novel too profound in its implicationsor maybe they understood it collectively esp as kindle had said the radio news department settled on what matt considered a cumbersome circumlocution those unconvinced by the experience so many of us shared on the last friday in august are invited to a meeting to be held in room at buchanan regional hospital the evening of september the th for details contact dr matthew wheeler and his home and office phone numbers followed by six seconds of dead air and a weather report he was grateful for the announcement but the experience seemed to foreshadow a whole world of negotiations and misunderstandingsprecisely what he hoped to anticipate and even forestall for the sake of buchanan for the sake he supposed of himself and tom kindle and these eight doubtfullooking souls waiting for him to speak he cleared his throat and introduced himself he felt more than a little misplaced up here he had attended how many meetings in his lifehow many graduation exercises board meetings staff briefings too many he had never liked any of them meetings in marts opinion were an excuse to drink coffee accumulate career karma and avoid the threat of real work but here he was he had even wheeled in the big silver coffee urn from the cafeteria from which tom kindle was tapping a cup kindle glanced at him with an air of patient amusementtilt on don quixote he thanked everyone for coming were here to talk about the future he said i think we share some common interests and i think were facing some common problems maybe if we get together now we can do something about that but since theres not many of us present maybe we should begin with introductions lets start with the front row thank you matt jotted each name in his notebook as it was spoken miriam flett front row left in her midsixties matt guessed not infirm but thin as a straw she wore a silver stickpin in the shape of a cross and she announced her name as if she expected an argument she sat down immediately and without comment and folded her arms bob ganish two seats away from miriam a salesman he said at highway five ford a round man of middle age dressed as if he had just left a golf game were people still golfing matt wondered or was it just that nobody cared anymore if you walked around in polyester slacks and a scuffed pair of putting shoes i agree we have a lot of problems dr wheeler but i dont know what we can do about it but its nice to know there are people left who still think the old way ganish sat down im beth porter and this is joey commoner no need to jot these names beth had dressed up tonightwore a longsleeved shirt to cover her tattoo but joey who had also been marts patient more than once in the last fifteen yearswho had been buying antibiotics on marts prescription since beth dragged him into the officesat with a grim expression arms clasped together over a black tshirt sullen clockwise from beth and joey chuck makepeace a sitting member of the city council that might be useful matt thought midthirties threepiece suit receding hairline natty little wirerimmed glasses if we do this again dr wheeler we should elect a chairman and follow some rules of orderbut maybe im getting ahead of myself excellent suggestion matt said but lets get to know each other first tim belanger about joeys age blond puppyish and eager to cooperate i work at city hall too im a records clerk for water and power or i used to be hardly anybody shows up at the office anymore abigail cushman who had driven in from her husbands farm out in surrey heights an hour in that old truck but buddy said take it he doesnt give a damn pardon me what i do anymore she wore a discounthouse dress and sweater and thick glasses with masculine rims taped at one joint matt guessed she might be fifty years old maybe older buddys looking after the kids our grandchildren actually our daughter and soninlaw died last year so we took the two boys theyre at home they didnt want to come im the only one who i mean theyre not the words ran out she paused and blinked at the room as if shed forgotten what she was doing here bob ganish coughed into his hand anyway she said call me abby abby sat down paul jacopetti big barrelchested sunburned sixtyfive retired manager of a toolanddie company in corvallis owned a hobby farm out along the lake roads not sure if theres any point in being here he said we can talk all we want but it looks to me like the horse left the barn some time ago tom kindle introduced himself from his wheelchair then turned to face the podium mr jacopettis got a point matthew its nice were all here and everything but whats the purpose therapy or strategy strategy matt said though a little therapy might be welcome there were a few nervous smiles he turned a page in his notebook the big problem ahead it seems to me is that you cant run a national economy when nobodys going to work everything seems all right so far the grocery stores are open the trucks are bringing in food the water runs and the lights are on good but youve all noticed the changes mr belanger mentioned that people arent showing up for work at city hall i guess nobody minds if the tax bills dont get out smilesbut only a few some of these people like mrs cushman obviously hadnt thought this far ahead but there are such things as essential services and if those people stop working we could be in trouble the hospital for instance there hasnt been much call for our work admittedly but even so i cant maintain a twentyfourhour emergency room all by myself im not the only physician on call but there are fewer every day the administration tells me the hospital wont close entirely at least not yet its the not yet that worries me i hear it a lot people are vague about the futuremaybe youve noticed i dont think they know whats going to happen much better than we do but they seem to expect something some kind of massive sweeping change doesnt take a genius to figure that out jacopetti put in its like i saidwe know the barns on fire not exactly abby cushman said could be a fire could be a flood or an earthquake we dont know what the problem is isnt that what you mean dr wheeler thats right the best we can do is make some general plans were going to want to maintain as much of the quality of life in buchanan as we can and i think well have to be able to deal with a breakdown at the telephone company say or the interruption of food deliveries makepeace the city hall functionary was frowning how is that our responsibility it doesnt follow if these other people cant maintain basic services wont they suffer right along with us tom kindle raised his hand use your imagination mrmakepeace is it its not like everybody got converted to some new religionthough maybe they did that too outside this room people are physically different they have things living inside them who knows what that means come next summer they might all turn to stone or live on air and sunshine or move to canada and there are those things miriam flett added her voice matt thought was as steely and rosinous as a violin noteand it commanded the same kind of attention those things on television the helpers socalled though they look like some kind of death robot to me probably one of them is coming to buchanan lord dont remind me abby cushman said it makes me shudder to think of it i got a phone call from my cousin clifford in new york state he said he saw one down on cruising toward utica at about forty miles an hour it stood a foot above the road like an eightfoottall ace of spades he said and traffic parted like the red sea all around it toms right matt said trying to steer the conversation back on course anything could happen and i think were obliged to do the most general kind of emergency planning these are a few of the areas im concerned about the boardroom was equipped with a green chalkboard along the front wall tom scrawled out four categories food medical care water utilities communication everyone stared at the board for a long moment it was abby cushman who broke the silence holy god dr wheeler is all that up to us jacopetti snorted thats nuts theres ten of us in this room dr wheeler two of us i would guess over sixty three of us teenagers or not much older none of us with much useful experiencethough we do have a medical man if all these things fail id say its game over we couldnt truck food here from portlandif there was food in portland which i dont guess there would beor run the electric company or pump water from the reservoir kindle looked interested the numbers could be an advantage though ten people cant run a town but they can sure as hell run themselves its a survival problem seems to me if theres no electricity we can operate generators as long as the gasoline holds outwhich would be a hell of a long time if we had free access to every gas station between here and portland similarly water we dont need every faucet in town running only one or two there might not even be ten of us bob ganish said ive got family in seattle i guess they might be you know changed but i still might try to get up there and see em in the kind of emergency youre talking about why stick around why leave this was tim belanger the city hall clerk frowning massively things would be bad all over wouldnt they we can assume that matt said but theres another point we may be the only human beings in buchanan but theres the whole northwest to think about if we have a plan in place we might attract refugees from portland or astoria or even farther away a small town is easier to manage than a city we could turn buchanan into a kind of safe haven no room jacopetti said not if the original population is still here but they might not be thats one possibility anyhow communications kindle said if were a refugee camp people have to know about us no telephone makepeace mused no mail no newspapers this is hard to imagine theres the local radio station but i dont think we could run it by ourselves ham radio kindle said shitexcuse meany radio ham who didnt go over to the enemy must be laying eggs and hatching kittens they love this emergency shit only theres nobody to talk to we should look into that as soon as possible matt agreed any hams present no one spoke okay i know we havent elected a chairman but does anybody object if i appoint tom kindle as our radio committee no objection tom you ought to be mobile by the end of the month i suggest you price a decent ham radio rigtheres an electronics shop down by the marina i recall in the meantime i can find you some books on the subject okay but im not licensed matt do you suppose the fcc gives a damn right now kindle grinned i spose not miriam flett put up her hand dr wheeler are we expected to pay for this radio nonsense we should talk about funding but im prepared to underwrite the radio committee for the time being makepeace and ganish both offered to chip in matt said hed get back to themno money was being spent until next week at the earliest theres a fifth category jacopetti said one you neglected to write down matt glanced at the chalkboard what would that be mr jacopetti defense a chill seemed to settle in the room joey commoner uttered a small scornful laugh kindle said we get the point mr jacopetti but as you yourself said were kinda outnumbered if this is the alamo we might as well pack it in jacopetti folded his hands on his belly i agree and i think its the likeliest prospect we dont fit into this new world of theirs theyll get tired of us and then theyll dispose of us not my kids abby cushman said faintly they wouldnt do that to me not my grandchildren jacopetti gave her a stony look i wouldnt count on that we have to be preparedisnt that why were here dr wheeler i dont think thats something we can prepare for mr jacopetti and i dont think its as likely as all that no ones threatened us yet and no one will a new voice heads turned toward the doorway a small presence there it was cindy rhee matt had the involuntary thought she ought to be dead by now he was visited by the memory of ellen rhee wiping drool from her daughters chin as cindys eyes roamed aimlessly and without focus that was before the intervention of the neocytes this miracle cure now cindy rhee was walkingalbeit stifflyand talking although her words were solemn and curiously deliberate shes one of them miriam flett announced she shouldnt be here the twelveyearold focused her eyes on miriam before matt could frame an answer i wont stay if you dont want me to miss flett i came so that someone could speak for us the collective the inclusive the universal us she turned to matt dr wheeler its probably sensible what youre doing here but mr jacopetti is wrong were not a threat to you cindy matt said are you speaking for everyone all the contactees she remained in the doorway a small silhouette yes how is that possible she shrugged cindy if you really know whats going to happennext month next yeari wish youd tell us i cant it hasnt been decided yet dr wheeler paul jacopetti had turned a shade ofbrick red that caused matt to speculate about hypertension who is this kid and how does she know my name to cindy what were you doing listening through the door shes a patient of mine matt said she they know everything miriam interrupted havent you figured that out we dont have any secrets from them jacopetti stood up i vote to have her removed shes a spy obviously ill go cindy rhee said no matt said lacking a gavel he slapped shut his notebook i was about to declare a coffee break cindy please stay until we reconvene twenty minutes he asked cindy to sit in one of the boardroom chairs and pulled up a second chair in front of her he felt he should take the opportunity to examine the child though he couldnt say what moved himsympathy curiosity dread he took a penlight from his shirt pocket and shone it into her eyes the others had crowded around the coffee urn talking in low voices and sparing an occasional glance at matt and cindy he hoped he hadnt jeopardized his credibility by talking to the girl tom kindle sat apart thoughtful in his wheelchair cindys pupils still seemed slow to contract but their reaction was equivalent and otherwise normal she tracked the penlight adequately when he moved it right to left up and down he touched her forehead the skin was cool thank you for being worried about me dr wheeler im all right im glad cindy its good to see you walking but you think its strange im happy about it but yes it seems strange to me more than that he wondered what kind of miracle it really was he wondered what was inside her skull right now normal brain tissue somehow regenerated or something else something fed by blood like dark molasses she seemed to sense the thought they had to work on me before contact dr wheeler because i was so sick so im a little farther on than most people thats why you came here partly partly because even mr jacopetti cant be too scared of a twelveyearold she suppressed a smile the smile looked authentic it was the way she had smiled last year before the neuroblastoma put an end to all her smiling we arent dangerous to you its important to understand that youre right about the future it might be difficult but were not the danger she was still woefully thin you mean to help matt said i appreciate that but it would be better if you didnt stay i know thank you for the examination she stood up and seemed ready to leave then frowned and tugged at his sleeve dr wheeler yes its about your daughter he felt a deep interior chill rachel what about her you should talk to her you havent really talked to her since contact she misses you how do you know that it had become the great unanswerable question cindy just shruggedsadly talk to rachel dr wheeler there wasnt much more meeting chuck makepeace said they should invest in a few copies of roberts rules of order and elect a chairman at the next meeting matt agreed tim belanger volunteered to take minutes next time abby cushman said they would need a nameyou cant have us just be namelessand were there any suggestions abby herself thought committee of the last true human beings would be good too confrontational makepeace said thats not what were about jacopetti raised his hand committee of cockeyed optimists council of lost causes matt said he thought it could be the emergency planning committee for the time being heads nodded though abby seemed disappointed it was past ten oclock and people were eager to leave matt asked them to write their names addresses and phone numbers on a piece of paper which he would photocopy and distribute to everyone on the list along with an announcement of the next gettogether meeting adjourned beth and joey commoner were first out the door miriam flett last matt stood at the window watching cars pull out of the parking lot tom kindle wheeled himself to the door care to push me as far as the elevator jeez i hate this fuckin chair youll be walking before long matt guided the chair down the semidarkened corridor the walls were painted a shade of green that was supposed to be soothing but looked under the ceiling fluorescents unearthly kindle wouldnt be alone in this cavernous buildingthere was still a skeleton night staff on dutybut in some other sense he would be very alone and matt felt sorry for him so kindle said are you going to take the girls advice you heard that a little none of my business of course didnt know you had a daughter i used to he rang for the elevator and worked to keep the bitterness out of his voice im not sure i do anymore chapter the battle of us the problem john tyler thought was that all the armies had gone home all the factories had closed their doors all the congressional committees had adjourned foreverand where did that leave him sidelined down in other words but not out tyler lived alone in a twostory georgianstyle townhouse in arlington virginia he had equipped the spare bedroom with a formidable array of nautilus exercise equipment and in the days after his unproductive conversation with the chief executive he spent a great deal of time working out tyler was a month away from his fiftysecond birthday and though he was in fairly good civilian trim he wanted more he wanted to be in fighting shape at his age it was a difficult proposition not that it couldnt be done but he was paying for the effort the token of exchange in this bargain was pain first the obvious pain of a hard workout the pain he took to a certain brink and backed away from then the stealthy pain that crept up in the nightthe aching tendons the protesting spine the humiliating discomforts that sent him to the drugstore in search of bengay tylenol something to help him sleep something to help him move his bowels but there came a time when he was able to look at himself in the fulllength bedroom mirror without flinching taut chest lean belly tapering into the waistband of his jockey shorts firm legs gray stubble hair on his head and a down of gray hair on chest and limbs it seemed to tyler that he had created something good here a reflection he could take some pride in appearances had always mattered to tyler a great deal but the important thing was that he was fit for duty if anyone could be fit for the kind of duty he had in mind on the second monday in october he took his old army jacket out of mothballs decided he liked the way it looked over a crisp white shirt and dress pants and climbed into his car and headed for the marine base at quantico the virginia countryside was deep in a sweettempered autumn the sky was blue and the full blush of color was on the woods the highway was mainly emptyas most highways were these days tyler had given a great deal of thought to the crisis facing the country and he rehearsed his logic as he drove the problem he thought once again was that all the armies had gone home and how do you engage an enemy without an army guerrilla warfare was the obvious response to an occupying power of superior strength but you still needed an infantry a militia a power base the revolutionary moves among the people like a fish in the sea mao tsetung but the people had been coopted the fish was beached tyler had seen videotape of african armies central american armies asian and european and even israeli and american armies rabble and trained troops alike laying down their arms bailing out of tanks abandoning trenches and revetments like something from a hippie pipe dream of the sixties it had happened from ethiopia to lebanon from turkestan to latin america and it had happened without exception but it seemed to tyler that even this defeat could be used to his advantage weapons that were rusting in the field couldnt be turned on an insurgency he could move among this pacified population not like a fish in the sea more likesaya shark among the minnows or a whale among the kill but not by himself one could be outnumbered one ought not to be alone one in ten thousand the president had told him tyler didnt know if that was a reliable statistic it surely wasnt an encouraging one but the military had been a major employer prior to contact and even if the situation was as bleak as it seemed he should be able to find one or two good men maybe hed waited too long maybe the plan he had devised wouldnt work but that remained to be seen quantico was a disappointment last month the marine reservation had been a hive of activity local newscasts had shown an apparently endless relay of hercules transport aircraft buzzing in and out part of the postcontact grain airlift to the famine zones of the world but that airlift was over now and the huge usmc complex at quantico appeared to be deserted he drove among these brick buildings and overgrown parade fields honking his horn until he grew weary of the echoes rolling back he drove to the main gate stopped his car and opened the trunk sunlight warmed the skin of his neck and dappled the huge statue of the iwo jima flagraising from the trunk he unwound ten yards of bright orange ripstop nylon on which he had painted painstakingly in letters of waterproof black acrylic the words any member of the aimed forces remaining on duty call colonel john tyler or report to portage street arlington asap god bless the usa he had sewn nylon cords into the fabric at several points and he attached these to the fenceposts so that the banner hung suspended across the road the nylon drooped in the still air but the message was easy to read over the course of a week and a half tyler constructed similar banners and left them at smaller military installations from baltimore down to richmond every evening he checked his answering machine for messages to date none on his trips tyler was able to monitor the evolution of the new world superficially not much had changed traffic was substantially lighter especially on the interstates tyler saw more people out walking than there used to be and fewer at work a lot of small businesses muffler shops hairstylists bookstores were closed or unattended people were still running the food stores and shopping at the malls but he wondered how much longer that would last come to that he wondered how several hundred thousand military and government employees were surviving without paychecks the thought was intriguing enough that tyler tried an experiment he went into a suburban arlington grocery storenot in his neighborhoodand filled a cart with canned goods and bottled water when he came to the checkout he told the clerk i dont have any money i used to work for hud he expected security guards instead the clerka chubby young redhead wearing a nametag that said sallysmiled and waved him through so why was anybody paying tyler lingered by the door and took an eyeball survey of the tills according to his count it was roughly half and halfhalf paid half didnt those who did seemed to be operating mainly by force of habit tyler guessed that paying for what you take was a reflex deeply entrenched in the american psychenot an easy habit to break it continued regardless like the major league playoffs but he guessed the country was already well on the way to a moneyless economy perfect communism he thought as practiced by perfect robots tyler heard a voice inside him say youre surrounded by monsters it was sissys voice sissy was an old sad ghost tyler squared his shoulders and paid no attention sissy had been telling him he was surrounded by monsters since the day he was born over the years all his memories of sissy had condensed into a single image here was sissy as she appeared in his dreams a middleaged woman in a swaddling of canvas and polyester skirts two sweaters buttoned over her pillowing breasts gypsybright and redfaced pushing a wire buggy full of old newspapers on a toobright city sidewalk a bag lady as they would say nowadays she was his mother his father had been a salesman for a company that sold plastic novelty cups on which the name of a business could be printed in gold flash the cup tyler drank from for the first seven years of his life was inscribed with the legend fletchers taxidermy east fith st cincinnati when tyler learned to readhe taught himself to read at the age of four yearshe discovered the word fifth had been misspelled which made him cry for no good reason he could think of by then his father was long gone his mother she demanded he call her sissy lived in an ancient threestory row house on a hilly street in an urban neighborhood declining toward slum status she owned the house sometime in her younger days sissy had inherited money from an aunt in pittsburgh sissy had been young and childless and perhaps tyler thought aware of her own impending dementia she had bought the row house outright and put the remainder of the money in a trust which issued her a monthly check tylers father had come and gone without gaining access to any of this money sissy a cautious woman by nature had remained tightfisted even as the world began to slip past comprehension tyler wasnt sure when he figured out that sissy was crazy probably some other child had been kind enough to let him know hey tyler your mothers dressed like freddy the freeloader hey tyler your house smells like shit he learned early on that the best response was a firm and uncompromising fuck you it got him beat up a lot but in the long run it also got him left alone and it taught him a valuable lesson about people you could be afraid of them or you could hate them those were your choices anything else was a trap a temptation to punishment he hated and feared sissy but she was also the exception to the rule although she was insane sissy was still his mother she fed him sporadically she clothed him eccentrically she was supposed to care about him and she was capable of hurting him with her indifference he could tolerate the indifference of anyone but sissy that was why when he went to school for the first time in his lifefive days late and in the company of a truant officerhe was driven to tears when everyone laughed at his torn pants his foodstained shirt not because he cared what they thought it was sissy who had wounded him sissy who had sent him off so badly dressed sissy why didnt she know any better obviously she didnt sissy had moved into a land where reason and custom had given way to bright strokes of invisible lightning fearsome revelations too private to share sissy the adult tyler recognized had been schizophrenic sissy had been defending her home by stockpiling it with garbage and rags and it was a miracle she had dressed him at all sissy had been dead now for many years but she visited tyler regularly and she wasnt shy about making her opinions known the phone call came while he was watching television tyler had installed a satellite dish on the roof and an illegal descrambler in his living room the descrambler was a neat little sync regenerator based on a cmos chip and a mhz oscillator he could decode anything including cspan hbo and military broadcastsnot that any of these were on the air anymore in fact since midoctober there had been only a couple of hours of national tv a dayskeleton cnn broadcasts mostly coverage of the disarming of the world and the continuous slow unwinding of the octahedrons it was this last that interested tyler today another bright autumn morning windows open and a breeze tangling the curtains he sipped a diet soda and watched a videotape of a lone helper socalled gliding along an empty highway near atlanta he was fascinated by the look of it seven feet of matteblack formless menace it was a helper the way stalin had been uncle joe these curious items had been unwinding steadily from their octahedral bases in new york and los angeles spreading out forming a network across the countrythe worldfor purposes unannounced you can call them helpers tyler thought but he recognized an occupation force when he saw one what would you need to take out one of these dreadnoughts well tyler thought let me see and then as if in answer the telephone rang he stood up from the chair with his heart battering his ribs christ how long since hed heard that sound he had just about given up waiting he thumbed the mute button on the remote tv control and snatched up the telephone handset hello itll be a wrong number he thought some contactee who dialed a instead of a or did they still make such human errors colonel tyler asked a male voice speaking he managed saw your sign sir down at quantico pause one of the strings came loose but i hooked it up again i thank you for that tyler said are you a marine turned out he was a fairly raw one a weapons specialist twentyone years old names aw murdoch whats the a for alphonse im sorry to say im sorry to hear it i wont ask about the w do i understand you managed to turn down the invitation to life eternal yes sir well then we ought to get together we will uh colonel tyler i take it youre thinking of offering some resistance here meaning no offense im not in need of company for companys sake i thought from your sign youd probably want to kick a little ass eager young buck tyler thought well so am i eager at least i think thats a safe assumption when can i see you you can see me right now if you step to the window sir tyler did so he peered down from his secondstory bay window into the sunny street parked there parked on a quiet treelined arlington avenue was a camouflagebrown m hummer the oneandthreequarterton vehicle that had replaced the jeep of tylers youth a sturdy and versatile machine on the roof of which was mounted an m tow launcher a tank killer par excellence looking a little like a ray gun from an old science fiction movie or like an answer to a prayer tyler thought and grinning up from the interior of this vehicle was a lanky blond youth whose regulation haircut had grown a little shaggy but whose uniform remained relatively clean holding in his right hand what appeared to be a cellular phone obviously a smartass tyler thought but a smartass bearing gifts murdoch saluted squinting into the sunlight it appears we have a lot to talk about tyler said ill be right up sir no ill be right down tyler had learned how to establish a certain tone in male conversation a certain rank in the military the rules of conduct were explicit in civilian conversation the matter was more subtle thus it was important to take command and do so quickly it was the inability to take command that had frustrated him during his interview with the president which was still a sore memory hed been off balance at a disadvantage taking a pistol to the white house was an impulse he should never have obeyed in the first place it was hasty here the situation favored tyler a w murdoch was an active marine sergeant john tyler was a retired army officer technically a civilian a superior officer by courtesy only but it started well tyler thought when murdoch addressed him as sir given that tyler thought all else falls into place they sat in the front of the hummer and swapped stories of the invasion as a prelude to more serious talk murdoch was a california boy the kind of adolescent drifter that state had so often produced until he drifted into the corps and discovered a purpose in life that purpose was the maintenance of portable weaponry and the instruction of recruits in the use of same and it was the only thing murdoch seemed to care much about when contact emptied quantico murdoch was devastated he kept driving back to the base he said every few days like an ant to an empty nest then he saw john tylers sign and guessed there might be a future for him after all tyler offered in exchange some of his own recent history it was hard to explain the civilian work hed done since it crossed so many borderscongress the defense industry banking his job had been to know people but not too well to say things but not too explicitly in fact that life was already beginning to feel vague and distant the intricacies that had once intrigued and compelled him seemed as abstruse now as the mating dance of an extinct species he didnt say exactly this to murdoch he did make some mention of the revolt that had been derailed at the last minute by contact murdoch was fascinated hed been aware of the highlevel alert that august night the furtive troop movements it was exciting murdoch said like something out of the civil war firing on fort sumter i never did care for that windy old fart in the white house bolstered by this the colonel described his last meeting with the commander in chiefa somewhat polished version murdoch was wideeyed you actually had a pistol on him yes tyler said you could have killed him he nodded why didnt you it wouldnt have helped it might have attracted attention anyway he was too malleable too yielding do you understand mr murdoch i know what you mean i meet people people i used to know even theyre real nice too nice its scary but you cant hate em for it much less shoot em be like killing a rabbit with a pipe wrench tyler nodded murdoch extracted two cans of coors from a cooler in the back of the vehicle he offered one to tyler who popped the tab and listened to the hiss no murdoch said theyre not the enemy those things on the road on the other hand helpers colonel tyler said uhhuh now to me they look like the enemy i share your thought tyler said you thought about what to do about it obviously but why dont you give me your perspective first well theres all this technology lying around but most of it you cant manage if youre just one personor just two might be fun zooming over the treetops with an a and twelvehundred rounds of those depleted uraniumtipped slugs say but shit im no pilot sir are you about a hundred hours in a piper cub we couldnt even preflight an a so were looking at portable ground weapons not a tank or a selfpropelled howitzer or anything sluggish like that i mean we dont know for sure what were up against so something lean a dragon an at okay we can get lots of those the whole worlds an armory right and the doors are wide open but for a first encounter im thinking power and mobility im thinking shoot and scoot the hummer tyler interpreted the hummer and more specifically that tow on the roof the way i see it we encounter a helper on the open road we can bust it and break away before their cavalry arrives tyler sipped his beer and pretended to be thinking it over mr murdoch we dont know what defenses those things might possess i dont think we can find out except by shooting at em might be dangerous murdoch heard something in tylers voice some unsuccessfully suppressed note of mischief he smiled sir it might indeed its a pretty day for shooting though isnt it dont get ahead of yourself you have to teach me how to operate this tow tyler glanced up at a sky the color of blue chalk its a pretty day for some livefire exercises too murdoch wasnt pleased with this id hoped to operate the tow myselfyou knowwhen it comes time rank has its privileges mr murdoch i expect well both get a chance yes sir murdoch said they came to know each other that first week they were together on the livefire range at quantico murdoch teaching him the tow and some smaller tankkillers tyler guessed you could say they were friends the barrier of command fractured a little by their odd situation tyler shared some secrets as friends do but there were secrets he simply couldnt share had never shared with anyonesuch as the history of his madness madness too strong a word but tyler used it to remind himself that it was not merely unhappiness not merely selfpity it was a darker and more powerful presence that from time to time settled upon him ever since sissy died these memories came back at night key events during his twelfth year he achieved a b average at school scored well above the norm on a stanfordbinet intelligence test administered by the school board and fainted twice once in gym once in homeroom the school nurse asked him what he usually ate for breakfast and dinner and he answered both times frosted flakes he liked the picture of the tiger on the box he did most of the shopping himself he never bought vegetables because he wasnt sure how you put them in these plastic bags you weighed them it was confusing he worried he might spend more than the three or four dollars sissy let him carry to the store as for canned vegetableshe had tried that once canned peas which came out pale green and wrinkly not much like the picture on the label sissy said they tasted like rat poison had he ever watched a poisoned rat die sissy had sissy described the event you want to do that to me tyler thought hed better stick to frosted flakes the nurse and his homeroom teacher conferred which led to a visit from a social worker which led after no little trauma to tylers installation in a foster home and sissys forcible remittance to a white brick building out of town where she died six months later of an accident while bathing tyler had seen the guards who worked at this institution they were barrelchested stupid and permanently pissed off sissy used to spit at them so tyler was suspicious when they told him the accident part but sissy was deadthat was a fact he never found out what happened to the old row house or sissys remittance money he didnt want to have anything to do with either one he was glad sissy was gone life was better without sissy still when he overheard a social worker say the same thingthat he would be better off without sissy tyler tried to kill the woman with the sharp end of a blue bic pen he didnt do much more than scratch her face though he privately hoped the ink had dyed the skin beneath the wound a permanent tattoo a reminder that such calculations were not hers to make the act propelled him out of his foster home and into a grim institution perhaps not unlike the white brick building in which sissy had died spitting at her captors in which tyler was kicked assaulted humiliated sometimes brutalized at best ignored he was rescued from this limbo when a legal inquiry into sissys holdings discovered a living relative who was willing to take custody of the boy tyler never actually met this man who preferred to remain safely distant he was a retired lawyer tyler understood who paid his way into a military boarding school of some repute the boy was bright everyone admitted that sullen sometimes given to fantasy a loner but smart as a whip he enlisted in the army with good prospects earned his lieutenants bars earned a bachelors degree at the governments expense faced a bright future as a commissioned officer he did carry a few black marks on his record during basic infantry training he had come close to killing another man a memory that still troubled him it was an impulse there was no other word to describe it one moment he was practicing a takedown the next he was strangling the man it was nobody in particular it happened to be a stringbean named delgado who was actually a friend of his more or less but that didnt matter what mattered was the sudden and overwhelming need to do harm to carve his name on a strangers life as painfully as strangers had carved their names on his plus it gave him an erection three other men had dragged him off delgado who gagged and vomited no permanent damage had been done however and in view of tylers otherwise excellent record the event was written off as an anomaly it was a pattern he would come to recognize the phrase in light of this soldiers otherwise commendable performance decorated a whole drawer of complaints not insubordinationnever that drunkenness fistfights slovenly dress once a speed run through saigon with the military police behind him but only at certain intervals certain dark passages in his life certain times when he heard sissys voice too often in his headthat is only during his madnesses it had slowed his rise from the ranks when you reach a certain point tyler discovered your private life begins to matter you start being seen at parties with embassy personnel in a decorative role offering dances to the wives of ambassadors and the daughters of diplomats consorting with people who want you to be their little brother in uniform an american centurion with a cute little pixie wife and maybe a freckled threeyearold in military housing somewhere they didnt want you trafficking for instance with asian prostitutes unless you were very discreet and they didnt look kindly on the rumor that youd been seen in a different redlight district altogether where the traffic leaned toward young asian boys it was only that his passions inclined to youth a certain androgynous beauty he craved but couldnt define he came to the asian boys asian girls telling himself it was simply a need to be satisfied and he left hating them for their grace their wantonness their doeeyed acquiescence he learned discretion discretion served him well for some years discretion did not fail him until his posting to west germany where his military career came to an end he had found a whorehouse in stuttgart in a pretty little building next to a pretty little beer garden in a part of the city not much frequented by americans and he had selected a turkish immigrant girl who claimed to be thirteen years old and by her looks might not have been lying and he had been upstairs with her the girl naked and mumbling bitte bitte through a mouth filled with the colonels erect penis while he held his service revolver to her head and stroked its trigger gently not even near the point of firing the weaponwhen the house matron came through the door screaming at him apparently it was her custom to keep an eye on her employees through a number of peepholes in the old plaster walls and she had seen tyler put his revolver to the girls headbut it was really only a kind of play was that so hard to understandand believed he was about to commit a murder tyler was startled by the woman and when he turned the revolver did go offhe shot the girl through her skinny left arm it was a mistake an ambulance came the police came he was arrested he was held for questioning by a redfaced man who told him this is not the wild west this is not where you shoot and fuck he was never charged but he was held for three days and the incident was reported to his superiors there was an investigation some local scandalmongering people began to look at him differently that was the hard part people knew they looked at him well the way people used to look at sissy he resigned his commission he had made enough friends to ease the transition into civilian life but it was a difficult time the stuttgart incident seemed to be always at his heels seemed to follow him like some odorous lost dog it fades sissy said memory fades everyone forgets everything thats the rule but the nights were long some nights were too long and on those nights he would drive his second car an anonymous brown sedan along dark city streets where the girls were usually black or hispanic and very young to cheap hotel rooms that stank of insecticide and perspiration where he would sometimes even after stuttgart play the gun game with them and in the aftermath home before dawn alone he might toy with his service revolver pick it up put it down put it to his temple the touch of the steel a familiar sensation after all these years the oily smell of it a comforting smell sissy always talked him out of pulling the trigger the sissy in his head sad ghost dont kill yourself and be like me and in time his daylight life grew bearable he was trustworthy he was discreethe had learned all about discretionand he was smart he moved between the military the defense contractors and the congressional committees with a growing familiarity his job was to say plainly what his employers could only hint at and to hint at what his employers would publicly deny and his madnesses came and ebbed in their own slow tidal rhythm never predictable and impossible to resist and the years passed meeting aw murdoch and wearing himself out on the firing range had postponed the madness for now but it would come again tyler knew it always came and came again when he had learned the basics of the tow he drove with murdoch to an empty stretch of us and parked in the breakdown lane under a stand of shade trees yesterday murdoch had roamed up and down this pike in a commandeered sports car making notes on the position of the helpers a stream of the devices had been flowing through baltimore on for some weeks now always travelling at a steady forty miles per hour and at regular intervals some turned west on or installed themselves in road towns like columbia or wheaton most continued south on one had taken up a position on the white house lawn tyler himself hadnt seen one with his own eyes only the tv pictures it was worse close up murdoch told him they arent just black like painted black or anodized black they dont shine in the sunlight at all theyre blacker than their own shadows and when they move colonel they dont tremble or bounce they glide you ever play a computer game sir you know how things move on a video screen like math like oiled perfection thats how these things move the idea of trying to stop one murdoch confessed as much as it appealed to him it also well it scared him a little you can deal with it though oh hell yes sir im anxious to deal with it so here they were parked on a sunny stretch of road at the edge of a cow pasture where a few holsteins grazed or perhaps they were guernseys tyler got those confused a dairy breed in any case crickets sang in the high grass and faint clouds dappled the horizon the air was cool november was only a day away any old minute now sir said murdoch who had calculated this somehow tyler focused his attention on the highway where it crossed a low ridge a couple of thousand yards north the helper would be coming over that ridge well within range but nothing moved there now not even traffic the roads were sparsely travelled these days murdoch popped a can of dr pepper which made tyler jump christs sake sorry sir tylers mouth was dry he envied murdoch that can of pop fresh from the cooler but he had to be ready to man the tow he guessed this was murdochs revenge for not being allowed first shot at a helper tough luck tyler thought i guess i can wait for a cold drink sir i think you have a target sir tyler stood up on the shooting platform and manned the weapon the tow was manufactured by hughes a company tyler had done some business with he had a lot of respect for the tow it was a wireguided weapon almost mindnumbingly complex but reliable in service it was designed to penetrate heavy armor plate and render even the bestprotected tank functionally unserviceable ie blow it the hell up he got his first good look at a helper through the cross hairs of the x optical sight the helper looked like a deathblack ball and conethe aliens seemed to love these euclidian shapesand it was travelling well below the speed limit along the slow curve of the road the image rippled slightly in the heat rising from the asphalt the cattle shuffled and raised their heads as if they sensed this presence tyler was suddenly nervoussuddenly this seemed like real combatbut he didnt let the anxiety affect his timing he kept the helper in his sights until it cleared the high spot in the road he wanted this target clean sir murdoch said nervously were a little exposed here keep your shirt on mr murdoch a long pause then sir tyler triggered the weapon the tow performed a number of complex tasks between one eyeblink and the next tylers finger on the firing button ignited a rocket motor which popped the missile from its launch container all the rocket fuel was used up before the missile left the tube which was what protected tyler murdoch and the vehicle they were sitting in from the backwash the sound of the launch was blisteringly loud it was a sound murdoch had compared to the hiss of satans own steam press when the missile was well clear a sustainer motor ignited the missile unfolded four wings and accelerated to feet per second tylers eyes were on the helper the tow missile trailed two fine wires attached to the launcher tyler actually used the sight and a joystick to drive the missile which never failed to astonish him this videogame aspect of it he steered the missile down a trajectory that seemed eternally long but was not he kept the cross hairs centered on the moving helper picturebook launch the missile arrived in the vicinity of its target travelling at plus miles per hour the warhead was fitted with a standoff probe that exploded fifteen inches from the target the main warhead detonated a fraction of a second later hell of an explosion tyler thought his ears ringing holy damn murdoch whooped the cows and crickets had fallen silent tyler had once seen a movie called war of the worlds loosely based on the h g wells novel martians land in california and build monstrous killing machines conventional weapons fail at last the air force drops a nuclear device explosion mushroom cloud nervous observers wait for visibility to improve the firestorm abates the dust settles the martian machine is still there tyler leaned against the hot mass of the tow launcher scrutinizing the spot on the highway where the missile had detonated the smoke swirled up and away in a lazy easterly breeze and nothing at all was left behind murdoch couldnt resist driving to the spot though tylers instinct was to get away as quickly as possible he stopped and idled a few feet from the scorch marks nothing remained of the helper but a fine sootyblack dusta thick arc of it clean across the highway nice shot murdoch said thank you spose youre right though colonel spose we ought to scoot commence scooting tyler said it was a small beginning but it was also tyler thought the first human victory after a long humiliation he closed his eyes as murdoch raced the hummer into the cool october air it had been a genuinely lovely autumn tyler thought a beautiful fall after a time the crickets started up again chapter two eagles northwest autumn weather moved in from the ocean on the third of october and settled over coastal oregon like a contented guest the sky darkened the rain came in mists and drizzles dusk began at lunch and lingered till dinnertime matt was afraid this would go on through the winter that they wouldnt see the sun again until april he was happy to be proved wrong five days before halloween the clouds parted one last bubble of warm air drawn across the pacific from hawaii paused above buchanan the dew dried on the pine needles and the grass wondered whether it ought to start growing again over breakfast matt recalled what cindy rhee had told him talk to your daughter the child was right of course he had barely spoken to rachel since contact hed been busyspending time at the hospital trying to keep the er functional then organizing the committee but even when he was alone with her in the long evenings too silent when the sun declined and the artifact cast its bony light or the rain talked to the roof still he couldnt bring himself to speak not to say the important things he was too much aware of the change in her of the neocytes socalled at work inside her skull changing her carrying her away to speak of it would be to invite the grief which he could not allow because there had been too much grief in his life already he couldnt afford more grief he was tired of grief but maybe the time had come he found her sitting at the kitchen table eating a bowl of cereal and reading a library book the book was propped against the cornflake box and braced with her left hand it was dostoevskys the idiot and it seemed to matt she was turning the pages a trifle too quickly better not to dwell on that her hair was uncombed and she was wearing a blue nightgown she looked at him as he entered the kitchen a look both hopeful and wary he moved to the counter and started measuring out coffee his hands were hardly shaking at all busy today rache no she said feel like a drive i thought maybe we could ride out to old quarry park last nice day of the year maybe we havent been up there for a long time rachel said in the mood for it she nodded rachel understood that her father wanted to talk wanted to make sense of what had happened and she knew how hard it was for him she wanted to help but didnt know how he drove the long way up toward old quarry park as the road rose along the flank of mt buchanan she could see the town sparkling in its bay polished bright as a jewel by all that rain there was no plume of smoke from the dunsmuir pulp and paper mill down south thered been no smoke from the mill for a couple of weeks now the car turned down a side road past the reservoir and rachel realized where this detour was taking them the old house her father nodded they always called it the old house it was the house where daddy had grown up back in the old days before her mother died they would go on this drive every once in a while maybe twice a year when daddy was in the mood they would drive past the old house and daddy would talk about what buchanan had been like long ago and rachel would picture him as a child as strange as that seemed her father as a tenyearold in jeans and a grubby tshirt trekking through the power company clearcuts on his way to school or carrying peanut butter sandwiches out to the bluffs on warm saturdays like this the street where he had grown up was called floral drive a grand name for ten s box houses on a culdesac with backyard views of the distant bay rachel recognized the old house at once as daddy slowed the car there was nothing special about it it had a shake roof and aluminum siding painted brown the number was marked on a gatepost with ornate brass numerals daddy didnt know who lived here now strangers he hadnt lived in the house himself for more than twenty years there was no traffic he stopped the car and let it idle my grandfather died here he said he was looking at the house not at rachel i was ten he lived with us for the last three weeks of his life he died of a bone cancer just before christmas but he loved to talk and he was fairly lucid those last three weeks i sat in the bedroom with him so hed have somebody to talk to he was born one year before the century turned if you can imagine such a thing he was twenty during the labor troubles in he talked about that a lot seattle was the big iww capital of the northwest but there was a lot of labor trouble in buchanan too buchanan was a logging town back then some bars a hotel city hall the harbor loggers in on weekends to drink and carry on the wobblies were organizing at the dunsmuir mill in they called the big general strike up in seattle buchanan had its own sympathy strike just like seattle the strike was put down with clubs and cops your greatgrandfatherthis was willy on the hurst side of the familyhe worked at dunsmuir he was part of the labor parade two hundred men marched into the city hall turnaround with red banners the mayor in those days was bill gunderson he was in the pocket of the dunsmuir familyhe called out a bunch of army regulars and they advanced with fixed bayonets three people were killed before the fight was over everybody went home bloody willy said the big fight was over the iww banner everybody was yelling protect the flag two guys got hurt one blinded the banner went down but willy and another man grabbed it and carried it up the hill behind city hall and planted it in the civic gardensit stood there ten minutes before the troops fought through the crowd and pulled it down he turned to face rachel that was his victory that bloody flag ten minutes he wanted me to know that before he died he wanted me to know he wasnt just an old man sick in bed he was willy hurst and he had saved the flag from the soldiers you never told me that before rachel said it was the first time i really understood this town had a history that people had histories a town is a living thing rachel it has memories yes she said i cant walk away from it not without trying to save it she nodded unhappily i know thats how it is for me he shifted gears and drove away from the old house back toward the road toward old quarry park the morning sunlight was hot through the car windows now you he said i want to know how it is for you old quarry park was a wooded ridge running from the northern slope of mt buchanan to the sea a mile southwest of the abandoned mineral quarry that had given it its name hiking trails wound through the tall coastal firs but the center of the park had been developed in the s there was a bandstand a little league diamond a playground rachel had been taken to play here on summer weekends since she was three years old on one of those longago summer saturdays she had fallen and cut her forehead on the rim of the whirlaround matt had cleaned and bandaged the cut she remembered his hands huge and warm doctor hands their confident touch these memories had been coming back to her lately it was part of the change he walked beside her from the parking lot through the trees to the picnic grounds he was superimposed on her memory of him an older version of himself it seemed as if he had aged years in the last few weeks they sat at a wooden table at the western end of the picnic grounds where they could see through the trees to the ocean the sun was bright and high a couple of jays made a quarrelsome sound overhead but the bees a summer peril had deserted the park altogether i want to know how it is for you she was a dutiful daughter and she meant to give him an answer but it wasnt easy there was so much to say daddy you know what contact was like you must remember even if you said no that feeling of doors opening up of a promise of something wonderful of being something that doesnt live and die but goes on changing all the time but not stopping i remember he said his face was drawn expressionless pale in the sunlight that didnt frighten you not when i understood what it meant it was hard at first being so transparent they talk to you but theyre talking to the inside of you your i guess soul and your soul talks back thats scary you cant hold anything back you cant hide anything but then you understand theyre not sitting in judgment its not st peter at the pearly gates theyre not even offering forgiveness thats not their businesstheir business is understanding and then you start to realize how big they are big with all the growing and learning theyve done over the centuries like some kind of beautiful seashell that gets more complicated and more colorful the longer you look at it every chamber with a smaller chamber on one side and a bigger chamber on the other all echoes and alabaster her eyes were closed and she realized shed drifted into rhapsody this contact memory was strong but she wasnt accustomed to talking about it and she was probably scaring her father she glanced at him his lips were drawn tight i couldnt say no she finished inadequately even though it means giving up so much giving what up life a normal life a family the way human beings have lived since they came out of the trees but i havent given that up people used to say is there marriage in heaven well this isnt exactly heaven but i think there will still be marriage people are people daddy theyre each unique they want different things from each other they find partners they fall in love maybe they dont get married at the first baptist anymore but were not turning into loveless monsters its hard for me to know that rachel said i dont know how to convince you what troubles me is that theres a mechanism thats altering your brain physically changing it rachel thats where love is loyalty trusteven the way we perceive the truth i tell myself this is all voluntary youre not being deceived but ive seen surgeons produce bliss with an electrode in the cerebral cortex have i changed yes you dont talk the same way arent you aware of it i know about that but me everything that makes me rachel has that changed he was silent for a long time finally he looked away from her and the pain in his eyes was nearly unbearable i dont know rache i honestly dont know she felt herself on the verge of tears she didnt want to be understood she wanted to be held she wanted him to wrap his arms around her tell her it was okay tell her he still loved her voice trembling indignant she could only manage im not different not inside she meant not where it counted on the day rachel turned four years old matt had caught her drawing on the living room wall with her birthday crayonsbig limegreen loops and whorls the wall had been painted two weeks previously and it must have looked to rachel like a big blank sheet of paper matt had paid for the painting the same week the car insurance came up for renewal the household budget had bottomed out celeste was cooking kraft dinner instead of steak rachels tricycle which she had ignored since this morning had pushed their visa card to the credit limit he went a little crazy when he saw the wall he grabbed the crayon out of her clenched fist and pushed her back bad he said bad rachel bad bad her legs went out from under her she sat down hard and her face clouded instantly almost as immediately marts remorse began to flush away the anger rachel stammered through tears im not bad he thought it was a cogent moral point he also thought he wanted to shoot himself he picked up his daughter and held her youre right rachel youre not bad but it was a bad thing to do even good people do bad things sometimes thats what i meant to say its a bad thing to draw on the wall but youre not bad it was the way she phrased her objection in old quarry park that convinced matt he still had a daughterat least for the time being im not different he felt those old father tears well up ah rache he said this is all so confusing she came around the picnic table to him he stood up and barked his knee on the pineboard tabletop it was an awkward ballet but the hug went on a long time after a while she went to a swing and asked him to push a little bit of old times matt supposed maybe it was good for her to be ten years old for a few minutes maybe it was good for him he pushed her she laughed the sky was blue after that they walked the short trail that looped into the forest but the track was muddy after all the rain when they emerged into the sunlight rachel said we should have packed a lunch i have a better idea lunch at dos aguilas really my treat he added if its open i think it is rachel said and he wondered how she knew dos aguilas was a mexican restaurant at the bayshore matt recalled that celeste had once classified it as a linentablecloth restaurant as opposed to the plasticbooth kind at the malls it had a cook not a controlledportion dispensing machine arturo the manager had inherited the business from his father the restaurant itself had been here since a landmark it was still open for business empty but open arturo welcomed them in and matt nodded to him but he understood by the glance that passed between arturo and rachel that they were of the same tribe now matt was the outsider here he chose a table by the window where they could watch the sunlit water lap the pier it means two eagles matt said rachel opened a menu over her cutlery what dos aguilas it means two eagles the story is that a pair of harbor eagles have a nest near here you can have dinner some nights and maybe see them circling over the crab boats diving for fish really she gazed out across the water did you ever see them nope dont know anybody who ever did the storys almost half a century old but people still look rachel nodded smiling at the thought arturo came to the table he took their order and headed for the kitchen disappearing into a foliage of decor sombreros pistol belts pottery matt said to his daughter you knew the restaurant would be open she nodded you know things not just you other people too he told her about the figure tom kindle had been quoting one in ten thousand rachel how would anyone know that she looked thoughtful its approximately the right number okay but how do you know oh i just shift gears tm sorry well thats what i call it it has to do with making connections a pause daddy do you want all the details of this yes because its strange i kind of took that for granted rache she gave him a look well okay if you insist it has to do with the neocytes she said one of the things they are is a kind of connector you can think of them as drawing invisible linesbetween people between people and the artifact like telepathy in a way but i think that gives the wrong impression the lines theyre drawing are knowledge lines the travellers think there should be as few barriers to knowledge as possible peoples lives are private if they want them to be but knowledgeknowledge is infinitely sharable what kind of knowledge more or less any kind give me an example well suppose i want to know how to get from here to chicago used to be id have to look at a map now i can just remember it rachel youve never been there no but im not remembering it from myself im remembering it from somebody else anyone whos ever looked at a road map it isnt my knowledge but i can get to it if i need it thats all there is to it remembering thats hardly all there is to it but thats what it feels like i suppose its more like data sharing or something computery like that but it feels like remembering you have to actually do it i mean theres a mental effort involvedlike thinking really hard shifting gears but then you just remember what if its something complicated quantum theory say neurosurgery she frowned and matt wondered if she was shifting gears right now as they spoke you can do that she said but it has to be orderly in the traveller world knowledge is infinitely available but functionally hierarchic you have to take the logical steps whats the good of knowing for instance that you can derive classical probability from the squared modulus of the quantum complex amplitude if you dont know what a modulus is in physical terms or an amplitude the knowledge is available but if you want to understand it you still have to eat it one bite at a time like this salad thank you arturo my pleasure get you something to drink a coke rachel said for you sir anything his mouth was dry rachel said i didnt mean to be scary no you took me by surprise thats all i surprise myself sometimes the meal passed in awkward silence matt noticed rachel glancing off across the waterchecking for eagles once you started it was hard to stop you still look sad she said when arturo had brought his coffee do i you were happy for a little while because we talked but only for a while because of whats happening because its stealing you rachel youre right im happy we talked but it doesnt change anything does it youre going somewhere i cant follow doesnt that happen anyway if id gone off to college or its hardly the same i know youre not a teenager forever you go to college maybe you get married you have a career things are different of course but my god this is something else entirely you go to college i can phone you on weekends next yearcan you guarantee well even be able to talk to each other she looked away so what do we have matt asked a few months she pondered the question her eyes strayed to the harbor the calm water there maybe a few months maybe less you are going away yes all of you yes where when its notit isnt altogether clear he balled his napkin and threw it on his plate she said daddy it works both ways you made a choice too im entitled to a little resentment oh because youre going to die and im not and it didnt have to be that way he followed the bay road toward home you know i mean to save this town matt told his daughter ive heard you say so you dont think its possible im not sure rachel listen to me if you know anything about the future anything at all about what might happen to this townto the planeti need you to tell me because we cant plan for what we cant imagine she was silent for a long time in the passenger seat then she said things will go on as they are now at least for a little while maybe into the winter after that people will start to disappear disappear give up the physical body oh daddy i know how horrible that must sound but it isnt it really isnt if you say so rachel what happens to these people they move to the artifact at least temporarily why temporarily because well have a place of our own before long what are you sayinga human artifact that kind of environment yes for what purposeto leave the planet maybe daddy these decisions havent been taken yet but the planet is a serious consideration weve left a terrible mark on it the travellers have already started cleaning it up erasing some of the changes we made taking some of the c out of the air they can do that yes so people disappear matt said so buchanan is empty we dont all disappear or at least not all at once in the short run what would you call a day like today indian summer last nice day of the year last chance to get in a ballgame maybe or go to the park well i think the next four or five months are going to be indian summer for a lot of us our last chance to wear skin and walk around on the earth last chance before winter matt said last chance before something better but even if you were moving from a log cabin into the taj mahal youd still want to look around the old place before you locked the door her eyes were vague unfocused her voiced seemed faint its the cradle of mankind not always easy leaving the cradle curious matt thought how a sunny day could feel so cold after dinner she curled up in the easy chair with dostoevsky in her lap how come you still need to read that matt asked how come you cant just remember it im not that good yet so the librarys not defunct not yet but the time is coming yes she looked up he was wearing his jacket the evening had turned cooler are you going out just for a drive want company thank you rache no not this time he drove down to the parking lot where the summer ferry took tourists over to crab pot island a dot of national park greenery in the embrace of the bay the parking lot was low to the water and matt parked facing west where the sky was still gaudy with sunset although the light had begun to fade he used to come here in the bad time after celeste died when you wanted privacy and you lived with a daughter you found your own retreats a parking lot was one place where you could sit by yourself in an automobile and be left in peace people assumed you were waiting for someone they didnt look closely a person could be alone with his grief could even weep if he did so discreetly if he forestalled the kind of helpless sobbing that would attract a strangers attention he was past that now but he wanted the solitude it was that time of evening when the streetlights flicker on and everything solid seems hollow and flat when dark thoughts come easily and are harder to ignore he wondered what he was trying so hard to save what was he sorry to lose in this new world they were making war was finished after all disease apparently was a thing of the past starvation was history lies were becoming impractical he had never loved war disease starvation or deceit so what was it what had he loved so much that he turned down the offer of eternal life something evanescent something fragile a family rachels childhood celeste the possibility of a human future all these things were illusions he thought of willys iww banner an old rag invested with glory by his stubborn defiance or the eagles of dos aguilas a beautiful lie the sky above the bay was empty but the eagles flew matt thought they flew when we believed in them willy flew those ten minutes on the hillside i will save this town matt thought see if i dont and if i cant save the town if it comes to that then by god i will save some part of it someone chapter annie and bobby on the saturday matt took his daughter to old quarry park annie gates drove south for an hour on the coast highway she had made this drive one weekend out of twosometimes saturday sometimes sundayfor ten years now she had never spoken of it even to matt she was going to visit bobby bobby lived in a room in the east wing of a long low building in a pine grove near the sea his window overlooked a broad green lawn and a portion of the lot where annie parked her car of course bobby seldom looked out the window but maybe that had changed maybe he was beginning to appreciate the view annie hoped so the sign at the front door of the building said wellborne care community where caring is commonplace commonplace but very expensive since bobby moved in annie had been paying wellborne the equivalent of a park avenue monthly rental she had cut a great many corners the furniture in her apartment was fifteen years old her salad and tuna diet was not for cosmetic purposes she rarely bought a hardcover book which had been the most difficult economy of all worth it of course to know that bobby was decently looked after she checked in at the deskwellborne was still fully staffed the effects of contact slow to take hold among its patientsand walked down the east corridor to bobbys room shed noticed an improvement on her last visit usually bobby retreated into a fetal curl when he saw her coming last time she visited he had unbent and regarded her with a solemn expression on his face an expression however that annie could not decipher nor could bobby explain it he never spoke to her he spoke to the staff sometimes simple food and bathroom words but never to annie today her hopes were high she crossed her fingers and said a silent wordless prayer before she knocked and opened the door annie he said her heart did a startled doublebeat how long since shed heard his voice almost thirty years she thought she remembered quite distinctly too distinctly the last words bobby had spoken to her annie dont he had been nine years old she had been ten annie he had said please dont he looked good today he was dressed in clean blue jeans and a white cotton tshirt the tshirt said i love wellborne except that love was a heart shape he was still way too skinny for the last couple of years bobby had been a problem eater just before contact he had bottomed out at pounds the staff doctor had called to discuss intravenous feeding as an option now he was eating again and although she could see the staves of his chest through the tshirt she could tell he was gaining weight his face was terribly thin his smile was skeletal but it was a smile and that was miracle enough his eyes deep in their sockets twinkled at her hi bobby she managed through the lump in her throat he climbed off the bed where he had been sitting crosslegged watching baseball on tv they said i could go out today annie go for a walk with me sure bobby she said he looked painfully fragile as he hobbled down the front steps onto the lawn but annie supposed it really was all right for him to be outside the medical staff at wellborne knew what they were doing and of course since contact bobby was immortal like everyone else but it was hard to convince herself of that he walked like an old man he was thirtyfour years old he talked like a nineyearold which was how old he had been when the accident happened annie walked with him across the sunny lawn she ventured a question bobby do you like it here its not bad he said the food is all right you want to stay he shrugged she recognized the gesture a particular bobbyshrug the shrug meant dont know dont want to talk about it nice day she said helplessly after all these mute years discussing the weather bobby just grinned she said what have you been doing watching tv he said remembering remembering i remember a lot since they came he touched his headthe side of it that was not quite symmetricaland pointed to the sky the travellers annie guess what i remember she cringed at the thought of what he might remember i remember lawn tag and he tapped her on the shoulder and went hobbling away she pretended to chase smiling to herself all that last summer they had played lawn tag through the long evenings daddy was the town doctor in bruce a little canadian prairie town a oneroad grain town of all the lawns in bruce the gatess lawn was the biggest lawn tag was a simpleminded chase under the privet hedge past the willow tree mustnt stray beyond the border of the sidewalk around back past the doghouse annie a year older could have caught bobby anytime but she liked the sound of his laughter when he dodged her hand some evenings she tagged him once twice played hard to get then let him win some evenings she let him win from the start now she could scarcely believe he was running again the sunlight was radiant on the big wellborne lawn the air was silky cool he moved in a slipjointed lope his jeans threatening to fall off his bony hips it would have been easy to catch him she pretended to chase bobby looked back and laughed out loud annie savored the sound sometimes of course he made her mad the hardest part of contact had been facing this memory but it was a memory that had to be faced most of annie had said yes to the travellers but this memory part of her had said annie doesnt deserve to live she was ten only ten a child impulsive wasnt every child bobby and annie were playing on the roof of the house on the hottest day of summer it was easy to get onto the roof bring the ladder from the old bunk beds in the basement step onto the tiny balcony outside annies room up to the steep and baking slope of the shingles you could lie there and see all the way out past the water tower past the highway past the granaries past yellow quilts of wheat to the horizon bobby was scared of the roof annie always helped him up helped him down but she sometimes took a shameful pleasure in his fear bobby the younger often got more attention than he deserved bobby was the baby of the family annie was expected to help with the dishes bobby never did todaywell it was hot prairiesummeritchysunburntightclothes hot bobby had been whining about it so she went up on the roof by herself hoping he wouldnt follow of course he did he pulled himself over the eavestrough and scuttled up the shingles behind her clinging to her foot until he could safely lie down stay still silly and you wont slip but thats not what annie said if you get scared she said your hands get all sweaty bobbys frown deepened and if your hands get sweaty you might slip he looked at her aghast across a space of cedar shakes and hot air annie dont its a looong way down bobby panicking a little he grabbed her left foot with both hands hey let go no fair but he hugged it tighter she was wearing shorts and no shoes in the hot air his fingers felt sticky as tar his touch was an intolerable itch bobby let go of me she kicked her ankle out to shake him loose annie he said dont now she was starting to get scared her gaze drifted down from the blue deeps of the sky across those farms grain elevators houses streets to the rain gutter and the paved walk down below mama had put the garbage out the garbage cans shivered in the rising heat she thought of bobby tumbling down there and carrying her with him she shook her foot again harder one hand came loose bobby scrabbled against the shingled roof she kicked again annie please dont it was peculiar it was maddening how calm his voice still sounded annie kicked to pry him loose felt his hand separate from her ankle she had turned her head away and when she looked back she caught the briefest glimpse of him as he disappeared over the edge an expression of vast surprise on his face she scrambled down the bunkbed ladder and looked over the edge of the balcony and saw bobby on the paved walk beside the garbage cans she looked for a long time unable to make sense of what she saw his head was broken open and some of what was inside had come out when bobby left the hospital he was back in diapers mama had to change him all the time once she shook a soiled cotton diaper in annies face this is your fault mama said bobbys head was curiously flat on one side and he didnt talk but whenever he saw annie coming he curled away from her and closed his eyes mama died a couple of years after that annie had hoped to win back her fathers affection with a medical degree but he died too while she was away at school she finished her degree anyhow bobby was institutionalized and the estate was paying for everything but that money wouldnt last forever and she would need a good incomea doctors incometo keep bobby cared for her residency was the hardest part the sight of a head wound still made her dizzy when she took up the partnership with matt wheeler he talked about his wife celeste and how he had lost her annie never talked about bobby bobby was a secret it kept them apart but annie understood that this was what they both needed something more than friendship something less than love matt was guilty about loving someone after celeste and annie annie wasnt convinced she deserved to be loved the travellers had stirred up these memories but the travellers had offered something in return objectivity as cool and cleansing as mountain water the ability to forgive herself annie forgave annie a quartercentury down the line but it wasnt her own forgiveness she really craved bobby tired himself out playing lawn tag so they retreated to the shade of the patio at wellborne annie brought out two glasses of lemonade from the staff cafeteria the lemonade was tart and perfect they sat on the steps drinking it were going on a trip bobby said she thought he meant the wellborne patients thats nice she said to the seashore bobby no i meanus were all going on a trip oh that trip yes are you excited annie its not for some time yet bobby a few months anyhow they have to build the spaceship yes he shook his head i have a lot of growing up to do theres no rush i got kind of left behind she wanted to say im sorrybut couldnt find her voice im getting stronger bobby said annielook what i can do a wooden railing ran all around the patio of the wellborne building before she could say anything bobby had boosted himself onto the banister he was clinging to the narrow timber with hands and feet then he stood up like a tightrope walker balancing himself his hips stuck out in bony ridges from the loose jeans his arms thrown out for balance were fragile as twigs a brisk wind could knock him down from there she felt a surge of panic bobby stop it no annie look he took two tentative steps proud of his balance proud of his new life bobby youll hurt yourself no i but she was up without thinking about it running to him grabbing him around his painfully thin waist and lifting him down he was lighter than she expected he was as light as a nineyearold annie annie its okay bobby wrapped his skinny arms around her and pressed his misshapen head against her cheek i know why youre crying he whispered did he oh god that was all a long time ago bobby said we were kids it doesnt matter anymore and annie cried in her brothers arms as if she had tapped a reservoir of tears a well of sorrow ancient and eager for the light part three indian summer chapter annie and bobby tom kindle decided he would stay in buchanan until the end of the world series after that well the horizon had an alluring look these rainy autumn days matt wheeler didnt appear to approve of the idea kindle walked with him through the empty hallways of the regional hospital some of the overhead fluorescents had burned out some flickered like candles in a cold wind the building was increasingly spooky in kindles opinion nobody but matt came around anymore id be happier if you stayed matt said kindle didnt answer he was concentrating on the pleasure of locomotion christ in a basket it was good to get out of that wheelchair it was good to be walking under his own steam it hurt like hell but it was good anyway monday hed made it halfway to the maternity wing and back today all the way to maternity and far beyond as far as the fabled corridors of physiotherapy where empty sitz baths gleamed like strange idols in dim green rooms he stumbled once matt took his arm dont overdo it no pain no gain it was a bad break at your age you dont heal as fast as you used to thank you dr kildare you want me to lie every once in a while it might be nice a pause matt said youre serious about leaving buchanan yes kindle gritted his teeth and closed his eyes okay now we turn around they shuffled back through ancient odors of ether and antiseptic kindle wore his old jeans and a cotton workshirt the doctor wore his hospital gown over a similar outfit we dont look all that different kindle thought he caught their reflection in a rainy corridor window not doctor and patient just two guys who ought to shave more often two guys with similar worry lines different pain matt said you have somewhere in particular to go its a big country i havent seen it all in fact he was thinking about the wind river range the tetons that area he hadnt seen wyoming for about twentyfive years what about the committee i never signed on to salvage buchanan i barely lived here you know before contact the committeell get on without me you said youd do radio yeah yeah ill do radio im not leaving yet theres a meeting at the end of the week right ill be there i want you to talk to me before you leave matt said maybe i can change your mind kindle promised he would though it rubbed him the wrong way no strings attached damn it hed leave when he felt like it stay or go as the spirit moved him it was how hed lived his life why change now matt left him alone in his room kindle checked the tv but there was nothing but fuzz all they showed on tv anymore was a couple of hours of news per day plus the major league playoffs the firstofnovember committee meeting was brief and morose five people showed up in addition to kindle and matt wheeler joey commoner and beth porter were two of them abby cushman the somewhat ditzy farm lady failed to appear paul jacopetti unfortunately did the pessimistic extoolanddie maker issued his usual evilminded prophecies including a prediction that the helper recently arrived at the city hall turnaround would murder them all while they slept poison gas maybe matt seemed too dazed to refute this paranoia and kindle listened with disgust after that they held their first election matt stood for chairman his single opponent wasinevitablypaul jacopetti who didnt think matt should run unopposed although of course this whole exercise is futile there was a show of hands and matt took the vote six to one figures jacopetti said old business kindle promised he would drive down to causgrove electronics the next day and look for a ham set a lot of those stores are closed matt reminded him call first or call the owner and see if hell let you in or i could jimmy the lock matt shot him a disapproving look i dont think its come to that maybe kindle thought or maybe not but he did as matt asked phoned the store no answer phoned three causgroves out of the book until he found the one who owned the shop youre right mr kindle the front doors locked locked it myself force of habit i guess but the back is open you can get in that way you want to meet me there for what purpose well i can write you a check unless you want cash please dont bother just go ahead and take what you need im sorry what we had a reasonable stock last time i looked i presume you can find the stockroom or just root around the displays if we have what you want take it pardon me you saidtake it yes sir justtake it yes just like that yes im happy to see the goods serving a purpose i thought theyd all turned into scrap metal please take whatever you want but its nice of you to have called mr kindle the connection broke at the other end kindle stared at the phone for a while his first experience with a motor vehicle since the accident wasnt his pickup truck which had been towed or trashed but a car matt wheeler left for him in the hospital lot a little blue japanese device kindle was longlegged and the act of climbing inside this automobile left him feeling like hed been folded into a mailbox his knees bumped the wheel until he figured out how to lever back the seat everything was digital the dashboard looked like a cockpit display but it was transportation what the hell maybe when his leg didnt hurt so damn much he would take himself to a car dealership maybe the price of a new car had dropped since contact maybe to zero he wondered what it would be like to drive one of those bulletshaped vans he used to see on the road it would be nice to have an enclosed space to keep a few things out of the rain this morning a tuesday morning the roads were wet and empty the rain fell in mists the windshield fogged until he figured out how to run the heater driving west from the hospital kindle was impressed with the stillness of the town it was as if some languorous fatal calm had settled over buchanan he counted the cars he passedeight altogether their brake lights making comettails on the slick asphalt no pedestrians most of the shops were dark it resembled a ghost town kindle thought but no one had really left what were all those people doing he parked in a nostopping zone anarchist outlaws of the world unite he extracted himself from the car moaning when his bad knee knocked against the steering column causgrove had been correct the front door of the shop was locked but the door facing the service alley opened at the turn of a knob kindle switched on lights as he entered the building he realized as soon as he found the dimly daylit front room that shopping was going to be harder than hed expected the racks were full of indistinguishable black boxes with endless cryptic numeric displays some of these items were marine radios some were ham rigs some served no obvious purpose should have studied up on this kindle said aloud you just have to know what youre looking for he was startled by the voice and he turned thoughtlessly on the axis of his left foot a flare of pain sizzled up the leg ouch goddamn it he steadied himself on a steel rack whos there it was joey commoner joey came out of the shadows behind the cash counter he looked like a hood kindle thought but not a dangerous one the kind of suburban white kid who dresses like a drug dealer but doesnt know any he stood with his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket and an unreadable expression on his face knew youd show up joey said you were waiting for me what you said at the meeting last night what about it figured you wouldnt know what you wanted kindle glanced again at the relentless racks kid had a point so are you here to help or did you just want the fun of watching you need a transceiver joey said show me one joey pushed away from the counter and sauntered over to a wall display yet more big black boxes some of them had microphones attached joey said how much are you planning to spend do you see anybody behind the register were ripping this off not exactly i talked to the owner he says were welcome to take anything we want what for free no money down no monthly payments shit joey said thats weird i knew these people werent human he turned his attention to the stock so we want the best right he put his hand on a huge rig there was a japanese brand name on the face of it next to more knobs and technical graffiti than kindle cared to look at this is a threehundredwatt transceiver they come more powerful but i dont think we need it you know ham stuff how come you didnt say anything at the meeting save me the trouble i dont know much mainly theory i know how radio works i never got a license or anything one up on me uhhuh probably we could use an arrl manual too which the book on the rack over there looks like a phone book kindle considered his leg the ache which never ceased was cranking up toward real pain tell you what ill carry the book if you carry that machine its a transceiver or you can call it a rig all right christ its a transceiver can you carry the fuckin transceiver joey smiled should have brought your wheelchair smartass joey rooted in the stockroom for a boxed unit with a manual then loaded it into the trunk of kindles car i appreciate the help kindle said youre not done yet no think about it you want to be a radio station so you need more than a box you need an antenna it was obvious he felt a little stupid well shit he squinted at the kid you know about antennas could figure it out they stock em here joey nodded but we should come back with a truck or something were talking about maybe a big beam antenna you got a threehundredwatt transceiver so you want a big antenna and a big tower to do it justice why dont i just go home and let you take care of it joey backed up i didnt volunteer for this no hey i didnt mean it that way i mean fuck you if you want me to do your job no just wanted to help so help kindle slammed the trunk shut lets not stand here in the pissin rain well come back with a truck but maybe tomorrow all right my leg hurts joey gazed at him you broke it yeah how fell down a mountain uhhuh joey said you look too old to climb a mountain kindle sighed and took a pen and notepad from his shirt pocket write down your phone number ill call you about the antenna told you im not doing your work for you you dont have to work goddamn it you only have to point i just like the electronics but joey wrote his number down there was a baseball game on tv that night there had been a long hiatus after contact then the season had picked up where it left off the world series would run into cold weather but with all these domed stadiums kindle supposed that wasnt a problem he had watched all these games everything else on tv since contact had been bizarre and kind of frightening even such laudable events as the relief flights to the third world the food flights had been good but they had also been operated with scary precision there was something unnerving about all those military planes in v formation even if their cargo bays were filled with wheat now the relief flights appeared to have stopped the implication was that the refugee populations of the world had found some new way to get along or had discorporated a word kindle remembered from his youth feeding the poor had been a stopgap effort a bridge to that great unspoken mysterious millennium kindle felt bearing down on him like a runaway locomotive but baseball went on the nba hadnt started a new season football was finished but a decision had been made in some telepathic congress the world series would be played out come hell or high water maybe in spain it was soccer or in russia it was hockey or chess or whatever the hell they played over there but games still mattered according to matt there were still little league games being played in buchanan even some pickup football on the high school field whatever it was people were turning into they still liked to get out on the turf and chase a ball he hadnt followed baseball since the world series the last time hed owned a tv the yankees took the dodgers that year as kindle recalled things had changed since then he didnt recognize names everybody looked too young but he had watched the season progress on his hospital sony and he was determined to see the end of it tonight it was an al game detroit at new york he thought detroit looked good for the series he thought it would be a detroitchicago series and his money was on detroit the tigers would take the cubs and then kindle would pack up his possessions and move on he spent that night at the hospital but he wasnt sick enough to stay longer and he didnt intend to it was a charmless place at best at the same time it seemed pointless to move back to his cabin he could get all the isolation he wanted much closer to town in the morning he phoned the local realty office no one answered but kindle was ready for that he knew a guy who worked there or used to a guy named ira who sometimes hired his boat for fishing trips kindle reached him at home iras voice had the detached bemused quality kindle had come to expect from a contactee kindle identified himself and came to the point just a question ira seeing as youre in the business are houses free what do you mean you want to buy a house nope i just want one yesterday i wanted a radio rig and i got one for free can i have a house there was a pause well thoughtful i know of some empty properties if you move in i dont suppose anybody will mind youre shittin me kindle couldnt contain himself beg pardon christ youre serious i can move into any fuckin house any empty one i suppose he recalled joey commoners remark about an antenna i want a house on a hill no obstructions nice view all around ocean view doesnt matter i can give you a few addresses kindle fumbled for his pen he spent the next day looking at properties by midafternoon hed picked one out a twobedroom frame house in delmar estates a mildly upscale part of town overlooking buchanan and a northerly piece of the bay the house was empty and unfurnished he moved in his single piece of propertythe radio transceiver still boxed he put it in the middle of the living room floor the house had an emptyhouse smell he guessed the broadloom had been cleaned before the property went on the market maybe the walls had been painted he breathed in breathed out he had never lived in such a place and never really wanted to but he guessed a month or so here might be tolerable although at the moment there was nothing to sit on but the floor he drove to the sears at the nearest mall and found the doors standing open but no one on duty at the cashiers stations what else he realized with some startlement that he could equip the house with any furniture he happened to like price being no object hed always kind of admired these imitationleather sofas for instance he tried one out right there in the deserted home furnishings department it was like sitting on a stuffed lizard sumptuous but probably sticky in hot weather but this was all academicthere was no way he could transport any of this stuff not at the moment not without grinding his bad leg down to bloody splinters he sighed and moved on to the patio furniture two folding chairs and a chaise lounge just about his speed he tucked them under his arm and carried them to the car he went back for fresh clothesa pair of jeans and an armload of cotton tshirts and underwear it had been a long day and he was beginning to tire but he made a second stop at the a p where he picked up canned food cold cuts a couple of loaves of bread the house was equipped with a refrigerator and stove but hang on was the electricity working it hadnt occurred to him to check the lights he supposed he could phone the power company if the phone was connected if there was a phone okay one more stop back to the mall to pick up a touchtone telephone it was nearly dusk by the time he arrived back at the house electricity it turned out wasnt a problem the refrigerator was humming vigorously he switched on the kitchen lights and began putting away the food he noticed the wire shelves in the refrigerator were barely cool and he frowned and checked the freezer no frost not even a trace was that significant maybe it was a frostfree unit kindle had heard of such appliances though he had never owned one but the refrigerator was humming like a son of a bitch when he was here earlier had he noticed that sound maybe not maybe this afternoon the electricity hadnt been turned on he plugged in the phone and called ira ira i found a place i know ira said cheerfully up on delmar i was the listed agent on that property by the way good view i hope youll be happy there pardon me ira but how the fuck do you know where i picked to live there was a pause the neighbors saw you leave some belongings we assumed you were moving in what you talked to the neighbors well in a way by voodoo telegraph in other words so tell me did the neighbors also talk to the power company well tom everybody more or less talks to everybody well ira doesnt that more or less scare the shit out of you no but i apologize if we alarmed you think nothing of it he put the phone down in a hurry unfolded a chair and sat in it hed forgotten to pick up a tv set was there a game on tonight he couldnt remember kindle went to the kitchen where the light was brighter and unpacked the transceiver ungainly object he tried to read the manual but it was written in some language only theoretically english do not allow to contact with moisture or heavily wet words to live by he guessed joey commoner would be able to figure it out november was rainy he postponed the chore of erecting an antenna the ache in his leg retreated some he began stocking up on groceries beginning to suspect that marts fears about the food supply were wellfounded the staples were still being trucked in but luxury items had begun to disappear from the shelves he stockpiled some of those too he felt like making a trophy list successfully hunted down in buchanan oregon last bag of oreos last bottle of gourmet popcorn he ferried down some items from his cabin mainly tools and books the decline and fall of the roman empire had been sitting where he left it last august and was a little musty since hed left the windows open but still readable a trudge through gibbon might not be too bad given all this rainy cool weather then on to madame bovary the tigers took the american league pennant late that month he called joey when the skies cleared for a couple of days been waiting to hear from you joey complained i got a lot of tower parts from radio shack and a beam antenna from causgroves but you werent at the hospital kindle gave the kid his new address you can transport all that took a van out of the lot at harbor ford must do that myself one of these days kindle thought are we talking hard physical labor here some joey said bring beer kindle said you got it kindle had worked erecting tv towers back in the sixties and he remembered enough of that experience to temper joeys recklessness he used a power drill with a masonry bit to anchor the antenna base in a concrete trailer pad in front of the house he guyed the tower as it went up extra guys on the first ten feet so joey wouldnt come plummeting down probably matt wheeler would resent being called in on another broken leg would resent it even worse if he lost one of his one in ten thousandeven if it was joey commoner they had the tower stabilized and the antenna installed by dusk joey did all the climbing in deference to kindles leg a nice thought or his age which was insulting he was careful not to ask joey stood back from his work this ought to give us good access to the twentymeter band which i guess would be the busiest band under the circumstances though who knows i sure as hell dont joey had taken off his shirt during the final guying of the tower as they entered the house kindle read the tattoo on his right bicep neat blue letters worthless it said you believe that kindle asked joey shrugged his shirt back on and began fiddling with the back of the transceiver kindle cracked a beer waiting for an answer that didnt come this would have been a good time to order in a pizza he thought except nobody delivered anymore he wondered who in buchanan had eaten the last delivery pizza he persisted it just seems like a strange thing to write on yourself joey put his head up from behind the transceiver since when do you give a shit dont get hostile anyway kindles attention had refocused on the dinner problem maybe i could cook us up some hamburgers on that jennair in the kitchen cook whatever you want fuck joey had jammed a screwdriver into the palm of his hand he added some other words shouldnt have written worthless kindle said should have written bad tempered little sob fuck off joey said i thought you liked to do electronics joey stood up what was that on his shirta skull skull and roses its too many words eh badtempered little sob would have hurt too much kid has a sense of humor kindle said he cooked up hamburgers the way he liked them with a startling amount of chili worked into the ground beef an acquired taste perhaps but joey just ladled on the ketchup and forged ahead kindle asked when do we power up i guess after we eat might not be anything to hear joey shrugged he had absolutely mastered that gesture kindle thought he had a vocabulary of shrugs kindle said if its one in ten thousand how many of those are hams or have the sense to rig up a radio i read a statistic in one of those library books maybe one out of six hundred adult americans has a valid amateur license so what does that come to after contact fifty people in the continental us how should i know well we dont know but it cant be very many and how many of those are on the air more at night joey said receptions supposed to be better at night even so some of them are bound to be out of range or at the wrong angle to the antenna or some damn thing some of them maybe tried and gave up we might not hear a blessed word might not joey said what you dont give a shit joey seemed to ponder the question i want to work the transceiver he said finally you need somebody to talk to so as far as youre concerned this isnt about saving the world is that what you think no he admitted its maybe what matt wheeler thinks stupid idea joey said is it everybodys gone already i mean theyre still here but theyre gone some of us just got left behind we cant do anything about it help ourselves maybe if we were that smart we would have gone to heaven like everybody else theres a reason we got left here all the important people are gone and were still here because basically because were what joey smiled worthless joey switched on the radio but the twentymeter band was empty all that static gave kindle a chilly feeling little crackles of who knows whatinterstellar radiation cosmic noise like rain on a rooftop faint as memory it was like listening to the restless sleep of the world it wasnt just buchanan that had gone strange it was the entire planet you could know thathe had known it for monthsand still not feel it but he felt it now listening to the radio hiss like waves on an empty beach this was the silence of detroit and chicago the silence of washington the silence of ceylon and baghdad and peking and london we must have been the most talkative species for lightyears around kindle thought but tonight the earth was as still as an empty church he heard what he thought was a snatch of voices amidst the static but when joey tuned back there was nothing try putting out a call kindle suggested joey took up the microphone he cleared his throat calling cq he said then covered the mike with his hand i feel like an asshole i expect everybody does the first time carry on calling cq this is he covered the microphone again we dont have a call number just say your name for christs sake say were in oregon cq this is joseph commoner in buchanan oregon calling cq joseph cq if anybody can hear me calling cq kindle sat through a couple of hours of this then told joey he was going to bed when you get tired you can crash on the chaise lounge if you want to not that joey showed any sign of wanting to sleep he continued to patrol the twentymeter band with an obsessive glaze in his eyes kindle brushed his teeth and stretched out on a mattress he had ferried here from the mall he closed his eyes and listened to the sound of joey calling cq in the next room he thought about the antenna about joeys radio waves zooming off into the dark night seek you seek you just the idea of it gave him the lonely shivers kindle got up at dawn joey curled on the lawn recliner in the living room slept till noon when he woke he came into the kitchen looking smug any luck last night kindle asked i talked to a couple of people joey said and checked out kindles reaction with a sideways glance no shit kindle said who a guy a ham in toronto thats in canada right last time i looked at a map it was whats happening in toronto he says the situation is about the same as here were supposed to talk again tonight ask him yourself and another guy down in georgia southerner huh well hes travelling around joey said hes an army colonel name of tyler some nights later kindle watched the final game of the world series on his color tv it was a tigerscubs series as hed predicted the game was broadcast without narrative which gave it an eerie atmosphere the only sound was the crack of the bat the murmur not a roar of a sparse crowd all these games had been close pitchers games kindle thought scientific mistakes were few and counted for much if a breaking ball stayed up and over the plate it was bound for glory detroit took the game in the eleventh inning winning the series last at bat for the boys of summer the final score rode up the screen then suddenly there was static nothing on tv tonight kindle thought nothing on tv tonight ever again he phoned matt wheeler and told him hed stay till christmas chapter christmas matt wheeler saw less of his daughter rachel as winter settled in she was out of the house much of the time she seldom told him where she was going or where she slept at night matt seldom asked they talked occasionally he appreciated the effort she made but increasingly it was dialogue across an invisible wall daddy she told him you have to talk to the helper he thought talk to it whatthat statue the helper had stood in the city hall turnaround like a piece of grim abstract sculpture for weeks now it neither moved nor spoke if you talk to it rachel said itll talk back thats difficult to believe you have to talk to it rachel said it can tell you things i cant and itll be here when im gone thats what its for the rain was nearly constant now on the day he closed the hospital the second of december matt posted a sign at the emergency entrance his name and phone number were written in red letters under a waterproof plastic sheath the number would reach him at home or in his car as long as the telephone and local cellular system survived he was considering the possibility of fitting a mobile medical unit in a hospital ambulance or trying to locate the hospitals own rural treatment unit abandoned somewhere after contact but there didnt seem to be a pressing need the hospitals facilities were intact if he should need them though he could foresee a time when the town would exhaust its supply of drugs of sterile needlesof doctors perhaps on his way home thinking about what rachel had said he stopped at the city hall turnaround the center of this traffic circle had been developed as a park planted with grass and equipped with a water fountain and a plaque commemorating the towns incorporation much of willys iww battle had been fought on this circle of alkaline soil the helper stood here it had floated into town along the coast highway made a right turn where the highway crossed marine glided past marts office in the marshall building and across the railway overpass and stationed itself on the turnaround green matt walked toward it through the rain the rain was cold he shivered under the wet bulk of his overcoat he stopped a short but wary distance from the helper he was intimidated by its sizeit stood at least seven feet talland by its glossless black surface somehow untouched by the rain they called it a helper the name he thought was grotesque but appropriate it suggested a blunt totalitarian benevolencea meaningless gesture from a humorless tyrant talk to it not possible he stood in the park a while longer listening to the rain as it fell on the grass and watching the clouds roll down from the slope of mt buchanan then he turned and walked back to the car hard times coming rachel repeated the warning a few days later the travellers are doing things to the planet she said and matt experienced a tremor of fear that stitched into the deepest part of him it wasnt what she saidthough that was frightening enoughbut how she said it blandly if not happily they were sitting in the living room looking past the blank tv set through the window to a faraway ridge of wet douglas firs in their darkgreen winter coats it was another rainy december morning matt cleared his throat and asked what doing something to the planet might entail fixing it rachel said restoring it reversing all the changes what we did over the last century or sowhat people didwas to set forces in motion we couldnt control global warming for instance the travellers are taking some of the c out of the atmosphere and trying to bind it into the ocean she turned to face him it was worse than we suspected if the travellers hadnt come it would have been awfully hard for all of us next century or the century after that they care what happens to the earth they care because we care even if youre leaving its where we were born rachel said its our planet and it wont be entirely empty restoring the balance matt said that doesnt sound so bad no but in the short term daddy i cant explain all the things theyre doing but in the short term it could mean some chaotic weather at the very least storms bad storms he nodded grateful for this nugget of hard information when i dont know maybe soon late winter early spring therell be some warning of course thats what the helpers are for one of the things theyre for her expression now was not bland at all she regarded him with a desperate unhappiness daddy you must talk to the helper it had been agreed at the november committee meeting that they would gather to celebrate christmas eve at tom kindles new house in delmar estates guests were welcome even contactees especially family and matt asked rachel to come alongbut she declined he drove to the party through a chill heavy rain that threatened to turn into hail along streets grown ragged with winter potholes he wondered whether he might be the only one lunatic enough to brave the weather some party but there were other cars parked at the house and kindle welcomed him inside took his coat told him that in fact all ten members of the committee had shown up but nobody else just us human beings which is probably just as well come on in matt everybody else got here early cause of the weather i guess abbys been here since two this afternoon puttin up these goddamn christmas decorations plus that little plastic tree in the corner had me hangin bulbs and lights on it looks good tom looks like a fuckin department store but there was no stopping her matt remembered the way buchanan used to dress itself up for christmastinsel across the avenues pine boughs on the lamp standards the punch is over there kindle said but go easy for a while we got a turkey in the oven and some radio calls coming in from the easti dont want anybody throwing up on the microphone dinner was festive even paul jacopetti seemed to have mellowed for the occasion matt sat between chuck makepeace who was promoting the idea of a new years reconnaissance trip to the waterworks and the power company and abby cushman who had taken most of the dinner chores on herself and was away from the table between courses matt noted the way she fluttered over tom kindle served him generously asked his opinion of the gravy the dressing the plum pudding looks real good to me kindle said real good abby she was married matt reminded himself and had a couple of grandchildren living with herbut they were like rachel lost to contact it was no wonder she had adopted the committee and tom kindle in particular he gave a brief sober thought to annie gates he hadnt spoken to her for months he hadnt wanted to say all the necessary things all the things that amounted to goodbye good luck i loved you in my own fuckedup way but now youre not human anymore surely silence was better than that abby recruited paul jacopetti bob ganish and a reluctant beth porter to deal with the dinner dishes everybody else adjourned to the living room joey commoner began warming up the transceiver scouting for stray voices prior to the eastwest hookup scheduled for pacific time kindle took matt aside that abby shes a pain in the butt shes been over three times this week stops to chat i dont know how to chat she brings food matthew she bakes she seems nice enough matt said hell she is nice if she wasnt nice it wouldnt be a problem she talks about her familyshe doesnt see em much anymore shes having a hard time and she needs somebody she can latch onto and you know im only human its been a while since i had a woman around barring some saturday nights in town and even thats all finished since contact so i think yeah okay abbys nice but its not fair to her why not because ill leave the only advantage to getting old is that you learn this shit about yourself i was married oncelittle coast salish girl up in canada lasted about six months she went back to the reserve i came back across the border and that was pretty much the endurance record for tom kindle maybe i wont leave this month maybe not next month but ill leave and abbys been left too much just now maybe you should tell her that good advice maybe i should just club her down with a stickitd be kinder or dont leave thats the other choice uhhuh the thing is youre useful around here right about as useful as half a crutch speaking of which im still limping is that normal youll limp a while longer but dont put down your own contribution youre like an anchor at the committee meetings the radios been a morale booster too mostly joeys work and joey come to that hes turning into a human being you treat him with a certain amount of respect thats a new thing for him you ever see that tattoo on his shoulder matt nodded worthless kindle said you suppose he believes that he thought about it he didnt know joey commoner particularly well joey must have been eighteen years old when he had that word dyed into his skin and it was precisely the kind of thing a pissedoff eighteenyearold might do it might mean nothing still if he had to render an opinioni think he might believe it yes kindle shook his head shit he said finally i didnt sign on to be anybodys husband and i sure as hell didnt sign on to be a goddamn parent come eight oclock joey established contact with the community of survivors in toronto the weather was bad and the signal was poor voices faded in ghostly fashion but the contact across all that distance was heartening everybody gathered around the microphone and sang adeste fidelisthey had rehearsed thisand the canadians sang silent night through the static it was snowing there the canadian radioman said the streets were kneedeep and the municipal plows werent out this year the survivors were partying in a downtown hotel lots of rooms and an emergency generator in the basement were cozy the canadian chorus was bigger than buchanans perhaps eighty people almost as large as the nearly one hundred in the boston community joey had contacted a few days ago which meant matt knew there must be more such groups but only a few of them had thought to attempt radio communication toronto said merry christmas and signed off joey tried for boston and a third contact in duluth but the weather wasnt cooperatingthe skip isnt in joey said we could phone em kindle said guy in boston gave me his telephone number but the longdistance exchanges were unreliable these days and anyway a phone call wasnt the same as radio contact they could wait until tomorrow to pass on christmas sentiments telephone service wont last the winter jacopetti predicted wires go down relay towers i doubt anybodyll fix em joey went on dxing kindle said joey had twice made brief contacts with other continentsa ham in costa rica and on one memorable clear night a voice speaking what joey said was russian but might have been polish or ukrainian the signal faded before he could respond beth porter in a gesture that took matt by surprise had brought along a vcr and two tapes from the big video store on ocean avenue white christmas and its a wonderful life because i used to watch those movies every year you know i just thought it would be nice joey took time away from the radio to hook up the tape machine kindle freshened the punch and miriam flett in another surprise move volunteered to make popcorn somewhere between bing crosby and jimmy stewart matt thought my god there are only ten of us but this might work this might still work this might still be a town sometime after midnight the rain turned to sleet and the roads began to ice its a wonderful life cranked to an end and in the silence that followed without warning paul jacopetti began to weepracking sobs that shook his large body like seizures beth retrieved her videotape jeez im sorry maybe that was the wrong thing to show it was fine matt told her dont apologize but the party was over kindle offered bedroll space to anyone who wanted to stay the night tim belanger had confined his drinking to diet pepsi and offered a drive to those who hadnt he left with bob ganish and the stillteary paul jacopetti joey was still working the transceiver beth told him a couple of times she wanted to go home she was tired the streets werent getting any safer just wait joey said turning the dial with a relentlessness that looked nearly compulsive to matt kindle said beth could take one of the spare rooms if she didnt mind sleeping on the floor but she shook her head and pursed her lips i want to go home i can drop you off matt said if its okay with joey joey shrugged his back turned another voice crackled from the radio speaker read you joseph signals faint its that colonel tyler kindle said i swear that son of a bitch never sleeps tyler matt said hes the guy down south he moves around loner type kindle escorted matt to the door out of joeys earshot you should talk to him some night when the signals less feeble joey thinks the guy is hot shit you dont well its too soon to be choosy about the friends we make right but tylers full of all kinds of ideas he says we should form a defense committee or something says hes seen some mayhem out on the road a lot of peculiar people turned down contact he says he keeps talking about some big project out in colorado hes heard about matt he claims the aliens are building a spaceship out there is that possible i guess its possible i suspended judgment last august you dont believe him oh i believe him i guess kindle rubbed his chin i believe him all right i just dont you know trust him hes in no position to do us harm not at the moment kindle said beth huddled into the passenger seat matt asked her to fasten her seat belt the roads were slick with sheet ice and it was easy to imagine his little import sliding into a ditch beth strapped herself in and gazed through the window at dark suburban houses he signalled a left turn on marina crossing town to beths house but she touched his arm no keep going i dont live there anymore he frowned but crossed the intersection moved out from your family it never was much of a family dr wheeler mainly just my dad and hesyou know changed i guess its hard to talk to him it used to be hard now he wants to talkbut its worse in a way i think part of the deal is that if you want to live forever you have to understand what a shit you were in real life he figures he kicked me around too much and he doesnt know what to do about it he wants to apologize or make it better somehow you dont want that she shook her head fiercely im not ready for that christ no its hard even being around him since he changed he even looks different now you remember how big he used to be now hes almost skinny none of his clothes fit he looks she chose a word empty she used the nail of her right index finger to draw an oval in the fog on the passenger window she gave it eyes eyelashes a pursed mouth a selfportrait matt thought so im staying at the crown motel the one by the waterfront past the ferry dock matt turned right at the next intersection toward a blankness of fog and rain the ocean you could have done better than a motel look at tom kindle the room is big enough it has a kitchenette so i can cook i get along the rain turned icy again clattering against the roof of the car matt eased past the sign that said crown motor inn the car fishtailing on a slick of ice he realized he hadnt seen a single other vehicle during this drive from tom kindles houseno traffic of any kind a light was burning in beths room she left it on she said so she could find the door at night it gets lonely in this big parking lot she cocked her head at him you want to see the place the roads arent getting any better beth you could walk me to the door at least he agreed though it seemed somehow careless to leave the dry enclosure of the car beth had appropriated a groundfloor room the number on the door was the door wasnt locked it opened into yellow light just take a look beth said tell me its a nice place god it would be nice to have somebody tell me that he stepped inside the room was hot the thermostat was turned up she had decorated this ordinary suite with cheap art printspastel watercolors kittens and farmhouses a quilt obviously homemade had been thrown across the bed she followed his look its the only thing i took with me when i left home i slept under this quilt since i was little my grandmother made it she sat on the bed and stroked the quilt with one hand do i have to call you dr wheeler everybody at the party called you matt you can call me matt matt you can stay here tonight if you want some part of him had expected the offer some part of him was surprised even shocked because of the weather beth said the weather being so shitty and all she began unbuttoning her shirt i hardly see joey anymore he just plays with that fucking radio over at kindles it wouldnt be so badi mean joeys hardly a prizebut he was the only person who ever i mean he used to say i was pretty she paused to gauge his reaction nobody else ever said that she slid out of the shirt her skin was perfect blemishless flushed pink her breasts were small the nipples almost childlike there was a line of freckles across her breastbone why couldnt he say anything he felt as if his mouth had been disconnected from his body he was mute worthless said the small blue letters on her shoulder im twenty years old beth said i guess youve seen me naked since i was ten you never said if you thought i was pretty i guess doctors dont say things like that matt matthew mattdo you think im pretty beth i cant stay here she unzipped her jeans and stepped out of them then sat back on the bed she frowned then she folded her hands in her lap in a gesture that was oddly shy i dont know why i do this shit she looked imploringly at him its hard being alone all the time the town is empty its not just that no one comes out on the streeti think people are actually missing and i dont know what happened to them and i lie here and i think about that and its just so fucking scary sad and scary and i would like not to be alone but you cant stay im sorry is it as easy as that its not easy it wasnt she was twenty years younger than matt but he wasnt old and she wasnt a child and the sight of her was deeply arousing he hadnt shared his bed with anyone since that august night with annie gates and beth was right about the town matt thought it was empty and it was scary and the touch of another human being would be a powerful magic on a bitter winter night but she was vulnerable and too needy and it was an act that might have unforeseen consequences she managed a small embarrassed smile telling the truth she looked him over perhaps noticed the obvious bulge in his blue jeans i guess youre telling the truth you want to stay but you think if you stay it might be dangerous can i use that word he managed a nod hey she said im dangerous she stretched out across the bed in a motion that was both sensual and weary maybe i had too much to drink maybe we all did or maybe im a roundheeled little cunt as my daddy used to say he drove home on ice through ice a night all ice and darkness the house was dark when he arrived the baseboard heaters stuttered and creaked rachel wasnt home he hoped she was sleeping in a warm place this christmas eve but it wasnt christmas eve anymore matt realized it had been december since midnight since before he left the party it was christmas morning by christmas noon most of the ice had melted from the streets matt drove to the city hall turnaround and confronted the helper a second time he wore his winter coat and a scarf celeste had knitted for him in a time so remote it seemed like prehistory blades of grass stiff with frost crackled under his feet he stood close to the helperclose enough to touch it rachel had said the thing could speak but where was its mouth could it see him did it have eyes did it know he was here he supposed it did he began by cursing it he called it a fucking intruder a monster a stony heartless motherfucking monument to all the needless cruelty that had been visited on the earth he had to restrain himself from striking it because he sensed its invulnerability knew how easy it would be to beat his hands bloody on that unyielding surface he cursed it until there was nothing left in him but speechless hatred the silence after that was almost shocking he waited until his voice came backhe had worn it raw tell me he whispered tell me what you know tell me what we have to do to survive he took a quick step backwardsurprised in spite of himselfwhen the helper opened its eyes or what seemed to be eyes twin patches of sleeker blackness on the black orb of its head weirdly mobile like two slick dots of oil and it spokea voice deeply resonant somehow artificial completely terrifying this is not a safe place any longer it said chapter skin it was good at first cruising through these southern towns drowsy little november towns in virginia north carolina parts of kentucky and tennessee the towns were much alike each had its church its central school its highway malland each town had its helper nested at the center of it like a worm burrowed into an apple john tyler personally destroyed several of these devices and his friend aw murdoch dispatched more murdoch was a surer hand at the tow much as tyler disliked to admit it we each have our talents he told himself and murdoch was an excellent shooter at first they took elaborate precautions tyler thought the m was too obvious a vehicle to conceal it they navigated the highways in a stolen eighteenwheel a p truck with the hummer and its tow platform parked in the rear murdoch argued that this was a simpleminded piece of sleightofhand not likely to fool anyone the artifact was probably as effective a surveillance tool as the average military satellite and the contactees were an unlimited source of information on the ground sir murdoch said if they want to get us face it they can get uswere mostly counting on their pacifism tyler yielded to the argument after a week or so they abandoned the container truck and simply drove the hummer from place to place along highways and secondary roads that were generally empty following a route tyler hoped would seem random but that tended to the south tyler had not been warned about the weather but he had already noticed an odd restlessness of wind and rain he thought theyd be safer wintering below the snowbelt all this plus his friendship with murdoch served to keep despair comfortably distant at least for a time tylers first warning that things had changed came in a little georgia town called loftus they had driven through dozens of towns like it these little towns seemed emptier as the days passed tyler thought one seldom saw the populace either they had gone elsewhere or were locked indoors only a few lights came on at night it was disturbing it was even if you let yourself dwell on it frightening but at the same time it made travelling easier they spent nights in deserted motels they drove freely in the daylight they arrived in loftus at noon these buildings the threestory hotel and restaurant the barber shop bedecked with wildroot cream oil stickers had probably not changed in any important way since the korean war there was a helper of course it stood on a traffic island where the highway passed between a hardware store and a yellowbrick kresges murdoch fired the tow and tyler watched what he had come to think of as the customary fireworks an explosion that shattered windows on all sides and left the road littered with glass and black dust murdoch drove on through loftus in moody silence murdoch had been moody since they left dc but hadnt wanted to talk about it tyler mentioned that they would need to locate another source of missiles before too long the munitions they had carried from virginia were about to run out if theres any point to it murdoch said were pissing in the ocean if you ask me tyler gave him a hard look murdochs uniform was ragged oilspotted and torn from working on the hummer he wore a jacket he had stolen from a retail shop in an empty mall his hair was long and matted theres more of these helpers than we can ever hope to shoot murdoch added and i dont see any evidence were doing any real harmand shit colonel maybe thats as it should be i dont understand tyler said dont you are you sure after contact i figured everybody was turned into zombies it was like a horror movie invasion of the body snatchers i just wanted to kick some ass show somebody the human race wasnt that easy to knock over you know what i mean certainly but it isnt like that fuck i knew all along it wasnt like that murdoch kept one hand on the wheel and used the other to unscrew the lid from the coffee thermos didnt want to admit it he took a long swallow but maybe they arent getting such a bad shakeall those zombies life eternal not such a shitty deal christ murdoch tyler said after all our work you cant tell me you believe that dont you i mean down where it counts when they came to you that night didnt some part of you want to go along even if you said no some part of you thought shit i dont want to live and die and never understand what its all about wasnt it like that stupid question seriously he startled tyler by stopping the vehicle standing on the brake until they were poised motionless on the white line of this country road cutting all the crap murdoch said tyler just stared what do you think wed find murdoch pressed if we turned around and drove back into that little pissant town some evidence of our ability to harass an enemy were you asleep when you fired that tow so we knocked down one of their ducks im sorry colonel but big fucking deal how long till they send another helper they can have another unit there in a couple of days probably hours theyre that efficient the more i think about this the more pointless it seems the only reason we get away with it is that they dont care were like fleas on an elephant too insignificant even to scratch he jerked the hummer into a uturn tyler said you really mean to go back there we need supplies we should have stopped before we fired that missile plus id like to see just how long it really does take to repair the kind of damage weve been doing think of it as target assessment he gave tyler another long look if you dont mind colonel tyler minded a great deal but he didnt say so it might be dangerous to linger at the site of an attack but it might be more dangerous still to override murdoch when the younger man was in this hostile mood everything since contact had become a matter of balances tyler thought one thing weighed against another what was buoyant might suddenly sink what fell might rise they parked the hummer out of sight tylers precautionin the service bay of an exxon station because murdoch intended to stay the night in this village they located two adjoining rooms in the brick hotel overlooking the remains of the helper the hotel was empty the afternoon sky was dark and the corridors rattled with the sound of distant thunder murdoch left to scrounge for food tyler stayed in his room dwelling on the problem of the younger mans doubts maybe he should have seen this coming murdoch had been a technician in his old life more loyal to the weapons he maintained than to the abstractions they servedthe country the corps the national defense it was a thin reed to cling to and lately murdoch had grown sullen the decline had been gradual but marked maybe it was predictable all the standards had fallen tyler thought there was no propriety anymore no decency the norms had become fluid it was a frightening thought tyler had spent a lifetime negotiating the borderline between sanity and compulsion and he had learned what sissy in her madness had forgotten appearances matter in the question of sanity you were allowed to pretend you were supposed to pretend everyone pretended we prove were sane by pretending to be sane to fail at the pretense or not to bother was the definition of insanity but now it was as if gravity had failed as if every solid thing had come unhooked from the earth in an empty world who was to judge where were the boundaries to separate one thought from another what impulse might surface unobserved how to distinguish the daylight from the dark were naked in this place tyler thought and god help us for that he dozed for a time on the hotel bedspread and woke with a skullsplitting headache murdoch came in the door with bags of canned food and bottled water he dumped these on the bureau and took a towel from the bathroomhe was wet his hair streaming water it had begun to rain its funny murdoch said most of the towns weve been through you see at least a couple of people this placeid swear its deserted didnt see a living soul out there for a while i thought i heard music but i couldnt track it downnot in this weather murdoch toweled his hair vigorously the window was open a notch and the room smelled moist and cool murdoch gave him an odd cautious look by the way colonel have you seen the helper tyler came alert what about it well its doing something murdoch said we destroyed itwhat could it be doing well sir its more or less putting itself back together aw murdoch followed tyler down to the lobby where the colonel stood rigidly at the shattered front window and stared across the road at the remains of the helper at all that black sooty dust that had begun to move as if stirred by an imperceptible wind to heap itself into a crude wet mound where the helper had been murdoch hadnt been too surprised to see the helper putting itself together all the traveller technology seemed to use subordinate but independent partsthe octahedrons which were part of the artifact the helpers which were smaller fractions of the octahedrons and all this impact dust which was just the smaller constituents of the helper he guessed mobile and smart enough to crawl back into the original order or the microbes that had infected everybody come to that murdoch supposed those were machines too tiny but intelligent there must be some irreducible levela disorganization from which a helper for instance couldnt recoverbut they hadnt achieved that with a simple tow murdoch thought its like punching mud we should have known but tyler hadnt known and tyler was plainly horrified he stood at the frame of the broken window shaking his head murdoch approached the older man cautiously colonel is it a threat tyler said are we in danger from it maybe we ought to move on i dont imagine so i dont think we really damaged it i doubt we even annoyed it if these things carried a grudge wed be dead by now he felt a little guilty for breaking this news to tyler in such an abrupt way he felt he should make up for it sir we might as well go upstairs youre getting all wet cook us some food up there i got some coors from the grocery when tyler decided to leave dc they had assembled a kit that included a hot plate pots and pans plastic cutlery upstairs murdoch plugged in the hot plate and started frying eggs the hotel room filled with the smell of hot butter tyler cracked open a beer and stared out the window his manner murdoch thought was frankly a little crazed murdoch had decided weeks ago that colonel tyler might not be firing on all cylinders but so what who was maybe all the sane people accepted that nighttime offer last august maybe only a pair of lunatics would be driving around the country taking shots at these machines like two kids soaping windows on halloween he came to understand that tyler lived in a world of orders given rules obeyed limits respecteda world as fragile as the egg murdoch had just cracked and as hard to repair naturally tyler was finding it hard to adjust my father only gave me one piece of advice in his life murdoch said and that was to play the hand they deal you i think he got it from a song or dear abby but you cant argue with it right colonel we got a shitty hand here but were not dead yet tyler looked away from the window you never talked about your father much mr murdoch not much to say what did he do for a living raised sinsemilla up in mendocino county to tylers uncomprehending look murdoch added he grew marijuana christ really honest to god he was a drug dealer wellmore like a bootlegger that was the spirit of the enterprise tyler absorbed this information he must have hated it when you joined the marines i cant say it pleased him but he told me it was my life i should make my own mistakes when i got on the bus at ukiah he said try not to shoot anybody and i never really did murdoch thoughtunless you count the helpers even then he hadnt done them much harm apparently tyler shook his head its always a surprise peoples families you dont talk about your own family much no tyler said i dont murdoch let it drop he served the eggs but tyler put his plate aside sir murdoch said speaking frankly are you all right the colonel who had been sitting stoopshouldered in the chair by the window drew himself up almost into a sitting brace his chin tucked frowning as if the question had stung him of course i am and they ate in silence and listened to the hiss of the rain on the window murdoch told the colonel he thought they should stay in loftus until the cold rain passed and tyler had surprised him by agreeing it seemed to murdoch that the colonel had grown both very unhappy and very agreeable recently privately murdoch was curious about this little town there were some questions that had piqued his interest during this shootinggallery trek across the south and he hoped to find some answers here for instance exactly what was happening to the people in these little road towns where were they going they werent on the highway for sure the highways were deserted but soincreasingly oftenwere the towns tyler disliked these questions and refused to discuss them but murdoch was simply curious in the morning he left the morose colonel and wandered out into the street the rain had eased but the sky was dark and restless with cloud while he was asleep the helper had achieved a blurry approximation of itself minute grains of black dust moved over its surface giving it the look of something swarmed by insects it was as strange as anything murdoch had recently seen but he was growing accustomed to miracles he watched for a moment then shrugged and turned away from all these shattered storefront windows yesterday there had been music hed heard it while he was scrounging for food at a grocery store a couple of blocks from here the music had come very faintly through the rain and murdoch guessed it might have been imaginary the kind of thing you hear when youre alone in a strange place in a storm but he remembered it as music faint but unmistakable today he stood still and listened there was a faraway bark of a dog a few wind sounds the grit under his shoes as he shifted back and forth no music spooky he turned a corner away from the main street he had decided that today he would find somebodya human being or a contactee it didnt matter murdoch just wanted to look at a new face ask some questions the name of this little street posted on a rusty sign at the intersection was elm every one of these towns had an elm or an oak or maybe a peach or a magnolia as they pressed on into georgia what better place to find out what had happened to everybody everybody lived on elm he decided to knock on the door of the first house he came to the first house on elm was a little bungalow with a tiny front yard it had a wooden porch and on the banister five terracotta pots of dead flowers murdoch stepped up onto the sagging porch and nudged aside a childs red wagon he pushed the doorbell and listened as the buzzer rang inside nothing stirred he opened the screen and knocked at the door the sound of his knock seemed to make the silence heavier hey he said hey anybody in there this was a strange thing to be doing and he was suddenly aware of himselfa lonely figure thin in his ragged uniform his hair grown long and his stubble unshaven christ he thought i must look like a scarecrow what if somebody did open the door one look at me and theyd close it in a hurry but no one answered his knock he tried the knob the door was locked he looked up and down the street hed never broken into a house before well fuck it he said to himself im coming in there heads up you ghosts he put his shoulder against the door and pushed the door was old and wood rot had gotten into the framing of it the latch sheered out of the molding with a creak and a snap murdoch peered into the inner darkness who had lived here somebody with kids judging by that wagon the room inside now dimly visible in the watery daylight was dusty but reasonably tidy a brickred sofa stood against one wall above it hung a framed oil color of a woodland sunset there was a tv set a stereo an empty fish tank some kids toys were scattered on the floor also on the floor murdoch stared at it a long time before he recognized it for what it was a human skin after he vomited over the porch railing murdoch selected a long willow branch from among the windfall on the neighbors lawn he was reassured somewhat by the weight of the stick in his hand he was otherwise unarmedbut what was there to shoot at all up and down this rainy street nothing moved murdoch clutched the stick and forced himself to climb the three steps up to the porch to cross the intervening space to the door open it step once again into that terrifying dimness the skin lay at his feet it hadnt moved but it was definitely a skin fragile emptyalmost transparent but human murdoch thought its shape was difficult to discern it was folded into itself accordioned together but one arm projected a fragile white papyrus with a hand like an empty glove and five delicate pale fingers it reminded murdoch of a discarded skin of a spider he had once found in an empty lockerspidershaped but so delicate that a breath would carry it away he lowered the willow branch until it was almost touching the empty human skin then pulled it back revulsion winning out over curiosity he stepped over the hideous thing and deeper into the house the house was a bungalow with only a few rooms this living room the kitchen two bedrooms a bath murdoch investigated them all flicking on lights where the daylight didnt reach he found two more skins one in the kitchen onesmaller which made it somehow more horriblein the childs bedroom leaving that room he felt dizzy and realized hed been holding his breath as if something in the house might infect him might suck away his substance might drain him as thoroughly as these people had been drained of themselves he hurried to the door but stopped there he turned back he took a firm grip on the willow stick and held it with its narrow end pointed at the first of the skins the urge to poke at the thing was as strong as the urge to turn and run there was something childish about this murdoch thought he was like a little child poking at a rattlesnakes shed skin he dreaded it but he couldnt help wondering about it would it crumble or would it fold if it broke at his touch would it make a sound would it move in leathery fashion like parchment or would it rattle like sunbleached cellophane he touched the skin with his stick in fact it made only the faintest noise as he turned it a whisper of membranous surfaces like the murmur of leaves in an autumn tree or the turning of a page in an old dry book murdoch thought he might vomit again he turned and stumbled to the porch railing that was when he saw the girl you dont look so good she said murdoch didnt think he could stand much more startlement one more shock and his ventricles might explode he looked up from the railing with a terrible emasculating dread but it was only a girl standing on the sidewalk with a frown of concern a local girl judging by her accent she wore a toobig mans windbreaker over a yellow tshirt her blue jeans were tight and she had sneakers on her feet murdoch pegged her at about eighteen but she might have been younger or older her head was cocked and she was studying him with patient sympathy you found those skins in the house huh first time you seen one she was pretty in a stringyhaired kind of way her face was a perfect oval and her eyes were intelligent murdoch tried to reassemble some masculine composure first time he admitted christ youve seen them before yup scary as hell she shrugged the nausea had passed murdoch straightened and undamped his hands from the railing you uh live here nonot this house thiss where the bogens used to live she pointed i used to live a couple doors down but i moved out of there guess where i live now he felt like saying girl there are three dead people in this buildingnothing left but their packaging under the circumstances maybe a guessing game kind of verged on bad taste but here was a new face which was what hed set out to find and he didnt want to chase her away i cant guess the roxy she said the roxy a theater did this town have a roxy theater was there an old trestle town like this that didnt i turned the managers office into kind of an apartment she said and i taught myself how to run the movies he said you were running a movie last night last night when it was raining she brightened howd you know heard the music it was nd streetthere was an oldmovie festival playing when contact came those are the only films i can find i got nd street and golddiggers of and the maltese falconi dont play em much its pretty hard work by yourself and if you see em too often whats the point but on a cold night like that i understand murdoch said already i could sing that nd street song in my sleep uhhuh hey whats your name soo she said two ohs its not short for anything soo constantine im aw murdoch whats the a for aw abel he lied mmm i like aw better so do i soo tell meare there more of those uh those skins are there more of those skins around most every house she said if you look i hope youre not planning to look no i just well christ it took me by surprise i mean is everybody in town like that nearly cept me well what happened to them do you know they left a w she said flatly they went away but not their skins they just used up their bodies and they left their skins behind a radio colonel tyler said maybe thats something we ought to have murdoch cooking dinner over the hot plate wondered what this might portend sir a radio to contact other people other human beings tyler sat in the hotel chair where murdoch had left him this morning he hadnt shaved which for the colonel was a serious omission murdoch had pegged tyler for the kind of man whod shave in a hurricane and stock the storm cellar with aqua velva i think we need that contact dont you mr murdoch sir how many of those coors have you been into tyler looked at the can in his hand then set it aside what are you suggesting nothing tm not drunk no sir maybe you should have a drink yourself later sir thanks murdoch served out equal portions of canned corned beef hash tyler liked canned corned beef hash but murdoch thought it resembled dog food too closely it was like ladling out hot alpo shitty weather sir the rain had returned with a vengeance there was occasional sheet lightning and a muted continuous thunder tyler accepted his bowl of hash and held it in his lap were nothing without a community mr murdoch no sir a community defines the perimeters of behavior the way a border defines the perimeters of a nation mmhm alpo or not murdoch was hungry tonight he sat opposite the colonel and gazed past him at the window nighttime now night came early these days tyler was frowning skins you say yes sir murdoch had told the colonel about the skins hed found hed kept quiet about soo constantine however murdoch couldnt explain his reticence even to himself but it seemed better that way soo was a new and particular discovery his own just their vacant their empty skins sir yes horrible murdoch nodded what do you suppose happened to their insides mr murdoch i think soo had told him this best be cautious its possible they just kind of faded disappeared from the inside out didnt you get that hint in contact sir that it would be possible to leave the body behind i never thoughtnot like a lizard shedding its scales no i wouldnt have expected anything that repellent the colonel took a halfhearted spoonful of the hash and the helper nearly assembled i would prefer not to linger in this town mr murdoch sir the weather you were never scared of rain before we came to loftus its a cold dirty rain some of these mountain roads could wash out we can deal with that yes sir id just prefer to deal with it when it isnt storming tyler showed him a baleful look something in this town attracts you shit no sir but murdoch felt himself begin to sweat community tyler said a human presence sir was the son of a bitch psychic we need a radio for the sake of community mr murdoch maybe we can be more effective in numbers than we are individually between the two of us frankly there isnt much in the way of discipline we say the words but its reflex you dont respect me as a superior officer murdoch was startled that isnt its not your fault on the road were simply two men all the structure has fallen away i should have understood that when i talked to the president he was in lafayette park mr murdoch with his shirt undone at the collar the center cannot holdisnt that what the poet said mere anarchy is loosed upon the world anarchy is without structure it flows like water mr murdoch do you suppose weve lost structure entirely has it gone that far iwouldnt know if there were more of us tyler said yes sir its as if we left our own skins behind our skins of propriety our skins of good conduct suddenly were raw our nerves are exposed were naked with the right provocation we could say or do anything yes sir murdoch said realizing as he spoke that his friendship with colonel tyler had also peeled away that the skin of amicability had been shed in this room and the thing beneath exposed a queasy mutual fear after dinner he left the colonel and hurried into the dark street he was meeting soo at the roxy and he was already late according to the digital watch on his wrist since contact murdoch had kept two watches one on his wrist one in his pocket so when he replaced the battery in one watch he could set it by the other the roxy was easy to find it was one more peeling main street movie theater its blank marquee shedding rainwater in cold sheets murdoch hurried past the empty ticket box inside to the lobby where soo had turned on the lights she was waiting for him still wearing her yellow tshirt one hand cocked on her hip standing in the doorway of the auditorium murdoch looked at her and felt weak all over probably it was only the effect of a long separation from female company what it felt like was highoctane kneebuckling adolescent lust she was a compact package of curves and smiles and he wanted to pick her up in his arms and feel her weight soo he thought some kind of weird southern name for a young girl he said it twice to himself lord murdoch thought take pity on a soldier you shaved she said he nodded blushing theres no more candy at the popcorn stand she said but i got some cokes in a cooler the movies ready to go its nd streetwe can watch it from the projection room come on aw speechless he followed her upstairs between reels she talked about herself while murdoch listening writhed in a fever of hormonal suspense he watched the words come out of her mouththe way her lips moved when she talked i wasnt born here i was born in a town two counties east town of tucum wash if you call it a town really a gas station and a post office they bused us thirtyfive miles to school every day well i hated that place its a common story i guess everybody hates their hometownespecially if they come from a little wideplaceintheroad like tucum wash so when i graduated high school i came here looking for work to loftus yeah i see you smiling bright lights big city right i guess you must have seen all kinds of places but ill tell you aw i never wanted much more than loftus loftus isnt bad i worked at the k mart checkout and two nights a week at the sandwich castle in the mall its actually an okay kind of life i kept myself in tv dinners and i had some fun had a boyfriend dean earl was his name oh hes goneyou dont have to look so long in the face dean didnt mean that much to me except every friday night or sometimes saturday wed come here to the roxy i love movies i wont watch em on video like watching a postage stamp plus it dont smell right you know what i mean you ever smell a theater people think oh popcorn but it isnt the popcorn in summer its that airconditioning down the back of your neck smells like cold metal and the smell of sweaty people comin in with their jackets over their shoulders and mopping their faces with handkerchiefs waitin for that chill to shiver up their spine and when everybodys cool the lights go off and the movie starts course i cant make it be like that but when folks started leaving you know leaving i couldnt help but think of the roxy and how nice it would be to come here all by myself and i did maybe you think im crazy but its nice here its not the same but it reminds me of the old days well maybe i am crazy aw let me work this machine your hands are cold youre still wet from the rain arent you shivering like a pup you want dry clothes you know i thought you might get wet i picked up some clothes at the k mart after we met this morning clothes about your size bet that aw comes out in the rain i thought he looks like hed come out in the rain take that shirt off your shirt wellmine too if you like later murdoch felt obliged to tell her about himself they shared a mattress on the floor of what used to be the office of the manager of the roxy theater she was naked in the faint light sitting crosslegged in a curl of woolen blankets murdoch was full of quiet wonder at the sight of her five minutes ago theyd been joined in a passion so intense that murdoch thought they might penetrate each others skins occupy each others space now she was sitting apart from him a little aloof but smiling in a blur of light from a high window where the rain washed the dusty glass it was after midnight by the watch on murdochs wrist he felt a need to justify himself so he told her about growing up in ukiah leaving home enlisting discovering his aptitude for machines how he had learned the tolerances and mannerisms of small arms their maintenance and renewal their weaknesses and strengths a weapon was a complex environment in which a small eventthe squeezing of a trigger sayled to vastly larger consequences the discharge of a bullet the death of a man the winning or the losing of a war but only if everything was in balance only if the weapon was correctly toleranced unworn clean and dry here oiled there it captured his imagination in a world murdoch often found confusing here was a map he knew how to read soo listened attentively but began to frown and he hurried to change the subject then came contact you know and then i met colonel tyler and we started this little crosscountry turkey shoot turkey shoot well you saw the helperwhat happened to it uhhuh big mess frankly took out the window at the fiveanddime and the rain came in and mint the magazine rack you guys do that a lot he wasnt sure whether he ought to boast or confess maybe twenty times twenty different towns since october isnt it dangerous the helpers dont fight back they dont have to murdoch thought i mean dangerous for regular people like civilians we havent killed anybody so far she nibbled her thumb i dont want to hurt your feelings aw but it seems kind of pointless like the helpers almost back together again we only just found out they can do that but is it sensible you mean soo i dont know colonel tyler thinks so the taste of her skin her lips was still in his mouth murdoch thought we smell like each other going to do it some more the tow shoots he shrugged maybe i wont colonel tyler i cant speak for him sometimes i think what hes maybe not the worlds most stable individual you didnt look that stable yourself this morning her smile was mischievous he shook his head at the memory well christ skins come on its not so terrible he looked at her sidelong you said those people what faded away kind of you know aw it was something they decided to do its how they wanted it maybe in some other town more people stayed in their flesh around herei guess it sounds stupid but there isnt that much to do you remember contact travellers said in time people might not want the flesh well thats all this is mrs corvallis she used to run the hair salon she rented me a basement roomi watched her go we were friends i sat with her a lot toward the end she was justi dont know how to describe itvery pale you could tell she was going she was like china like porcelain almost shiny light as a bag of feathers the travellers were holding her together until the end aw you know what they call neocytes he nodded hed heard the word from a medic at quantico shortly after contact well the neocytes kept her together until she was living mainly on the other side hardly here at all then one morning i knocked on her door and nobody answered and when i went in her skin was there all empty it wasnt so bad she was happy about it but murdoch couldnt suppress a shudder it was her choiceyou honestly think so i know it horrible murdoch said aw whats the alternative when you die you know you leave your skin behind too and considerably more than that it gets buried in the ground and rots this was cleanerand it wasnt death she was still smiling but gently almost absently what was contact like for you same as for everybody he murmuredsoftly because a terrible suspicion had touched him and lingered a moment before he could dismiss it no she said for you i really want to know the travellers came that night in august and they made an offer what else is there to say you turned them down obviously any particular reason i thinkno its stupid she focused her large eyes on him tell me aw when we moved from l a up to mendocino county i used to follow my father around those woods big pacific woods i was nine or ten years old and it scared the shit out of meredwoods helicopters but not just that it was the bigness of everything i got lost once only for maybe half an hour i sat under a tree until my old man found me but i couldnt help thinking about the woods rolling on for miles all the way to the sea the sea big enough to cover up every place id ever lived and everyone i knew and a sky big enough to drown the seashit does this make any sense soo nodded gravely murdoch was embarrassed but he went on talking almost in spite of himself i dont think i trusted anything after that unless i could hold it in my hand or take it apart contact sounded real good you know in its own way im not ashamed to admit that but it was like being out in those woods again everything was so there wasnt a word for this feeling big so you said no murdoch nodded awdid you ever regret it you mean would i do it the same way over again i dont know he thought of the skins it still scares the shit out of me frankly maybe if there was somebody with you he looked at soo a long time in the dim light but thats not possible i think it might be they saidthe travellers saidsoo the neocytes arent inside me anymore aw if you want a second chance i think it could be arranged he backed away across the sheets how would you know that i mean how would you know she looked deeply worried is it possible to fall in love with someone in less than a day it wouldnt surprise me because i think i did stupid me she sighed no they arent inside you but they can be if you want them it would be as easy as a touch aw a kiss if you want them its not too late murdoch couldnt think clearly he grabbed his pants and pulled them on backed against a wall and stared at her he summoned words and the words spilled out i thought you were human oh god i am i just wanted to stay this way a while longer its a choice aw it really is i like my skin theres skin in the new life too i mean its not just angels floatin around heaven but i wanted to have my earth skin and be in loftus a while longer she hung her head she looked weirdly penitent like a little girl caught stealing cookies i should have told you he thought of what hed seen this morning dry parchment in the shape of an arm a hand fingertips he looked at soo this skin hed just touched he imagined it empty and dropping like isinglass perhaps blowing down the street in a strong wind god help me murdoch thought i held her in my arms and all along all along she had been one of them one of them under her skin aw she said please dont leave please ill explain the monster wanted to explain murdoch shook his head and ran for the door he left most of his uniform behind he didnt want his uniform there were other clothes he wanted this cold rain to wash him he wanted it to wash him clean john tyler placed his service revolver on the desk opposite the bed where he could see it he was reassured by the sight of the weapon it was substantial and weighty it was like an investment tyler thought something withheld until its value increased he was thinking about loyalty loyalty was the fundamental thing tyler thought loyalty was normalcy reduced to its essentials loyalty allowed no room to maneuver loyalty was precise he had begun to entertain doubts about murdochs loyalty tyler was sitting at the rainswept window watching the dark main street of loftus when murdoch came stumbling back to the hotel murdoch was a ludicrous sight naked above the waist and barefoot mincing over patches of broken glass in the midnight rain it might have been funny except for its implications about what murdoch had said and refrained from saying implications about this town and about murdochs loyalty to tyler he listened through the wall as murdoch let himself into the adjoining room there wasnt much to hear the shower ran for a long time before the room grew quiet again tyler eased back into his chair he had been without sleep for two days and he hadnt left this room since murdoch took him down to see the helper rebuilding itself this was his madness come back again tyler recognized but he had forgotten that madness was also clarity madness was the ability to see things as they really were to make decisions he might not otherwise be capable of making he could even admit that this might be a form of sissys madness a madness he had inherited sissy had heard voices tonight tyler heard a crowded confusion of voices hovering on the edge of intelligibility and if he listened closely he thought the sound might resolve into words the same words perhaps that had frightened and exalted his mother but tyler wasnt interested in voices they were what the doctors called an epiphenomenon a secondary symptom like the curious sterility of the yellow light radiating from the rooms electric bulbs or the sour odor of stale tobacco smoke that had begun to seep from every surface perhaps sissy could be deceived by such trivia tyler was different what interested him was the clarity the speed of his thoughts he was able to see the threads of significance that bound one event to another in a complex web of meaning it was both hideous and quite beautiful colonel tyler examined it turned it this way and that in his mind this glittering web as the hours marched toward daylight the rain had been falling now for fortyeight hours murdoch knocked on his door early the next morning tyler rose and walked to the door and opened it just as murdoch was preparing to knock a second time sir murdoch said ive reconsidered and i think you were right i think we should pull out of this town tyler surveyed the younger man you look shitty mr murdoch you look like you havent slept murdoch blinked no offense sir but youre no bed of roses yourself its still raining tyler said savoring this sir yes it is but you made a convincing case about navigating these mountain roads in the rain well as you yourself said sir we shouldnt be scared by a little rain i think no you were eloquent on the subject we have to be careful we cant phone if we slide off a mountainside its a new world mr murdoch yes sir murdoch said miserably but we can afford to stay another day murdoch seemed to surrender he bowed his head yes sir or longer sir depending on the weather tyler was buoyed by this small victory and in the afternoon he felt well enough to brave the rain he ducked across the street to a clothing store found a yellow rain slicker and wore it for protection as he explored the immediate neighborhood of the hotel the town was small and might not contain what he was looking for but then again it might he stalked the rainwashed streets of loftus with his gaze aimed at each shingled roof he passed he was scouting for an antenna some of these houses were equipped with ancient rooftop television antennas some had satellite dishes mounted on their lawns like enormous mushrooms most tyler presumed were wired for cable but it wasnt a tv antenna he was hunting for tyler walked on a strange figure in his yellow raincoat the only color and motion in these gray and empty streets by five oclock the light had nearly failed tyler was preparing to turn back when he looked east on one of these narrow residential streets and saw a tower silhouetted against the blueblack skya radio tower with a beam antenna mounted on it smiling to himself tyler hurried down the block to the pertinent house and kicked open the front door the lights blazed on at the touch of a switch it was amazing he thought and maybe it was more than amazing that the power hadnt failed in every one of these whistlestop towns theyd passed through the wall plates continued to offer volts of ac as reliably as evermaybe more reliably it was a mystery but tyler set it it aside for later pondering inside the house he found two of the skins murdoch had talked about he regarded these relics with a faint distaste probing them with his shoe the skins were dry and snaky and he understood murdochs alarm but they were harmless dead things too and tyler was able to ignore them in the basement he found what hed been looking for a small room decorated with qso cards and antique code keys and on a knotty pine desk a kenwood radio transceiver of recent vintage tyler switched on the machine to make sure it worked the faceplate lit up static whispered from the speaker who might be out there out there even now tyler thought voices buried in this whisper of noise maybe no one tyler thought or maybe a population of survivors one in ten thousand americans was still a large group of people such a population would know nothing about him none of them would know about stuttgart or any other of his long nights none of them would know he had held a gun on the president among such people he would have essentially no past he could be a new thing he could be what he looked like in a mirror he tuned the radio with scrupulous care he was disappointed by its silence but he persisted for hours until long after dark until he heard the faint sound of joey commoner talking to boston massachusetts when tyler analyzed the events that followed his verdict was i shouldnt have played with the pistol it was the pistol that made things go bad when he came back to the hotel he found murdoch frying hamburgers on the hot plate tyler wasnt hungry his headache had gotten worse after dinner murdoch hauled a case of beer into the room tyler matched him bottle for bottle it was a stupid thing to do under the circumstances the alcohol affected his judgment he talked long and volubly and perhaps not too coherently about the large things on his mind about loyalty and sanity in the end he told murdoch it comes down to obedience obedience and sanity are the same wordwouldnt you agree mr murdoch murdochwho had been nervous to begin with and seemed no better for his massive intake of coorslooked at tyler wearily tell the truth sir i have no idea what youre talking about thats a hell of an admission is it whats that supposed to mean now murdoch was angry its an insult right jesus i swear i dont understand you half the time you come on like a good old army boy half the time you sound like some faggot college professor i dont even know why we do this military routine aye sir colonel sir just because youre walking around like you have a ramrod up your ass salute me im wonderful well fuck it its not just stupid john its not even sane tyler was stung by the extremity of this epictetus he said murdoch exasperated what the discourses why then do you walk as if you had swallowed a ramrod epictetus he was a stoic an educated roman slave you shouldnt insult me mr murdoch all i meant but tylers attention had strayed to the pistol on the side table spontaneously in a motion that seemed to belong to his hands alone he picked the weapon up murdochs eyes widened it was an oldfashioned revolver tyler opened it to show murdoch the chamber empty he said then he took a single bullet from the tabletop displayed it between his right thumb and forefinger and placed it in the pistol or pretended to in fact he palmed the bullet but murdoch didnt see one round tyler said he spun the chamber without looking at it he raised the pistol to his own head the act was familiar but he had never performed it in the presence of another man it made him feel strange dizzy not altogether connected to murdoch or this room or the exterior world in general he looked steadily at murdoch as he pulled the trigger click he spun the chamber again thats the advantage i have over you you lame little fuck that im capable of this perhaps murdoch the weapons specialist was visualizing the internal working of the pistol the firing pin as it came down on empty airor not click i can do this without flinching now can you murdoch huddled away from the barrel of the pistol he looked pinned in his chair by an invisible wind his adams apple bobbed in his throat a motion tyler watched with fascination it looked like there was something inside him trying to get out something more substantial than a word christ murdoch said in a strangled voice please christ jesus dont this is why you call me sir you understand yes yes sir i doubt it click christ christ put the gun away jesus dont do this to me murdoch was rigid with terror his hands were clamped on the arms of the chair in the sterile light of the hotel room murdochs wristwatch was clearly visible tyler watched the numerals blink he counted thirty seconds then he lowered the pistol he looked at murdoch and smiled well leave in the morning he said murdoch opened his mouth but no sound came out tyler put the pistol back on the table maybe you should get your things together mr murdoch murdoch blinked until he realized he had been excused the ordeal was over then he stood up on shaky legs walked to the door turned and took a last bewildered look at tyler before he left and closed the door behind him tylers headache was much worse later it occurred to him to look for the bullet hed palmed but it wasnt beside the chair nor in his pocket nor on the tabletop finally he opened the pistol and found the bullet resting in the chamberexactly where he had led murdoch to believe it was which worried him a little it was a strange sort of mistake to have made murdoch lay awake for what remained of the night with the door of his hotel room locked and chainedeyes open because when he closed them he saw the barrel of tylers service revolver pointed at him or soo constantine pale and naked in a darkened room or an empty human skin littering the doorway of an old house dear god he thought what if tyler had shot him he wouldnt be a skin hed be a corpse a messier object as soo had pointed out shed talked about the missing people as if they had really gone somewhere had they true the travellers had promised that the memory of contact was vague in murdochs mind a dream that paled by daylight but he remembered the promise of a new kind of life both physical and bodiless an idea that had made sense somehow in the intensity of contact its not too late soo had said and why did the words linger on was he actually tempted by the offer was such a thing possible but thats terrible murdoch thought i dont want to be an empty skin on some empty street like a bottle somebody drained and threw away its something they choose no bullshit murdoch thought but she hadnt seemed like a liar he tried to imagine himself travelling on with tyler watching the old man sink into outright lunacy firing missiles at something anythingtrying to make sense of the world by dismantling it christ murdoch thought miserably i dont even know where i am i couldnt find this town on a map loftus where is it im lost murdoch thought rain tapped on the window he tossed and slept a little in the last hour before dawn tyler woke regretting the incident of the night before and tried to act as if it hadnt happened he knocked on murdochs door and asked for some help loading up the hummer murdoch noddedboth of them a little sheepish tyler thought in the sober light of morningand began to assemble the cooking gear they carried their personal items to the street around the corner to the exxon station where the hummer was parked under cover tyler arranged the baggage in the rear of the vehicle and made sure everything was strapped down murdoch looking baleful and confused watched from a few feet away then tyler took the passenger seat and waited for murdoch to climb in behind the wheel it was a conciliatory gesture giving murdoch the reins a small apology for the night before but murdoch didnt move sir he said i think i left something in the room tyler took a pair of sunglasses from his breast pocket and polished them on a handkerchief what sort of thing sergeant compass murdoch mumbled isnt that with the mess kit i thought i saw it there sir i dont think so he made no move to look the air in the garage was thick it smelled of gasoline and old solvents this is a dark place tyler thought an oppressive place it was a cheap compass he said we can find one like it anywhere its easier if i just go back sir back to the hotel room yes sir tyler understood the lie and the significance of the lie it made him feel enormously sadthis shabby little betrayal well tyler said youd better hurry then sergeant embarrassingly murdoch couldnt hide his relief yes sir ill be waiting yes sir colonel tyler watched his young blondhaired friend leave the exxon garage murdoch was haloed for a moment in the morning lightthe rain had finally stoppedthen he turned into the shadow of a taller building and was gone soo was in the managers office of the roxy only just awake wearing a gray sweatshirt that reached nearly to her knees she looked up as murdoch came through the door the room was different in the morning light murdoch thought sunlight came through the small high window the floorboards were lustrous and ancient the mattress looked disheveled as if the girl hadnt slept much herself soo he began you dont have to explain aw i understand she stood up i know why youre here its okay he was as scared as he had ever been more frightened than when tyler was pointing his pistol at him the impulse that had brought him here seemed reckless foolish she moved closer i dont know he said i mean im still not sure if i it doesnt hurt or anything thats what they tell you about vaccinations murdoch thought about dentists its just life she touched him she put her hands on his shoulders and tilted up her head a new kind of life and murdoch closed his eyes and kissed her he guessed the neocytes entered his body at that moment there was no sensation nothing more ominous than the touch of her lips it reassured him that she still smelled like soo still tasted like soo the fear began to subside she stepped back and smiled at him now we can be together aw together as long as we want he was about to frame a reply when three things happened almost simultaneously the door flew open striking murdoch across the ribs and throwing him aside and john tyler strode into the room his pistol at arms length and there was a sound like the snapping of an immense tree limb as tylers weapon kicked and soo constantines head shuddered in an explosion of blood and tissue tyler put three more shots into the girls prostrate body bang bang bang he felt the recoil in his arm and shoulder it felt good he had drawn the obvious inference from murdochs silences and night visits his hysteria and his quicksilver urges to leave or stay but look tyler wanted to say consider this evidence she can die after all she can die as dead as any human being her blood was dark viscous and strange and the sight of the body mesmerized him for a time then he turned and looked for murdoch but murdoch had slipped out the open door not good tyler hurried down to the lobby and into the street murdoch was a block away frantically rattling the doors of parked cars murdoch had forsaken him for the girl murdoch himself might be infected there had been hints a word or two tyler had heard through the door now we can be together tyler sighted down the barrel of the pistol sunlight gleamed on the fenders and windows of these parked cars tyler moved to shade his eyes murdoch caught sight of him and ducked away the pistol bucked and the shot went wide tyler saw it kick dust from the brick facing of a muffler shop murdoch crouched and hurried on to the next car an old ford tyler walked out into the street quickly but calmly and assumed a shooters stance he had begun to squeeze the trigger when the door of the ford popped open and murdoch ducked for the interior tyler cursed but followed the motion the pistol kicked again in his hand he saw murdoch lurch as if hed been hita gout of blood came from the left leg or thighthen the car door slammed and the engine turned over twice rattled on the edge of a stall finally began to roar murdoch threw it into gear and tyler watched helplessly as the vehicle screamed away from the curb the ford made a drunken swerve its rear fender caught a lamp standard on the left side of the street then it straightened and accelerated west tyler turned and ran back to the hummer but the exxon station was three blocks away precious time was lost he drove west on the highway for an hour without sighting the ford murdoch might have followed one of these dirt side roads tyler thought or hidden the car in a barn in back of a billboard even along some back street in loftus but i hurt him tyler thought with some satisfaction in a place without doctors without medical care maybe that was enough it was a question of principle tyler thought murdoch had forsaken his humanity and tyler was better off without him murdoch had seen too many of his lapses murdoch had seen him shoot the girl it was precisely the kind of baggage tyler wished to leave behind he pulled over to the side of the road well beyond the limits of loftus in a patch of cool november sunlight and listened to the silence it was the new silence of his aloneness in this increasingly empty world murdoch was gone that second voice second self was gone there was only tyler now tyler talking to tyler or those other voices the sissy voices whispering from the trees the earth the air murdochs wound was more serious than the colonel had guessed the bullet entered his hip shattered a wedge of bone and opened a raw round exit wound blood instantly soaked the seat of the ford the pain was blinding but murdoch was sustained by the vivid memory of soo constantine dead under the barrel of tylers gun he drove two blocks at high speed turned right and rolled into the first empty garage he spotted the car wouldnt be invisible here but it might be inconspicuous in the shadows murdoch didnt have a choice it was stop now or pass out on the street the car came up the driveway too fast he fumbled his right foot ineffectually between the gas and the brake pedal the ford coasted into the garage and collided with a stack of pineboard shelves murdoch fell against the steering wheel as a pair of garden shears dented the hood of the car and a can of varsol cracked the windshield he managed to turn off the engine before he slipped into unconsciousness curled in the hot salt smell of his own blood the helper responded promptly to the distress of a soul in transition the transition had hardly begun but the neocytes in murdochs body broadcast the terrible news of the organisms impending death moments after tyler ran west in the m bouncing over buckled tarmac and hunting vainly for murdochs ford the reconstructed helper moved from its place in the center of loftus and glided to the garage where murdoch was dying it came up swiftly along the drivers side of the car and stopped there the only sound was the drip of dilute prestone from the fords cracked radiator the helper was many awarenesses some of them human one of them was soo constantine who had recently been killed by colonel john tyler her distress was its distress the helper looked at murdochs bloody organism with pity and grief if he diedand he was nearly dead nowmurdoch would be dead forever there hadnt been time to engineer a transition to grow a second murdoch for the murdochessence to inhabit there was only this fragile plasmic murdoch with a scant few neocytes inside him the neocytes had only reproduced a few tens of tens of times they had not mapped or expanded murdoch in any significant way but murdoch had made his choice this was an involuntary death which the travellers found abhorrent the helper made an arm and reached out to the window of the car the window glass shattered and fell away in a fine gray powder the arm extended further reached inside the car to murdoch and touched his damaged body mass surged inward from the body of the helper which was proportionately diminished multiple millions of its subunits anticipated new taskssealing broken blood vessels containing and fostering the spark of plasmic life soon murdoch was covered in what appeared to be a featureless black cocoon the cocoon was motionless murdoch was motionless inside it prompt and feverish activity had begun but it was internal and below the threshold of perception superficially nothing changed days and nights passed the sky outside the open garage roiled with clouds periodically that december there was lightning murdoch woke in january the helper had retreated he was alone in the car he opened the door and staggered out into dim daylight the sky was gray and threatening the weather was bleak and dangerous everywhere that winter he had been warned about storms the neocytes were still at work inside him murdoch could have chosen to move directly into his new life his virtual life but he wasnt finished with the flesh tylers gunshot had interrupted him there were things he wanted to see he couldnt say precisely what thingsliterally could not say to himself or to anyone else in the aftermath of his injury he had very nearly died the flow of blood to the brain had been interrupted for too long the neocytes were reconstructing that tissue but much of their work was conjectural and slow elaborating the holon of murdochs self from its fragmented parts he was himself but he was inarticulate and he didnt trust himself to drive too much neuromuscular memory remained unreconstructed mute he walked in the direction of the setting sun he walked for weeks his legs were unnaturally strong and his stamina seemed unlimited the weather was only a minor hindrance and his wordless contact with the artifact helped him anticipate and avoid the worst winds and lightnings he sheltered in abandoned buildings storm cellars gullies some nights he slept in the rain his body had been changed on the inside extremes of hot and cold no longer bothered him he seldom ate he didnt need to though he drank copiously when there was water he crossed the mississippi at cairo and passed into the prairies where the storms were often fierce one night crouched in a pipe section where a fourlane bypass had been abandoned in midconstruction he watched a blizzard unroll from the western horizon like a flat white wall the wind made a sound like freight trains passing through the sky after midnight when the snow had almost blocked the pipe at each end a wild foxdrenched and miserablecrept inside with him the fox was terrified of murdoch but more terrified of the blizzard murdoch strengthened his tegument and let the fox chew harmlessly on a finger until the animal was exhausted and no longer afraid of him then he cradled the fox against the warmth of his body until both of them were asleep in the morning it was gone but murdoch was startled and pleased that he had remembered the name of the animal during the night fox the animal was a fox he said it out loud fox it made his throat hurt he didnt care the pleasure of speech was almost unbearable fox he walked west and north along a road shrouded in glittering bluewhite snow fox he exclaimed from time to time and the word fell away across the empty winter farmland fox fox fox late that winter murdoch passed through kansas and crossed the state border into colorado where he glimpsed for the first time the thing he had come all this distance to see the home he had heard about from the travellers this was what had drawn him this was his reason for clinging to the flesh some stubborn fraction of aw murdoch had wanted to see this miracle with his own eyes from a great distance it looked like a mountain a curvature of blue and white nearly lost in the haze of the horizon it was murdochs good fortune that the skies had cleared in the eastern lee of the rockies with a little more luck the weather would hold until he was closer but distances were hard to calculate with such an object how many more miles to go how far to the horizon and how far beyond that he walked a day and a night and another day and another night words returned to him piecemeal as the days passed and his neural tissue was restored the effect was sometimes comic as when murdoch would suddenly halt along the verge of an empty road point his index finger and announce to the heedless air some newly acquired nounwindow or fence proper names were more elusive he could barely pronounce his own murdoch he said but it sounded clumsy and grotesque nor could he remember the name of the girl he had met in loftus though the memory was vivid and he often felt her silent presence maddeningly the name lingered on his tongue but couldnt be coaxed from his mouth suhsuhsuh he worked at it day after day until his jaw was sore home stood on the horizon closer now it drew the eye irresistibly a miraculous blue pearl capped with white the white was snow like a mountain home rose more than feet into the rarified air up where it was always cold where the snow never melted the travellers had explained to him wordlessly but vividly how the creation of home had begun months ago on the eve of contact a single microscopic neocytea kind of seedhad come to rest on this plain of dry rolling land where colorado met wyoming instantly the traveller organism had begun to reproduce itself one made two two made four four made eightin less than an hour a million two million four million the organisms grew themselves from the constituent parts of soil sand water air and light when their numbers were large enoughuncountably inconceivably largethey organized themselves into machines into devices as big as cities home required immense tonnages of raw matter the building machines began by digging into the earth cratering the prairie and displacing the antelope herds but that was only a modest first step as murdoch approached he felt a series of rhythmic tremors under the imponderable substance of home he knew a conduit had been opened into the magma of the earth itself the days remained clear but a cold wind blew steadily from the west murdoch felt weaker the farther he walked he understood that he couldnt get as close to home as he might have liked it wasnt a healthy environment the wind curling around a sphere more than thirty miles in circumference created a turbulence that could sweephim off his feet deadly gases vented from the magma tap and the heat at the cratered base was well beyond human tolerance but he could get a little closer than this suh he pronounced suhsuh it wasnt good enough the snow came back that night it was a hard granular snow difficult to walk through murdoch slept in an empty best western motel in a hallway away from windows that had been broken by the winter storms and walked on in the morning his compasshe had pocketed it in loftusand his road map kept him aimed in the right direction but home was hidden by the weather the weather settled in and showed no inclination to change he walked for three days blindly walked until he was forced to stop by a violent tremor and a wind so sulfurous and hot that it melted the snow on the ground murdoch felt himself growing lighter when he was finished here there was no reason to cling to the flesh he understood that but he worried that the process might be happening too quickly that he would be gone before the weather cleared he curled under a tarpaulin in the rear of a gas station drifting in and out of sleep listening to the hard snow sift across the roof the gas pumps the empty road time passed he couldnt have guessed at day or month knew only that it was after midnight when the snow stopped he woke to a blanketing silence stood up stiffly and hurried outside the clouds had passed on there were starsvivid prairie starsand a few faint streaks of cirrus and home murdoch caught his breath it was a wall that dominated the sky perspective made it seem truncated a looming dome about to tumble over and crush him a crescent of snow at its apex reflected the starlight but most of that part of the sphere was a occluded by its nearer slope the lower section of home wasnt solid it was a gridwork a lace of bonewhite struts and spars as fine from murdochs vantage as spider silk but each one must be immense he thought columns as wide as towns as long as highways it was illuminated from within by the lightmany miles awayof the magma tap and by the luminescence of the earths own toxic gases pearlous and strange periodically balls of blue lightning seemed to flow and stutter along the countless struts and spars of the structure and there was a sounda distant continuous thunder that had been obscured by the snow but echoed now in the cold night air across the plain a wind blew and murdoch anchored himself between the pillars of the gas pumps here was the strangest and most beautiful thing he had ever seen he felt both fragile and grateful he had been lifted up exposed to the elements abandoned to this vision his uniform was a rag he felt his own tenuous existence flickering inside it this was the moment he had saved himself for he opened his mouth to make some exclamation to vent his human awe but what came out was suhsuhsoo he felt her presence he felt it so strongly that he looked left looked right he was alone of course she was with him but not here with him in the new life he was rising now he was lighter than air murdoch gazed at the home growing out of the plain at its astonishing size and its interior lights and its reflection on the snowy plain soo he said faintly proudly and she reached for him the wind took what was left of murdoch took his rags and his skin and carried them away up beyond the snowbound colorado flatlands up and away from the mountains chapter flesh on a windy afternoon late in january tom kindle found a human skin snagged on the leafless azalea bush outside his front door the skin had been carried some distance by the wind it was tattered and incomplete bleached by the weather to so colorless a shade that kindle thought for a moment it was some old ghost that had fetched up on his doorstep kindle studied the object for a time then ducked back into the warmth of the house and telephoned matt wheeler matt drove the short distance to delmar estates with his black bag on the car seat beside him not that this was a doctors job if he had understood tom kindle correctly a coroners perhaps he examined the skin where it was trapped in the naked branches of the azalea his expression fixed but emotionless then he looked at kindle do you have a pair of tongs pardon me kitchen tongs barbecue tongs well i think abby brought over a pair hang on he disappeared into the house and returned with a pair of kitchen tongs the handles were cartoonblue plastic the business end stainless steel matt used them to lift the tattered skin away from the spindly bush and carry it into the garage out of the reach of the wind he laid out the tissue with some care across the gasolinestained concrete floor unfolding it meticulously layer by layer until it resembled a nearly transparent pair of body tights torn beyond any utility one leg ended in frayed nothingness at the knee one arm was missing entirely the headthere was very little of the head kindle stood well back i wonder who the hell it is i meanis it somebody like a corpse or just a piece of somebody matt crouched over the object it didnt frighten or disgust himhe had encountered worse things as an intern but he was careful not to touch it with his naked hands this is the first one ive seen first kindle cocked his head there are others you should have come to the meeting sunday night bob ganish found a couple of them in his neighbors house paul jacopetti says the farms out in his area are all emptyexcept for these jesus matthew empty skins he nodded what about the people inside gone gone where matt shrugged so kindle said does everybody end up like this i think so eventually except us of course abby said shes worried about her husband her grandchildren she says theyre getting well thinner paler jesus kindle repeated what about he checked himself but the question was obvious what about rachel matt couldnt bring himself to form an answer not even to himself kindle looked back at the fragile envelope arrayed on the floor of the garage matthew is there somethingi mean what should i do with it put it outside let it blow away it wont last long a few days in the sun and itll turn to dust not much to leave behind kindle said what is he drove home to rachel she had arrived at the house this morning and hinted that it might be her last visit matt made the obvious connection between this and the discovery of the skins throughout buchanan but it was an impossible thought a thought he must not allow himself the image of a dry shell of rachel of his daughter abandoned to the wind lonely and empty in the cold raindear god not this he told her what the call from tom kindle had been about he described the skin described it clinically made himself the doctor machine because this was his last defense his only defense and when the telling was done he shook his head dazed at his own story it isnt human rachel i know what youve said but this isntit isnt something human beings do he expected an argument she only nodded maybe youre right she was pale somehow ethereal she moved with a certain new lightnessand these observations too matt didnt care to mark or consider maybe too much has changed maybe the word human doesnt apply anymore her voice was solemn i dont feel differentnot basically different the basic part of me is still rachel wheeler but theres more now more layers more ways of seeing things if i leave this behind gesturing at herself her body am i rachel am i human i dont know she might have been confessing to some disease some terrible wasting illness she seemed to feel the thought lately she had seemed able to interpret the smallest nuance of his expression although he was laboring to conceal his grief daddy im not sorry about any of it youre a doctoryou know how many lives were saved even at the local hospital how many terminal cancers were cured how much heart disease and in the world my god all the starvation the malnutrition the crippled lives but matt could not dispel the memory of the skin that had fetched up a pathetic and unassailable statement of grim fact on tom kindles leafless azalea bush rachel is this better yes firmly we couldnt have gone on you know the way we were the planet wouldnt support us we were damaging it beyond recognition beyond its ability to recover something had to change something human had to change do you know who said yes to contact who accepted the offer of eternal life almost everybody everybodyincluding dictators pickpockets child molesters murderers people who killed people for their wristwatches killed them for their tennis shoes people who tortured children to death in front of their parents but it was immortality with a price they had to understand what it means to hurt someone to damage someone and if that didnt work if they could witness human pain and understand it intimately and still not care or worse enjoy itthat meant they were flawed broken not complete so they had to be repaired they cant choose to commit violence anyone can choose anything but only if they understand what theyre choosing and why rachel it sounds like compulsion daddy youve told me since i was a baby that theres no good reason for all the wars all the bullying all the hurt in the world it was what one told a child and pressed he would have admitted to believing it himself but the fact wasas scott fitzgerald had written if matt remembered his american literature correctlythe fundamental decencies were parceled out unequally at birth theres no excuse for it but people dont seem to know that now they do you cant change human nature rachelnot without taking away the thing that makes people human then were not human in a way that was always the point humanity was reaching its limits facing problems we couldnt even begin to solve in the usual human wayglobal problems planetary problems and the main victim of our inadequacy was us our children they were already dying by the millions in africa and we were too human to do anything about it matt bowed his head this was true of course the contactees had done a better job at least in the short term but what were they saved for if their humanity wasnt saved but it wasnt lost either just outgrown do you know what were building has anyone told you a spaceship an artifact of our own a human one daddy do you know whats inside it the earth is inside it not literally of course but a model of it all of it every leaf of every tree every mountaintop a memory of this was mingled with his own fading memory of contact you mean a simulation like a computer program or a paperweight he thought the earth in a globe of water with snowflakes more than a simulation its a place as real as this place except that it doesnt occupy a physical space its alive in a very real way it has winds it has seasons were human enough to need thatnot just immortality but a place to live even if its an illusion is it is an idea an illusion is the value of pi a hallucination just because you cant touch it rachel its not really the earth no one pretends it is no matter where we stand well know that because there will always be a door not a physical door but a sort of direction a way to turn and through the door is always the bigger world all our knowledge and the knowledge we inherited from the travellersthe epistemos people are calling it the ideaworld we might have done it by ourselves matt said given time if wed survived a couple of centuries without vaporizing ourselves without poisoning the planet we might have moved into space maybe it seems trivial but we walked on the moon without anyones help given time maybe we could have met the travellers on their own terms rachels eyes widened what a terrible thought is it she frowned daddy i know more human history than i used to its an ugly parade infanticide bloody warfare human sacrificethose are the norm theyre not exceptional at all and modern history is no better when i was in school we studied roman history and we pretended to be horrified by it the romans left unwanted children to die by the side of the road did you know that how horrible well it is horrible but compared to what the century of auschwitz of hiroshima and the khmer rouge going into space wouldnt have civilized us wed have had our robots disemboweling moslems on the surface of mars you know we would is that how the travellers saw it yes and it terrified them theres no monopoly on power or knowledge given time given our own survival maybe we could have stopped them destroyed them before they got close enough for contact and thats why all this is happening not because theyre doing us a favor its selfdefense in part but they didnt have to go to all this trouble they had the means to exterminate us that would have worked too the coldness of the statement made him feel both frightened and ashamed he took a long look at rachel who used to be his daughter who used to be a human being there wasnt just brutality rachel people lived livessmall useful lives sometimes helped one another often loved one another there was beauty sometimes there was even decency her expression softened daddy i know they know the travellers know that about us she paused thats why they couldnt exterminate us only change us yes change us a silence filled the room rachel left the house before midnight after her father had fallen asleep on the sofa she had wanted a better goodbye but she supposed there was no way to say what she meantno words to encompass her grief and fear she loved her father enormously and hated the idea of abandoning him to an empty planet abandoning him to die a cold rain had begun to fall and the wind in the street was sharp and gusty rachel adjusted herself so that the temperature ceased to be unpleasant then she pausedalone among dark housesand listened to the trees talk their sibilant winter language the wind lifted her hair and waved it behind her like a sad flag overhead high above the streetlights midnight clouds tumbled and dipped it was a stormy night and there was worse to come although it was winter in the northern hemisphere temperature gradients in the tropical oceans had risen dramatically winds in the upper atmosphere had shifted north and east of hawaii a lowpressure cell a vast and powerful weatherengine had begun to churn above the turbulent ocean a typhoonunheard of this time of year but all things were new her father would learn about the storm soon enough because he had begun to talk to the helper still rachel thought he was so fragile she wondered why he had resisted the offer of immortalitywhy anybody had but she didnt submit the question to the greater world where there might have been an answer she didnt want to dwell on it more tonight there was not much left of her time on the cradle earth and rachel wanted to make the most of these hours not everyone relished the flesh many had already abandoned itwhole towns in some cases some as large as buchanan buchanan itself was largely empty and would be emptier by the day but some chose to linger a leavetaking made strange by personal transformation in some cases like the group hidden in the basement of the high school some forty strong who had elected to share each others memories in every detail they were there still crosslegged on the floor and welded at the fingertips motionless enraptured waiting to surrender their joined flesh in a single communal act othersmainly but not exclusively the youngjust wanted to play a little longer on the surface of the earth stay up past bedtime do what had been forbidden rachel encapsulated her grief and set it aside she focused all her attention on this january nightthe bite of rain on her exposed skin trickle and drip of water in storm drains creak of tree limb rush of wind she hiked through the maze of tract housing that had overgrown the northern foothills of mt buchanan rainwater streamed off the shingles of silent houses empty houses where abandoned human skins were crumbling to dust she paused at every high culdesac that allowed a view the rain obscured much but there were still a few lights in buchanan itself lonely and far and fogobscured and she could sense as much as see the ocean feel its enormous mass troubled by the climatic adjustments the travellers had begun to perform she was wet to the skin her clothes were sodden and heavy but none of that mattered it was a cold rain rachel knew but the touch of it was soothing like the rain that carries away the heat of a summer day she walked toward old quarry park where sleepless others had gathered by unspoken mutual consent to share the pleasure of the night it was a long walk nearly two hours by foot from her fathers house but rachel finished it without weariness she was lighter and stronger than she had ever been before a year ago a hike this long in this weather would have left her exhausted and ill tonight there was no fatigue at all only a growing excitement a first tremulous presentiment of joy she followed an empty access lane into the deep green darkness of the park but it was not a complete darkness even in the rain even at two oclock on a january morning a faint light radiated from the low wrack of clouds douglas firs tossed in ponderous slow motion like the masts of ancient sailing ships the rain was everywhere a silvery presence on lips and skin figures moved in the dim light not human daddy had insisted and rachel supposed that was especially true here in the human history of buchanan there had never been such a gathering on such a raw january night before contact no one had come to smell the wet winter earth and walk among the mossy winter trees no one had come for the caress of flesh against fleshat least not in the cold not fearlessly not openly it wasnt human but it seemed very human to rachel who had recently been studying the travellers the travellers in their organic form had been almost incomprehensibly strange she had seen them in borrowed and ancient memories porous antlery creatures like mobile sponges slow in the thick atmosphere of their chilly moon like humans their bodies had been cellular in structure but there the resemblance ended the travellers were uninucleate and genetically haploid more like algae than animals a mature traveller was a colony of secondary systemsas if human beings were assembled from cultivated crops of livers hearts lungs brains the parts reproduced independently of the whole for the travellers sex was a series of protracted continuous events they spoke of karyogamy the way people talked about middle age human sex had seemed to the travellers equally strange a grotesquely foreshortened reproductive whirlwind allied to something like a repeatable religious trance but they understood pleasure rachel remembered some of their slow protracted pleasures she remembered a glade of crystalline fans warmed by pale sunlight and enriched by volcanic vents of gaseous water where an ancient traveller whose name was a shape had come to bask and root she remembered the pleasure of hyphae uncoiled in a solitary erotic flowering the pleasure of germinal sterigmata scattered in glittering clouds to the tidal wind rachel left her soakingwet clothes at the entrance to the park bodies moved along the grassy green or timidly like fawns among the trees the emerald light made these people seem golden and diffuse rachel opened an eye to the greater world and saw them not just as surfaces but as lives as shapes of lives complex and manycolored she longed for their touch she found a man whose lifeshape was a pleasing temperate complexityhis name was simon ackroyd and he had once been the rector of the episcopal church but he was something else now a creature as fresh on the earth as herself infinitely light lightly wedded to her skin rachel touched and joined his rainwet flesh in the shadows of the great trees in the cold air after january midnight on the surface of the cradle earth the rain stopped falling sometime after dawn matt woke from a fitful sleep on the living room sofa and noted the absence of his daughter and the silence of the rain at noon tom kindle and chuck makepeace arrived in chucks nissan committee business the three of them drove to the municipal reservoir at the northeastern end of town next to the stone slope of the reservoir was a white limestone building the filtration plant a wpa project as old as the roosevelt administration set in a wide rolling lawn it looked to matt like the temple of some serene religion the three men sat in the car gazing at the building from the gravel parking lot kindle taking long pulls on a can of coke together they were the public works subcommittee and their job was to report on the condition of water and power resources inside the county line starting here but none of them seemed to want to move from the car just yet all three had recently been spooked kindle had found the human skin snagged on his azalea bush just yesterday makepeace had discovered a similar relic in a neighbors house and matt was still troubled by rachels visit last night worried that he might not see her again or that if he did she might be changed beyond recognition but these were common fears and none of the men spoke about them last nights rain had left a high cool overcast the filtration plant with its whitewashed steel doors waited with infinite patience in the green kindle said you ever see the time machine no makepeace said in the movie the time machine gets carried off into this building where the time traveller cant find it morlocks are in there nasty ugly people big old building you have a point makepeace asked looked like this building kindle tipped back his coke funny how they used to build public works in the old days like you ought to wear a toga to go inside you guys are pretty thoroughly out to lunch makepeace said i hope youre aware of that chuck makepeace former city councilman former junior member of the towns second most prestigious law firm was still wearing threepiece suits to matt this seemed deeply neurotic like formalwear on a lifeboat but he kept his opinion to himself i was inside there once matt said school trip about twentyfive years ago oh kindle said whats it like theres a double row of filtration tanks and a walkway in between i remember a lot of bigdiameter pipes and valves you know how any of it works nope makepeace laughed it points up the stupidity of this whole expedition we dont know what to look for and we wont know what it means when we see it not necessarily kindle said if we go in there and everythings humming along we tell the folks they can use the kitchen faucet a while longer on the other hand if the floors under water and the pipes are broken we can all put a bucket on the roof and pray for rain lets get it over with then if youre finished with that soda kindle drained the can and tossed the empty into the backseat hey makepeace said dont litter my car you can get a new car kindle said kindle had brought a big iron crowbar with him the filtration plant was liable to be locked and nobody knew where the maintenance people had gone much less their keys but when matt approached the windowless steel door he found it standing ajar inside was darkness no one wanted to reach out and yank the door wide certainly matt didnt he heard the muted thump of machinery inside like a massive heartbeat kindle said did it always sound like that maybe matt said i was ten years old when i came here last it could have changed privately he thought no it wasnt like that it had been quiet this was a high reservoir the tanks were gravity filters sounds like morlocks to me kindle said jesus makepeace said open the damn door matt tugged it wide moist air gusted out there was no light in the great windowless space inside once there had been banks of lamps suspended from the ceiling no more got a flashlight in the car makepeace said get it kindle said makepeace ran for the cherryred nissan while matt and kindle took a tentative step through the doorway neither of them spoke until makepeace arrived with the flashlight the beam probed the farther darknessonce systematically once wildly the filtration plant didnt look the way it had looked during marts fifthgrade field trip what had once been copper pipe was now a tangle of fibrous tubing columns thick and knotted as mangrove roots sweating condensation into the warm interior air much of the floor was occupied by a black dome a pulsating hemisphere attached by ropy ventricles to the looming black filtration tanks from this dome came the buildings heartbeatperiodic kettledrum throbs like a distant organic thunder and the room smelted strange maybe that was the worst of it matt thought it was not a bad smell but it was wholly alienas penetrating as nutmeg and as rich as garden loam silently the three men backed out into the cold january noon chuck makepeace drove the coast road back into buchanan not talking much his hands clenched on the steering wheel the road had grown potholes over the winter the little nissan bucked and jumped all i want to know kindle said is whats it doing there my guess matt said its filtering and pumping water thats all there arent enough people to maintain essential services so the travellers grew a machine to do it if we check out the power company well probably find something similar operating the local gridall the way back to the power plant why would they be so interested in keeping buchanan going i dont suppose its only us if theyre running utilities in buchanan they must be doing the same for every other city hoover dam grand coulee dam all the nuclear plants all our little engineering miracles he imagined tangled black machines operating the massive turbines no one had put these devices there they had just grown like weeds matthew do you suppose all our water flows through that thing it appears to well jesusi drank that water i dont think they mean to poison us they could have killed us a long time ago if theyd wanted to exterminated was the word rachel had used they could have exterminated us but its control kindle said that much is obvious if they can turn off the lights and shut off the water they can tell us what to do we depend on them do we you can dig a well nobodys stopping you we could dig wells and press lamp oil but we arent going to cause the faucets still work and the lights are still on so why do you guess they did it civic spirit maybe matt said maybe because its easy for them so why not you remember contact i dont like the fact that theyre here and i dont like what theyve done but i dont think they did it because they hate us you believe that he shrugged thats what it felt like sure it did but only a really lousy lie is gonna feel like a lie the best lies feel like gods own truth thats the point and anyway matt looked at the older man anyway what even if theyre jesus and buddha in one happy package who says i want em working for me i mean how does this go we get water because the travellers favored us with a big ugly pump if its a dry spell do we pray for rain and if we do do they send some along he shook his head i dont happen to believe in god matthew but if i did i think id prefer the one that works in mysterious ways his miracles to perform pray for rain in other words but keep the tanning butter handy its more human well get rain enough to suit chuck makepeace said running a red light at the vacant intersection of commercial and marine i understand theres a motherbitch of a winter storm on the way kindle gave him a sharp look how would you know that it turned out chuck makepeace had heard the news the same way matt had through the agency of the helper twice since christmas matt had gone to stand before that motionless obsidian giant he had asked it questions about the travellers rachels transformation the future of buchanan the helper had answered concisely in a sedate baritone of neutral accent beyond that it had no discernible personality it spoke to matt in colloquial english but he didnt doubt that it would answer an iranian in farsi or a brazilian in portuguese it was rachel who had first hinted to matt about the weather but the helper elaborated that warning described the new and fiercer storms spinning to life in the altered waters of the tropical seas matt had withheld that warning from the last meeting of the emergency planning committeethere had been too much new business and the threat was safely distantbut he had planned to bring it up tonight but chuck makepeace knew as much about the weather as matt because makepeace had talked to the helper too matt arrived at the hospital boardroom unshaven and somewhat lightheaded five minutes late he had skipped dinner maybe lunch too he couldnt recall he missed a lot of meals these days time seemed to slip past his attention often wandered he had hoped to chair a fairly sedate meeting and introduce the stormwarning during new business at this point the best and simplest strategy was to secure a sheltermaybe the basement of the hospitaland stock it with water food coleman lanterns it was an important job but not a difficult or costly one but the news had arrived before him chuck makepeace had heard it and so had bob ganish and abby cushman all three had been urged by contactee friends or family to talk to the helper all three had done so and all three had received the same warning strange and powerful weather moving eastward from the far pacific the news had spread by telephone the day before the meeting had spread even farther in the crowd around the coffee machine before the emergency planning committee was gaveled to order matt arrived in time to hear tom kindle wonder whether he was the only human being in buchanan who wasnt having long conversations with that damn robot up at the city hall turnaround by no means paul jacopetti said i havent talked to it either wouldnt not on a bet im with you there mr kindle thats a consolation kindle said matt called the meeting to order nine people took seats and gazed at him there was no use postponing this he upturned the agenda and asked for debate or resolutions on the subject of the weather emergency abby cushman expressed her astonishment the travellers are going to a lot of trouble to help usas mr makepeace mentioned theyre keeping our water and electricity on lineso why would they create a storm that might kill us i dont understand i dont think itll kill us kindle said not if were careful as for the logic of itabby by any calculation theyre a superior species more powerful than us at least i knew a guy in florida one time ran a hospital for injured birds he had a wild heron with a broken beak and he worked real hard on it taped the injury fed the bird by hand until it was strong enough to go free finally he released it with a metal tab on its leg for some kind of wildlife census three months later he gets back the bangedup tab with a nasty letter from the faa apparently the bird got sucked into the intake of an alitalia abby looked dismal i still dont understand wellthe heron got some nice treatment but that bird shouldnt have jumped to any conclusions about how safe it is to deal with another species the fact that were getting free electricity doesnt mean the jets arent rolling out onto the tarmac all the same thats macabre and terrible miriam flett announced kindle regarded her mildly do you disagree maam she thought about it no matt proposed a shelter to be provided in the hospital basement and asked for volunteers for a storm precautions subcommittee then suggested the whole subject be tabled until there was more substantial information we have other business pending after all agreed with random grumbling matt consulted the minutes okay is there a weekly report from the radio subcommittee joey commoner stood up radio report joey said he cleared his throat if marts memory served this was the first time joey had spoken at a committee meeting joey had dressed up for the occasion there was nothing on his tshirt more offensive than a tennisshoe ad this week we logged thirteen calls most of those were mr avery price from the boston group or mr gardner deutsch of toronto plus a few from colonel john tyler and some onetime contacts like a woman in ohio and someone in costa rica who i didnt understand mr price says boston is leaving town in a convoy and toronto is also going to leave tomorrow morning according to plan so the two groups can meet in pennsylvania and travel together he says matt banged the gavel joey what are you talking about boston is leaving boston damn it this might be important joey glared at him its all written down id like to just read it wellcarry on i suppose we can reserve questions until later joey cleared his throat again the boston and toronto people are going to an area along the fortieth parallel probably in ohio which their helpers say will be safe from storms and where they can establish a town and a radio beacon for people to follow they say this will attract survivors from all over the continent and theyd like us to join them as soon as we can because there are about enough people in north america to make one goodsized town theyre carrying mobile radio equipment and they want us to let them know as soon as possible when were going to join them also colonel tyler is travelling toward the northwest looking for survivors and hell be passing through buchanan in a couple of months or he can rendezvous with us on the road if we decide to join the bostontoronto convoy end of report pandemonium several people wanted to pack up and leave immediately bob ganish the excar dealer spoke for the group we can beat the damn storm get across the mountains before it finds us no offense people but i like the idea of seeing some new faces abby raised her hand there are things here wed all hate to leave but maybe its better if we do should we put this to a vote matt argued that they should stay in buchanan at least for the time beingwait until the boston group had a more solid plan have somebody besides joey talk to them weather the storm then think about moving it wasnt the kind of decision that could be made impulsively privately the idea terrified him he didnt want to abandon buchanan christ not yet it was too soon to give up buchanan everything was still intact still functional only a little tattered theres hope he wanted to say we can salvage something its not over yet kindle moved to postpone debate until more facts came inthis is the first ive heard of it and im half the damn radio subcommittee with a long sideways look at joey commoner the motion passed five to two matt listened numbly through three more subcommittee reports and adjourned the meeting at midnight he wanted only to go to bed to sleep to table for a few hours all his own private debates but annie gates was waiting when he pulled into his driveway she must have walked here matt thought her own car was nowhere in sight none of these people seemed to drive anymore he saw them walking sometimes a curious light stride not quite human as rachel might have admitted the sight of annie filled him with fear he had avoided her for months avoided her because she was one more component in a problem he couldnt solve and because he had slept with her when she was human loved her when she was human an equation he didnt care to balance but now she scared him because she was waiting on his doorstep under the hospitality light dressed too lightly for the cold night air looking at him with a terrible sympathy terrible because it was authentic because she was waiting to speak rachels gone home annie said matt shes not here anymore she wants me to tell you that annies voice was solemn and very sad she says she misses you she says she loves you and shes sorry she didnt say goodbye annie was not human but matt put his head against her pale shoulder and wept chapter view from a height it was the winter the oceans bloomed with strange life the travellers perceiving the thermal imbalance of the planet and the human desire to restore it dispatched seed organisms into the earths restless hydrosphere the organisms multiplied in the shallow surface waters like the phytoplankton they resembled the new organisms fed on mineral material from the upwelling ocean currents fed on sunlight but fed also on the water itself assembling themselves from atoms of hydrogen and oxygen the ocean was food and the traveller organisms increased their tonnage by the minute as they multiplied they began to avoid the coastal waters rich in natural diatoms their role in the oceanic ecology was temporary and there must always be enough phytoplankton to feed the krill they confined their bloom to less nutrientrich waters far from land they grew so numerous that autumn that in places they covered the surface water in crystalline slicks hundreds of miles in diameter their opalescent coats bouncing rainbows from the swell then they began their significant work they began to devour atmospheric carbon and bind it to themselves as the phytoplankton do but more efficientlyvoraciously the oceans combed the air of c the population of the earth plummeted daily in the greater world a few acts remained malum in se but none were malum prohibitum the inhibitions of a thousand generations had been swept away by contact the last devotees of the flesh celebrated their bodies even as their bodies grew pale and light they danced to silent music in abandoned mosques made love in infinite variation in the shadows of cathedrals they laughed and embraced and surrendered their bodies by the light of arab sunsets oriental noons african dawns daily they vanished into the greater world and their abandoned skins like phantom armies roamed the streets of djakarta beijing reykjavik capetown until they crumbled to dust and the dust was borne off by the rising wind matt wheeler picked up a school notebook at delisles stationerywhere miriam flett used to buy glustiks and paper cutters before the observer ceased publication in octoberand began a private journal according to rachel everyone started fresh at contact basically they entered a new state of being its not the last judgmentno sins are punished its not the judeochristian paradise at all more like the ancient greek idea of the golden age when men were so pious they socialized with the gods everything is forgiven rachel said nothing is forgotten i try to believe this it sounds noble but what does it really mean its hard to imagine guys who wore cartier watches joined in spiritual union with third world sharecroppers or much worse men who battered their infant children to death allowed to live forever nirvana for mass murderers terrorists surviving their victims by a millennium or more unless theyve changed it isnt just and if theyve changed so radicallyit isnt human rachel admitted as much the human baggage is too unsavory to carry into a new life she claimed the real punishment for such people is to understand what they wereto truly understand it i suppose this is possible though it beggars comprehension for her sake of course i want it to be true he chewed on the end of his pencil and decided he might as well ask the big questions there was nothing to be lost by honesty not at this late hour but what about those of us who stayed behind what made it possible or necessary for us to turn down immortality why are we here none of us seems extraordinary in any outward particular the opposite if anything what is it we have what is it we lack the next morning beth porter phoned and said she wanted to be a nurse and would matt be willing to help her he asked her to repeat the question he hadnt slept much the night before these days his eating and sleeping habits didnt encourage a lucid state of mind hed lost fifteen pounds since november his reflection in mirrors took him by surprise who was this skinny holloweyed man i think you should teach me how to be a nurse beth said ive been thinking about this youre the only doctor in town right so maybe you need an assistant at least somebody who knows what to do in an emergency this storm thats coming for instance say a lot of people get hurt maybe i could at least put on a bandage or stop some bleeding he closed his eyes beth i appreciate what youre saying but this is not a comeon jesus i hope you dont think that pause im serious maybe i can save somebodys life somewhere down the road beth i mean i feel so useless just sitting here in this room all by myself he sighed do you know cpr ive seen it on tv but i dont know how to do it no you should joey commoner used the handicam hed stolen from the newcomb house to videotape buchanan joey had heard all this talk about the weather if half the talk was true there might not be much left of buchanan in a month or so he didnt love this ugly little bay town but he liked the idea of saving it on videotape while it was still intact joey commoner the towns last historian so he drove up and down the main streets and some distance into the suburbs guiding his motorcycle with one hand and running the camcorder with the other he drove slowly in order to capture all the detail the images he played back on his basement vcr were unnerving and strange empty streets bouncing when the yamaha bumped over buckled asphalt empty storefronts empty sidewalks empty buildings in whitewashed ranks all the way to the marina and the cold winter sea empty everything it made him feel peculiarly alone it was the feeling you might get joey thought if you were locked inside some big mall at night with the mannequins and the mice it made him want to ride over to tom kindles place and work the radio but that was probably a bad idea since the big cities began their migration joey had been edged off the radio by kindle and bob ganish and that asshole chuck makepeace gimme the microphone this is important well fuck it he was tired of the radio he had better things to do than dxing foreigners who couldnt even speak english he videotaped some important personal places his basement his street the street where beth porter used to live the motel shed moved into hidden behind a highway abutment where she couldnt see him he videotaped beth climbing into a white volkswagen and driving north beth didnt have a drivers license she had only started driving since contact and it was funny how she drove a clumsy jerkandstop he wondered where she was going where was there to go he watched the car bump out of sight she might be shopping idly curious or so he told himself joey waited a prudent few minutes and then followed on his yamaha he checked the empty mall lots along the highway for her car but it wasnt there visiting somebody so who was to visit slow suspicions formed in joeys mind not that he cared what she did he hadnt seen her much lately he wasnt sure what beth meant to him or used to mean to him a few good friday nights but he remembered the way she used to undress for him shy and bold at the same time he remembered her shrugging out of an old sleeveless tshirt in a dark room unbuttoning her pants with one hand while she watched him watch the memory provoked a knot of tension in his belly not desire more like fear he rode past kindles house past bob ganishs ugly little ranch house no volkswagen then he drove past the hillside house where matt wheeler lived her car was in the driveway joey parked his motorcycle in a garage half a block away he approached the house along a line of hedges and used the camcorders zoom to spy on the doctors house but the blinds had all been pulled he waited about two hours until beth came out again looking somewhat pink in the cheeks he taped her climbing into the car and bumpjerking away from the curb bitch joey thought among the last things tom kindle moved down from his mountain cabin was his remington hunting rifle old but sturdy he hadnt used it much in the last few years hunting in the coast forests wasnt what it used to be too many hobby shooters had moved into what had once been some pretty secluded territory every autumn the woods grew a new crop of chubby cpas in orange flak jackets it made for a dangerous situation in kindles opinion he didnt relish getting shot by somebody who carried his ammunition in a nylon fanny pack but this talk of storms and travel made him nervous too so he brought down the remington and picked up some shells and took some practice shots at the knotholes of a longdead slippery elm back of his house the crack of the gunshots echoed a long time in the still air the bullets struck the decayed tree with a different and softer sound like a mallet head hitting a fence post kindle found his aim was reasonably accurate even after too many lax years but the rifle kicked harder than he remembered of course it wasnt the rifle that had changed he was getting old there was no denying the fact he bruised too easily went to bed too early and pissed too often old for shooting he wore the corrective lenses hed had made up a couple of years ago kindle was mildly myopic which affected his aim but the condition didnt seem to have worsenedwhich was good because where were the opticians since contact gone to heaven every one he sighted on a circle where the bark had dropped from the tree squeezed off a shot and missed by what appeared to be a good half foot damn he said and massaged his shoulder he could have gone inside where chuck makepeace was talking by radio to avery price the boston guy but kindle distrusted this business about ohio it was where everybody wanted to go a new promised land a place prepared worse it was where the helpers wanted them all to go boston and toronto were both travelling with helper guides and probably so were a bunch of small towns like buchanan at least they called it guiding another word for it was herding all the wild human beings were being assembled in one placeand kindle guessed there were other such places on other continents little reservations little corrals barns pens he didnt like that idea at all no doubt he thought the promises were true everybody would be defended against the weather the land would be fertile and the skies would be blue they would all be well cared for like cattle cattle were well cared for cattle were also slaughtered he put three more shots into the bole of the tree and then stopped because his right shoulder felt damn near dislocated the sky was a high luminous blue brushed with cloud the air smelled of brine there had been ground fogs every morning for the last week sunsets had been wide and vivid if old bones tell the weather kindle thought then something big was indeed about to break the last few days he had been sleeping restlessly this morning he had woken up at dawn in a cold sweat his body felt tight as if it was braced for something he turned and squinted across the bay the water was choppy whitecaps feathering in a stiff breeze the ocean kindle thought dear god what mischief had been committed out there storms were already raking the east coast as the president of the united states prepared to leave the white house he was alone in the building the first lady had abandoned her skin many weeks before elizabeth had been captivated by the greater world and had wanted to explore it in greater detail an impulse william understood in any case she had never liked bad weather it frightened her william on the other hand had been a devotee of thunder a relisher of storms it was not entirely his aim to relish the weather that had already begun to wreak so much destruction there were still many mortal human beings on the surface of the earth and many of them would die despite the best efforts of the helpers but it was the paradox of the senses that they did not make such distinctions a stormy sky made his skin tingle his pulse quicken no matter what the circumstances fundamentally though it wasnt the storms william wanted to see it was the countrythe nation he had once governed if govern was a meaningful verb that was why he had clung to the flesh even after elizabeth went home besides she was not really absent merely less accessible only a small minority of contactees had retained their corporate bodies and many of those like william had changed or were changing themselves in some critical way after all it wouldnt do to go tramping across the landscape in an old mans cumbersome shell therefore william went to bed for a week and while he slept the neocytes altered certain genetic instructions and ran his cell division at a feverish pace he radiated heat and when he woke he was many pounds lighter than he had been he was also younger he peered at himself in a fulllength mirror and saw a face he hadnt seen since the year the allies marched into berlin what age would he have guessed this boy to be twelve thirteen anticipating the change william had obtained some clothes to fit before he went to sleep he dressed himself in blue jeans and a tshirt and fresh running shoes the shoes were a little loose hed had to guess at the size but how glorious he felt newly minted he felt like a bright penny he felt restless and hungry the white house seemed suddenly bigger and more ridiculous than ever and he couldnt wait to get away from its stifling frills and history he thought of all those miles of america opening out from his doorstep a continent like a long empty beach william laughed a high childs laugh and ran down the steps of the main portico the sky that day was heavy and fat with clouds by january the albedo of the planet had risen considerably travellerengineered phytoplankton laced the surface waters of the tropics like crystals of fine glass they bounced sunlight back into the sky above these vast reflective ocean plains domes of moistureladen air punched into the troposphere convection clouds the shape of fists rose and flared into cirrostratus from orbit the tropics resembled a fractal image a fury of greater and lesser whorls the air above the sea was knotted with hurricane crowns individual pressure cells broke loose and travelled with the prevailing currents like tall ships of wind wound tighter as they penetrated the cooler latitudes some rode the monsoon drift into india and asia some rode the equatorial currents to australia or africa some followed the gulf stream across the east indies into the gulf of mexico a few rode the kuroshio current to japan and then veered eastward gaining new strength over the phytoplanktonheated north pacific and turned at last like lazy giants toward the coast of north america chapter hard rain the storm once a comfortably distant threat seemed to hurry closer as the days passed matt organized the men into a work crew nailing plywood sheets over accessible windows on the first floor of the hospital and crossing the plate glass with duct tape the hospital was a relatively new building constructed under a strict state building code for regional emergency centers essentially it was a threestory reinforcedconcrete bunker it stood on high ground in a neighborhood of middleincome residences and tall conifers the basement contained a records room generator room laundry room heating and plumbing and a kitchen and staff cafeteria matt chose the cafeteria to serve as shelter it was a cheerless cinderblock box painted salmon pink but it was spacious and well away from any exterior walls tables were shoved up against the service line to make room for mattresses and bedding by the first thursday in march the storm was still a day or two away according to the helper but the shelter was as complete as matt could make it and people had already begun to truck in their valuables protecting photographs souvenirs memories against the wind abby cushman served as coordinator keeping in close touch with all nine members of the emergency planning committee and relaying helper updates she conferred with matt by telephone and they chose friday at pm as the hour when everyone should be in the hospital basement doors closed exits bolted incidentally abby said i heard about rachel im terribly sorry matt matt accepted her condolences abby had recently lost her husband and two grandchildren to what rachel had called the greater world for a moment an unspoken understanding flowed between them then matt was hailed by bob ganish who had run out of duct tape abby said tomorrow at sixand everybody better be there the storm was preceded by strange gusts of warm air flurries of rain a racing overcast matt had expected something sudden a burst of weather as quick and violent as a spring thunderstorm tom kindle ferrying canned food down to the hospital kitchen told him it wouldnt be that way a typhoonwhich was what this was if not something even more powerful still namelesswasnt a localized event it was a vortex of air miles wide slow at the edges more intense as you moved toward the eye or as the eye moved toward you it would not come all at once but it would come quickly insidiously friday afternoon matt packed up a few things at the housethe family album rachel had cherished celestes letters a change of clothes it wasnt much but the act of selection was both agonizing and more difficult than he had anticipated by the time he had the trunk full and his car on the road his watch said the wind plucked at the car like a playful hand as he drove to the hospital high clouds tumbled inland from the ocean and the bay was so white with froth it seemed to be boiling the roads were already littered with twigs and branches he parked close to the emergency entrance but was drenched before he could dash inside with his two cartons of worldly goods the rain was cold and the wind so intense he had to put his shoulder against the door to close it again the basement cafeteria by contrast was warm and noisy he felt unreasonably cheered by the sight of other people by the babble of their voices abbys deadline was only a quarter of an hour away if were all here matt thought we can nail plywood over the last door and hunker down for the night he looked for abby cushman meaning to propose a final head count and a battening of the hatchesbut abby was on the phone it took him a second to work out the implication she waved him over its miriam flett miriam wont leave her houseits too stormy to drive she says she thinks shell be safe where she is matt checked his watch again how about if we send someone to pick her up would she be willing to go with an escort matt do we have time its getting bad awfully fast ask her if shes willing abby took her hand away from the receiver miriam miriam how about if we send somebody somebody to drive because were not sure your house is safe enough no but its not just the wind miriam theres the storm surge to worry about flooding yes you might be too close to the water i know but yes dear but but if we send someone how would that be fivefifty according to his timex abby covered the receiver again shes willing to go but she wants to know who to expect tell her ill be there in ten minutes matthew are you sure he shrugged im already wet wellyou be careful we cant afford to lose the town doctor tell miriam to make sure shes packed all right we wont barricade the door until youre back no but do it if you have to ordinarily it would have been a fiveminute drive from the hospital to miriams bungalow on bellfountain avenue allowing for the weather matt had estimated twice that outside he wondered whether he should have doubled it again coming around commercial he managed to stop just short of a toppled douglas fir the tree was a giant old growth left to mature next to a grocery store parking lot its trunk obstructed the road as neatly as a fence it would mean a detour but not a long one another block south and left to the highway he backed up sweating despite the cold the fallen tree made the storm seem suddenly real an immediate danger for matt a kind of emotional electricity always accompanied even a modest summer cloudburst he used to love the sight of a storm coming in around the crest of mt buchanan the thunder rolling up the slopes grotesque as it seemed maybe he had been getting the same kind of pleasure from this storm but the fallen tree had cut his euphoria as neatly as it divided the road this wasnt a cloudburst or an outofseason thunderstorm this was something immensely more powerful an engine wound on a column of air as tall as a mountain it had the power to lift to compel to move slash shatter to destroy it could pick up his car and spin it like a topprobably would if not now then in an hour or two hours it had already toppled this ancient fir and the storm had not even begun this was only its curtainopener its prelude he circled down to marina with his high beams on the storm had blotted up all but the last trickle of daylight streetlights cast a feeble iridescence into the gloom every house he passed was dark the contactees had turned out the lights before they left a universal primness as alien as their means of departure coming toward the highway along a familiar residential road he was startled to see a house with windows blazing yellow light even more startled when he recognized it as the house where jim and lillian bix had lived for the last ten years he looked at his watch fretted a moment then pulled over to the curb the house wasnt fortified against the storm the windows werent taped or shuttered matt hoped the building was simply unoccupied the lights left burning for no good reasonbut then he saw a shadow against the downstairs curtains a motion there and gone again he sighed and climbed out of the car he was instantly wet wetter than before the rain drilling through his topcoat he ran to the shelter of the porch knocked once waited and knocked again jim bix opened the door matt recognized him immediately although his friend had changed the last time he had seen jim bix was when they argued over lillians pregnancy jim insisting she didnt need prenatal medical care the travellers would protect her and jim had cut his hand and the blood had been viscous and very dark now jim stood in the doorway haphazardly dressed as tall and ugly as he had ever been but thinner and inhumanly pale his skin matt thought didnt look like skin at all it looked like some much finer membrane a transparent sheath drawn over bones as delicate as seashells his eyes in their china hollows were like dusty blue marbles as if the color of the irises had bled into the whites the pupils fixed and small were the bottomless black of night shadows matt thought of the empty skin he had inspected at tom kindles house it looked like his old friend wasnt far from that condition thank you for stopping jim said his voice was a husky whisper but its not necessary matt were fine you should get under shelter he said somewhat breathlessly so should you reallywere fine is lillian here jim hesitated still blocking the doorway matt called out lillian are you all right no answeror if there was it was masked by the roar of the wind along the overflowing eaves lillian would have been three months from her due date by now the baby matt said is that why youre still here when everyone else is gone jim for christs sake is it the baby the thing that had been jim bix peered frowning at him but failed to answer frustrated frightened matt pushed past him into the house jim fell away instantly from the pressure and matt sensed his lightness the terrible lack of solid weight behind his ribs lillian matt jim said it would be better if you left will you leave i want to see her she doesnt need medical care so you say i havent examined her since contact matt his friend looked at him mournfully youre right it was the baby that kept us here lillian wanted to finish the pregnancy but the stormit would be awkward to linger past tonight this is a private moment matt please leave what do you mean finish the pregnancy you mean shes having the baby not exactly we where is she matt dont force this on yourself the front door was still open distantly from somewhere down the street came the sharp sound of a window shattered by the wind he felt driven by the need to see lillian and speak to her or if not to know what had overtaken her know precisely what maze of transformation she had stumbled into maybe he wasnt being reasonable he didnt care she was his patient lillian he stepped into the kitchen it was empty lillian shouting up the stairs jim too fragile to stop this stood aside and gazed at him with a vast sadness in his cavernous eyes matt he said finally matt please stop shes in the bedroom off the hallway he hurried there and threw open the door lillian was naked on the bed her ribs were stark against her papery flesh and her eyes were as strange as her husbands though browner she raised her head to look at him and seemed unsurprised by his entrance her legs were spread there was no blood but matt recognized with horror that she had delivered something it resembled a shriveled homunculusa monkey fetus perhaps as preserved on the shelf of some medieval apothecary it was quite dry quite motionless his horror was overtaken by an immense weary sorrow he looked at lillian her face was bland she had wanted a baby very badly lillian he whispered dear god matt she said calmly you dont understand this is not the baby you must understand that this is only an end product the baby is with us hes been with us for some months now a boy hes alive matt do you understand me she tapped her head alive here and spread her arms here the greater world she smiled a bloodless paperthin smile we named him matthew he arrived at miriam fletts small house grateful for the anesthetizing noise of the storm the roar of the wind had become so intense it was hard to think which was good he didnt want to think miriam met him at the door a small woman her spine curved with what matt diagnosed as a mild osteoporosis her expression was grim youre late i had some trouble on the way over you look sick dr wheeler are you sick miriam i may very well be but we dont have time to worry about it we have to get you to shelter i told abby on the phonei have shelter it was an invitation to argue that matt did not accept are these your bags two pale gray tourister cases yes she admitted he picked them up well she said all right but theyre heavy be careful he carried them to the trunk of the car came back to help her into a bright yellow raincoat he took her arm but she resisted my journals what the door was open and the wind was shrieking my journals miriam we dont have time we would have had time if you hadnt been late she stamped her foot i wont leave without my journals have mercy matt thought how many minutes back to the hospital and what were his chances in that time of staying on the road damn it we simply cant theres no call for profanity shouting to make herself heard he closed his eyes where are they what the journals where are they she took him to the kitchen where it was marginally quieter and pointed to three shelves of bound notebooks so full of newspaper clippings they were bent as round as bread loaves matt gathered up an armful no miriam shrieked theyll get wet i can carry them to the car i cant make it stop raining dont be testy here she shrugged out of her raincoat and draped it over the journals miriamyoull be soaked to the bone ill dry out she said he took her to the car helped her inside and piled the journals at her feet she slammed the door to keep the rain away from the books narrowly missing the fingers of marts left hand he climbed in behind the wheel and advised her to fasten her seat belt the engine stuttered a little when he cranked it as if some moisture had crept in where it didnt belong he said as they pulled away from the curb have you talked to abby she must be worried the wipers on doublespeed did very little to improve visibility the road in front of him was a liquid blur i would have liked to talk to abby miriam said but the phone stopped working twenty minutes ago dr wheeler may i ask why you were so late believe me miriam it isnt something you want to know she examined him over the rims of her eyeglasses and rendered a judgment maybe youre right he took a different route back to the hospital longer but higher he was afraid of flooding down by the marina the road rose along the foothills of mt buchanan and matt was forced to crawl along in the breakdown lane away from the winds that had begun to sweep up the hillside with devastating force many of the houses he passed were already windowless and the road surface was littered with broken glass debris rolled past the car at a constant rateloose garbage bins cardboard boxes green matter at the apex of the drive where the road began a descent into the hospital district the battering rain suddenly eased matt spared a glance to the west the clouds skimming overhead at a dizzying speed had briefly lifted he could see the water of the bay driven up beyond the marina and nearly to commercial street the hulls of overturned pleasure boats bobbing level with the roofs of warehouses and restaurants the bay itself was a furious caldron though calmer than the sea beyond where waves the size of houses battered the stony southern tip of crab pot island the last daylight came from the westseemed to come from the storm itself a strange weak radiance he turned his attention back to the road and swerved to avoid a cartwheeling tree limb the wind made his steering awkward it was like driving into a tide of molasses dear god miriam said suddenly look at that and he looked again reluctantly toward the west offshore the racing overcast had begun to dimple black clouds grew lazy tails which spiraled toward the sea where they touched white foam erupted waterspouts matt thought he counted five of them it was fascinating almost hypnotic how they moved there was something awful about their twisting like the lash of a cats tail plucking the water here and there then lifting and falling again moving in the dim light moving toward shore a sudden curtain of rain obscured the view maybe you had better drive a little more quickly miriam said everything would have been all right abby cushman thought except for the ventilator ducts the storm was way too big and coming way too fast and matt wheeler was still out there somewhere hadnt even arrived at miriam fletts house when the phones went dead and then the lights in the basement cafeteria began to dim and tom kindle ambled away to some other corner of the building to start up a generator leaving abby alone with six more or less terrified people in the flickering dark and all this would have been endurable except for what she had begun to think of as the god damn noise she had no idea how the hospital was ventilated she knew only that several pressedtin ducts ran along the ceiling above the fluorescent fixtures and that the wind had somehow penetrated these conduits worse the wind had begun to play them like a pipe organ not any ordinary pipe organ abby thought but a pipe organ for mastodons and great whales a pipe organ that produced sounds too fundamental for the human ear perceptible only like fear in the hollow of the stomach the god damn noise had begun a little after six oclock it was innocuous at first almost a whisper then above that as the velocity of the wind increased came an intermittent keening noteeerie but bearable then the whisper rose to shouting volume the sound of a bathroom shower running full tilt and other noises began to creep in along the columns of hammered tin in particular a low wail that made abby think uncomfortably of a crying child and periodic creaks and pops as of sheet metal stressed beyond its tolerance she endured that though it made her feel absurd serving oreos and lukewarm coffee to six individuals huddled kneestochest on hospital mattresses on a cold linoleum floor pollyanna in a pantsuit she felt like a jennyass frankly but then bob ganish began to complain of claustrophobia it was too close in here he insisted especially with the fluorescents out and the damn battery lanterns casting such a dreadful low lightseemed like the air had gone bad so abby had to sit with him and share her cookies and change the subject hey what was the best sale he ever made down there at highway five ford the dropdead pinnacle of his sales career and bob smiled nervously and launched into a description of the nearcriminal flogging of a used pinto the monologue lasted twenty minutes by abbys watch including details on the financing all the while the ducts screaming and abby beginning to feel that ganishs hysteria by some reverse osmosis was draining into her okay all that and dr wheeler still out in the storm but then the wind made a sound that was in abbys imagination precisely the sound the last t rex might have made dying in a pool of hot cretaceous mud her grandson cory had been a dinosaur buff and to top it all off that was the moment paul jacopetti picked to have his goddamn heart attack abby was startled by the sudden commotion of voices she turned away from bob ganish spilling her coffee onto his pant leg ouch abby hey jacopetti lay faceup on his mattress his hands clutched over his chest his face was pale and he was breathing rapidly wheezing worse everyone seemed to expect abby to do something about it she hurried to jacopettis mattress and crouched over him paul what is it im having a fucking heart attack he gasped what does it look like her first impulseshe was instantly ashamed of itwas to slap him tell him not now this isnt the time or the place you idiot have your heart attack later instead she asked not too intelligently does your chest hurt yes it hurts hurts like a son of a bitch he closed his eyes and grimaced abby looked up everyone had gathered in a circle around the mattress their attention on jacopetti or worse on her the ventilator ducts screamed abby heard the sound of a window breaking perhaps up on the second floor a nervewrenching sound conducted directly into her eardrums she said half to herself i dont know what to do then as the last buckles of restraint broke loose louder i dont know what to do stop staring at me she felt a hand on her shoulder gently pulling her asidebeth porters hand abby bit her lip but retreated from the mattress dazed she watched beth kneeling over paul jacopetti mr jacopetti beth said mr jacopetti can you hear me he opened his eyes you what do you want mr jacopetti you have to tell me whats wrong perhaps the pain had gotten worsejacopetti seemed suddenly more malleable chest hurts show me where beth said jacopetti raised his right hand and drew a circle on his shirt above the breastbone there in the center nod how about your arm does your arm hurt at all no how about your breathing tight gendy beth levered back the mans head so his chin jutted up mr jacopetti i know this is a personal question but are those false teeth dentures he managed why can you take them out in case you fall asleep or anything its safer or i can take them out for you jacopetti pried out his teeth abby had always been a little frightened of this manhis barrelshaped body his booming voice his invincible cynicism but jacopetti without his teeth looked altogether less threatening his cheeks seemed to collapse inward giving him an old mans gummy frown jacopetti looked up at his audience thuck you he saidthuck all oth you we could use some more light beth said hurriedly maybe if everybody would just sit back down they did though abby stayed close mad at herself for failing this test if it hadnt been for the noise mr jacopetti beth said are you nauseated nod feel like you might throw up maybe could somebody fetch a towel just in case chuck makepeace dashed for the bathroom mr jacopetti listen to me did you ever have this pain before not as bad but youve had it before nod seen a doctor about it no it always went away nod okay beth said thats good i think what you have isnt a bad heart attack i think its angina itll probably pass if you lie still joey commoner leaning against the wall with a strained expression said how would you know hush abby told him and got a sullen glare in exchange bob ganish his claustrophobia forgottenmisplaced along with his common sense abby thoughtoffered this man should be in a hospital jacopetti i am in a hothpital you athholel ganish reddened i mean he needs proper medical attention abby took the salesman aside a second time i know he does bob but our proper medical attention seems to be lost in the storm lets sit down shall we she looked at her watch sevenfortyfive how much worse could this weather get much worse she supposed the eye the helper had told her would probably pass directly over buchanan possibly around midnight and that was only half the storm i wish she muttered somebody would turn off this goddamned noise matt felt as if he had fallen into some peculiar time warp the smaller the distance between himself and his destination the more slowly he was forced to proceed the enemy wasnt so much windthough that was bad enoughnor even miriam fletts relentless backseat driving the enemy was visibility more precisely invisibility all traces of daylight had passed the rain was continuous and dense as fog it carried with it tiny particles of salt and something else a crystalline dust some sort of sea life matt presumed the effect of this was to obscure his vision so completely that he turned onto campbell road the direct route to the hospital without any certainty that he had chosen the right intersection there were no landmarks nothing perceptible beyond five or six feet from the car even in the high beams he drove hugging the right side of the road scanning for the sign that marked the entrance to the hospital then worrying that hed passed itmaybe it was set too far back from the tarmac a particularly strong wind rocked the car up on its righthand wheels miriam sucked in her breath i should have stayed home home might be underwater by now matt said try not to worry miriam we dont have far to go and well be safe at the hospital can you guarantee that stake my life on it not funny dr wheeler not meant to be desperate he took the next available right it looked like the entrance to the hospitalthe shrub on the corner seemed familiar but it wasnt the hospital he identified on close approach an unfamiliar yellow speed bump a parking lot that curved the wrong way finally the broken window of the local eleven miriams hands were clenched together in her lap arthritic knuckles knotted together she said are we stopping for snacks it wasnt the hospital but it was at least a landmark matt tried to recall the relationship of the eleven to buchanan general hed driven this route at least twice a week for years but when he tried to map it in his head was the eleven before the hospital certainly close to it he thought so but how many yards exactly was there another store en route possibly a camera store he seldom stopped at any of these shops they were vague in his mind he navigated turtlefashion back to campbell road and crawled onward miriam gasped as a yardlong tree limb came whirling out of the darkness and struck the rear left window the glass starred but didnt shatter miriam whispered something inaudible matt clenched his teeth and drove he slowed where the curb yielded to a driveway on the right he exchanged a glance with miriam then turned the wheel this might be the hospital it probably was better be the access lane seemed to crawl on forever in front of the car matt began to entertain the possibility that he had driven from the eleven into a horizonless limbo of rain and wind all landmarks erased he fought the temptation to check his watch every thirty seconds try to calculate his progress he was suddenly aware of the pungent smell of the sealed automobile his own sweat mingled with the lighter sourer odor of miriam and the reek of wet upholstery and wet clothing he was grateful when a brick wall loomed up in the twin circles of his headlightseven more grateful when he recognized it as the east wall of buchanan general he pulled abreast of the emergency entrance thank god miriam said matt switched off the engine but left the lights on ill come around to your side wait for me well go in together he didnt say it but he was afraid miriam was light enough that the wind might simply sweep her away she nodded the door was wrenched out of his hand as soon as he opened it the wind matt thought had made everything dangerous even an ordinary act like opening a car door the door banged against its stops and bounced back whacking his hip matt stepped aside and pushed it closed sparing miriam more than a momentary blast of salty rain he fumbled around the hood of the car with his hands braced against the cold metal the wind was nearly strong enough to lift him upcertainly strong enough to knock his feet out from under him if he took a miscalculated step the combination of wind and rain was blinding with his eyes pressed tight in the darkness every surface of his body awash it was as if the world had been reduced to some few essential elements the wind the automobile the wet concrete under his feet variables in a complex equation he groped along miriams side of the car until he found the door handle then he steadied himself took as deep a breath as the wind allowed and opened the door instantly the door kited into its stops but this time matt was ready for it he wedged his body against the door frame and held it fully open he held out his hand to miriam but she drew away matt leaned into the meager shelter of the car where he could see miriamblurrilyin the faint illumination of the map light whats wrong she hissed back my journals christ in a red wagon matt thought dr wheeler you can leave whats in the trunk but i want my journals the journals were bundled at her feet still wrapped in her yellow raincoat matt leaned over her conscious of the wet woolen odor of her skirtit smelled like a wet dog he tied the arms of the raincoat together to make a sort of bag for the journals a tedious process that left him plenty of time to reflect on the absurdity of his position standing ass to the wind in the midst of the most powerful typhoon to approach the oregon coast since the ice age the rain was sluicing into the car now soaking miriam but matt had ceased to care let her get wet she deserved to get wet he couldnt shake the memory of those funnel clouds snakedancing toward shore couldnt shake a suspicion that one of them might reach down and fold him into the dark wing of the sky when the journals were bundled together he stood and offered miriam his right hand this time she took it moaning as she stepped out of the car as soon as she was standing he put his right arm around her waist and tugged her halflifted her in the direction of the emergency door only these few steps matt told himself one two three but the hospital door resisted when he tried to pull it open the wind nonot just the wind he banged a fist against it the door was quarterinchthick wiremesh glass inside there was a dim light perhaps motion but he couldnt see much through the blur of rain feeling panic like a third presence something large perhaps just over his shoulder matt pulled the wide handle of the door a third time and this time it opened outward he hurried miriam inside she stumbled a few steps then righted herself and took the package of journals from matt thank you she said breathlessly not looking at him brushing water from the raincoat bundle that was harrowing tom kindle pulled the door closed behind them kindle held a hammer in his hand a sheet of plywood and two pine planks were leaning against one wall matt sat down on the tiled floor panting water ran off him in all directions he looked at kindle you were about to board up that door yup you couldnt have waited it didnt seem wise kind of a vote of confidence isnt it kindle smiled welcome back anyway abby cushman met him where the stairs opened into the hospital basement she briefed him on paul jacopettis medical crisis and added hes resting easier now though the pain hasnt entirely gone away ill look at him but i need to change into dry clothes first do me a favormake sure miriam gets dried off too maybe you can find some fresh clothes to fit her all right but abby hesitated matti should tell you i nearly fell apart when paul got sick it was a little embarrassing wellmore than a little abby youve done fine without you we wouldnt all be here you cant handle every crisis that comes alongnobody could but i could have done better matt i dont know anything at all about first aid the most i ever did at home was spray bactine on scraped knees maybe sometime you could give us a short course i will should have done it months ago weve all been busy but speaking of first aid beth was a wonder she didnt do anything in particularmainly convinced mr jacopetti to take his dentures out but she calmed him right down and it looked like she knew what she was doing you have a student there i taught her cpr gave her a firstaid manual to read at home well shes a quick study anyhow bright young woman when she wants to be matt said in clean dry denimand despite the shriek of the ventilator ducts which abby had warned him aboutmatt felt percent better it was his experience that bad weather tended to shrink a room the basement cafeteria a cavernously large space had contracted to circles of light around the battery lanterns it wasnt just a room anymore it was a huddling place a dry cave he spoke to paul jacopetti and read his blood pressure which was slightly but not dangerously elevated doc jacopetti said matt unwound the sphygmomanometer cuff from jacopettis pale arm it was always the difficult ones who called you doc yes mr jacopetti can i put my thucking teece back certainly beth was worried you might pass out but that doesnt seem likely at this point and matt looked away politely while jacopetti slipped his dentures into his mouth everybody says angina jacopetti said its not a heart attack its angina okay good but how is that better it feels like a fucking heart attack theyre not necessarily different angina pectoris is the pain you feel when your hearts not getting enough blood through the coronary arteries the heart works harder to compensate and it simply gets tiredthe way any muscle hurts if you overwork it its a symptom of coronary disease but in your case the heart itself seems to be basically sound we can treat the angina with drugs called beta blockers which help the muscle ease up a little bit jacopetti was frowning trying to digest this information how long do i take these drugs probably the rest of your life matt thought if we can find a supply and keep them from going bad it was one of those facts of life he still hadnt grown accustomed to no new pharmaceuticals no more free pencils or coffee mugs from drug companies promoting tofranil or prozac no more tofranil no more prozac no more insulin come to that or penicillin or measles vaccine not unless he could locate every ounce of every significant drug and store it somehow refrigerate it prolong its active life must get this advice to the boston and toronto people matt thought should have done it sooner christ everything had gotten away from him these last few months he had been blinkered by his fear for rachel transfixed by her slow evolution but rachel was gone it was past time to pick up the fragments of his life including his work youll probably be on medication for some time matt said but i cant tell you for sure until we do a more thorough workup not until the storm passes obviously if it ever does jacopetti said in the meantime it still hurts ill go up to the pharmacy and find you something lie still while youre waiting all right dont exert yourself im not going fucking dancing jacopetti said matt checked in with abby before venturing upstairs she might have fumbled the jacopetti crisis but she was doing a fine job as den mother she had helped miriam flett into a dry outfit and settled her onto a mattress with coffee and oreos now abby was contemplating the possibility of a hot communal mealmaybe a little later if tom gets his generator working and we can run the microwave i think that would cheer people up dont you its hard enough just keeping track of everybody some of us want to move into the hallwayits quieter there and closer to the bathroom would that be all right i dont see why not people are scattering all over i dont know where beth got to or joey for that matter is the whole basement safe oh probably but we should encourage people to stay together and i dont want anyone running around upstairs upstairs is dangerous it could be if not now later but youre going up there only for a moment abby matt you look terribly tired maybe you should lie down for a while soon i just have to pick up some pills for mr jacopetti poor man sick on a night like this matt i had the most terrible thought about him she lowered her voice i thought he was having a heart attack because it was the best possible way to annoy me for maybe three seconds i really thought that should i be ashamed of myself abby if id been here i might have had the same suspicion she looked pleased and grateful really really check in when you come back downstairs he promised he would at that moment the thunder began the storm was complex peculiara whole inventory of storms matt thought one layer upon another the stairs ran upward through a cinderblock stairwell at the southwestern corner of the hospital the groundfloor fire exit had been boarded over but there hadnt been time to seal the second and thirdstory windows one had broken a trickle of rainwater ran down the stairs between marts feet the thunder a sudden new presence was continuous it had taken matt a moment to identify it as thunder not the approach of some mechanical leviathan from the west with the thunder lightning the lightning lit the stairwell from above with a diffuse reddishpurple glow it flickered but was never wholly absent matt supposed abby was right he was tired mortally tiredtoo tired at any rate to be frightened of this new evolution of the storm it wasnt even a hurricane it was something larger still nameless peak winds in a hurricane were what miles per hour maximum and in this tsunami of wind currently breaking against the flank of the coast range three hundred miles per hour around the eye wall more and how powerful was that powerful enough to level buchanan matt supposed and drown half of it in the storm surge as he climbed from the hospital basement to the ground floor he listened to the wind gusting through the upper reaches of the hospital slamming doors and rattling gurney carts down vacant corridors and he listened for the voice of the storm itself a tympani growl alive organic pervasive it was out there devouring his town uprooting it and devouring it he thought of jim and lillian bix wholly changed and wholly alien inhabiting their paperthin bodies only long enough to consummate some process he didnt understand or wish to understand the translation of lillians unborn child and the delivery incidental and trivial of its derelict hulk he supposed jim and lillian had abandoned their own skins by now their skins like so many others must have been carried up by the typhoon wind perhaps to the high atmosphere somewhere peaceful above the rain matt shook away these troubling thoughts and concentrated on the task at hand pharmaceuticals were stored at various key points around the hospital so that each floor had an accessible supply these caches were lockedthe drugs stored there included narcoticsbut matt had been carrying a key and a duplicate since september he followed the corridor from the stairwell and cursed himself for not having had the wits to bring a flashlight kindle had hooked up a gasoline generator in the basement but it was only feeding the emergency lights incandescent bulbs at tenyard intervals the drug cupboard a room approximately large enough for one person to stand in without touching the shelves was dark as night inside matt stood blinking hoping his eyes would adjust boxes and labels would reveal themselves in the faint glow leaking from the corridor they didnt he stepped back into the hallway pondering the problem he could go back for a flashlight but there was an element of time here he didnt trust that elevating rumble of thunder the new intensity of the storm he hurried to the nursing station down the corridor for years hazel kirkwood had been the clerical day nurse on this station she had her own desk at the rear away from the busy corridor nurse kirkwood matt recalled had been notorious for her tenminute breaks every hour when she would duck outsideor into the stairwell furtively in bad weatherto indulge a cigarette habit he rummaged in nurse kirkwoods desk drawers he found an abundant supply of bic pens paperclips and knobby pink erasers a stapler and a pocket calculator and a single lonely plasticwrapped tampon and lastly at the back of the bottommost drawer a package of filter kents with a matchbook tucked into the cellophane he took the matchbook into the supply cupboard one match to home in on the propranolol for paul jacopetti another match to empty a cardboard box of tongue depressors a third match as he filled the box with anything nonperishable he hadnt already crammed into his gladstone bag antibiotics painkillers a bag of sterile cotton all the while berating himself for not having done this before the storm a last match to doublecheck his work then he turned and found joey commoner blocking the doorway he was too weary to interpret thisjoeys presence merely baffled himuntil he saw the knife it wasnt a big knife but it caught the faint light from the hallway the blade glittered as it trembled in joeys hand joey said i want you to stay the hell away from her his voice was shrill and barely controlled and it occurred to matt that whatever else might be troubling him joey was also very frightened of the storm you shouldnt be up here its dangerous up here i dont want you near her joey said cant we talk about this later there was a guncrack of thunder above the general dull roar we could end up with a wall on top of us fine joey said just tell me youll stay away from her and we can go downstairs matt was suddenly deeply tired of all this the storm miriam jacopetti joey it was all a single phenomenon and it was too much it made him weary he dropped the pharmaceuticals and stepped forward joey thrust the knife wildly the blade nipped his forearm slicing his shirt digging into the skin beneatha vivid immediate pain matt stepped back and came up against a shelf the walls were mercilessly close there wasnt room to swing his arms and joey was poised at the entrance like a snake but marts resentment was irresistible it propelled him forward the situation was childish inappropriate a frustration not to be borne he kept his eye on joeys knife hand and thought about getting inside the periphery of it knocking joey out of the way in the corridor he would have room to maneuver he took a second step forward joey shrieked dont make me do this and slashed the air the knifepoint missed but narrowly just say youll stay away from her thats all you have to do thats he didnt finish his sentence there was suddenly a taller silhouette behind himtom kindle kindle twisted joeys arm up behind his back until joey yelped and opened his hand matt came out of the supply cupboard and backed away from the two men kindle pushed joey against the wall of die corridor and let him go joey spun around slowly kindle moved away hands spread then he bent and picked up the knife peered at it swiss army knife kindle said real good joey after you kill him you can trim his nails fuck joey said rubbing his abused arm i didnt come up here to kill anybody matt clamped his hand over the cut on his forearm it was superficial but messy hed left a trail of blood spots on the green linoleum floor kindle shook his head you came a little too close in that case stupid thing to do wave a knife at somebody theres only ten of us in town joey is that too many for you no answer is there some reason you came up here joey nodded he fucked beth kindle did a small double take then he pocketed the knife matt any truth to the charge i taught her cpr matt said shes been getting firstaid training thats not what i hear joey said what do you hear i hear the doctors fucking her who told you that selfrighteously beth did there was a momentary silence if you could call it silence matt thought with the wind banging the walls kindle said joey a woman might say a thing and not mean it especially if she thought she was being neglected a woman might think what would piss off joey the most what could i say to really aggravate this asshole who hasnt even asked me the time of day since christmas joey seemed to ponder the idea maybe matt thought on some level he was flattered by it i just wanted to warn him warn him what that youll kill him if he hangs around your exgirlfriend fuck you joey said mildly fuck me because i dont want the town doctor knifed by a jealous asshole christs sake joey how is it even your business what beth gets up to shes not your wife and even if she was adulterys not a capital crime you were pissed off and you wanted to wave that knife and make yourself feel better but thats so stupidin the situation were in thats absolutely suicidally stupid and that surprises me frankly cause youre not as stupid as people think joey looked up wary of a trap not sure whether hed been insulted kindle went on i know what people say what they used to say nobody held joey commoner in high esteem but thats changed a little maybe you noticed you set up the radio that shithead makepeace took it over joey said i dont get close to it anymore point is it wouldnt be there without you who found boston on the twentymeter band who found toronto shit joey youre the only individual in town who can read a circuit diagram you know that so why do a stupid thing like this come up here wavin a little red pocketknife just because some girl tickled your nuts you dont understand joey said but there was a note of conciliation in it a hint of regret maybe kindle said if the doctor agreesand its his call hes the one who got cutmaybe we can not mention this incident downstairs not ruin your reputation for being smart joey said nothing waited his eyes averted matt said i guess i can go along with that joey looked at him expressionlessly get on downstairs kindle said and consider yourself lucky matt watched him amble down the corridor to the stairwell the door opened and closed inaudibly the sound of it buried under the noise of the storm kindle turned to matt some medical advice from a civilian you ought to bind that cut he bandaged it quickly and rolled his sleeve down to cover the evidence since youre here maybe you can help me carry some pharmaceuticals sure enough kindle said i brought a flashlight by the way abby mentioned youd gone up without one thanks and thank you for what you did with joey i didnt do anything except derail him ive been worried hed do some shit like this when joey gets mad he gets mad all over you know what i mean he said he didnt come up here to kill me but it might have happened its not just temper its like some old hurt he never paid back theres a button in joey that shouldnt get pushed you did a good job turning him around yeah for now but in the long run kindle looked unhappy people are such shits matthew they can be joey sure as hell can be youre still shaking its been a long night damn noise kindle said they had been shouting to make themselves heard his voice was raw matthew a little more friendly advice you have to watch out for yourself i think we all do sure we do kindle looking vaguely embarrassed gathered a carton of pharmaceuticals from the shelf so what do you think are we gonna live through the night the roar of the storm had increased a notch it sounded like some disaster more tangible than wind trucks colliding trains derailing in the dark probably matt said but we should get downstairs and stay there come morning kindle said there wont be much left of this town matt gave abby some of the sterile cotton which she wadded into her ears it does help though it makes conversation difficult but no ones talking much anyhow matt did you hurt your arm the bandage had seeped a little cut myself on some glass nothing serious get some rest if you can he promised he would he medicated paul jacopetti then found a mattress for himself and stretched out on it everybody had moved into the hallway where it was quieter beth and joey were three mattresses apart glaring at each other from time to time tom kindle wadded towels under the stairway door where some rainwater had begun to trickle through everyone else was simply waiting waiting for the storm to peak matt thought or for the ceiling to drop whichever came first and because there was nothing to see of the storm the temptation was to listen to it try to decipher every rumble that penetrated the basement after a time abby consulted tom kindle and the two of them managed to tap enough generator power to run a microwave ovensuddenly abby was distributing cafeteria trays of steaming instant dinner shed been right matt thought about the restorative power of hot food it was an act of defiance we may be huddled like rats in a hole but we dont have to eat like rats dinner ended with a crash that seemed to shake the concrete under their feet jesus chuck makepeace said we must have lost part of the building kindle who was collecting empty trays said maybe more likely something hit us one of those big trees at the west end of the parking lot maybe jacopetti painfree but still pale was impressed by the idea what would it take to pick up one of those trees and fling it that distance whats a tree like that weigh eight nine hundred pounds i never weighed one kindle said pick it up like a stick jacopetti marvelled pick it up and throw it matt checked his watch ten fortyfive eleven fifteen beth porter said she thought she smelled smoke maybe coming down through the ventilators kindle said he didnt think it was likely but for safetys sake he was going to shut off the generator get those battery lamps going eye of the storm should be overhead soon the hallway seemed colder without the overhead light maybe it was colder hadnt been that warm to begin with matt thought he helped abby distribute blankets another huge crash shook the hallway and another directly after it christ matt thought what must it be like out there he tried to picture an exterior world so transformed that douglas firs flew through the air like javelins at half past eleven there was a new and even louder crash a rending roar that shook the foundationthe vibration seeming to come from beneath up through the concrete through the bedrock lost part of the building for sure jacopetti said maybe a whole floor you may be right kindle said he added into marts ear as nearly a whisper as conditions permitted i hope you didnt go to too much trouble to cure this man abby said i think i might scream she sat down pale in the lantern light fair warning people we must be near the eye wall matt thought a wall of wind harder than brick wind become a substance solid deadly he thought of that wind sheering at the broken stump of the hospital and prying at what was beneathrooting for these few human lives like a terrier digging up a nest of field mice the foundation shook again matt looked at his watch perversely the battery had chosen this moment to die the display was blank when he rapped it the watch said abby do you have the time it was twelve twentyfive when the wind suddenly paused the freighttrain roar faded gradually the air stirred dust rose from the floor of the hallway and danced in the lantern light eye of the storm kindle said the building is exhaling my ears popped abby said matt thought of gradients of air pressure steep as a mountain the engine of the storm worse bob ganish said my nose is bleeding there was a dreamlike quality to the stillness matt had heard that in the eye of a hurricane you could look up and see starsit was that clear he tried to imagine buchanan or the ruins of buchanan enclosed in a perfect rotating column of cloud the moon shining on a landscape of wet rubble warmth what remained of it seemed to drain from the basement matt wrapped his blanket around himself and saw others doing likewise abby appeared hypnotized by the calm itll come again wont it just as hard maybe harder and all at once like a fist isnt that true kindle moved onto abbys mattress and put an arm around her true but then were through the worst of it after that abby its only a question of waiting bob ganish said i need some cotton for this nosebleed im a bloody mess here matt attended to it in the dim light the blood on ganish s shirt looked dark shiny rust he worked mechanically still thinking about moonlight oh abby said sadly i can hear it its coming back matt breathed shallowly listening she was right here it came that freighttrain roar it was advancing across the water onto the land marching uphill to buchanan general impossible not to think of it as a living thing vast and ponderous and stupid and malicious leviathan best sit down matthew kindle said my god he marvelled listen to it come the helperanchored to the high ground where city hall recently stoodhad witnessed the destruction of the town it assembled vision from disparate wavelengths peering deeply into the storm it saw what no mortal human could have seen it saw the storm advance it saw the ocean flood the lower reaches of the town it saw tornadoes dipping from the dark shelf of the clouds it stood in the calm center of the eye seeing what matt wheeler had only imagined moonlight shimmering on splintered tree stumps loose bricks battered truck bodies fractured bridge abutments fragments of drywall road tar torn shingles torrents of rainwater while the microscopic shells of traveller phytoplankton hovered in the still air a silver mist then the eye wall approached once more from the west eclipsing the moona black horn of wind the helper saw buchanan general hospital as the eye wall devoured it the storm had already sheered away the hospitals roof and much of its third floor this new impact was more than the weakened structure could withstand chunks of concrete whirled upward trailing rustred structural rods like severed arteries pieces of the hospital joined fragments of other buildings in a stew of airborne debris lab coats tangled with tree limbs bedsheets embraced splintered glass there were human beings in the hollow under the ruins of the building but not even the helpers powerful eyes could see into the earth the building came down in a noise of wind and destruction so intense that matt didnt register it as a sound he was simply battered by it it knocked him down he saw abby screaming but he couldnt hear her the others shrank into their mattresses making themselves small the cafeteria ceiling collapsed fractured concrete poured through the remains of the west wall of the building matt saw this clearly from the hallway through the open cafeteria doors the doors were open because the storm wind rushing through the lapsed ceiling forced them open if we had been in there matt thought if we had stayed in the cafeteria a gap had been opened to the tortured sky the wind penetrated the hallway in a single terrible thrust tim belanger took the brunt of the assault he had laid out his mattress by the entrance to the cafeteria a mistake the windheavy with dust wet almost tarrycracked his head against the wall and tossed him aside the wind picked up the battery lanterns and threw them down the corridor tom kindle managed to snag one but the rest winked out as they struck the stairwell door kindle waved the single lantern beckoning with it shouting something inaudible matt fought his way upwind to tim belanger the city hall clerk was unconscious matt took a breath full of grit and dirty rain and began dragging belanger away from the cafeteria toward the faint beacon of kindles lamp breathing was the hard part everything would be okay matt thought if only he could extract enough oxygen from the moist sludge that had replaced the air every breath filled his mouth with grit and drove a dagger into his lungs he fell into a rhythm of inhaling hawking spitting exhaling the dead weight of belanger became an intolerable burden and several times matt considered leaving him behind it would be the wise thing to do he decided save yourself maybe belanger was already dead but his hands wouldnt let go of the injured mans arm traitorous hands he bumped into abby cushman who gestured left a doorway matt pulled belanger over the threshold kindle was braced against the wall holding his lantern into the corridor he saw belanger and said thats it matthew help me close this door they wrestled it shut kindle hawked and spat a black wad onto the floor grab that twobyfour well nail this thing shut then see how people are doing kindle took a hammer from his carpenters belt he drove nails into the framing of the door while matt braced the twobyfour and struggled to clear his throat this was some kind of furnace or plumbing room from what matt could seeconcrete floor exposed pipes a huge water heater the air in the room was dense with suspended particles but it was relatively still eventually some of this garbage would settle out in the meantimeany of you having trouble breathing try wrapping a cloth over your nose and mouth jacopetti weakly this isnt the linen cupboard a hank of shirt or something for those who feel they need it with the door barred matt set about investigating injuries he took the lantern from kindle and called beth to help tim belanger first the city hall clerk beginning to recover from a bad blow to the head his hair was sticky with blood but the injury didnt appear to be severeas far as matt could tell under these primitive circumstances miriam flett was having trouble catching her breath but so were they all he encouraged her to spit if she needed to were not being formal tonight miriam she managed i can see that she held a ragged plastic shopping bag clutched in her left handthe journals jacopetti had suffered some recurrence of his angina but it wasnt cripplingthats normal right doc i mean if a fucking building falls on you i think were all doing pretty well we dont have blankets abby said mournfully she coughed gagged coughed again we dont have anything theres water in that tank at the back kindle said i checked this place before the storm maintenance guys used to come down here for their breaks we got a card table around the corner and a coin machine full of candy bars do we have any change abby asked no kindle said but i got this hammer the wind howled on but the storm was breaking matt thought that was the basic fact they had come through the worst and now the storm was wearing itself out on the heel of the continent morning would come in a few hours overhead the wind still gnawed the raw ruin of the building but the wind had begun to ease tom kindle joined matt sat down wearily with his arms on his knees kindle had been a great strength but he was starting to show his fatigue his face was caked with dust his hair was a grayblack tangle if the hospitals gone kindle said there cant be much left of buchanan i guess not matt said knowing the sentiments of people once this storm clears well probably be heading east probably pity about the town being gone was it gone matt had avoided the thought but it must be what could stand up to the wind commercial street gone city hall gone the marina washed out to sea dos aguilas gone old quarry park a wilderness of mud and fallen trees and his house the house where he had raised his daughter the house where celeste had died gone but that isnt the town matt said the thought came to him as he spoke it rising out of his fatigue and his sorrow the people in this room are the town were the town then maybe the town survived after all kindle said maybe it did matt thought maybe the town would live to see morning part four the harvest chapter traveller the boy had come a long way he had the skinny body of a twelveyearold toughened by his time on the road his eyes were blue his hair a dusty brown he wore jeans a plain white tshirt loose at the waist and a fresh pair of hightop sneakers he liked the sneakers laced tight they braced his ankles they felt good on his feet a second skin he rode an expensive nakamura mountain bike he had found in a store window in wichita the bike had grown dusty as he pedaled north on crossing the border from utah into idaho last night camped at an exxon station the boy had cleaned the bike with a damp rag he had oiled the freewheel and the brake calipers the cables and derailleurs he had tightened the chain and the crank arm and adjusted the bearings this morning the small nak ran like a dream the air was cool the sky was a hard glassy bluethe color of a marble he had once owned the boy wheeled through sagebrush plains where interstate followed the snake river humming to himself as absentminded as a bird he liked the way the wind tossed his hair and snapped his tshirt behind him like a flag in eighty days he had seen a great deal of the country he had crossed the mississippi at cairo rolled through arkansas into texas and sheltered for three weeks in the empty city of dallas while storms raged overhead he had skirted the mexican border at el paso and headed north along the rio grande then west again on across the continental divide he had pedaled through the immense deserts of the southwest landscapes as large and strange as the moon a cloudburst caught him in arizona filling the arroyos spiking the arid hills with lightning and drenching him before he could find shelter but he was never ill he was never tired now he was looking forward to the salmon river mountains some of the most impassable territory in the continental united statesa wilderness of larch and hemlock cedar and spruce at noon he stopped at a nameless little farm town for lunch he broke into a gas station cooler and pulled out two bottles of grape crush drank one immediately and saved the second for later in some towns like this one the electricity was still workingthe soda was cool if not icy in the handimart next door he found tv dinners still preserved in a working freezer that was unusual the freezers didnt always last without maintenance even if the electricity was on the tv dinners were past their bestby date but only a little the boy opened one and heated it in the stores microwave oven it tasted okay he drank the second bottle of grape crush it turned his lips purple the boy carried some items in a bag attached to the rear of the bike after lunch he opened the bag and took out a hata khaki bush hat from a huntingandfishing store back east it didnt fit too well but it kept the afternoon sun off his face and neck he climbed onto his bike and pedaled down the white line the precise meridian of the empty road the wheel bearings sang a high keen note into the silence he passed irrigation farms big oreida potato plantations gone brown in the absence of humanity then more sage prairie as he followed the snake westward near dusk as he was thinking about breaking camp the boy came around a slow curve into another tiny road town where a number of trucks and campers had parked in a string he saw the motion of people among the vehicles the boy realized he knew a few things about who these people were and where they were going their presence was troubling it demanded a decision paths diverged here one way the salmon river mountains a last dalliance before he went home the other way a less certain future it was perhaps not an accident that he had come across these people the boy stood with his bike between his legs frowning at the choice then he sighed and walked his bicycle to the nearest camper the camper was a dusty travelaire the rear door was open and an elderly woman sat in the doorway with a book across her knees she wore a baggy cotton print dress and a blue quilt jacket over it her hair was gray and sparse she was reading by the light of the low sun squinting at the ricepaper pages of a king james bible she looked up at the tick of the nakamuras oiled bearings the boy stopped a yard away he stood beside his bicycle gazing at her she gazed back hello she said at last cautiously the boy said hi she set the book aside i havent seen you before i was riding this way from the east are you alone he nodded no mother no father theyre dead oh well thats too bad it was a long time ago are you going somewhere nowhere in particular are you hungry it had been hours since lunch he nodded i have some food the woman said fresh eggs and cured beef and a little stove to cook it over would you care to join me all right the boy said he followed her into the camper there was a propane stove inside she lit it and put a skillet over the flame the camper began to warm up the day had been sunny and fairly nice but nights were cold this time of year the boy looked forward to sleeping inside he looked around the camper while she cooked there wasnt much to see a few books including the dogeared bible a stack of scrapbooks that must have soaked up water at some time in the pastthe covers were round the pages wrinkled some clothes unwashed he sat at a small table the folding kind eggs sizzled in the skillet the woman hummed a tune the boy recognized it it was an old song unforgettable nat king cole made that one famous long time ago he waited while she said grace then tucked into a plate of scrambled eggs heres the salt the woman said heres pepper im boiling water for coffee do you drink coffee he nodded mouth full i suppose ill have to introduce you around she picked at her own eggs were a travelling group were going east there are other people east were from oregon the coast there was a terrible storm and thenoh but its a long story you can hear it all later tell me are you tired a little you must have come a long way on that bicycle he nodded yes she said ill introduce you tonight theres a meeting sort of a town meeting if you call us a town we can leave early if you like but i think people will want to know youre here my lord i dont even know your name pardon my manners im miriam miriam flett and you are william he said william just william misplaced your last name he shrugged well im pleased to meet you anyway william and im sure everyone else will be too she took a delicate bite of eggs eating slowly oldlady style it wont be troublesome she said there are only ten of us well eleven including that colonel tyler chapter election beth porter shook the boys hand and gazed a moment at his wide blue eyes they were strange eyes for a kid that age beth thought too something calm calm but observant but he seemed like a niceenough kid people seemed to enjoy seeing a new face everybody shook williams hand and made welcome noises at him even colonel tyler bent and ruffled the boys hairthough williams smile at that moment looked suddenly less genuine and that was odd too beth thought then matt wheeler called the meeting to order they had gathered in the living room of a little woodframe house next to a gas station the house was dusty and stale from being closed up so long but cozy enough on a chilly spring night matt had brought in ten folding chairs from his camper tom kindle had plugged in an electric heater which was minimal help but what really mattered beth thought was that they had come over the cascades into the land of the functioning wall sockets she guessed it was some helper voodoo that kept the electricity working in all these derelict towns as in buchanan before the storm trashed everything she didnt care lights that didnt need batteries heaven hot water bliss this very afternoon they had broken into the house and taken turns under a working shower beth recalled that first amazing flourish of steamy water on the skin of her back it was like the caress of some fiery angel shed been savoring the memory for hours she settled into a folding chair next to abby cushman a row behind joey up front with the rooms two sixtywatt floor lamps making him look pale and skinny matt wheeler zipped through some old business chiefly the news that joey had scavenged a portable ham rig in twin falls plus a quick unanimous aye on the proposition to continue east first thing tomorrow then it was time for the serious vote of the evening the one beth had been dreading matt looked tired when he announced it last week we resolved to open the position of chairman to an election we can start with nominationsanyone joey jumped up almost knocked his chair into beths knees i nominate colonel john tyler seconded jacopetti said wellthat was quick beth thought abby cushman looking a little startled put her hand up matt youve been doing a fine job cant we just carry on i nominate you now it was miriam who seconded another surprise two candidates matt said anyone else jacopetti said isnt two enough why dont we all run no more okay matt said do we need debate on this i think everyone knows where the colonel and i stand conceded well vote by show of hands colonel tyler and i will abstainand maybe our new resident should too at least until hes more familiar with current events miriam smiled im sure thats all right with william good show of hands for colonel tyler beth looked around hastily joeys hand shot up of course jacopettis in a gesture that was somehow smug two beth thought two out of nine bob ganish offered a plump hand three there was a long tense moment nothing hands for yours truly abbys at once and tom kindles then miriams hand went up three versus three beth thought abby said in the event of a tie ordinarily matt said the chair would cast the deciding vote but thats hardly fair since both colonel tyler and i agreed to abstain theres probably something in the rules of order maybe it would be simpler just to try it againwe had a lot of abstentions maybe some of those folks will change their minds meaning me beth found herself blushing me and chuck makepeace and tim belanger makepeace she couldnt predict as for belanger matt had saved the guys life dragging him down a hospital corridor during the storm but belanger had been pretty close to tyler ever since the colonel arrived and this was only a chairmanship vote after all not a test of loyalty or at least that was all it seemed to be makepeace belanger and me beth thought please god dont let it come down to me hands for colonel tyler the same three joey jacopetti bob ganish and now uhoh beth thought a fourthchuck makepeace had slid into the tyler camp could still be a tie abby commented no cheerleading matt said for yours truly miriam abby tom kindle beth folded her hands in her lap and stared at them when she looked up belanger had raised his hand for matt four to four jacopetti turned to her time to shit or get off the pot mdear she thought about matt weary unhappy at the front of the room she thought about colonel tyler the way he shook her hand one time the way he smiled she couldnt bring herself to look at either candidate or at joey or jacopetti the toothless sob tyler she said a whisper jacopetti pardon me she gave him a hateful stare colonel tyler there was a silence in the room joey turned offered an evil grin matt cleared his throat colonel tyler stood up immaculate in his uniform yes dr wheeler i believe this is your gavel now beth remembered when colonel tyler came to town it was in that desperate time when the storm had passed when beth had climbed out of the rubble into a world of no landmarksa world of everything flat and broken where you might find a bedframe nestled in the hollow shell of a volkswagen or a pleasure boat riding on a sea of windfall pines after a few days beth had been assigned to the food search with abby cushman and bob ganish she had hiked south on the highwaywhich was not even a road anymore barely a trail among the scattered detritus of ruined buildingsto the place where the big a p had stood just finding it was an act of archaeology beth had always navigated by the manmade markers road signs and intersections and malls now there was nothing except the curve of the bay the cryptic angle of mt buchanan above a plain of homogeneous junk the storm had left chalkblue skies and a chill wind behind it beth was cold in a ragged sweater soon dirty from prying up soggy drywall and ancient lathing hunting for canned food which they loaded into big doubleply garbage bags for the trip back into town she felt like something medieval a ragged scrounging peasant midafternoon her nose running from the chill she stood up straight to ease the ache in her back and that was when she saw him colonel john tyler she knew immediately who that distant figure was joey had talked to him on the radio more recently chuck makepeace had announced that the colonel was on his way to buchanan but that was before the storm beth thought the storm must have changed everythingall plans had been erased but colonel tyler had arrived as promised he was on foot he was a little dusty but he came along the ruin of the highway with his head high face cleanshaven his army jacket threadbare but neat and beth felt a voiceless rush of pleasure at the sight of himghost of a world that had seemed so lost she didnt tell the others let them scrounge in the ruins while beth watched this man come closer she wished her face was less dirty her hair not so tangled then abby straightened and caught sight of him well gosh she said bob ganish stood with a green garbage bag in one hand mouth open and his belly spilling over his belt some welcoming committee beth thought a middleaged lady a grimy excar dealer me tyler smiled as he approached you could see his age he wasnt young but he was in good shape his gray hair was cut close to his skull he looked like he wasnt tired he looked like he could walk forever beth suddenly embarrassed plucked at the hem of her ratty sweater ganish stepped forward and introduced himself colonel tyler shook hands solemnly we talked once on the radio he said a resonant calm voice nice to meet you in person and abby heard a lot about you mrs cushman smiles and breathless welcomestranger bullshit then they introduced beth colonel tyler shook her hand his hand was big and warm her own hand was cold from the weather raw from the work she was grateful for the touch she thought his hand was one of the most interesting things she had ever seena big mans hand creased and hard but gentle prettiest face ive encountered in a long time tyler said if you dont mind me saying so miss porter beth she managed beth she liked the way it sounded when he said it then they all hiked back into town tyler sharing the weight of the canned food and he talked a little about how bad the roads had been but its a different story over the mountains and how they would have to take their time plan for the journey east and so on and so forth beth not speaking or really listening much and then all the others had to meet tyler show him the shelter theyd made of the intact corner of the hospital basement and joey was beside himself glowing whenever tyler talked to him which was often since tyler and joey had become good radio buddies then there was planning to do tyler conferring with matt and tom kindle mainly and the days had run in a busy torrent ever since but she remembered the touch of his hand prettiest face ive seen in a long time beth had passed her twentyfirst birthday on the road out of oregon she didnt mention it no one knew but it got her thinking maybe shed been acting like a teenager well past her due dateriding around on joeys motorcycle committing pennyante vandalism but she was twentyone years old she was a woman maybe not the worlds most attractive or wellbred specimen but the only woman under forty among the local survivors a fact that made joey paranoid not that he had any right to be and everyone else a little nervous chuck makepeace had made a couple of very tentative passes so even more tentatively had tim belanger but they didnt attract her who did well joey had once but that was over an aspect of her life she didnt much care to recall matt wheeler attracted her colonel tyler attracted her none of this was very surprising what was new was the idea that she might attract them and maybe and here was the real novelty maybe not just because she was the only game in town since matt since her experience with jacopetti in the hospital basement beth had been exploring a new ideathe idea that she might have some work of her own to do in this new world something more significant than clerking at a eleven a new world new work a new beth porter coming up through the rubble which reminded her of the tattoo on her shoulder worthless it had seemed like a good idea at the time maybe it had been maybe it had been true maybe it wasnt anymore she would have to explain to matt about the vote not something she looked forward to for now she watched colonel tyler at the front of the room he smiled thanked matt for everything hed done thanked everybody for demonstrating their confidence in a relative newcomer he said he took the chairmanship seriously and hed do his best to live up to their expectations then he looked at his watch its late and i guess we all want to get some sleep before we move on in the morning so just a little bit of business here some people have been complaining about the weekly meetings we see each other every day maybe theres no reason to have a formal assembly so often when theres no special business pending seems reasonable i think we can safely schedule full committee meetings at a rate of once a month and ill ask your consent for thatunless theres any objections no objections though matt was frowning massively okay tyler said some picayune items ive posted a watch tonight and i think we should make that a permanent fixture joseph and tim volunteered for duty they can be our regular standing guard as far as im concerneduntil they get tired of it and unless anybody has a reason why not kindle said were talking armed guards here handguns tyler said abby is that necessary colonel tyler smiled his gentle smile i hope it isnt mrs cushman i trust it wont be but wed be stupid to take an unnecessary risk theres always the possibility of wild animals if nothing else i wont ask a man to sit alone all night without some form of protection holy crow kindle said softly and more such items none offered for a vote but the colonel pausing briefly for objections which never came it was businesslike beth thought a little dizzying however there was something about the radio makepeace and joey were a joint committee and controlled access communication with helpersthere was a helper in every one of these microscopic townswould be strictly through a designated representative tim belanger helper communication should be kept to a minimum in my opinion since weve all suffered at the hands of the travellers and im not sure we should place absolute trust in their emissaries though ill be the first to admit theyve been useful from time to time finally a motion to adjourn hands shot up kindle whistled appreciatively from the back row fast work colonel tyler looked mildly irritated you can voice your dissent at any time mr kindle thats what this forum is all about however were adjourned we sure are kindle said matt had picked up some material for beth at a local lending librarya red cross firstaid handbook with a chapter on traumatic injuries which he had annotated in the margin where it was out of date in a couple of weeks he wanted her familiar with the use of a hypodermic needle and a range of common antibiotics the problems they were most likely to be looking at aside from jacopettis coronary trouble and miriams geriatric complaints were injuries and bad food he had scheduled a session with her tonight but the meeting had run late she might not show up might not want to matt thought it was cold in his rv a lot of people were sleeping indoors tonight kindle had been warning people about turning on longdisused oil furnaces ever since they passed that burnedout section of twin falls and gas furnaces werent working anymore anywhere for no known reason but the travellers had been scrupulous about electricity kindle had hooked up expensive space heaters the kind with gravity switches to turn off the juice if somebody knocked the thing over heat a room let people camp in it it was reasonably safe and it took the chill off some arthritic bones including miriams but matt preferred his camper he had converted the rv into a combination of home and consulting office it provided a little continuity in a world that had turned so many things so completely upsidedown he picked up another library book a raymond chandler mystery its urban setting so distant in time and circumstance that it felt like science fiction and he switched on a battery light and settled down the wind came briskly along the dry margins of the snake river and rocked the rv on its old loose shocks matt found his attention drifting from the book to tyler the election the boy who had wandered into camp this afternoon he was yawning when beth knocked she let herself in matt checked his watch beth its late i know everybodys asleep she hesitated i came to explain about the election she obviously meant explain matt noted not apologize its all right he said no she frowned its not all right i dont want to leave it hanging matt its not that i dont trust you or you havent done a good job everybody knows you have but when you were standing up there it just seemed like you just looked so fucking tired had he well maybe was he tired more than he dared admit she said it might have been the wrong thing to do you did what seemed right at the time thats all anybody can ask it just seemed like you didnt really want the job i didnt but you dont want colonel tyler to have it wellno he doesnt seem like a bad person thats not the issue he didnt just take over the committee beth he bulldozed it ten minutes of colonel tyler and what do we have restricted access to helpers restricted access to the radio the camp under an armed guard beth looked uneasy you make it sound sinister it is sinister i think hes just used to the military way of doing things colonel tyler by his own testimony had left the military almost fifteen years ago it wasnt force of habit that had put him in charge tonight it was careful planning matt thought and a couple of partisan malcontents paul jacopetti and joey commoner and something else matt sensed in the colonel a certain restlessness an impatience that always seemed about to break out into violence catch him in a quiet moment and youd find tyler tapping his foot to some inner rhythm his eyes fixed and absent and his big hands closed into fists but he couldnt say this to beth without sounding paranoid or petty anyway her vote hadnt mattered any more than chuck makepeaces vote or bob ganishs it was only bad timing that made it seem that way she had done what she thought was the right thing and in the end maybe her call was as good as his she said i guess i should leave only if you want to tentatively youre not angry no he realized he wasnt she sat beside him relieved weary she put her head against him he stroked her long hair and listened to the night wind tugging at the corners of the rv he would never get used to these inland plains he missed the sea he thought about bethall the aspects of beth porter the neglected sullen beth the beth who had tattooed worthless on her shoulder who had baited joey commoner until joey felt compelled to pull a knife and this other beth beth treating jacopems anxiety with the anodyne of her own calm beth studying anatomy textbooks with the dedication of a monk something clean and strong rising out of all the garbage in her life joeys standing watch she said he has a campfire on the highway facing west did he see you come no anyway im tired of worrying about joey hes acting like an asshole maybe a dangerous one joey and his pocketknife i doubt it after what you said that night i shouldnt have i know but he doesnt own me he never did were a fragile community i dont want to create one more problem then should i leave challenging him bethyou know you dont have to i want to stay a while longer then stay a cold night a little warmth chapter destinations the caravan of ten dusty rvs and trailers led by colonel tyler in a fourwheeldrive ford pickup turned south on interstate toward utah tyler drove with the windows rolled down admitting a breeze so dry it made his lips bleed he drove at a cautious steady pace sometimes he felt fettered by the train of ponderous vehicles behind him but it was a privilege he thought to blaze the trail to see the way ahead the highway seemed wider for being empty periodically he passed an abandoned truck or car and it was nice to know that in an emergency the committee could siphon gas from one of these but no emergency arose most of the roadside gas stations had functional pumps and joey commoner and bob ganish had been scrupulous about keeping the convoys engines in decent repair tyler led them across the great basin into utah joined what had once been a populous stretch of north of brigham city then veered east on where the towns grew sparse again tyler read the road maps with great care he was worried about crossing the rockies skirted much of the mountains followed the union pacific route through the red desert in wyoming but late or early storms had been known to strand unwary travellers he called a halt at a town named emory and pressed on in the morning the sky when he started his engine was bright with herringbone clouds the road climbed and subsided and began to climb again he felt better when the road wound away from civilization those empty towns were oppressive mountain and desert were simply eternal granite and sagebrush and cheat grass invulnerable to all the discord that had dropped like bad magic out of a starry sky he was alone in the cab of the pickup truck although sissy kept him company sissy had been keeping him sporadic company since that town in georgialoftus she spoke to him a voice out of the wind but he didnt actually see her until one afternoon in rural texas while he was driving the hummer west it seemed appropriate that sissy should appear in the desert the desert was a place of mirages dustdevils chromiumblue lakes shimmering where the highway touched the horizon sissy had seemed exactly that tenuous sitting next to him where aw murdoch used to be she was a translucent desertdry sissydressed as inappropriately as ever in cotton and nylon and polyester of all colors clothes so brittle with old dirt that any motion emitted a greasy rustle and exuded an odor too stale to be offensive it was the smell tyler thought of something dead that had dried a long time in the sunlight the radio was good sissy told him good to be talking to those people smart but be careful she said stay away from the crowds all those east coast city survivors clever and dangerous in some way she never explained talk to that joseph sissy said he admires you sissy was an illusion tyler knew that of course he did youd have to be crazy to believe she was really sitting there some kind of ghost she was as the psychologists would no doubt say a private revenant a fragment of himself she was tyler giving tyler tylers advice but in another way she really was sissy sissy cut loose from memory his memory had lost its grip on sissy the way a child might lose its grip on a balloon and like a balloon she had risen up had floated out of his head and come to rest in the passenger seat beside him sissy advised him to drive to oregon hike down from the coastal mountains to buchanan assume a leadership position among these ragged refugees lead them east sissy said to the gathering place of the survivors a new home in the valley of the ohio river a sheltered placeor so tyler told them and it had even seemed true for a while but sissyalways a repository of unpleasant surpriseshad been coy about their destination tyler led his caravan up a road walled with granite threading a path around fallen rock whenever he turned his head to the right he found sissy gazing at him today she was bright as the sun her plump cheeks a blazing white difficult to look at those people back east sissy said they surrounded themselves with helpers they talk to helpers true tyler said helpers are the voice of that thing in the sky i know tyler said weary of these cryptic pronouncements sissys eyes volatile and relentless demanded answers he was helpless to produce and of the dead dead what the skinless living the contactees tyler interpreted contactees who had died might be able to speak through the helpers the dead might talk to the living tyler said the danger theyll talk about you john that girl you killed in loftus maybe it will be murdoch talking maybe murdoch crossed over too and who else might talk they might talk about stuttgart they might remember every sin you ever committed this was a new and unwelcome idea people will know what you are peevishly im no worse than the rest theyll know about loftus theyll call you killer would they extraordinary circumstances tyler thought alien possession the girl had been not human anyway he told himself im a man of some stature a man who served his country a man who made a place for himself in the business world a man who had once been a familiar presence in the capitol building a man accustomed to lunching with defense department functionaries or the members of oversight committees above certain kinds of innuendo thats a joke sissy said another washington crook whats the difference tyler worked at remembering that period of his life it had been structured formal complex in those days he had known how to seal off this sissy part of himself compartment a the presentable colonel tyler compartment b certain phantoms certain urges but with contact the borders had grown tenuous like a naval vessel he thought bulkheads breached flooding in the engine room fire in the hold the sad fact was he talked to this ghost because he had no choice pay attention sissy scolded him to the danger you cant risk being exposed but even colonel tyler had dreamed of that green valley in ohio a gathering place a new lifesafety a trap sissy said but if not there tyler said aloud if thats not where were going but when he turned to pose the question sissy had vanished they came across a fallen telephone pole blocking the highway tyler called a halt then enlisted joey commoner and chuck makepeace to work a chain around the pole and hook it to the rear of the pickup tyler revved the fords heavyduty engine inching forward against the drag the pole gave a moan of stressed timber and then began to shift tyler took careful note of the people who had climbed out of their campers and rvs to drink bottled soda and watch the show kindle and wheeler stood together both pokerfaced wheeler in particular seemed to be working to disguise some emotion his resentment tyler supposed at being elbowed out of the leadership position among the rest tyler identified idle curiosity some cautious frowns from the likes of abby cushman and miriam flett frank idolatry from joey commoner he turned away to measure his progress and when he looked again he was surprised to see sissy among the crowda more ethereal presence a dry wind came rivering down this pass but sissys long tangled hair hung limply over her shoulders her layered clothes stirred not at all she extended her hand over the head of the new boy william this one sissy said her lips moved soundlessly but tyler heard the words as if they were his own watch out for this one he drove until sunset a lot of settlers came through here kindle said mormons especially but also people on the oregon trail the california trail you can still find their wagon tracks on the scrub prairie about forty miles north matt walked with his friend along the highway away from camp they had stopped for the night along a stretch of high wyoming rock desert that seemed to matt infinitely dry silent and immense dinner was over now and the watch fires had been lit matthew kindle had said lets walk a bit get the kinks out and matt understood that the older man had something difficult to tell him neither moon nor artifact had risen and the stars were bright in a cold sky when he spoke kindles voice seemed to hover in the air it was called the south pass kindle said you followed the north platte to the sweetwater sweetwater to pacific creek sandy creek the green river crossing the overland stage route came through that way pony express scuff of shoes on empty road matt said sounds like you know the territory lived two years up in the wind river range did a lot of hiking through whiskey mountain and popo agie beautiful country you miss it been thinkin about it a lot they approached the small fire where joey commoner was keeping watch joey stood up at the sound of footsteps turned to face them with his hand hovering at the pistol colonel tyler had supplied him halt joey said his voice cracking kindle yawned and regarded the boy joey if you ever aim a loaded pistol in my direction ill feed it to youfair warning the colonel doesnt like people outside camp perimeter at night i dont suppose he does i dont suppose he likes my shirttail untucked either but hell have to put up with it wont he you go on report if youre out of bounds fine kindle said maybe later the colonel can slap my wrist youre such a shithead joey said kindle looked at him a long momentsadly matt thought then they walked on past the fire past joey matt tried to imagine crossing this blank immensity in a covered wagon no highways no gas stations no motels no helpers the stars sharp as needles matthew can you believe this bullshit pass a checkpoint before we can take a walk he shrugged joeys just joey isnt just anything joeys following orders and loving every minute of it were not living in a town anymore were living in a barracks thats why kindle hesitated matt said why what thats why im leaving no you cant kindle was a shadow in the starlight large and gray matthew christ tom i know whats going on as well as you do tyler did his little putsch and now we have to live with it its painful but were still moving heading for a place where tyler will be one small frog in a big pond theyre holding real elections in ohio according to the radio whens the last time you heard the radio the colonels got it locked up beside the point in ohio the colonel wont matter dont underestimate the man the bottom line matt said is that were more likely to get there if youre with us the bottom line is that its not my job kindle selected a pebble and threw it into the darkness an invisible trajectory anywayi never wanted to live in ohio tell you a story once upon a time i hiked along the titcomb valley thats up in the wind river range i was thirtythree years of age and i thought that was pretty damn old east side of the valley is fremont peak north is mount sacajawea at the head of the valley is gannett peak highest in wyoming all well above the timberline glaciers on those mountains like blue rivers of ice so pretty it hurts i camped there a night when i left i promised myself id come back one way or another before i died see all this a second time i never got around to it tom i know you dont understand this matthew youre happy with people happiest when youre helping them thats admirable i cant do it however id be happy by myself in the winds or the tetons or the beartooths matt tried to imagine this wiry strong aging man alone in the wilderness break a leg out there he said no one comes to help i dont relish the idea of dying alone who the hell does but what choice is there dont we all die alone he shrugged used to be shoshone and arapahoe through there might still be people around matt said in ohio in ohio theres nothing but people people and helpers which is another question seems to me theres only two ways it can go matt maybe the travellers move on and leave us aloneno helpers no electricity unless we make it ourselves and pretty soon the planet is repopulated and were back in the same bind or else they build us a private eden which is pretty much what they promised a safe place a protected place easy food and probably some kind of population control and maybe thats okay too but think about it everything the travellers are capable of doesnt that qualify them as gods i think it doesby the standards humanitys used for thousands of years but do you want to live with a god a real one i mean one who appears in the sky every night god who makes the rain fall god who makes the crops grow god who cures the sick child what would we be after ten years of thator a thousand years maybe about as human as those people who dropped their skins maybe less it might not be that way uhhuh but it might matt was tired again it was as if he had made some silent bargain traded sorrow for fatigue ever since rachel left he had been empty of grief but full of this daily exhaustion he wondered whether kindle was right whether they were headed toward a kind of domestication he wondered what dark marvels the earth might harbor in a hundred years or a thousand two species of humanity perhaps the wild and the tame he said have you talked to abby about leaving have i told her you mean no i thought id speak to her closer to the event say im going then go no time to blame herself she will though maybe it wont be good for her shes survived worse hell i dont mean all that much to abby cushman target of opportunity if she were fifteen years younger id say you and her might hit it off you both need somebody to doctor kindred souls but shell be happy in ohio easy as that not easy at all matthew abbys been generous youve been generous its been paid back often enough kindle looked at the stars scratched himself we should maybe get back before joey starts layin eggs they began to walk ill ride as far as laramie kindle said turn back from there itll be hard matt said one less voice against the colonel told you kindle said its not my job unspoken in a glance from kindle to matt in the darkness far from the firelight its your job now the next day dawned clear and cool engines revved in morning light rvs threw long shadows over the scrub colonel tyler leading the caravan as it wound through long miles of wyoming prairie was first to catch sight of the miraculous new thing it was a dusty blue dome on the horizon too perfectly symmetrical to be a product of nature capped with white like a mountain something artificial something large beyond comprehension a work of engineering that beggared any solely human effort calm and pretty in the dry blue distance its that spaceship sissy told him to take the dead away he recalled the idea dimly from contact from rumors he had heard on the radio a vast thing nearly alive that harbored emigrant souls and a miniature of the earth inside it elysian fields a world without evil her voice was like a sizzle in his ears we must see it more closely we must abide here for a time even sissy was excited chapter earthbound rosa perry connor had always dreamed of flying she had grown up earthbound chained to a suburban southern california tract development restless by nature rosa spent her childhood summers exploring concrete storm drains halfmade houses and the neighborhoods few surviving orange groves a reader she devoured stacks of little golden books then the bobbsey twins finally her older brothers collection of how and why wonder books wherein she discovered a volume devoted to airplaneswhich ignited her long romance with the idea of flight the orange county air was full of a number of things mainly petrochemicals but including passenger jets helicopters and military aircraft whenever one of these machines passed overhead rosa would come to a stop she would stand at attention head craned upward one hand raised as if in salute to shade the sun from her eyes f she would announce or looks like a dc she became a student of silhouettes a connoisseur of contrails always meticulous she taught herself the history of flight from montgolfier to the atlas rocket her obsession baffled her friends her parents were barely aware of it her father designed circuits for an electronics firm her mother played bridge with women whose suntans had acquired the quality of aged leather and whose jaw muscles stood out like taut little ropes when they laughed rosa imagined herself in a fokker strafing her parents barbecues and garden parties no more fat men in business suits exhaling sour whiskey clouds no more creased women in pastel shorts drinking martinis she would rise above all this her parents hated flying they had family back eastgrandma perry in wisconsin grandma hagstrom in florida sometimes rosas parents took her visiting by car across the desert across the farmland earthbound wheeling through an interstate hell of stuckeys bideawees and souvenir shops instead of above these dreadful things rosa from the age of seven to the age of seventeen begged her parents to fly at least once one summer leave the car at home she pleaded the car was hot crowded and took forever an airplane would save days of travel an airplane would turn torture into ecstasy but if we drive rosas mother said with maddening patience we can see the country ye gods rosa wanted to scream weve seen the country every inch of every road was tattooed indelibly into their brains what could be left to see one more plastic teepee one more jackalope postcard meanwhile she made plans she would go to college she would study well whatever was useful to a pilot mathematics aerodynamics her eyes were good she would take a job in civilian aeronautics somehow she would find her way into a cockpit and thenten days before her eighteenth birthdayher parents announced yet another trip to florida but this time were flying it was the best present ever and it almost made up for all those miles on the road rosa waited with itchy impatience for the appointed day the trip to los angeles international was novelty enough from the waiting room at the gate she was able to study in gratifying detail the silvery bodies of vanguards convairs s they were cumbersome on the ground out of their element like beached whales the distant runways turned them into sleek skythings through the redeeming magic of speed and altitude watching rosa trembled with excitement the boarding call startled her after an eternity of waiting it seemed almosttoo soon their plane was a new douglas dc super a stretched version of the standard dc rosa had picked out had insisted upon a window seat and she watched with honed attention as the luggage was loaded from a cart thumping into an invisible space under the passenger compartment listened with keen ears to the final latching of the door revving of engines rumble of wheels as the taxiing began she was able to see the runway before the plane turned for takeoff the runway was long and empty a strange road for this massive machine the stewardess demonstrated oxygen masks and advised passengers that their seat cushions could be used for flotation rosa watched and listened with a sense of unreality flotation she was interested in flying not floating then the engines whined to a higher pitch the sound invaded every part of the plane the bulkhead the window her seat herself a brake was released and the aircraft began to roll to accelerate she had not been prepared for this brutal burst of speed from below every takeoff had seemed graceful elegant from inside it was patently an act of force the wings which had seemed so solid bounced and wobbled against the air the fuselage rattled as if its rivets were about to pop and rosa began to entertain her first doubt was this practical would all this machinery really work could this fragile bus possibly sustain itself a mile from the surface of the earth she believed in flight she was not sure she believed in the invulnerability of engine parts manufactured by sweaty men in a pratt whitney factory but then the wheels lifted from the runway and she was flying the dc rose with the prompt efficiency of an elevator the ground simply dropped away at an angle that seemed to rosa precipitously steep she couldnt help imagining the dc as if on a hill stalling and rolling backward her hands began to sweat she wiped them on her skirt there was a knot of excitement in her stomach im flying she told herself this is the real thing i am truetogod flying she gazed at los angeles below her its gridwork vanishing into a gray diffusion of smog the aircraft tilted and seemed to rotate around the point of the wing as it banked over the pacific rosas parents read magazines incredible she thought her mother read redbook her father read time as if they were in some dentists waiting room not a metal cylinder high above the ocean the airplane circled as it rose until it was high and heading east a stewardess offered soft drinks rosa said no thank you the knot of excitement in her stomach had become something else she felt flushed and hot and unwell her eyes crept to the window and back again if she didnt look at the window she wouldnt see the ground wouldnt be reminded of their astonishing height of the distance the plane would fall if it fell but im flying but she wasnt she was just sitting here strapped in helpless in a metal box suspended above the san gabriel mountains by the clumsy rotation of a few greasy turbofans it might be flying but it felt more like risking her life the aircraft lurched in a pocket of air and rosa gasped and tightened her grip on the armrest her mother glanced over are you all right dear you look pale i think she swallowed hard she couldnt decide what was worse the fear the humiliation or the disappointment a dreadful lump had formed in her throat how long is the flight five hours more or less five hours could these engines really operate for five hours full of volatile jet fuel revolving at godknowswhat velocity bearings hot as griddles metal fatigue tearing at the fuselage she glimpsed mountains down below clouds and an impossible volume of empty air rosa her mother again dear whats the matter gods sake she heard her father say give her the goddamn paper bag thats what its there for she traded in her return ticket and rode a bus back to california the trip was long uncomfortable and depressing every inch of highway under the wheels was a confession of failure she spoke to no one she focused her eyes on the horizon the uneasy intersection of earth and sky home she registered at ucla midway through the fall semester she met a b a student named vincent connor who drove all thoughts of flight and recrimination from her mind vince was a farmboy gauche and handsome he came from wyoming his daddy was a sheep rancher there but to rosas glazed and grateful eye he was something out of the broadway musical oklahoma a sweet bigboned blond man in a checkerboard cotton shirt at any moment rosa thought he might break into song she married him in the spring and became rosa perry connor five of his cousins brave about airplanes flew in from wyoming with his widowed father the church was full her twin nieces four years old her brothers girls carried rosas train after the reception vince began their honeymoon drive to san francisco they spent a night at a motel on highway one where the sea fog came winding through the pines they made love for the first time as man and wife which seemed to inject a new vigor into the act rosa called him cowboy and he grinned after that years later she would wonder at how fast the time had passed vince took a series of jobs one of them with her fathers electronics firm in orange county briefly rosa was thrust into the gardenparty and countryclub circle she had despised as a girl she wasnt good at it vince was worse he didnt know how to dress at parties he told coarse jokes or refused to say anything at all he has wyoming stamped on his forehead a friend told rosa and its fucking indelible vince had dreams of opening his own business but he couldnt manage to save any money he began to drink too much so did rosa her garden parties became haphazard affairs at which she was liable to sit crosslegged on the patio steps indulging her old fokker fantasy watch out girls its the red baroness airsick bags provided for your comfort on the seatback when his father died vincent drove her across the desert to wyoming which rosa regarded as a hostile alien planet to her horror vince had decided to take over the family ranch youll get used to it he told her not much interested in her objections its not so bad here but it was it was a huge lonely land full of bellicose men and submissive women rosa did nothing but cook meals keep house and watch tv vince wasnt keen on children he said and neither was rosashe thought about a pregnancy just to relieve the boredom but never seriously enough to skip her pills and yet rosa thought for all the tedium my god how the years flew crackling cold winters muddy springs summers so dry her small garden plots inevitably failed before autumn seasons and seasons of network television she drove into cheyenne with vince sometimes but good lord cheyenne the last refuge of the bolo tie her life became eventless as smooth as the eastern horizon and worse somehow her life passed it eroded she grew old yes old she was forty in wyoming and how had that happened then fortyfive then oh christ fifty fifty years old on a sheep ranch in wyoming she was fiftyone when the artifact appeared in the sky like an ivory moon rosa wasnt frightened of it not even in the beginning vince thought it portended the end of the world maybe it did nevertheless rosa liked it she liked its glide smooth and effortless in the dark it was flight as she had once imagined flight to be and didnt that stir some old memories she was more earthbound now than ever of course chained to this vast acreage of prairie chained to vince and she had put on weight over the years a considerable poundage her girlish walk had become a waddle the revenge of gravity rosa thought what was weight but the measure of her bondage to the earth then the next summer like everyone else she came down with contact flu and woke to the realization that her life had been only a prologue vince submitted to contact just as readily which surprised her vince had seemed satisfied with his life in wyoming the ranch had prospered under his supervision and he seemed happy enough vince after all had never wanted to fly but vince was suddenly eager for the golden age to commence happy to drop his stolid marlboro man exterior and plunge into the fluid deeps of the greater world after contact she felt closer to vince but at the same time more distant she was able to appreciate the shape of his life the spikes of pride and canyons of ambition that had driven him to california and back there was even a broad pastel bump of affection that comprised his feelings for rosa a pleasant discovery but she could see too that their connection had been arbitrary and accidental their love had peaked in a motel on highway one and what persisted was fondness at best boredom at worst she wasnt surprised when vince abandoned his skin winter was setting in and vince had never relished the bitter storms and cold canadian air that came rolling each year from the north rosa however had conceived a different plan for herself she had in mind a certain transformation a dramatic farewell to the planet that had borne her it would take time it would mean staying on the earth longer than most therefore she began as soon as vince was gonehis skin a delicate memory carried off on a brisk autumn wind she retired to the bedroom of the ranch house to the old double bed she had shared with him for so many years then rosa took off her clothes and looked at herself for the last time in the vanity mirror she saw a bulging grayhaired woman whose expression was no longer perennially sad then she stretched out on the bed the neocytes in her body dimmed her awareness to make the time pass more speedily rosa was suddenly dreamy and afloat she weighed pounds that day a significant massenough for the neocytes to work with adipose tissue began to change its structure rosas pores exuded a gray fibrous substance within days it covered her body her physical functions dropped to negligible levels after a week rosa ceased to breathe her heart ceased beating inside her hardened chrysalis she began to change the pale cocoon lay motionless on the bed all that winter around it the world evolved the winter storms that year were particularly fierce not the hurricanes that had wreaked so much damage on the coast but snowstorms that froze the water in the pipes and beveled the house with glittering blue dunes the wind in january was so violent it broke a downstairs window rosas bedroom turned cold and a fine lace of frost formed on the mirror but rosa was protected from the cold and the wind vince before he left had torn down his fences and put the sheep out on the grazing land to fend for themselves but the sheep were stupid and most of them died that terrible winter not very many miles from the ranch south past the colorado border traveller organisms had begun to construct the new artifact if rosa had stood at her iceclad window she would have seen it grow would have felt the tremors in the bedrock as the earths magma was tapped and channeled would have seen a ghostly luminescence on starry winter nights that spring as the snow melted and the ground softened she would have seen home dominate the southern horizon a new mountain would have seen it as aw murdoch had seen it on the day he abandoned the flesh but rosa perry connor slept on the days were warming when rosa finally began to stir the nights were cold but the snow was long past each day she quickened a little inside her chrysalis awareness grew she felt the process reaching its consummation felt her new self struggling against confinement in a matter of days she would burst free rosa felt the greater world too all the new complexity of it since so many souls had gone over but she was not the only one left on the earth there had been other transformations many in fact on every continent new creatures halfhuman or exhuman or subtly posthuman like the man rosa thought as she rose toward dim consciousness the boy the old man who had become a boy who was aware of her too who in fact was very close clamoring for her attention through the medium of the greater world rosa he said while she struggled up from a winters hibernation rosa were very close i hear you boy she thought but im sleepy what is it you want rosa the boy said were very close rosa hurry rosa finish what you have to finish because were close now and you might be in danger chapter i know what you are the caravan pulled into an empty truckstop on i home a mountainous threequarters disc above the southeastern prairie turned a deep royal blue as the sun dropped below the horizon a faint last light played about its apex and gave the high frost a reddish glow we shouldnt linger here william thought home was nearly finished and soonwithin a very few daysit would cast loose from the earth no doubt it would be a spectacular sight but also a dangerous one to any unreconstructed humans in the area the creation of home had opened a deep wound in the mantle of the planet when home rose toward orbit the wound would bleed magma the bedrock would tremble and quake william knew all this through the agency of the greater world but he didnt speak of it it wasnt clear whether he should he walked a distance from miriams camper across the stillhot tarmac of the parking lot to an abandoned honda and sat on the dusty hood he wore a skyblue tshirt too big and a pair of jeans unravelling at the knees and when he closed his eyes he felt the gentle touch of the cooling air on his young skin debate was raging through the greater world as the human polis expanded to completion it had begun to take over certain tasks from the travellerschiefly the management of the earth it was an onerous burden the travellers had approached the earth like a benevolent but clumsy giant for all their wisdom they hadnt foreseen a ratio of resistance as high as one in ten thousand they had underestimated the stubbornness of humanity william thought no doubt an easy mistake to make their own transition from a biologicalplanetary species to a virtualinterstellar epistemos had been selfgenerated and nearly unanimous but the question remained how should the human collectivity the greater world relate to this stubborn minority leave them one faction asserted theyve chosen their independence and we ought to respect it let them find their own destiny the destiny of the polis was among the stars the earth could fend for itself its inhumane to abandon them other voices argued theyre free to choose for themselves but what about their children if the human birthright is among the stars how can we condemn another generation to death no resolution had emerged williams problem was a miniature of the larger debate he knew what colonel tyler was he understood the threat colonel tyler posed but should he intervene for the sake of his last sojourn on earth he had elected to become a child again he had put a great many memories behind him stored them temporarily elsewhere because he wanted this unmediated experiencenot just to feel like a twelveyearold but to be one and so the presidency had vanished into the misty past the greater world became a presence vaguely perceived now this crisis had forced him out of his ekstasis and troubled him with doubt he supposed it wasnt coincidence that had led him back to colonel tyler some unperceived connection had been forged as long ago as that day in washington when he sat in the park with colonel tylers pistol at his throat the boy had pedaled aimlessly across america the man inside had maneuvered him into meeting this sad expedition it wasnt clear what events might unfold but he felt a role for himself in their unfolding and a scant half mile down the road was the connor farmhouse another dilemma rosa he broadcast silently rosa hurry he heard miriam come up behind him her footsteps dragged on the gritty parking lot shes tired william thought miriam had demonstrated an enormous strength for her ageshe insisted on driving her own camper william recognized and appreciated her resilience but she tired easily and was often short of breath she stood beside him looking at home where it dominated the horizon in its own way miriam said its beautiful it was like a vast canyon wall at sunset home was every shade of blue from the palest pastel at its summit to the indigo shadows at its base a few tenuous clouds had formed along its western slope you look sad miriam said i was thinking william told her about what he shrugged things there was a distant clatter of broken glass the sound of colonel tyler breaking into the truckstop restaurant william miriam said her voice was solemn i wasnt sure whether i ought to mention this but perhaps the time has come william you dont have to lie to me anymore its not necessary to pretend you see i know what you are she regarded him loftily youre one of them miriam had doubted him from the beginning why not doubt had been her constant companion for months since contact all her certainties had melted away miriam had said a resounding no to the offer of immortality but she had seen certain things that longago august nighthad glimpsed certain immensities that shook her to the roots she went back to the red letter bible her father had given her and read it from genesis to revelation the bible had always been a cornerstone for miriam not because it explained everything as the tv evangelists alleged the opposite she trusted the bible because it was mysterious like life it was dense and contradictory and resisted interpretation rightly so miriam thought how authentic could a book of wisdom be if you understood it at a glance wisdom didnt work like that wisdom was a mountain you climbed it short of breath dizzy unsure of yourself even as you approached the summit but after contact here is a solemn blasphemy miriam thought but after contact the holy bible had seemed almost provincial all that earthly preoccupation with slaves and kings shepherds and patriarchs for one unforgettable moment last august miriam had beheld in her minds eye the universe itselfindescribably ancient large beyond comprehension and as full of worlds as the sea was full of water where was god in that immensity perhaps everywhere miriam thought perhaps nowhere it was a question the travellers had refrained from answering increasingly miriam doubted her own access to the answer no she told them i dont want your immortality she would be immortal at the throne of god it was enough but the world had never looked the same since by the time william came cycling from the east with his wide eyes and halfaname miriam had grown accustomed to doubt she knew at once he wasnt a normal sort of youngster for one thing she liked him during her years as a secretary at the elementary school miriam had not much cared for children they were messy impudent and vulgar the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light luke but miriam guessed the children of galilee seldom addressed their elders as fuckhead neither did william william was different and miriam suspected he had once been much older she told him so now he sat thoughtfully on the hood of the empty car his heels tapping the grill i didnt lie to you but youre not what you appear to be i am what i appear to be but im something else too older among other things youre not human he shrugged you dont want the others to know he shrugged again miriam shifted her weight her feet were tired from standing for so long i wont tell them she said i dont think youre anything to be afraid of williams smile was tentative she said but will you do me a favor what talk to me tell me about she couldnt find a word for it he said the greater world yes he was perceptive she added almost shamed by the admission im curious all right william said but first we should go eat dinner she hugged herself and shivered it gets so cold these nights im cold to the bone the colonel had organized dinner in the truckstop cafeteria abby cushman had uncovered a cache of canned chili and she warmed it in a big steel pot over the restaurant stove it tasted like tin and vinegar william thought but any kind of hot food was a pleasure nowadays the group had divided into clusters william watched matt wheeler and tom kindle conspicuously silent sharing some private uneasiness he watched john tyler conferring with his cadre joey commoner paul jacopetti bob ganish there was some troubled conversation therehushed and indecipherable beth porter stood with a bowl in her hand glancing nervously between the two groups william didnt like the sour atmosphere of the room the sooner we move on he thought the better he thought about miriam who was silently spooning a bowl of soup the chili she said was indigestiblemiriam who had guessed his secret he thought about rosa perry connor struggling out of her confinement a scant halfmile away he thought about home back at the camper he did his best to answer miriams questions she wanted more than he could give she wanted a tour of the architecture of the universe he was hobbled by words but he did his besttried to translate into simple english his own new grasp of time and space we live in a well of time william told her call up your most primitive memory a cradle memory something from your childhood now think of all the hours that have passed since then all the ticks of all the clocks in all those years an ocean of time double that amount he said and double it again and multiply it by a hundred and a hundred more and still miriam still you havent scratched the surface of the past multiply it by a number so large the zeroes would run off a page and you might reach as far back as the jurassic or the precambrian when the earth was a planet inhabited by monsters but only an eyeblink in its history multiply again and again and eventually you reach the dawn of life and again the planets molten origins again and again the formation of the sun and multiply again the elements that would form the sun and all its planets are forged in the unimaginable furnace of a supernova and still you havent removed more than a grain of sand from time itself lonesome miriam whispered and space william said was a mystery infinite but bounded the galaxy was a mote among billions of galaxies the sun a star among billions of stars this moment the axis of a wheel as big as the sky its too much william how can you stand it her voice was faint and sad so lonesome she repeated but out of all that blind tangle of particles and forces had come life itself it was a miracle that impressed even the travellers consciousness unfolding from a cocoon of stars and time pearls of awareness growing in the dark miriam how can it be lonely he couldnt disguise the awe in his voice we were implicit in the universe from the moment it began were the product of natural law every pondering creature in the deeps of the sky were the universe gazing back at itself thats the mystery and the consolation every one of us is an eye of god she woke three hours after midnight turned in her bed and saw william in his sleeping bag with his arms cradled behind his head and his eyes still open in the faint light the curse of age was the elusiveness of sleep an older person miriam thought gets too familiar with the dim hours of the night but william the boyman was also awake both of us restless miriam thought the aged and the ageless william she whispered he was silent but seemed attentive there is something i wonder about she said ive been thinking about us us on this trip and those in ohio or other parts of the worldwho said no who didnt want that immortality that greater world do you think about it his voice small in the darkness yes do you think about why sometimes why some of us chose to stay in our mortal bodies nod william is there an answer to the question lots of answers he paused as if to assemble his words as many answers as there are people sometimes it was religious faith though not as often as you might think people say they believe this or that but on the deepest level where the travellers spoke words are only words people call themselves christians or moslems but only a vanishing few held those beliefs so deeply that they turned down immortality am i one of those he nodded again at least miriam thought i used to be and the others some are so independent they dont mind dying for it tom kindle she thought and some people want to die they might not admit it they might even fear it but in the deepest part of themselves they long for it who was that miriam wondered bob ganish the fat usedcar dealer maybe paul jacopetti the retired toolanddie maker scared of death but secretly wanting it perhaps some are convinced they dont deserve immortality the belief in their own shamefulness has gnawed down to the bone joey miriam thought or some combination of these beth perhaps miriam said thinking of colonel tyler whom she had distrusted from the day she set eyes on him perhaps some of them are simply evil perhaps william agreed but some evil people laid down that part of themselves as gratefully as they might have given up a tumor others didnt others miriam this is hard to accept but some people are born so hollow at the heart of themselves that theres nothing there to say yes or no they invent themselves out of whatever scrap comes to hand but at the centertheyre empty colonel tyler miriam said william was silent but she recognized the description at once john tyler hollow to the core she could practically hear the wind whistle in his bones but there are people like dr wheeleror that abby cushman they dont seem exceptional the prairie wind rattled a window william hesitated a long while then he said miriam did you ever read yeats who is yates a poet she had never read any poetry but the psalms and she told him so yeats wrote a line william said which always stuck in my memory man is in love he said and loves what vanishes i dont think its truenot the way the poet meant it not of most people but it may have been true of yeats and i think its true of a certain few others some few people are in love with what dies miriam and they love it so much they cant bear to leave it behind what a difficult kind of love that must be miriam thought by some miracle of traveller intervention there was water pressure in the restrooms of the truckstop restaurant a pleasuremiriam despised chemical toilets at dawn the new artifact a crescent of pearl and pink on the horizon miriam hurried from her camper into the cold greentiled ladies room with the bible clasped in her hand she opened it at random and began to read lo i am with you always even unto the end of the world matthew there was blood in the toilet again this morning i am dying miriam thought chapter fireworks matt woke to a knock at the door of his camper tom kindle in ancient jeans a cotton shirt hightop sneakers and a cincinnati reds baseball cap he was carrying a rifle looks like youre loaded for bear rifles for you kindle said kind of a gift dont you need it i can pick up a fresh one plus ammunition in laramie matthew you might not like it but youre on some dangerous turf these days youre liable to need this matt took the rifle in his hands he didnt come from a hunting family and hed never done military duty it was the first time hed held a rifle it was heavier than it looked old the stock was burnished where it had been handled over the years the metal parts had been recently oiled he didnt like the sad weight of it any more than he liked the sad weight of kindles leaving he gave it back not my kind of weapon matthew i mean it dont be stupid dont be stubborn shit kindle said but he took back the rifle in his left hand and looked more comfortable with it there talked to abby yet im about to not looking forward to it you could change your mind kindle shrugged i doubt it he put out his hand matt shook it take care of yourself old man watch your back dr kildare we thought you should know the radio said all our helpers have gone silent it was not a routine call coming at this hour of the morning and tyler listened with a rising interest he and joey had set up the receiver in a seedy staff lounge at the back of the truckstop cafeteria tyler had made the room his command quarters and he was alone in it as alone as he ever got these days he held the microphone in his right hand and thumbed the talk button say again ohio the transceiver was hooked to a mobile antenna and plugged into a wall socket since they came over the coast range theyd been doing radio wherever they found live ac joey wanted to rig a ham unit to run off a car batteryit was easy he claimed and would be more convenient but tyler had discouraged him tyler didnt much care for the radio anymore he had begun to see it as a liability helpers have fallen silent the ohio man said ohio ran a twentyfourhour radio watch and this was their morning shift a guy named carlos with a faint hispanic accent wondered if you had the same experience were not currently near a helper ohio theory here is that the travellers are fixing to move on maybe the contactees take over maybe not could be well see the artifact move out of orbit soon end of an era huh if thats true the man seemed to want to chat sissy appeared in a corner of the room faintly luminous and anxious to speak all the helpers are silent tyler wanted to nail down this new fact every one carlos said they dont talk anymore or move or nothing tyler thought about it he turned it over in his head wanting to make sense of it he glanced out the greasy window at the curvature of the new artifact still earthboundthe human artifact a spaceship the size of a mountain ohio he said your signal is weak sorry colonel weather problem there the sky was babyblanket blue windless got a front moving in tyler said you in any danger colonel not that serious we might be out of touch for a while though sorry to hear it look for you later indeed thanks ohio sissy beamed approval now tyler instructed himself now think if the travellers leave if the helpers fall silent then well be safe all our secrets safe sissys voice was faint but strident like the buzz of a hightension wire it might not work that way tyler thought we dont know therefore wait wait and see wait here yes how long until its over until the travellers are gone dead are gone altogether empty skies people dont want to stay here tyler thought they want ohio make up something tell them ohio told you to wait bad weather like you said bad weather along the platte say dam washed out say sissy possessed a wonderful imagination it might work tyler agreed but not if they can talk to ohio or ohio talk to us the radio youre not stupid sissy said you can fix the radio tyler closed the dusty horizontal blinds and jammed a chair back under the knob of the door it was still early morning not much activity yet among the people tyler had come to think of pleased with his own sense of humor as the unhappy campers joey was walking a perimeter exactly the kind of idiotic task joey adored jacopetti slept until noon if no one bothered him no one else was likely to knock in the next few minutes he lifted joeys toolbox onto the trestle table where the radio was he unplugged the transceiver and worked out the sheetmetal screws that held the cover in place he used two alligator clips and a stout piece of wire to make a jumper cable then he hooked one clip to the volt primary of the transformer and the other clip to the positive rail of the dc supply for insurance he added a bare wire across the internal fuse put the lid back on sissy reminded him before you plug it in tyler did so he threw the power switch to the on position for good measure then he hunkered down and pushed the plug into the wall socket there was a half second of silence then the big transceiver made a sound like a gunshot and jumped a quarterinch off the surface of the table it belched a spark as bright as a camera flash and sizzled with highvoltage overload the ceiling light flickered and faded altogether as the buildings circuit breakers cut in now hurry tyler thought he unplugged the unit then cracked the blinds to admit just enough light to work by when he pried up the lid the transceiver gushed sour smoke into his face tyler ignored the stench and hurried to disguise his handiwork he pulled out what was left of the jumper the alligator clips the wire across the fuse then he jammed the lid back on and began to drive home the screws one by one the sound of tim belangers voice came faintly through the window something about the lights going off anybody know where the fuse box was eight screws four to a side tyler drove the fifth the sixth the seventh sweating footsteps sounded in the hallway he fumbled the last sheetmetal screw into its hole the screwdriver didnt want to find the slot in the screwhead when it did the screw sheered sideways shit tyler whispered dont curse sissy scolded him there was a knock at the door joeys voice colonel you still in there three twists of the wrist to drive the screw home a couple of seconds to clear joeys toolbox off the table couple more to yank the chair away from the doorknob dark as a bitch in here sorry he let joey in joey sniffed the air whats that stink had some trouble with the radio colonel tyler said things totally fucked joey said when he had examined the molten interior transformer must have shorted though i dont know how it could of he offered to drive into cheyenne and get a replacement fine tyler said but not yet how come joey wanted to know im calling a meeting tonight its important and i need you there as a vote and as sergeantatarms i could be back by dark i dont want to risk it tyler drew himself up let it ride mr commoner take my word on this joey nodded good soldier tyler thought matt was compiling a pharmaceutical wish list to transmit to the ohio peoplehe didnt know about the radio problem yetwhen he heard abbys anguished voice from the parking lot he hurried out of his camper into the rough circle of trucks and rvs knowing what the problem was and dreading it tom kindle had climbed into the cab of his lumbering rv and was cranking the motor abby had stepped out of her own camper she wore a denim skirt and a loose blouse and carried a hairbrush in one hand her feet were bare and shed been crying she ran a few steps across the hot midday tarmac toward kindles vehicle you cant stopping when it was obvious that he could and was ooooh she threw the hairbrush her hard overhand toss sent it pinwheeling at kindles camper it rang the side panel like a bell kindle leaned out the drivers window and gave her an apologetic wave you coward you selfish old cowardl the camper rolled out onto the highway and began to pick up speed matt took abby by the shoulders she pulled away and looked at him bitterly matt why did you let him do this we need him abby abby i know but he had his mind set on it i couldnt stop him i dont think anybody ever stopped tom kindle from doing what he wanteddo you she sagged toward him i know but oh shit matt why now he didnt know how to console her he had lost too much of his own but he held her while she cried joey commoner came running from the truckstop tyler and jacopetti a short distance behind joey cupped a hand over his eyes and watched kindles camper disappearing down the highway then he looked at abby figuring it out son of a bitch joey said hes fucking awol abby regarded joey as if hed descended from mars calm down colonel tyler said to no one in particular sir joey said he didnt ask permission to go somewhere quiet tyler said in the sunlight the colonel was silverhaired imperial his eyes lingered a moment on matt well discuss it at the meeting tonight matt cleared his throat thought you didnt believe in meetings special occasion tyler said tyler put his motion to the committee before everybody was finished sitting down the meeting was held in the truckstop restaurant under a bank of flyspotted fluorescent lights tyler stood against a window with the dark behind him and tapped a knuckle against the glass for attention news over the radio he said weve got some heavy weather across the state border along the platte ohio thinks we ought to stay put for a while and i agreebut i want a vote to make it official he paused to let this sink in everybody was still a little dazed by the departure of tom kindle wary of another crisis matt wheeler said i thought the radio blew up call came early this morning dr wheeler did it who took it i did did anybody else hear this call im sorry dr wheeler i didnt feel it was necessary to have a witness jacopetti laughed out loud wheeler said it would be nice to be able to confirm the message colonel tyler mr commoner offered to find a replacement for the radio im sure well be up and running in due time until then lets keep a lid on the paranoia shall we abby raised her hand a truckstop is hardly a place to spend time agreed in the morning we can take a look at the farmhouse to the south of here im sure itll be more comfortable tyler registered but didnt understand the sudden look of concern from the boy william wheeler again maybe we ought to keep movingwe can always find shelter if the weather turns bad suspicious son of a bitch refused to drop the issue after what happened to buchanan tyler said i dont think we want to take any chances with a storm do you and theres another consideration one of our company chose to leave us today a particular friend of yours dr wheeler all things considered maybe we should stay in the neighborhood long enough to give mr kindle a chance to change his mind if he elects to come back to camp at least hell know where to find us this hit home with abby cushman a potential swing vote she folded her hands in her lap all in favor of staying tyler said show of hands it was an easy majority chapter night lights they filed from the restaurant subdued and silent until tim belanger stabbed a finger at the sky heyanybody notice something tyler looked up the artifact he said and calmly checked his watch it should have risen by now by christ matt thought for once the bastards right that ugly alien moon was overdue missing gone dear god abby said what now there was nothing in the sky but a bright wash of starsno artifact but the second one still grounded on the southern horizon the earth was alone again matt had wanted it so badly for so long he hadnt allowed himself even to consider the possibility it was the kind of desire you could choke on but here mute testimony was an empty wyoming sky too late he thought bitterly if they left they left because their work was finished the starlight on the second and motionless artifact the socalled human artifact was cold and merciless in scale and design matt thought that object was wholly inhuman no matter who owned it or what went on inside the aliens are gone abby asked and matt said his voice a whisper why not we have our own aliens now it was an auspice that couldnt be read an indecipherable portent and they went to bed weary of miracles deep in the cold wyoming springtime dark sooner or later each of them slept except one old woman one ageless boy william his eyes were wide and moonbright yes dont you ever sleep he smiled sometimes miriams batteryoperated bedside clock bled numbers into the night there was a fresh new pain in her belly the travellers are gone arent they yes but youre still here were still here humanity he meant the polis he had called it the world contained in that blister on the horizon home william yes did i ever show you my journals no would you like to see them his smile was unreadable yes miriam i would she left her bed and took down from their shelf the fat scrapbooks full of clippings from the buchanan observer they had gotten wet in that terrible winter storm and the pages were thick and warped but the clippings for the most part were still legible william sat up in his cot and leafed through the books one by one it was a strange history contained there miriam thought she remembered how everyone had been frightened by the first appearance of the artifact in the sky it had been enigmatic terrifying an emissary from another world now less than two years later it was these clippings that seemed like messages from another world the universe miriam thought turned out to be a more peculiar place than any of us expected william said you obviously worked hard at this yes it seemed important at the time not now she had fought to protect these journals but what were they tonight they seemed like so much paper and ink no not now he looked at them carefully and then put them aside miriam steeled herself to ask the essential the final question the question she had postponed had dared not ask give me strength miriam thought one way or the other give me strength william is it too late for me she trembled in fear of his answer she closed her eyes squeezed them tight tight no miriam the boy said gently its not too late not yet a chaste kiss on the lips the neocytes he said would work quickly inside her before dawn when miriam was finally asleep the boy crept out of the camper into the chill air a fingernail moon rode low in the sky his breath made plumes of frost and there was frost on the tarry surface of the parking lot sparkling in the fragile light the artifact had left orbit hours ago resuming its long itinerary through the unexplored spiral arms of the galaxy its physical presence wasnt necessary any longer the collective knowledge of the travellers had been duplicated and stored in the human home and home would begin its own journey soononce certain controversies had been resolved williams bicycle was roped to the back of miriams camper silently he untied it and examined it the trip from idaho had coated the bicycle with dust the action of the chain and the derailleurs sounded thick and gritty but he didnt have far to go he climbed on the bike and pedalled down i a young boy legs pumping in the moonlight the banner of his breath streaming behind him in the chilly air he turned left past an open gate down a private road to the connor farmhouse rosa hurry he thought theyre coming in the morning hurry now chapter release william was with her as the sun rose rosa lay on the farmhouse bed the winters cold and wind had given the bedroom a dishevelled look the oaken dresser had faded and its mirror had dulled the curtains had tangled on the rod the single large window looked southeast where home occupied a portion of the sky sunrise was a faint vermilion on those distant slopes the gray cocoon on the bed had cracked on its long axis and the two pieces had begun to separate william gazed without visible emotion at the pulsating mass inside rosatheyll be coming soon help me then rosa said william moved to the bedside considered the problem then grasped the two chunks of dense porous material and began to pry them apart hurts rosa said william broadcast a voiceless apology no it has to be done the boy agreed and grasped the cocoon again and strained his thin arms until he heard the material split along its back seama dry fibrous sound like the crack of a walnut shell he felt her relief william stood away as rosa began to unfold the sun was well above the horizon when she stood at last beside the bed her enormous wings trembling in the cool air from the window rosa perry connor in her present incarnation weighed less than fifteen pounds her new body was a hollow shell of what had once been human bone and tissue transformed by the action of the neocytes into something more brittle and much less dense her features were diminished and compressed but still recognizable she had an attractive face william thought her eyes were large and bright she blinked at him still mute her lungs were a fragile bellows her vocal cords a memory her pupils unaccustomed to the light were black pinpoints her wings were a double ellipse around the axis of her body and sunlight through the moist tissue made bright moires of blue and purple william felt her exhilaration curious he thought the way some of us manufactured these destinies for ourselvesthese last brief incarnations on the surface of the earth she didnt seem strange at all only a stubborn dream given fleeting substance the membranes of the wings needed to dry before rosa could use them william didnt hurry herthere was nothing she could do to speed the process he tore the drapes away from the window the only practical exit it was an oldfashioned window one fixed pane and one counterweighted pane to slide up in front of it rosas body was tiny now and her wings were flexible but she would need more space than this he shattered both panes and carefully meticulously plucked away the splinters of glass and tossed them to the dry earth below then with surprising strength for a boy of his size he grasped the obstructing arm of the wooden frame and pulled until it cracked and came away some splinters remained in the wood despite his effort the palm of his right hand was scratched the blood that oozed out was dark and viscous almost black tyler looked up as he crossed the truckstop parking lot with joey commoner beside him joseph did you hear that sir uhno a sound like breaking glass no sir sound carries a distance in this still air tyler thought across this dry prairie he took a shallow breath listening but there was only silence hurry everybody along he said breakfast is over we have business to attend to sir joey said william heard the engines come to life one by one though he couldnt see the truckstop from this window i know rosa assured him soon now there was not much margin the boy thought on this brink of time the caravan of rvs made its way up the private road and parked in a ponderous line outside the connor farmhouse abby cushman liked the look of the house it was a fancy twostory frame house a comforting contrast to the range land all around it it occupied its space with a doughty colonial dignity the front door was unlocked abby filed in behind colonel tyler and his lieutenants the inside of the house was nice too she thoughtthough a broken window in the living room had let in the wind and tumbled some of the contents this big central room was decorated in a southwesthopi style that had been fashionable some years ago and seemed curiously misplaced on a northern prairie pattern rugs beige walls a long sandcolored sofa and kachina dolls on a sideboard squat porcelain lamps she wondered who had lived here someone dislocated abby thought someone out of place colonel tyler had gone off to investigate the kitchen and the cellar for supplies abby said ill check upstairs to matt wheeler who was helping a breathless miriam flett into a chair it was odd that william wasnt with her the old woman and the boy were almost inseparable these days come to think of it miriam had been acting strangely for days she thought of asking thought better of it mind your own business abby there had been much discontent in camp lately and none of it was mysterious this journey had demonstrated all too graphically the emptiness of the world and the inadequacy of the human temperament america is as empty as an old cup abby thought and the best we can do by way of survivors is a cowardly old man like tom kindle unpleasant thought she hurried upstairs to a carpeted hallway cool and dim and three closed doorsthe bedrooms abby supposed william heard the rattle of the doorknob behind him rosa i know she said she took a stepa delicately balanced pirouettetoward the window he felt her unsteadiness thank you she said whatever happens so accustomed had abby grown to the vacancy of the world that she was astonished above all else to find the second bedroom occupied william she said then she looked at the window at the thing in front of the window it was a delicate silhouette in the morning light she thought at first it must be a kind of decorationsome eccentric assemblage of cellophane panels meant to break the morning light into these fractions of purple and blue but then it moved it was alive somehow organic she discovered eyes a sort of face william raised his fingers to his lips a childs be quiet and abby stifled an urge to cry out dont be afraid the boy whispered but of course she was afraid she saw the broken cocoon on the faded bedspread it was an insect thing abby had never liked insects her older brothers used to torment her with caterpillars the cocoon on the bed implied that this creature was a kind of human bug and the idea was so distasteful that abby wanted to flee the room or call out for help william appeared to sense her distress abby he saidit was the first time william had called her by her given name as if he were an adultthis is rosa connor she cant speak but she wont hurt you all she wants to do is leave shes fragile and im afraid shell get hurt if the others find her here abby do you understand of course she did not how could one understand such things but she recognized the sincerity in williams voice he was an odd child abby thought dizzily abby knew children she had raised a daughter of her own and had been raising her daughters two boys when contact took them away william looked a little like cory her oldest grandson cory had always been bringing things home stones bottletopscocoons she had tried to share his interest at least from a distance had tried to enter that childs world where everything was a mystery and a fascination perhaps william was fascinated with thiscreature abbys heart was pounding desperately against her ribs but she thought of paul jacopetti in the basement of the buchanan hospital and she resolved to quell her panic this time not make the same mistake she closed her eyes and swallowed hard if it wants to leave she said why doesnt it abby did you ever see a butterfly when its new the wings are wet they have to dry otherwise it would just fall i see how much longer minutes williami cant stop anyone from coming upstairs but if you dont call out i wont she was steadily calmer but colonel tyler is searching the house we only need a short time abby a short time is all you may have even in this extremity william was impressed by rosas grace she grasped the window frame with arms as delicate as strings fingers like threads she pulled herself up paused on the sill facing inward then unfolded her wings behind her stretched them to their full span wide sails coralpatterned the blues and purples a lighter hue in the sunlight she was like an enormous orchid blossom when the wind blew she trembled almost rosa told him now then abby gasped the door opened colonel tyler it was remarkable abby thought how quickly tyler seemed to grasp the situation his eyes flickered from abby to william to the insect woman he was obviously shocked but not shocked motionless as abby had been his hand was suddenly active he drew that pistol he always carried no abby said the colonel paid her no attention his attention was wholly focused on the creature william had called rosa and his face was a twisted grimace of distaste abby had been afraid but the colonelthe colonel she realized was offended he stood with his legs braced apart and aimed the pistol at rosa with both hands abby felt as if time had slowed to a miserly crawl there was time to see everything see williams sadness and concern see the insect woman arching her impossible wings against the morning sky see tylers pistol in all its intricacy a complex steelgray machine she heard the rasp of her own breath in her throat like the tick of a metronome time to see no time to act but now william was moving for all the compression of time abby thought the boy was quick impossibly quick inhumanly quick he threw himself at tylers body the impact turned the colonels pistol toward the ceiling tyler fired and the sound in the enclosed room was an insult to the ears cruelly loud plaster rained from the ceiling there was a hole there ragged and small christ tyler raged abby looked to the window where the insect womans wings lifted caught air rippled and then rosa was away dropping in a long trajectory a glide then rising tyler staggered to the window raised his pistol once more william was beside him tugging his arm down tyler pushed the boy aside abby heard williams head crack against the wall no she cried it was not a decent way to treat a child william straightened unhurt but tylers gun was pointed at him now no abby said furiously colonel stop was he deaf william turned his face toward her it was absurd but abby felt he wanted to reassure her to tell her he would be all right he was not all right the boy looked at colonel tyler and said quite clearly i know what you are colonel tyler pulled the trigger williams chest exploded noooo abbys voice was a wail of grief tyler fired again now at williams head where his eyes were still blinking abby could not bear the sound of the shot or the result of it so much blood she could not help thinking of cory or her other grandson damian of her daughter laura she had lost laura to an airplane tragedy and cory and damian to the greater world and although william wasnt family abby could not tolerate the loss of another child any child for the sin of impeding colonel john tylers line of fire so she did what william had done hurried across the room through slowmotion time knowing it was too late seeing but not seeing the impossible amount of blood and threw herself at colonel tyler who fell backward then they were wrestling for the pistol abby surprised by her own physical strength and the strength of her hatred eyes blurred by tears wanting to rip the pistol from tylers hand and punish him with it but managing only to twist it in his grip and tyler pulled the trigger twice more both shots wild chipping paint and dust from the wallboard until at last her strength and courage ebbed and tyler thrust her aside and sat with the pistol aimed at herabby thinking shoot me go ahead you childmurdering bastardthen someone was holding her from behind and tyler horribly was pointing his pistol at the boys corpse abby hes not human look nudging the limp body with his foot this isnt blood christs sake it looks like thirtyweight motor oil jesus did any of that matter no abby thought in a gesture that surprised even herself abby collected all the saliva that remained in her dry mouth and spat into colonel tylers face her aim was precise tyler froze everyone in the rooma crowd now including bob ganish paul jacopetti and joey commoner who was holding her from behindfroze and waited take her to her trailer the colonel said the spittle ran down his cheek and his voice was a razory whine take her there and keep her there ill deal with this later rosa perry connor rode the morning thermals up long inclines of warming air until the ranch was far below her she moved in the sky with an easy familiarity the sky was not an empty space not a vacuum it was an ocean rosa thought rich with currents inviting discovery appreciation acrobatics glides and sweeping sensuous curves it was intoxicating she watched her shadow flow across dry rangeland over scrub and cheat grass like ocean swells far below the sun was warm on her wings she knew what had happened in the connor house she felt williams release it was premature he had been a sojourner like herself an old man in a boys body she broadcast her sorrow in the direction of home the ecstasy of flight and this unhappiness mingled in her william accepted her consolation but lightly he was also sharing her pleasure in the flight it was the human tragedy that saddened him tragedy is what they live in rosa thought tragedy is their ocean williamtheir air he touched her with a sad rebuke that was not quite contradiction you were human once yes rosa acknowledged she fixed her attention on the far peak of home chinablue in the morning light human once she thought but not anymore abby cushman was confined after some struggle in her camper with joey standing guard at the door dazed beyond thinking and weak with grief she pressed her face against the window and watched rosas orchidcolored wings grow small in the southern sky chapter provocation beth came out of her camper at the sound of the gunshot and hurried into the farmhouse she found abby cushman in tears joey and bob ganish leading her away upstairs matt wheeler was arguing with colonel tyler beth stood at the stairway end of the corridor too far away to hear the argument clearly but she was startled by the ferocity of it and by the way colonel tylers hand hovered near his pistol the unexplained violence in the air made her dizzy these two admirable men matt in faded jeans and shirt the colonel in a threadbare officers jacket looked usedup worn out by their own anger she heard matt say something about killing and colonel tyler fiercely he was some kind of spy not human she heard tyler say who were they talking about then matt told tyler he couldnt make a prisoner of abby cushman and tyler said the doctor wasnt in a position to give orders and there were more of these bitter clipped words until matt stalked awaybeth concealed herself in an empty bedroom as he passedand the argument was finished she was surprised by a sudden thought that both of these men had touched her tyler with his large hand matt more intimately somehow she was a party to this she walked down the corridor to colonel tyler he registered her presence though his eyes were distant beth said what happened peering past him into a room where the window was open broken and there was an acrid smellis that blood in there the colonel put his hand on her shoulder another touch and steered her away ill explain he said it was william who had been the spy the boy was dead the colonel explained and beth retired to her camper they had acquired all these vehicles at a dealership in the willamette valley on the eastern side of the coast range where the storm hadnt done as much damage it was strange beth thought everybody driving these travelaire and citations with connections for running water and tv sets these fancy boxes on wheels everything we ever made beth thoughtwe human beingsmost of it was boxes a house is a box she thought an office building is a box a tv is a box and a microwave oven is a box of radiation all these boxes nobody made boxes anymore all the boxes well ever need beth thought idly people left them lying around for free alone she listened to the mornings violence echo and rebound through the camp footsteps doors slammed angry voices now and then she wasnt accustomed to violence her family had never been violent unless you counted her fathers occasional deer hunts her mother was a careful prim woman who left home and moved to terre haute with a new husband when beth was fifteen years old her father was often angry but he never actually hit her since that trouble when she was fourteen her quick d c at a seattle hospital he had seldom even looked at her nobody had looked at her except to laugh or make funexcept joey she dozed through the afternoon afraid of what might be happening outside at dinnertime she left the camper and found tyler and joey and paul jacopetti building a fire in a barbecue pit behind the farmhouse people didnt want to eat a meal inside the house where william had died the colonel ignored her jacopetti ignored her joey watched her the way he always watched herfollowing her with i his eyes not making a big deal of it but relentlessly she felt his attention like a toothache he had been watching her like this every day since they had left buchanan a casual proprietary surveillance that made her itch with indignation she decided she wasnt hungry she turned her back on the men and walked to the front of the farmhouse and inside although the hotmetal odor of this mornings bloodshed was still hanging in the air miriam flett was inside sitting in a chair doing nothing watching the dust float beth approached her with caution she imagined the old woman must be horribly sad it was obvious shed liked that boy even if he was a spy not human miriam looked up at beths approach her face crowded with wrinkles im sorry beth said i didnt mean to startle you its all right miriams voice was a dry whisper you must was this the right thing to say you must feel terrible im sorry about what happened they told you about it the colonel did he said william wasuh not entirely human miriam supplied but i knew that about him did you still he died its sad if he wasnt human miriam said primly he didnt die it took beth a moment to interpret this i guess not its hard to get used to the idea though then miriam did something beth had not seen her do before she smiled it was hard for me too she said there was some talk of moving on or back to the truckstop some place away from this unhappy house but colonel tyler vetoed the idea at least until morning they could sleep in their vehicles there was no real urgency beth supposed he was right but the encampment that evening was steeped in an ugly silence just before dark while there was still a rosy light around the high slope of the human artifact tim belanger unhooked the campertrailer from the rear of his pickup truck and went roaring away east he escaped beth thought just like tom kindleanother refugee another one gone beth thought sadly nine of us left altogether she wished it had been joey who left she found him damping the fire in back of the farmhouse the fire had been the only significant light on this prairie and she was sorry to see it flicker out joey wore his ancient skullandroses tshirt and a leather jacket to keep away the night chill his pistol was tucked under his belt it was a smallcaliber pistol but beth thought it was reckless of colonel tyler to have given joey any kind of gun it was a miracle joey hadnt blown his own balls off with it she hadnt come looking for him she wanted to walk a distance into the connors grazing land and be by herself watch the stars come out and try to make some sense of everything that had happened but joey waved her over sit down he said i was going somewhere beth said aware of how pathetic it sounded taking in a movie goin down to the mall beth he laughed its a fuckin desert out here everywhere we go is some kind of desert or other doesnt it rain anywhere but buchanan it rains in ohio ohio joey said scornfully he poured another bucket of sand over the embers until even that faint light was lost some wild events this morning she nodded i saw the whole thing two shots he cocked his index finger bam the chest bam the head you dont want to know what it looked like it was obvious the kid wasnt human inside he was likeshit i dont know like a watermelon full of motor oil christ joey he smiled at her facts of life is abby cushman still under guard jacopettis outside her door not that he could stop her from coming out i take over from him when im done here it doesnt really matterwheres she gonna go like tom kindle or tim belanger maybe just leave nope i pulled the distributor cable out of her engine does colonel tyler know that he said it showed initiative big grin beth resented joeys access to the colonel it was joeys influence that had caused most of their problems she was sure of it she remembered tylers hand on her shoulder this morning familiar hand she had memorized the sensation his touch was like a token of everything shed gained since contact and joey was everything she wanted to forget the two of them together it was an unbearable combination bam joey said reminiscing ill tell you one thing theres less of now theres less bullshit it was a callous stupid thing to say and it made her angry the end of the world is a good thing because you get to carry a gun for the first time in your life sounds like bullshit to me if the world hadnt ended i wouldnt be carrying a pistol true if the world hadnt ended you wouldnt be fucking a doctor she flushed with anger you dont know who i sleep with you dont have a clue all im saying is dont act superior when youre out there with a tor sale sign between your legs maybe the rage she felt had been inside her all along and maybe it wasnt even joey she was mad at but oh christ after a long and fuckedup day when somebody had died for gods sake to have joey commoner call her a slut to be sneered at by himit erased everything she had pretended to achieve it was unspeakable and she hated him for it she blinked back tears joey was watching her was maddeningly attentive his face calm and slack in the starlight and suddenly beth recalled a dream she had once had joey as a wild horse beth the rider she rides him to the top of some high cliff he balks and she spurs him and he jumps shut up beth just close your mouth don make it worse she felt lightheaded utterly weightless this cliff she thought this desert bastard she said you dont know everything that goes on in this camp try me joey said chapter precipice matt was not quite asleep when the knock came at the door of his camper he sat up and peered out the window at prairie night the stars were the color of ice and there was a milky glow on the eastern horizon where the moon was about to rise beth he wondered but it was late even for beth and it hadnt sounded like her knock not that reckless three discreet taps dear god he thought wearily what now he pulled on a tshirt and briefs and stumbled to the door tap tap tap all right christs sake hold on he opened the door and stood mute in a river of night air matthew tom kindle said lemme in before i freeze my balls off kindle didnt look good he wasnt hurt but he looked chastened matt tried to remember where he had seen that look on tom kindle before of course it was when he came into the hospital with his broken leg raving about monsters about a thousand years ago matt kept the light low and poured his friend a cup of lukewarm coffee from a thermos you didnt get too damn far did you not much farther than laramie ill bet kindle put aside his rifle and shrugged his eyes were lost among wrinkles like crevices i took a little trip south toward that uh that thing the new artifact i admit i was curious about it arent you even sitting on the horizon its big enough to fill half a sky he took a long noisy sip of coffee and its strange matthew it draws the attention you ever been down to moab the canyonlands around there same kind of strangeness red rock blue sky and everythings too big maybe a person loses some judgment i looked at that thing a long time and then i started to wonder if i could get up close to it did you get close no not very he shook his head close enough though the air gets foul it smells like sulphur and it burns your lungs the ground isnt too steady either matthewthe thing is rooted to the earth literally it looks like it put down roots roots made of some kind of stone black sandstone or maybe pumice miles wide and matthew in the shadow of those roots there were certain things moving around things machines i guess or animals or both somehow but they were big enough to see from miles away hazy in the distance the way you might see a city from across a lakethey were as big as that big as a city and taller than they were wide and different shapes like giraffes or gantries or spiders or cranes he shuddered they must have built that entire thing since last augusthave you thought about that a thing the size of a mountain in half a year god almighty and matthew while i was watching those creatures move around a thought occurred to me they must be about finished their work i thought it doesnt look like a halfmade thing and its a spaceship right when its ready it goes into orbit spaceship the size of delaware and here we are sitting practically on its tail i came back north this morning and found you folks still parked here and i dont think thats too intelligent its tyler matt said he claims there was a radio message some bad weather east of here so were staying put there was a vote on this one of the colonels votes bullshit and gerrymander yeah basically he claims there was a radio message wellthe radio blew up while he was using it supposedly any witnesses nope you put up with this horseshit hes not a stupid man tom he had the committee rolled up like a carpet made me look paranoid a little paranoias not a bad thing i was careful coming toward camp left my camper in back of a billboard and hiked away from the road i spent most of the afternoon hidden behind a rise south of here watching folks mill around am i crazy or is joey commoner standing guard on abbys trailer matt told him about the insect woman about williams death and abbys altercation with the colonel kindle listened carefully eyes wide she had wings i saw her in the air matt said yes she had wings they looked like butterfly wings oh matt too many fuckin miracles kindle said uhhuh that about summed it up kindle held his rifle in his lap the question is what are you planning to do about it he cant keep abby in her trailer indefinitely weather or no weather well have to move on soon might not be time i dont know why tylers stalling but i dont think it matters that mountain on the horizon isnt going to wait for us its not just tylers risk theres abbyand that old lady miriam and beth matt thought but tylers still got the committee wrapped up im not talking about a vote im talking about haying bugging out soon say tonight you just got back i mean everybody everybody who isnt playing handmaiden to colonel tyler i saw tim belanger headed east by himself obviously hes got the right idea so we round up abby we get miriam beth matt said and beth and we take one of these big rvs and leave before the colonel gets his act together it would have to be this camper i dont want to leave my medical supplies behind okay this camper theres room for everybody until we can find more transportation were only a couple of days from ohio if we keep moving i thought you didnt want to go to ohio i thought you wanted to see the wind river range maybe i just want to see the last of tyler maybe i dont like the fact that he locked up abby cushman kindle lifted his rifle and sighted down the length of it or maybe some asshole talked me into thinking of this fuckin trailer camp as a town beth was ashamed of what she had told joey but tantalized by it too he had reacted with an enraged denial and here was the scary part she liked it she had always liked her ability to rouse joey from his slumberous complacencyto make him horny to make him mad poke the tiger and see if he bites even if it was her he bit maybe especially if it was her she had left joey by the dead fire in back of the house had left him stewing in his own anger and it was only fair beth told herself not nice but fair now they were even she was restless in her bed with the memory you want to know where im spending the night in that camper joey had said like you always do not every night not the whole night listen remembering it made her weakkneed and hot in every sense of the word if she left her camper now would joey notice he was guarding abby cushman with her cheek pressed against the rear window beth could just see the light of the burning sterno he used to keep himself warm joey took his guard duty seriously he hardly ever slept anymore he didnt seem to need to he was crouched against the meager light like a troll beth thought if i leave on the other side of the camper and circle around toward the house it might be possible she put on her old jeans and a blouse then she took three deep breaths and opened the door into cold prairie night she stepped out barefoot with her long hair loose like a country girl there was more light than she really liked the moon had just come up and was it a reflection of the moonlight or was the earthbound artifact glowing with some subtle light of its own a pale white pulsation as if it were storing up some peculiar kind of energy beth moved lightly silently in the radiant night miriam back in her camper understood that distant glow it registered on her eyelids and behind them as she lay in bed her body eroding from within miriam was two places now here and home the neocytes had worked quickly miriam at home was not made of blood and skin was not even altogether material and miriam became more wholly that miriam with every tick of the clock as this miriamthe old and usedup and ailing miriamgrew increasingly hollow and fragile she turned her head to the window and saw home bathed in a ghostly nimbus summoning the energies that would lift it free of the earth summoning the energies miriam thought that would carry it to the stars a human epistemos in the growing awareness of the galaxy very soon now miriam thought colonel tyler had occupied a downstairs room in the connor housea room that once had been vince connors study with a filing cabinet full of deeds insurance documents and bookkeeping ledgers and a leather sofa long enough to stretch out on colonel tyler sat in what had been vinces favorite chair a highbacked recliner finished in olivegreen naugahyde although it was very late the colonel was awake he hadnt slept for three nights nowa bad sign he hated the dark in the dark sissy tended to disappear and as bad as her presence was to be alone was often worse the days were all right in the day there was sunlight a horizon at night doubts came swarming doubts and sometimes madness it seemed to colonel tyler that his madness which had once been a sealed box had spilled out into his everyday life madness was everywhere in sissy whose persistence was probably not normal in the derangement of the world in the appearance of the insect woman and the death of the pseudochild william and today tim belanger had left camp and that seemed the worst omen of all the symptom of a disintegration that had begun to move from the peripheral tom kindle to the more central tim belanger and would eventually strike at the core ganish jacopetti joey even himself colonel tyler he looked up startled beth porter stood in the doorway he hadnt heard her knock he cleared his throat beth he summoned up the daylight colonel john tyler she glanced at him and then at the service revolver he had placed on the arm of the recliner are you okay who had last asked him that a w murdoch he thought in that little town in georgia in loftus certainly i am may i come in he nodded she stepped into the meager light of a single lamp and closed the door behind her she was not a child tyler thought nor yet quite an adult she still moved like a teenager with a teenagers unconscious coltishness what brings you out so late just that i was lonely beth said i thought it might be warmer in here matt and kindle approached the sterno fire in front of abbys trailer expecting a brisk whogoesthere from joey the fire cast tall nervous shadows on the aluminum wall of the camper the camper was dark and the door was closed but joey wasnt there maybe he got tired and found somewhere to sleep matt said or took a bathroom break kindle shook his head joey doesnt sleep and he pees in the bushes when he figures hes alone this is peculiar he rapped his bony knuckles on the door abbys voice sleepy and chastened came from inside whos there me kindle said me and matt we need to talk a few seconds later she was at the door in an old blue nightgown looking at kindle with sleepy eyes and a stew of emotions you selfish son of a bitchyou left selfish sob came back kindle said abby i didnt know he was going to lock you up where is joey abby wondered she turned her head at the sound of the gunshot hold up kindle said christs sake hold up he stopped matt and abby before they ran across the open space to the connor house the shot had seemed to come from there think about this whos in the house tyler probably matt said i dont know who else which room is tyler using around the side show me but stay back from the house they circled clockwise in the dark behind the row of rvs where lights had begun to come on that window matt said it was a small side window with a roll blind across it they saw a second flare of light in that confined space a second gunshot and moments later a third rosa perry connor didnt hear the shots she was far away attending to another summons she had flown miles from the connor farmhouse carried more by wind than volition she had flown south past the artifact had soared high above the faint smudge of denver an abandoned city and then away from the mountains and across the plains in a wordless ecstasy of flight her lifespan in this altered body was short but sufficient night fell she approached the stars on gusts of colder darker air she grew lighter as her physical resources were exhausted it was time to go home the summons had gone out all over the world sojourners in the air the sea on the land come home come home now time for the great departure but like a guilty child at bedtime rosa lingered a moment longer the moon rose over the lightless immensity of the high plains one wingbeat more rosa thought one more savoring the brisk night wind that would carry her dust away chapter wounds joey had been doing sentinel duty every night since they crossed the snake and he had learned how to listen to the dark every night he made a fire to keep himself warm it was spring and the days were often hot but after dark the heat bled into the sky the air grew cold and the wind cut close to the bone make a fire too big though and the sound of it would obliterate every other sound at first he burned windfall roadside trash loose barn boards or stick furniture from wasteland shacks abandoned long before contact pine knots in the old wood exploded like gunshots and their sparks threatened to ignite the dry sage beyond the blacktop highway it was colonel tyler who showed him how to light the little cans of sterno jelly and joey had begun to collect them from the sportssupply and generalmerchandise shops in the towns they passed the sterno burned almost silently just a whisper as the wind whipped the flames it gave off precious little heatwith luck enough to warm his hands but in his leather jacket he was generally okay the campers were lined up outside the connor house and joey sat minding his sterno fire on the concrete drive at abby cushmans door listening he had honed his listening skills quickly the world might seem empty but joey knew it wasnt there were animals for one thing dogs expets maybe learning how to survive in the wild or wild dogs or wolveshe had heard some howling the last couple of nights and people it was amazing the variety of noises people made on a still night these campertrailers had thin walls and he often heard the murmur of night talk people talking to themselves talking in their sleep or rolling over in bed rocking the rv a little maybe somebody trotting into the house to use a toilet somebody else restless stepping outside to look at the stars tonight he tried to calm himself to make his ears come alive but he couldnt help rerunning his encounter with beth it was stupid what she had said joey knew what went on in this camp especially at night he knew all about beth and what beth did at night slept alone mostly snuck over to the doctors rv sometimes which was bad enough the mystery of beth was that he simultaneously wanted her and didnt sometimes just looking at the way she moved across the tarmac in her blue jeans was enough to give joey a raging hardon other times she was as appealing as a dayold cut of meat sometimes he hated to think about her sometimes he hated to think of anyone else thinking about her he guessed she was fucking the doctor and as bad as that was he had begun to live with the idea but the thing she had told him tonighther dirty comments about colonel tyler no it was impossible colonel tyler joey thought was like an avenging angel a pure and powerful force from far beyond the limits of this ratty trailer caravan it was colonel tyler who had come into the ruins of buchanan with clean clothes and a pistol on his hip and asked to talk to mr joseph commoner it was tyler who had trusted joey to walk the perimeter tyler who had trusted him with a gun the idea that the colonel would stoop to some furtive little night fuck with a nonentity like bethit was obscene and he didnt believe it but the night wore on and the moon began to rise and the new artifact radiated a pale light of its own and joey heard beths door ease openthe whine of the hinges above the mothflutter of the sterno flameand he stood and took three silent steps to the corner of abbys camper helplessly curious and watched beth moving a shadow to the front door of the connor house and inside probably she was just using the toilet but joey itched with the insult of what she had told him and he circled around the house to the side to the window where colonel tylers light was still burning the blind was down but joey put his face to the glass and was able to capture an angle of vision where the blind gapped against the sill colonel tyler sat motionless in a chair his pistol rested on the arm joey touched his own pistol snug against his belt he knew the colonel couldnt see him that the lamp and the blind would have made a mirror of the window on a night this dark but his face was hot with shame and suspicion and his heart was beating wildly he saw colonel tyler look toward the door saw his lips move but couldnt make out the words the door was at the wrong angle and joey wasnt able to see who had arrived but who else could it be he began to take small sharp breaths colonel tyler spoke paused spoke again joey registered these images but ceased to think about them he couldnt think any longer could only watch now beth moved into his range of vision she was dressed too lightly for the weather she was blushing a little she looked nervous and aroused her hair hanging loose around her shoulders she came and stood beside tylers chair tyler didnt move beth spoke words inaudible she reached for tylers huge hand and took it in her own she put his hand on her blouse on her breast and moved against it in a way that seemed to joey brutally obscene joey took his pistol out of his belt and hurried to the front of the house once it was obvious why beth had come tyler felt in control of the situation she wasnt much different from the hundreds of such women tyler had hired at various times in his life and there was nothing very surprising he thought about her presence tonight apparently he had inherited more than a gavel from the deposed matt wheeler she put his hand against her blouse and he felt the shape of her breast the hard nugget of the nipple he admired the sight of his hand there the creviced skin against the flimsy cloth he stood up and pressed her against him she wasnt very tall her head was tilted back her eyes halfclosed expecting a kiss tyler didnt kissit was a dirty habit instead he tangled his right hand in her hair and pulled her eyes widened he warned her not to speak not to say anything he didnt like women who talked he pressed his hips against her put his left hand under her blouse and explored he pulled her head back until her throat was exposed in a fine white curve she wasnt sure what to make of the pain seemed to hover between arousal and fear her blue jeans were closed with a row of buttons tyler had opened two of them when joey kicked open the door colonel tyler had never been wounded in combathe had never experienced combat firsthandand he was surprised when the bullet hit him there was pain and anger but first of all above all else an enormous surprise as if it were an act of god a causeless momentum that tumbled him backward he caught himself against the recliner with his right hand the left hand his left arm in fact wouldnt answer to the helm it felt as if someone had cut off the arm and replaced it with a fleshy useless slab of rubber there was blood all over his shoulder beth was still standing though the shot must have come very near her head tyler realized that she was screaming that the sound was exterior to him move away joey was telling herthe colonel recognized joeys petulant whine get out of the way tyler braced his hip against the recliner and reached for his own pistol he had loaded it earlier tonight he had meant only to touch its cold steel against his forehead perhaps taste the barrel with his tongue as was his habit never to pull the trigger sissy always talked him out of that but now someone else had pulled a trigger someone else had shot him joey had shot him he grasped the pistol and swiveled around one foot slid against the polished oak floor and tyler bumped to a sitting position with his back against the recliner joey must have tracked this motion as a fall or ignored it altogether his attention was still on beth to the colonels eyes joey looked grotesque inflated with jealousy to bullfrog proportions move aside joey repeated and beth seemed finally to understand she took two steps toward the window and turned to look for tyler perhaps she saw the blood for the first time her eyes widened and tyler wondered if she would scream again beth looked a little ridiculous too with her smooth belly showing through the gap of her unbuttoned pants joey looked at the colonel and the colonel shot him in the head there was no precision or elegance in the act only the raising of the pistol and the pulling of the trigger and joey falling down and convulsing for a horrible thirty or forty seconds before he died beth went to joey and knelt above him and made a choked sound at the sight of his injury her hand rested on the pistol joey had dropped beside him colonel tyler watched that hand watch that hand sissy instructed him sissy was a sudden nebulous presence hovering near the ceiling of the room but tyler didnt look for her merely followed her advice watched beths hand on the pistol she took up the pistol and turned it toward tyler was she offering it threatening him with it the expression on her face was unreadable opaque with grief there was no way to calculate the danger so colonel tyler shot her too at the sound of the third gunshot matt ran to his trailer and collected his gladstone bag kindle tried to restrain him at the door its stupid to go in there matthew we dont know what happened matthew just wait for christs sake matt ignored him ran past him to the connor house in its patch of moonlight and inside where it was dark chapter prophylaxis the girl was a mistake sissy said colonel tyler weak with blood loss climbed from the floor into the recliner and gave his mothers ghost a weary look it was unusual for sissy to be out after dark but she was not merely present tonight she was almost tangible her layered skirts billowed around her large body her skin was fishwhite and her eyes were crazed and attentive if i walked over to that corner of the room tyler thought i bet i could touch her you shouldnt have shot the girl you might have been able to explain about the boy you might have gotten away with that but not the girl you told me to watch her hand nor to shoot her she picked up the gun she wouldnt have used it tyler began an answer but stopped as the door opened matthew wheeler stood there with his gladstone bag and a dazed expression obviously struggling to sort out what had happened his eyes flickered from body to bodyjoey beth tyler tyler raised his pistol an action that was almost reflexive and aimed it at the doctor now listen to me sissy said if you dont do this exactly right everyone will come in here everyone will come nosing into this room to see what you did theyll know what you are and well be lost so listen to me listen colonel tyler the doctor said i cant treat anyone if youre pointing a gun at me let me come in but his attention was obviously on beth the girls breathing was wet and loud in the room it reminded tyler of the sound bathwater made as it ran down the drain tyler held the pistol firmly and listened to sissys urgent whispers then he answered the doctor come in close the door behind you ill come in if you put down the gun youll come in or ill shoot you dr wheeler its as simple as that wheeler hesitated but he entered the room after another long look at beth now close the door tyler said wheeler did so he moved to lean over the girl was fumbling with his bag but tyler said nonot yet the doctors irritation was obvious she needs attention shes badly injured of course she is i shot her now go to the window wheeler looked skeptically at the pistol i wont hesitate to use this does it look like i would we have two corpses here already one corpse wheeler said shes still alive tyler nodded impatiently and took more silent advice from sissy he leaned forward though it hurt his bad arm and trained the pistol on the girl so she is i guess you want to keep it that way now go to the fucking window wheeler stood erect finally and did as he was told pull up those blinds all the way good now open the window good and turn off the lamp ill need the lamp to work youre not working yet dr wheeler turn off the lamp please wheeler switched it off now the room was dark no light but moonlight and a fainter bluer radiance that might have come from the direction of the human artifact tyler looked out at the space beyond the connor house the last rv in the caravan bob ganishs big glendale was framed in the window i want everyone assembled where i can see them how am i supposed to manage that colonel use your wellknown powers of persuasion tell them i have a gun on you wheeler leaned through the open window and signaled to abby cushman who was standing not far away sissy was distracted by the light from the artifact which flared brighter as tyler watched that mountain may be ready to rise good tyler thought then we can go to ohio and no one will know what we are except these few who mustnt go with us how to stop them you know how its an awful lot of people to kill tyler thought well be clever sissy said well think of something matt waved over abby cushman and told her to assemble everyone in the space between this window and bob ganishs glendale have them stand there where the colonel can see them abby she stood a wary distance from the window squinting at him whats this all about matt is anyone hurt i cant talk about it she took another step forward her eyeglasses reflected the moonlight she looks like an owl matt thought a frightened owl he thought of vaulting this windowsill joining her outside and leaving the colonel to tend his own injury but beth was under the colonels gun and badly hurt he heard her terrible stertorous breathing he wanted to finish with all this menacing foolishness and get on with the business of helping her abby came close enough to see tyler in the dim room the pistol aimed at beth dear god just do as he says abby get everybody in one place and try not to worry she pressed her fist to her mouth but nodded and turned away now stand back from the window dr wheeler tyler said he did so may i treat the girl not yet she may be dying probably tyler said but lets get our ducks in order first jesus christ tyler it was too much the colonel gestured with his pistol at beths prostrate body if you mean to be uncooperative it would be easy to resolve the issue right now looking at tyler was like peering into an open cesspool in a single day this man had killed two people and he might be killing a third by delaying medical attention obviously some internal restraint had snapped obviously tyler was mad it was vital to watch what he said to weigh his words before he spoke ill need more than what i have in my bag ill need bandages in due course be quiet the colonels attention was focused beyond the window abby had begun lining up people in front of the aluminum moonglow of ganishs rv matt counted them off impatiently abby bob ganish chuck makepeace paul jacopetti the count seemed short kindle he thought where was tom kindle but wait kindle had come back into camp only an hour ago tyler wouldnt expect to see him in the line up as far as the colonel knew tom kindle was still absent okaynevertheless where was he abby gestured for his attention go back to the window tyler said slowly he did wave her over matt waved tell her theres someone missing matt gave tyler an involuntary stare somehow he knows about kindle tyler said the old womanmiriam flett he relayed the message to abby i know abby said she stood at the window with her eyes fixed on tylers pistol obviously hating it hating him thats what i wanted to tell you miriams in her trailer we cant wake her up christ almighty the last thing he needed was another casualtyand where was all this light coming from very well tyler was saying tell mrs cushman to take everyone inside that glendale and close the door abby said i can hear you quite well colonel tyler for how long until further notice go on abby matt said everything will be fine i promise she stalked off and herded three sullen figures into the rv ganish chuck makepeace jacopetti the last sullen remnant of buchanan oregon the door closed behind her and matt felt suddenly much more alone he was about to turn away from the window when his eye tracked a glimmer of moonlight or whatever peculiar light this was at the right rear corner of the glendale he might be mistaken but it looked like the barrel of tom kindles rifle had tyler seen it apparently tyler had not tylers uniform was sodden with blood he must be weak matt thought he ought to be in shock by all rights there was something more than frightening about the colonels calm facade it was almost supernatural ill need bandages he said i dont want you going out there where those people are i cant work miracles colonel these wounds need bandages your wound for instance i needwell at least clean cloth there should be such a thing in the house i think theres a linen closet in the upstairs hall you trust me that far dont be asinine if youre not back promptly ill shoot the girl or if i see you out that window ill shoot the girl get what you need but hurry tylers face was pale and glassy with sweat matt was out of the room for five minutes he came back with a stack of clean white linen a box of kotex from rosa connors bathroom cupboard and a plan the plan was ugly and the plan was dangerous but it was the only way matt could see into a future that contained both himself and a chance at least for beth the room which had been vince connors study was bathed in bright blue light from the window matt was conscious of the light but couldnt spare any thought for it he had achieved a narrow intense focus of attention it reminded him of his days as an intern there were times at the end of a long shift when he would be sleepless and vague and running on empty and some emergency would arise and either he would screw it up maybe threatening somebodys life or he would force himself into this condition of unnatural clarity this bright bubble of concentration he concentrated on tyler and beth the angle of his approach to the problem the geometry of life and death he went to beth first but tyler said again not yet im losing considerable blood i dont want to pass out shes in worse shape than you are colonel i know that tyler said irritably i want you to stop this bleeding from my shoulder then you can attend to the girl matt didnt argue focus he thought any distraction was too much distraction tyler trained his pistol on beth but allowed matt close enough to examine his wound there was enough light to see that the bullet had passed through fairly cleanly joey shot you tyler nodded he found me with the girl he watched for marts reaction does that shock you not especially she waswhats a polite word for it loose maybe you arent too tightly wrapped yourself colonel what nothing matt took his pulse it was rapid but not weak are you nauseous dizzy not particularly the wound isnt as bad as it looks i cant feel anything in the arm damaged a nerve maybe under the circumstances i cant do anything about that you understand tyler nodded matt tore away the shirt and packed a sanitary napkin against the entrance wound and a second behind the shoulder where the bullet had come out the kotex was absorbent and wouldnt stick to the wound he improvised a broad bandage and wound it around tylers shoulder tyler winced the pain was beginning to break through his defenses when the dressing was secure matt opened his bag he took a disposable syringe out of its wrapper and thumbed the plastic protector off the needle his attention kept wandering to tylers pistol aimed almost casually at beth how much pressure was necessary to squeeze that trigger how much awareness to keep it aimed he put the hypodermic needle through the rubber seal of a small brown vial and drew up a measured amount of clear liquid tyler was watching him what is that a systemic antibiotic bullets arent especially clean is it necessary depends do you want to risk gangrene were a long way from a hospital colonel tyler regarded him silently for a time oddly he seemed to be listening to what voice matt wondered what invisible third party can you inject it into the bad arm because im not putting down the pistol im not that stupid how about the leg matt said the thigh im not taking off my pants either its a broad weave the needle will pass through the cloth it isnt very sanitary however tyler shrugged distracted by his pain matt flushed air from the syringe flicked away bubbles then pushed the needle into the meat of tylers leg and forced the plunger down may i tend the girls wound now very well tyler said sissy colonel tyler pleaded im too weak youre not his mothers ghost insisted stay awake stay awake she hovered in the corner and she smelled like stale bloodor perhaps it was the room youre not hurt bad the doctor said so you trust him he took an oath they all take an oath but im so tired tyler thought you have it all sissy said you have all the guns all the guns are in this room joeys gone the girl is gone tom kindle is gone tim belanger is gone the old woman is no threat you can kill the doctor whenever you like and there are only four in that trailer and theyre unarmed and one of them is a woman and one of them is an old man four would be easy to kill all this killing tyler thought he was a little dazed by it you must sissy scolded him or people will know tyler guessed he could do it shoot wheeler walk out to the trailer walking would be the hard part open the door and shoot until everybody was dead it wasnt complicated but it would be difficult and he was so very tired he lifted the pistol which had drooped away from its target beth but the pistol was oddly heavyand a new suspicion entered the colonels mind the light was much brighter now matt crouched over beth he was afraid of the wound but he forced himself to look at it he unbuttoned her blouse and pulled it away exposing her small breasts her pale skin freckled with blood the bullet had penetrated the chest wall and allowed air to flow into the chest cavity each time she exhaled bloody bubbles formed on the wound her inhalations were labored choked and liquid he couldnt find an exit wound the bullet was still inside her might have been deflected by a bone he took a carotid pulse it was weak and irregular she was clammy and didnt respond when he raised her eyelid he took another sanitary pad from the box and used the plastic wrapping to cover beths chest wound it was urgent to seal this opening and the plastic was reasonably clean reasonably airtight when he fastened it with surgical tape then he lifted her into a semisitting position with her body inclined toward the injury and her breathing seemed to ease a little beth he thought her head lolled to one side he needed to keep her blood volume up and he needed to get her to a hospital even then with modern equipment at hand he wasnt sure of his ability to treat the wound singlehandedly he might have to explore for the bullet he looked at tyler tylers eyelids were drooping his mouth moved but soundlessly who was he talking to matt watched the colonels hand sag until the pistol was aimed not at beth but at the floor tylers mouth hung open now his eyes were nearly closed matt turned his attention back to beth shell need an improvised stretcher he thought and which would be the fastest vehicle and where was the nearest hospital laramie cheyenne he stood up and turned to the door but here was an unhappy miracle tyler stood up too he came out of vince connors old recliner like neptune from the briny deep his eyes were wide his pupils small and the blue light from the window made an eerie halo around him it wasnt an antibiotic tyler said it had been morphine perhaps enough to kill him certainly enough to sedate him and what miracle of will or sheer evil had allowed him to resist it even this long tylers good right hand came cranking up the pistol in it im going to die here matt realized in this stupid room for this stupid reason then tyler looked puzzled turned his head aside and vomited massively across vince connors desk matt dropped to the floor he wanted just a little time time enough for the morphine to do its work as it inevitably must he rolled into the corner of the room knocking over a table lamp at the sound colonel tyler jerked his head the pistol swiveled with his look simultaneously the door crashed open tom kindle stood in the dark hallway with the barrel of his hunting rifle sweeping the room tyler pivoted to face the motion kindle fired tyler fired his pistol the two sounds in this confined space battered the ears even beth deeply unconscious gave an involuntary twitch kindle cried out and fell back in the hallway colonel tyler fell but soundlessly with tom kindles bullet lodged in his heart john sissy said as he fell it was the first time she had said his name the first time since he was a child tyler looked at her as the life went out of him in a powerful sigh it was as if he had been holding his breath for fiftytwo years and his breath was his life and now he just opened his mouth and let it go john she said her voice grown faint now you can come to live with me again its over matt thought the words seemed to circle in his head it had been vile and ugly and there was still beths terrible wound demanding his attention and kindle in the hallway but tyler was dead that impediment was gone its over he must have said the words aloud as he bent over tom kindle who had been shot in his bad leg and was bleeding from the calf matthew its not kindle said through gritted teeth matt wrapped the injury what do you mean are you blind its bright as day out there two am and bright as day and the sound jesus matthew are you deaf not deaf merely distracted he heard it now a faraway rumble it came through the air it came up through the bedrock it began to shake the house the artifact was leaving the earth chapter ascension from the doorway of bob ganishs motor home abby was able to see the connor housethe dark window where colonel tyler was holding matt hostageand beyond it on the horizon the disc of the new artifact glowing like a floodlight or a bright new moon paul jacopetti had taken a propranolol and was resting in the campers narrow bed ganish and chuck makepeace sat stiffly at the table in the kitchenette they had grumbled at this confinement but not too loudly it was tylers idea and they were tylers constituents they seemed to think their docility would win them some brownie points when this was all over we dont know for certain whats going on makepeace said it would be premature to pass judgment idiot abby thought she worried about matt and about miriam grown so strangely thin and about tom kindle hiding in the shadows with that hunting rifle of his but her eyes kept straying to the artifact she had grown so accustomed to that presence on the far prairie that she had forgotten what an astonishing thing it really was it was a spaceship she thought as round as a marble and as big as a mountain it was affixed to the earth like a tick on the skin of a dog it had fed on the earth filled itself with humanity and now sated it was apparently ready to leave it was almost too bright to look at abby shaded her eyes and stood at the door of the glendale waiting for a resolution for more gunfire or for matt to emerge from the house or colonel tyler or for the world to end with this peculiar blue light radiating across the prairie she guessed that was a possibility too you hear something bob ganish said the car salesman had cocked his head to listen chuck makepeace looked up sullenly from a game of solitaire no like a rumble ganish said like a truck going by you really dont hear it abby pressed her face against the cold window glass and felt another caress of the fear that had not left her for a day and a night i do she said i hear it the noise was faint but distinct like thunder like the artillery of a faraway war then it was as if the cannons had come suddenly much closer as if the caissons had rolled up behind the connor house where the grazing land began the glendale motor home began to yaw and pitch abby braced herself against the frame of the door jacopetti began shouting from the bed shouting a single word over and over the sense of it was lost in the roar she looked at him and tried to read his lips but he wasnt speaking to her he wasnt speaking to anyone in particular he was speaking to god abby thought his eyes were wild with panic the word was earthquake chuck makepeace fell to the floor and pulled the table down after him playing cards fluttered through the air like wounded birds bob ganish gazed around himself in mute startlement then slumped into a crude duckandcover with his hands clasped behind his neck he had stocked this camper with every conceivable necessity and the floor was suddenly awash with canned goods bottled water spare propane tanks and plastic jugs of gasoline somehow abby managed to stay upright she saw the artifact begin to rise the horizon had obscured its lower circumference but now a gap began to widen there the spaceship rose with a gentle impossible buoyancy at its base a dome of hot volcanic gases exploded after it and the cannonfire became a deeper more frightening growl and the floor dropped under abby and rose and dropped again until she lost her footing and fell home had driven its roots deep into the lithosphere its central artery its umbilical connection to the earth was a vent that reached below the basaltic crust to the fluid magma homes departure fractured the substrate beneath it into floating chonoliths like so many loose teeth and exposed a reservoir of liquid rock to the cold night air the mantle shook with protest a tectonic shockwave radiated outward from its epicenter in northern colorado and was followed immediately by a second shock and a third the hole in the earth vented a cloud of luminous gas a phenomenon geologists called a nute ardente the cloud emerged at enormous speed and pressure it carried volcanic ejecta at high velocity peppering the retreating home with rock fragments it unfolded around the newly opened crater and set fire to the prairie in an expanding ring miles in diameter home rose at the crown of this maelstrom and accelerated toward the high atmosphere toward the stars from an altitude the caldera on the land below resembled a flower a stamen of boiling lava petals of gray smoke touched at their tips with flame home rose silently beyond a thin waft of cloud rose brightly and silently in the thinning air its motive force was silent it transformed its few gigawatts of waste energy into a bluewhite wash of photons in the space inside it deserts shimmered in virtual sunlight alpine meadows bloomed at the approach of a virtual spring new oceans lapped at the shores of new continents below in the darkness a blister of ash and fire expanded over the cold colorado tableland the first shock knocked matt to the floor beside tom kindle he guessed it was an earthquake it felt as if the connor house had grown legs and begun to take long bounding leaps across the prairie maddeningly there was nothing to hang on to he was as helpless as a mouse in a rolling barrel after what seemed like an endless pummeling he managed to grab a doorjamb and brace himself firmly enough to raise his head and look around the air was full of dust the quake seemed to raise dust from every surface above the roar he could hear the joists twist in the ceiling he wondered how long the house would last tom kindle writhed on the floor with one hand clutching his bad leg matt pulled himself into the room where colonel tyler had died the shaking seemed progressively less intense though it had not entirely stopped he looked for beth the colonels body and joeys had been thrown into a ghastly embrace tylers limp arm draped over joeys shoulder and his hand pawing at joeys ruined head beth was approximately where he had left her but no longer sitting up against the foot of the recliner she had slid back to the floor and her breathingshe was still breathingsounded tentative and very wet the floor bucked again and matt braced himself until it steadied he heard what must be the sound of the connors front porch collapsing a series of dry woody explosions the window popped out of its frame and shattered on the ground outside the house when the trembling eased matt pulled himself up to the empty sill and took a hurried look outside he couldnt see the artifactthe window faced the wrong directionbut he knew it must be rising it was still radiating that vivid bluewhite light casting sundial shadows from the rvs and the prairie scrub but now the shadows were growing shorter and inclining to the west the door of the glendale opened and abby stood in it looking bruised and bewildered she raised a hand to shield her eyes against the light matt heard someone crying out from inside the vehiclejacopetti he thought he wanted to tell abby to stay away from the house it wasnt structurally safe the walls were inclining and it was a miracle only the porch had collapsed the urgent thing was to get beth outside get kindle outside before the next shock or aftershock but he couldnt speak or wave or make any coherent gesture before abby opened her mouth in an o of dismay and clutched at the door of the motor home matt supposedmuch laterthat there must have been a sinkhole under the rv some old hollow in the bedrock that had been opened by the violence of the quake all he knew as it happened was that the big glendale tilted leftward and the camper in front of itmarts campertilted right one tumbled frontward into a sudden depression that might have been five or ten feet deep the other tumbled back the two vehicles collided made the shape of a flattened v and the glendale began to slide sideways abby fell back into the dark interior jacopettis strained shouting ceased abruptly the exposed engine of the glendale ground against a torn flank of marts camper and sparks fountained into the night air christ no matt whispered the motor home was on fire as soon as that terrible possibility entered his mind events were outrunning him the fire didnt spread it was much quicker than that there was no fireand then the fire was everywhere the side door of the glendale rolled up to an impossibly steep angle matt vaulted through the window and ran across the connors dry garden to the burning vehicles both were on fire now a propane tank popped and matt heard shrapnel scream past his ear the subsidence wasnt deep he scrambled down toward the glendale just as flames licked up the undercarriage forcing him back he called abbys name she didnt answer he ran to the rear of the glendale there were no flames herenot yetbut the paint was peeling off the aluminum and when he tried to climb up to the window the skin of his hands sizzled on the metal he dropped to the ground and crawled away until the heat from the burning vehicles was no longer painful the artifact shrunken by altitude dropped away beyond the western horizon its light faded it left behind the light of the burning campers and a more baleful light from the caldera far away a column of smoke impossibly wide fanshaped where it had risen into the dark sky the prairie was still undulating matt thought long lowfrequency waves like the swell of the ocean on a gentle night or maybe it was his imagination there might be stronger aftershocks he thought about beth still work to do time lurched forward in a drunkards walk somehow he dragged beth away from the connor house somehow he went back for tom kindle who had pulled himself most of the way to the door before passing out he remembered miriam the old woman had been too sick to be sequestered with the others her small camper was still intact matt hurried to the door and forced it open but miriam wasnt insideonly a relic of miriam only her empty skin in that interval the sun had risen the southern horizon was a bank of roiling gray smoke larger than the artifact had been the sky was grayer by the minute and a gray ash had begun to fall like snow beth continued to breathe but each breath was a miracle each breath was a victory against great odds somehow he lifted beth and tom kindle into the coach of an undamaged camper somehow he began the longest journey of his life chapter eye of god it was cold in the shadow of the volcanic cloud the sun was a tenuous brightness in a dark sky pewter or brass on a field of featureless gray matt drove with the campers high beams on he drove toward cheyenne on the place where the artifact had been anchored to the earth was sometimes visible on his rightnot the caldera itself but the glow of distant fires of lava flows a second brightness not sunlight periodically the road shook under his vehicle the road was difficult to follow ash fell from the sky in a continuous sheeting rain it collected on the tarmac and drifted across the highway in charcoal dunes at times the road seemed to disappear altogether he navigated by the vague shapes of retaining walls by road signs and mile markers transformed into gray cenotaphs the campers wheels spun in the drifts grinding for purchase on the buried blacktop progress was slow and painful he passed through laramie a landscape of hopeless ruins at noonhe supposed it was noonhe stopped at a gas station that had lost its windows but was otherwise reasonably intact he fought through a drift of ash his shirt tied over his mouth and nose the volcanic ash was a finetextured grit that smelled a little like rotten eggs he stepped through the space where a window had been and in the meager shelter of the depot he located a road map of colorado and wyoming the camper could have used some gas but the pumps were dead matt shivered in the cold across the highway a charred frame building smoldered all else was ash a concealing darkness a smudged snowfall time to check on kindle time to check on beth he had left them in the coach bandaged and wrapped in blankets against the cold all his medical supplies carefully hoarded had been destroyed in the fire but he had treated both patients with the antibiotics in his bag kindle was occasionally conscious beth was not her breathing was terribly desperately faint her pulse was rapid and weak she was bleeding internally and she was in shock he checked her bandage decided it didnt need changing there was so little he could do keep her warm keep one shoulder up so her good lung wouldnt fill with blood so she wouldnt drown in blood he worked by the light of a coleman battery lantern the daylight that penetrated the ashcaked windows was powerless and bleak he turned to kindle next kindle opened his eyes as matt examined the leg wound the injury didnt appear serious but the bullet might have taken a chip from the fibulaand this was the leg kindle had broken last fall it would need to be immobilized until he could make a more thorough evaluation he looked up from his work and found kindle staring at him jesus matthewyour hands his hands he held them up to the light ahhis burns he had burned his hands trying to get abby out of the glendale the palms were red blistered peelingweeping in places he took a strip of clean linen and tore it in half wrapped a piece around each hand must hurt like hell kindle said we have painkillers matt said enough to go around you been driving since last night mmhm taking painkillers and you can drive like that painkillers and amphetamines speed he nodded you carry amphetamines in that black bag found them in joeys trailer matt said you crazy fucker no wonder you look like shit kindle moaned and moved a little under his blanket beth alive yes where are we a few miles out of cheyenne kindle turned his head to the window is it dark out day is that snow ash ash kindle said marvelling at it but kindle was right he had gone without sleep for too long when he looked at the map all the names seemed obscurely threatening thunder basin poison spider creek little medicine creek we have very little medicine at all matt thought progress was maddeningly slow the ash continued to fall hard to believe the earth could have yielded so much ash the refuse of such an enormous burning volcanic ash was rich in phosphorous and trace elements he had read that somewhere the rangeland would be fertilized for years to come he wondered what might grow here next year the year after the speedometer hovered around ten miles per hour he was overtaken by a thought as the afternoon lengthened beth might die he had hesitated at the brink of this idea for hours he was afraid of it if he allowed the thought into his head if he spoke the words even to himselfwould it affect the outcome if he named death would he summon it but in the end it was unavoidable a contingency that demanded his attention beth might die she might die even if he found a source of whole blood even if he found a functional hospital and those things seemed increasingly unlikely he should be ready for it after all he had chosen to live in this world a world where people not only might die but inevitably unanimously would die the mortal world he remembered contact the memory came back easily in this desolate twilight he could have chosen that other world the world of mortality indefinitely postponed the world of an immense knowledge the greater world they had called it the world of no murder no fatal fires no aging no evil there was a poem celeste had loved land of hearts desire he couldnt remember who wrote it some sentimental victorian matt gripped the steering wheel with bloody hands and the memory of her reading it aloud took on a sudden tangibility as if she were sitting beside him i would mould a world of fire and dew with no one bitter grave or over wise and nothing marred or old to do you wrong he guessed that was what they had built out on this prairie their curious round mountain their world of fire and dew where beauty has no ebb decay no flood but joy is wisdom time an endless song it was tempting matt thought it was the ancient human longing a desire written in the genes it was every dream anyone ever hated to wake up from but it was bloodless not joyless nor sexless the contactees had preserved their pleasures what they had given up was something more subtle it had taken matt most of his life to learn to live in a world where everything he loved was liable to vanishand he had never loved that vanishing but he had learned to endure in spite of it he had made a contract with it you dont stint your love even if the people you love grow old or grow apart you save a life when you can even though everyone dies there was nothing to be gained by holding back seize the day there is no other reward but the price matt thought dear god the price all our grief all our pain pain inflicted by an indifferent universe the cruelties of age and the cruelties of disease or pain inflicted as often as not by ourselves grief dropped from the open bays of bombers grief inflicted by scared or sullen young men coaxed into military uniform grief delivered by knife in dark alleys or by electrode in the basements of government offices grief parceled out by the genuinely evil the casually evil or such walking moral vacuums as colonel john tyler so maybe they were right matt thought the travellers and rachel and the majority of human souls maybe we are irredeemable maybe the greater world was better for its bloodlessness its exemption from the wheel of birth and death maybe he had made the wrong decision maybe he came into cheyenne at what he calculated was nightfall the streets were all but impassable in this darkness it was too easy to lose the road he turned off onto what he guessed was th street and faced the necessity of stopping for the night but then as he was ready to switch off the engine he peered up at the sky and saw by some unanticipated miracle the stars a wind had come up from the north it was a cold wind brisk enough to stir these ashes into more dangerous deeper drifts but the ash itself had ceased falling there was a little light blue shadows on a gray landscape he took his hands off the steering wheel an experiment it didnt hurt he was beyond hurting but he left some skin behind much of the city had burned he passed ashshrouded rubble strange columns of brick like broken teeth the shells of empty buildings two hospitals were marked on the map de paul hospital a smoking ruin and the v a medical center not far away it hadnt burnedbut the earthquake had shaken it to the ground he checked on beth and kindle once more kindle drifted up from sleep and nodded at him kindle was okay beth on the other hand was not dead but he couldnt say why her pulse was impossibly tenuous she wasnt getting much oxygen her lips were faintly blue her pupils were slow to dilate when he lifted her eyelids still she continued to breathe there was something aweinspiring about each breath for beth each breath had become a challenge a kind of everest and it seemed to matt that she met the challenge bravely and with a fierce resolve but no single breath would meet the needs of her oxygenstarved body and each breath must be followed by the next a new mountain to scale she wasnt dead but she was plainly dying what city might have an intact medical center he looked at the map his eyes seemed reluctant to focus somewhere beyond the range of the ashfall but what was beyond the range of the ashfall denver no he would have to travel too close to the caldera itself the journey might be impossible and would surely be too long north to casper he wasnt sure what he might find in casper it was still a long distance away everything was too far away she might not last another hour two hours would surprise him sleep kindle said i know how it is matthew but you wont gain anything by killing yourself get some sleep there isnt time youve been looking at that map for a quarter hour looking for what someplace to go someplace with a hospital not finding it i bet and you cant drive in this he had pulled himself to a sitting position looks like armageddon out there matt folded the map meticulously and put it aside beth is badly hurt i can see that i can hear how she breathes i dont have what i need to help her matthew i know gently im not telling you to give up just we cant work a miracle and it does no good to beat yourself for it look at you youre a mess lucky you can walk it was true that they couldnt reach a hospital he might as well admit it but something pushed forward in his mind an idea he had not wanted to entertain theres another possibility he said he explained to kindle and listened to kindles objections for a while but grew impatient and fearful for beth and hurried back to the cab of the vehicle and turned it around he glimpsed the new artifact as it finished a quick eastward transit of the sky but the sky was closing in again most of the stars had disappeared and it was not ash that began to fall but a brutally cold rain the ash on the ground absorbed the water and became a slick intransigent mud he was forced to drive even more slowly and even so the rear end of the camper fishtailed now and then on what seemed like a river of liquid clay but he didnt have far to go he found the state capital building or what was left of it at the end of a broad avenue lined with ashcoated trees and fallen limbs threequarters of the dome had collapsed one section of it like an immense splinter remained in place lit from below by fires still burning in the shell beneath the broad space in front of the building was a field of ash and the rain had given it a wet sheen and the firelight was reflected there matt wasnt certain he would find what he wanted but the capital buildings were the centerpiece of the city like buchanans city hall the most logical place therefore to find a helper he parked and climbed out of the cab there was blood on the steering wheel blood on his pants he struggled for footing on the slick compressed ash beneath his feet the rain on his skin was not only cold it was dirty it carried soot out of the air it turned his skin black matt realized he had left his jacket in the coach with kindle he went to fetch it beths breathing was barely audible dont do this kindle said matt shrugged into his jacket kindle sat up and took his arm matthew most likely it wont work and thats bad enough but if it doeshave you thought about that yes thats not a hospital out there thats not a doctor its something from outer space something we never did understand and that thing in orbit isnt humanity how could it be and what youre doing its not asking for help its praying shell die matt said christ dont i know shell die havent i been listening to her die but shes dying like a human being isnt that what we decided to do last august when it comes down to it what we said was no thanks ill die like a human being you meeven colonel tyler even beth thats not the issue the hell it isnt matthew listen the travellers left they went away best thing that could happen and that new artifact probably itll go away too go starchasing or whatever it is they do and thats fine because well be left here with some human dignity but if you go out and pray to that thing for helpmy fear is that it will help and it wont stop helping and well have a new god in the sky and thatll be the end of us one way or another im only one man matt said maybe one is all it takes maybe they can look at a thousand things at oncemaybe everything matters i have to help her it was the only answer he could formulate why because sometimes we help each other its the only decent thing we do he turned to the door matthew he looked back dont let that thing come near me i dont care how badly off i am i dont want it near me promise me that he nodded the helper was at the foot of the stairs of the wyoming state capitol building scabs of wet ash clung to it in the frigid rain matt reached up and brushed away these impediments he was a little feverish and immensely weary it was strange to be standing here at the foot of this alien structure in the ash in the rain with the domeless capitol building burning fitfully in the dark he shivered the shiver became a convulsion and he bent at the waist until it passed and hoped he wouldnt faint rain settled on the helper in thick dark drops this helper seemed to matt less tall less perfectly formed than the one at the city hall turnaround he wondered whether it might have begun to erode perhaps it would eventually sink into the earth a shapeless mound discarded it didnt develop eyes it didnt look at him it remained impassive he told it about beth he described her wounds some part of him listened to the sound of his own voice and marveled at the melancholy note it added to the rainfall and the wind he felt like an intern on rounds reciting a patients symptoms for a hostile resident was this necessary it seemed to be he said i know what you can do i saw that woman that insect woman if you can change a human being from the inside out you must be able to heal a chest wound and cindy rhee the little girl with the brain tumor she was cured the helper remained impassive was it dead deaf or simply not listening answer me matt said talk to me now the cold seemed to claw inside his body he knew he couldnt stand out in this night rain much longer he put his hands on the body of the helper the helper was as cold as the air he left bloody prints on the alien matter it didnt speak he carried beth from the camper he knew this bordered on the insane taking a dying woman into the cold night but he seemed to be out of options there was no reasoning only a slow panic beth was heavy he held her with one hand supporting her shoulder and the other under her knees she was a small woman but he was terribly tired he staggered under her weight her head lolled back and her breathing stopped he waited for it to resume breathe he thought she gasped a bubble of blood formed on her lips he told her how sorry he was that all this had happened she didnt deserve it she wasnt bad it was one of those unforeseeable tragedies like an earthquake like a fire he put her down in front of the alien sentinel she was pale and limp in the wet gray ash rain fell on her matt put his jacket over her he pulled away one limp strand of hair that had fallen across her face then he addressed the helper here she is he said fix her was this too peremptory but he didnt know another way to say it from that black obelisk nothing i know you can fix her you have no excuse an infinitely long time seemed to pass a gusty wind turned the rain to needles on his skin the wind made a sound in the ruins of the capitol building it sounded like whispering the helper was connected to the artifact he supposed and the artifact was full of humanityor something that had once been humanity are you all in there several billion human souls can you hear me nothing he was lightheaded he leaned against the helper to steady himself the helper was cold substantial inanimate everybody in there he was hoarse with all this talking jim bix in there lillian annie are you in there rachel silence and the sound of the spattering rain you have no excuse you can help this girl rachel listen to me this isnt good at all just standing there letting this girl die we didnt raise you to do that he closed his eyes nothing had changed he felt himself sliding down felt himself sitting in the wet ash beside beth he couldnt hear beth anymore he wondered if she had stopped breathing there was a buzzing in his ears that drowned all other sound if you were human he said you would help he fought to cling to his awareness but the sense was eroding from his words there was nothing left inside him but a weary frustration if you were human but you arent i suppose we dont matter anymore this girl doesnt matter this dying girl that offends me fuck you fuck all of you he wanted to open his eyes but couldnt time passed he roused for a moment rachel come out of there he felt the stony body of it cradling his head rachel asleep he dreamed that she did come out he dreamed that the helper changed that its contours melted that it became the shape of his daughter rachel as if carved from black ice black against a gray sky rain on the polished skin of her like dew he dreamed that she touched beth touched matt himself and the touch was warm he dreamed that she said a word to him some wonderful comforting word he could not understand because the language she spoke was not a human language chapter direction as soon as he thought it would be safe to leave matt for a few hours tom kindle located a functioning automobilea honda that had been buried under ash but washed moreorless clean by the rainand drove north to casper his leg nagged him relentlessly the bullet wound was a knob of fire in the meat of his calf but it had been a clean wound and matt had bandaged it well and kindle found he was able to move around all right if he favored the leg he wondered how he looked with a limp like a lopsided old son of a bitch he supposed which was approximately true a wave of cool dry canadian air had chased the rain away he drove an empty road north beyond the limits of the ashfall he marveled at how good it was to see some green grass again wildflowers were blooming in the gullies he saw a number of dead animals along the way the departure of the human artifact had killed a lot of livestock did they know did they care the socalled heirs of mankind but kindle guessed it was no worse than a natural disastera unique event unlike the perpetual hardships human beings had imposed on the animal kingdom since the year zip the herd animals would come back quickly now that so many of the range fences were down in casper he picked up a ham radio he believed would operate from a twelvevolt car battery he wasnt sure how to hook it up but it came with instructionshe could probably figure it out he could have used joeys help however as daylight faded kindle hunted for water water was a scarce commodity since the taps had ceased to work a supermarket its big windows shattered in the quake yielded a dozen plastic gallon jugs of distilled h he loaded them into a new car for the trip back a buick wagon with a nearly full tank of gas gas pumps didnt work any better than the plumbing but there was plenty of this old detroit rolling stock free for the taking night fell he drove with the buicks heater running with the smell of hot metal and a pinescent air freshener south toward that glow on the horizon the smoldering volcanic crater as if crossed a border into the western precincts of hell in cheyenne the next morning kindle assembled two wooden crosses from lumber stock and loose nails when the crosses were solid kindle used a nail to scratch a letter deep into the horizontal board of the first of the two markers it was awkward clumsy work but he persisted he wrote the letters a b b then he paused to think would she prefer abigail or abby or abbey or abbie come to that he had only ever known her as abby and in the end he inscribed the simplest version of her name abby cushman and on the second cross joseph commoner and he took the two crosses out and hammered them into the ashgray lawn in front of the ruins of the wyoming state capitol building next to the statue of esther hobart morris of course joey and abby werent buried here their bodies were lost but they deserved some memorial more dignified than the burnedout hulk of a glendale motor home as for jacopetti ganish makepeace colonel tylerlet em rot he went back to the camper and stood vigil over the inert forms of matthew wheeler and beth porter matthew seemed to be asleep his hands appeared to be gloved they were encased in a glossy substance the color of bituminous coal matthew kindle said matthew can you hear me but the doctor didnt answeras he had not answered yesterday or the day before beth was covered from the waist up in the same inert black material kindle didnt speak to her why bother her head was all enclosed her nose her mouth he built a fire and watched the smoke rise up into the blue twilight probably no one would recognize the signature of a campfire in cheyenne much of the city was still smoldering but he would have to be careful out on the rangelands where it would be easy to spot a mans fire at night there might be other people who hadnt chosen the option of ohio there might be more like colonel tyler matt was awake in the morning the black substance had left his hands kindle wondered where it had gone had it been absorbed by the body had it evaporated into the air thirsty matt said kindle brought him some water the skin on the doctors hands was pink and new i dreamed about beth matt said i dreamed they fixed her maybe they did kindle said matt helped him build the evenings fire they brewed coffee and sat huddled at the flickering warmth i thought maybe you had gone over kindle said maybe youd end up an empty skin like everybody else matt shook his head no that wasnt the decision he had made kindle allowed the silence to grow to its natural length the stars had come out tonight all these bright wyoming stars he said i talked to ohio hooked up a radio he nodded their helpers are working again i gather they werent for a while everything went down when the traveller artifact left power went down the travellers had been running all the turbines and so forth keeping electricity on line i guess all over the countryall over the world now its back on but only in ohio the man says a certain perimeter around that encampment and a few similar places on other continents a perimeter not a fence but i gather if you stray too far youre on your own no power no water no guarantees its a safe place matt said eden kindle said can you think of a better name for it kind of a garden live there youre taken care of god looks after you for your natural span god makes the sun shine god makes the grass grow theyre not god matt said might as well be but only in ohio matt said maybe only as long as the artifact stays in orbit artifact might not leave guy in ohio says its not decided yet according to the helpers war in heaven an argument at least matt looked across the gray lawn of the capitol building at the local helper their helperthe pillar to which he had prayed if we talked to it it was alive for a while matthew but i think its not anymore i think if you want to talk to a helper you have to go to ohio matt nodded periodically he looked at his handshis new raw hands he said you think im responsible for this for keeping the artifact here kindle shrugged he had thought about this who knows were talking about the collective decision of ten billion soulsi dont think matthew wheeler tipped the pot but you walked into their debate i think made them look at what they left behind and maybe you werent the only one maybe the same scene got played out a thousand times different places on the earth people saying if you want to be god show a little compassion or if youre still human some human compassion you blame me no but you dont like it no kindle sipped his coffee it was hot and bitter no i do not beth woke up groggy the next morninggroggy but well there was only a pucker of healthy skin where the bullet had entered her chest she asked about joey and colonel tyler matt explained not gently because there was no gentle way to say this what had happened she listened carefully but didnt speak much after that she sat at the evening fire hugging herself and drinking coffee the talk flowed around her silence like a river around a stone periodically her hand strayed to her right shoulder and touched her jacket above the place where her tattoo had beenwhere it remained matt corrected himself the helper had not taken it away he supposed some wounds were easier to heal than others she slept that night curled around herself on a mattress on the floor of the camper in the morning they began the journey east across the border from wyoming into nebraska tom kindle said he would ride along for a while but only a while nebraska was a halfandhalf statearid in the west wetter in the agricultural east interstate joined the platte river east of the kingsley dam and the platte fed a valley of rich alluvial soil where acre upon acre of corn beets potatoes and beans had grown wild and high in an empty springtime matt drove most of the time tom kindles leg was still bothering him it tended to cramp after a time behind the wheel so matt drove through these empty agricultural towns pretty little towns made ragged by a hard windy winter brady gothenburg lexington kearny sometimes kindle rode in the cab beside him mostly it was beth out of kindles earshot beth talked a little more about what had happenedand what might happen theyre still inside us she said thewhat are they called neocytes he nodded theyll be with us for a long time he nodded again she said you know about this too yes same as me i mean nobody told you you just know it right right theyre inside us but dormant not doing anything until you can say it matt told her there was a potent magic in saying things out loud until we die beth said and then theyll give us another chance to say yes to go with them he nodded like heaven she said a little like and not just us everybody in that town on the river that town in ohio everybody in eden matt thought they did some night driving it was kindle who pointed out the line of division that had appeared on the orbiting artifact a dark equator on that bright circle its dividing said kindle who had been talking on the radio again thats what ohio tells me itll be two artifacts not one one to go roving among the stars one to stay here like a custodian matt said or a local god he gave matt a long look you dont seem surprised he admitted im not you knew about it yes how he shrugged kindle turned away he watched the road pass he said youre not what you used to be not entirely god damn kindle said it was not a particular lament it wasnt aimed at matt it was just a sad curse to rattle away in the chilly night air god damn epilogue as wise as they were the travellers had come to the earth with their own assumptions and for their own reasons they were benevolent but clumsy giants and the human polis alone in orbit began to tinker with certain changes the travellers had made in the oceans the population of traveller phytoplankton dropped to a fraction of its earlier numbers the work continuedthere was still much excess c to be bound into the seabut it neednt be done in a season and it neednt inject so much violent energy into the atmosphere nor was it necessary to maintain power and water in every city on the earth that had been the travellers fumbling reaction to the phenomenon of human obstinacy the puzzling willingness of so many people to accept their own mortality the human polis fashioned better and more compact alternatives in ohio in ukraine in hunan and kenya and a dozen other places and outside those boundaries was simply the wild earth for those who wanted it home divided itself into two entities one to journey outward into an awakening galaxy one to cherish its own past its birthplace and its parent species after a harsh and stormy winter the spring of the year was mildoceans calm skies blue kindle stopped at the iowa border and refused to go any farther he was away from camp for a day and when he came back he was riding a gaunt saddle horse that had survived the winter but was not entirely wild over the course of a dry season kindle said most of the gas might evaporate from all these abandoned automobiles or the hoses rot or the oil thicken or the pistons seizeor some damn thing a good riding horse was a better bet over the long run you going west matt asked kindle said he was wind river whiskey mountain somewhere through there kindle said beth watching the two men shake hands thought there was something similar in the way they looked at each other something more than friendship more than sadness each one seemed to look at the other and see what he might have beenwhat he could have been or maybe should have beenbut would never be two roads parted here and they would not run together again both men seemed to know it kindle rode off down the ragged highway in the hot part of the afternoon matt stood a long time watching she was with him that night when the artifact passed overhead it was almost two things now a massive figure eight on the verge of separation two parts of humanity she warmed her hands at a fire that seemed lonely without tom kindle she hadnt wanted him to go but things change whether you want them to or not things change she said needing to communicate the thought but daunted by the lonely sound the words made on this vacant plain wasnt that what everyone was afraid of things change the past drifts off until its irrecoverable and strange and the future is a mystery and nothing stands still not for us not for those people in the sky nothing is solid not even trees or mountains or planets or stars look long enough and they all boil away boil away she had seen it as long ago as contact she had seen it in her minds eye its a dance she said you cant cling to what you love because its all a dance love and friendship and men and molecules all dancing in a brief light she looked helplessly at matt did he understand but he seemed to she thought perhaps he had known it all along she looked east where the stars were rising in a dark sky its been getting greener as we go beth said and warmer these nights werent as cold as they had been matt said maybe itll be a gentle summer gentler in ohio greener warmer i think so matt said i would like that beth said wanting to cry for no particular reason i think that would be good
