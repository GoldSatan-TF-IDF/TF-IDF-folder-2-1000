steven saylor the house of the vestals death wears a mask eco i said do you mean to tell me that you have never seen a play he looked up at me with his big brown eyes and shook his head never laughed at the bumbling slaves who have a fallingout never swooned to see the young heroine abducted by pirates never thrilled at the discovery that our hero is the secret heir to a vast fortune ecos eyes grew even larger and he shook his head more vigorously then there must be a remedy this very day i said it was the ides of september and a more beautiful autumn day the gods had never fashioned the sun shone warmly on the narrow streets and gurgling fountains of rome a light breeze swept up from the tiber cooling the seven hills the sky above was a bowl of purest azure without a single cloud it was the twelfth day of the sixteen days set aside each year for the roman festival the citys oldest public holiday perhaps jupiter himself had decreed that the weather should be so perfect the holiday was in his honor for eco the festival had been an endless orgy of discoveries he had seen his first chariot race in the circus maximus had watched wrestlers and boxers in the public squares had eaten his first calfsbrainandalmond sausage from a street vendor the race had thrilled him mostly because he thought the horses so beautiful the pugilists had bored him since he had seen plenty of brawlingin public before the sausage had not agreed with him or perhaps his problem was the spiced green apples on which he gorged himself afterward it was four months since i had rescued eco in an alley in the subura from a gang of boys pursuing him with sticks and cruel jeers i knew a little of his history having met him briefly in my investigations for cicero that spring apparently his widowed mother had chosen to abandon little eco in her desperation leaving him to fend for himself what else could i do but take him home with me he struck me as exceedingly clever for a boy often i knew he was ten because whenever he was asked he held up ten fingers eco could hear and add perfectly well even if his tongue was useless at first his muteness was a great handicap for us both he had not been born mute but had been made that way apparently by the same fever that claimed his fathers life eco is a skillful mime to be sure but gestures can convey only so much someone had taught him the letters but he could read and write only the simplest words i had begun to teach him myself but the going was made harder by his speechlessness his practical knowledge of the streets of rome was deep but narrow he knew all the back entrances to all the shops in the subura and where the fish and meat vendors down by the tiber left their scraps at the end of the day but he had never been to the forum or the circus maximus had never heard a politician declaim lucky boy or witnessed the spectacle of the theater i spent many hours showing him the city that summer rediscovering its marvels through the wide eyes of a tenyearold boy so it was that on the twelfth day of the roman festival when a crier came running through the streets announcing that the company of quintus roscius would be performing in an hour i determined that we should not miss it ah the company of roscius the comedian i said the magistrates in charge of the festival have spared no expense there is no more famous actor today than quintus roscius and no more renowned troupe of performers than his we made our way from the subura down to the forum where holiday crowds thronged the open squares between the temple of jupiter and the senian baths a makeshift theater had been erected rows of benches were set before a wooden stage that had been raised in the narrow space between the brick walls some day i remarked a rabblerousing politician will build the first permanent theater in rome imagine that a proper grecianstyle theater made of stone as sturdy as a temple the oldfashioned moralists will be scandalizedthey hate the theater because it comes from greece and they think that all things greek must be decadent and dangerous ah were earlywe shall have good seats the usher led us to an aisle seat on a bench five rows back from the stage the first four rows had been partitioned by a rope of purple cloth set aside for those of senatorial rank occasionally the usher tromped down the aisle followed by some togaclad magistrate and his party and pulled aside the rope to allow them access to the benches while the theater slowly filled around us i pointed out to eco the details of the stage before the first row of benches there was a small open space the orchestra where the musicians would play three steps at either side led up to the stage itself behind the stage and enclosing it on either side was a screen of wood with a folding door in the middle and other doors set into the left and right wings through these doors the actors would enter and exit out of sight behind the stage the musicians could be heard warming up their pipes trilling snatches of familiar tunes gordianus i turned to see a tall thin figure looming over us statilius i cried its good to see you and you as well but who is this he ruffled ecos mop of brown hair with his long fingers this is eco i said a longlost nephew not exactly ah an indiscretion from the past statilius raised an eyebrow not that either my face turned hot and yet i suddenly wondered how it would feel to say yes this is my son not for the first time i considered the possibility of adopting eco legally and as quickly banished the thought from my mind a man like myself who often risks death has no business becoming a father so i told myself if i truly wanted sons i could have married a proper roman wife long ago and had a houseful by now i quickly changed the subject but statilius where is your costume and your mask why arent you backstage getting ready i had known statilius since we were boys he had become an actor in his youth joining first one company and then another always seeking the training of established comedians the great roscius had taken him on a year before oh i still have plenty of time to get ready and how is life in the company of the greatest actor in rome wonderful of course i frowned at the note of false bravado in his voice ah gordianus you always could see through me not wonderful thenterrible rosciuswhat a monster brilliant to be sure but a beast if i were a slave id be covered with bruises instead he whips me with his tongue what a taskmaster the man is relentless and never satisfied he makes a man feel no better than a worm the galleys or the mines could hardly be worse is it my fault that ive grown too old to play heroines and havent yet the proper voice to be an old miser or a braggart soldier ah perhaps roscius is right im uselesstalentlessi bring the whole company into disrepute actors are all alike i whispered to eco they need more coddling than babies then to statilius nonsense i saw you in the spring at the festival of the great mother when roscius put on the brothers menaechmus you were brilliant playing the twins do you really think so i swear it i laughed so hard i almost fell off the bench he brightened a bit then frowned i wish that roscius thought so today i was all set to play euclio the old miser ah then were seeing the pot of gold yes one of my favorite plays eco quite possibly plautuss funniest comedy crude yet satisfying i was to play euclio statilius said rather sharply drawing the conversation back to himself when suddenly this morning roscius explodes into a rage and says that i have the role all wrong and that he cant suffer the humiliation of seeing me bungle it in front of all rome instead ill be megadorus the nextdoor neighbor another fine role i said trying to remember it fah and who gets the plum role of euclio that parasite panurgusa mere slave with no more comic timing than a slug he abruptly stiffened oh no whats this i followed his gaze to the outer aisle where the usher was leading a burly bearded man toward the front of the theater a blond giant with a scar across his nose followed close behind the bearded mans bodyguard i know a hired ruffian from the subura when i see one the usher led them to the far end of our bench they stepped into the gap and headed toward us to take the empty spot beside eco statilius bent low to hide himself and groaned into my ear as if i hadnt enough worriesits that awful moneylender flavius and one of his hired bullies the only man in rome whos more of a monster than roscius and just how much do you owe this flavius i began to say when suddenly from backstage a roaring voice rose above the discordant pipes fool incompetent dont come to me now saying you cant remember the lines roscius statilius whispered screaming at panurgus i hope the mans temper is terrible the central door on the stage flew open revealing a short stocky man already dressed for the stage wearing a splendid cloak of rich white fabric his lumpy scowling face was the sort to send terror into an underlings soul yet this was by universal acclaim the funniest man in rome his legendary squint made his eyes almost invisible but when he looked in our direction i felt as if a dagger had been thrown past my ear and into the heart of statilius and you he bellowed where have you been backstage immediately no dont bother to go the long way round backstage now he gave commands as if he were speaking to a dog statilius hurried up the aisle leaped onto the stage and disappeared backstage closing the door behind himbut not i noticed before casting a furtive glance at the newcomer who had just seated himself beside eco i turned and looked at flavius the moneylender who returned my curious gaze with a scowl he did not look like a man in the proper mood for a comedy i cleared my throat today youll see the pot of gold i said pleasantly leaning past eco toward the newcomers flavius gave a start and wrinkled his bushy brows one of plautuss very best plays dont you think flavius parted his lips and peered at me suspiciously the blond bodyguard looked at me with an expression of supreme stupidity i shrugged and turned my attention elsewhere from the open square behind us the crier made his last announcement the benches filled rapidly latecomers and slaves stood wherever they could crowding together on tiptoe two musicians stepped onto the stage and descended to the orchestra where they began to blow upon their long pipes a murmur of recognition passed through the crowd at the familiar strains of the miser euclios theme the first indication of the play we were about to see meanwhile the usher and the crier moved up and down the aisles playfully hushing the noisier members of the audience at length the overture was finished the central door on the stage rattled open out stepped roscius wearing his sumptuous white cloak his head obscured by a mask of grotesque happy countenance through the holes i glimpsed his squinting eyes his mellow voice resonated throughout the theater in case you dont know who i am let me briefly introduce myself he said i am the guardian spirit of this house euclios house i have been in charge of this place now for a great many years he proceeded to deliver the prologue giving the audience a starting point for the familiar storyhow the grandfather of euclio had hidden a pot of gold beneath the floorboards of the house how euclio had a daughter who was in love with the nextdoor neighbors nephew and needed only a dowry to be happily married and how he the guardian spirit intended to guide the greedy euclio to the pot of gold and so set events in motion i glanced at eco who stared up at the masked figure enraptured hanging on every word beside him the moneylender flavius wore the same unhappy scowl as before the blond bodyguard sat with his mouth open and occasionally reached up to pick at the scar across his nose a muffled commotion was heard from backstage ah said roscius in a theatrical whisper theres old euclio now pitching a fit as usual the greedy miser must have located the pot of gold by now and he wants to count his fortune in secret so hes turning the old housekeeper out of the house he quietly withdrew through the door in the right wing through the central door emerged a figure wearing an old mans mask and dressed in bright yellow the traditional color for greed this was panurgus the slaveactor taking the plum leading role of the miser euclio behind him he dragged another actor dressed as a lowly female slave and flung him to the middle of the stage get out he shouted out by hades out with you you old snooping bag of bones statilius had been wrong to disparage panurguss comic gifts already i heard guffaws and laughter around me what have i done what what cried the other actor his grimacing feminine mask was surmounted by a hideous tangled wig his gown was in tatters about his knobby knees why are you beating a longsuffering old hag to give you something to be longsuffering about thats why and to make you suffer as much as i do just looking at you panurgus and his fellow actor scurried about the stage to the uproarious amusement of the audience eco bounced up and down on the bench and clapped his hands the moneylender and his bodyguard sat with their arms crossed unimpressed but why must you drive me out of the house euclio why since when do i have to give you a reason youre asking for a fresh crop of bruises housekeeper let the gods send me jumping off a cliff if ill put up with this sort of slavery any longer euclio whats she muttering to herself ive a good mind to poke your eyes out you damned witch at length the slave woman disappeared and the miser went back into his house to count his money the neighbor megadorus and his sister eunomia occupied the stage from the voice it seemed to me that the sister was played by the same actor who had performed the cringing slave woman no doubt he specialized in female characters my friend statilius as megadorus performed adequately i thought but he was not in the same class with roscius or even with his rival panurgus his comic turns inspired polite guffaws not raucous laughter eunomia dear brother ive asked you out of the house to have a little talk about your private affairs megadorus how sweet you are as thoughtful as you are beautiful i kiss your hand eunomia what are you talking to someone behind me megadorus of course not youre the prettiest woman i know eunomia dont be absurd every woman is uglier than every otherin one way or another megadorus mmm but of course whatever you say eunomia now give me your attention brother dear i should like to see you married megadorus help murder ruin eunomiaoh quiet down even this exchange usually so pleasing to the crowd evoked only lukewarm titters my attention strayed to statiliuss costume made of sumptuous blue wool embroidered with yellow and to his mask with its absurdly quizzical eyebrows alas i thought it is a bad sign when a comedians costume is of greater interest than his delivery poor statilius had found a place with the most respected acting troupe in rome but he did not shine there no wonder the demanding roscius was so intolerant of him even eco grew restless next to him the moneylender flavius leaned over to whisper something in the ear of his blond bodyguarddisparaging the talents of the actor who owed him money i thought at length the sister exited the miser returned to converse with his neighbor seeing the two of them together on the stagestatilius and his rival panurgusthe gulf between their talents was painfully clear panurgus as euclio stole the scene completely and not just because his lines were better euclio so you wish to marry my daughter good enoughbut you must know i havent so much as a copper to donate to her dowry megadorus i dont expect even half a copper her virtue and good name are quite enough euclio i mean to say its not as if id just happened to have found some oh buried treasure in my house say a pot of gold buried by my grandfather or megadorus of course not how ridiculous say no moreyoull give your daughter to me then euclioagreed but whats that oh no im ruined megadorus jupiter almighty whats wrong euclio i thought i heard a spade someone digging megadorus why its only a slave ive got digging up some roots in my garden calm down good neighbor i inwardly groaned for my friend statilius but if his delivery was flat he had learned to follow the masters stage directions without a misstep roscius was famous not only for embellishing the old comedies with colorful costumes and masks to delight the eyes but for choreographing the movements of his actors statilius and panurgus were never static on the stage like the actors in inferior companies they circled one another in a constant comic dance a swirl of blue and yellow eco tugged at my sleeve with a shrug of his shoulder he gestured to the men beside him flavius was again whispering in the bodyguards ear the big blond was wrinkling his eyebrows perplexed then he rose and lumbered toward the aisle eco drew up his feet but i was too slow the monster stepped on my foot i let out a howl others around me started doing the same thinking i was badgering the actors the blond giant made no apology at all eco tugged at my sleeve let it go eco i said one must learn to live with rudeness in the theater he only rolled his eyes and crossed his arms in exasperation i knew that gesture if only he could speak on the stage the two neighbors concluded their plans for megadorus to wed the daughter of euclio with a shrilling of pipes and the tinkling of cymbals they left the stage and the first act was done the pipe players introduced a new theme after a moment two new characters appeared on stage these were the quarreling cooks summoned to prepare the wedding feast a roman audience delights in jokes about food and gluttony the cruder the better while i groaned at the awful puns eco laughed aloud making a hoarse barking sound in the midst of the gaiety my blood turned cold above the laughter i heard a scream it was not a womans scream but a mans not a scream of fear but of pain i looked at eco who looked back at me he had heard it too no one else in the audience seemed to have noticed but the actors on stage must have heard something they bungled their lines and turned uncertainly toward the door stepping on one anothers feet the audience only laughed harder at their clumsiness the quarreling cooks came to the end of their scene and disappeared backstage the stage was empty there was a pause that grew longer and longer strange unaccountable noises came from backstagemuffled gasps confused shuffling a loud shout the audience began to murmur and shift restlessly on the benches at last the door from the left wing opened onto the stage stepped a figure wearing the mask of the miser euclio he was dressed in bright yellow as before but it was a different cloak he threw his hands in the air disaster he cried i felt a cold shiver down my spine disaster he said again a daughters marriage is a disaster how can any man afford it ive just come back from the market and you wouldnt believe what theyre charging for lamban arm and a leg for an arm and a leg thats what they want the character was miserly euclio but the actor was no longer panurgus it was roscius behind the mask the audience seemed not to notice the substitution or at least not to mind it they started laughing almost immediately at the spectacle of poor euclio befuddled by his own stinginess roscius delivered the lines flawlessly with the practiced comic timing that comes from having played a role many times but i thought i heard a strange quavering in his voice when he turned so that i could glimpse his eyes within the mask i saw no sign of his famous squint his eyes were wide with alarm was this roscius the actor frightened of something very realor euclio afraid that the squabbling cooks would find his treasure whats that shouting from the kitchen he cried oh no theyre calling for a bigger pot to put the chicken in oh my pot of gold he ran through the door backstage almost tripping over his yellow cloak there followed a cacophony of crashing pots the central door was thrown open one of the cooks emerged onstage crying out in a panic help help help it was the voice of statilius i stiffened and started to stand but the words were only part of the play its a madhouse in there he cried straightening his mask he jumped from the stage and ran into the audience the miser euclios gone mad hes beating us over the head with pots and pans citizens come to our rescue he whirled about the central aisle until he came to a halt beside me he bent low and spoke through his teeth so that only i could hear gordianus come backstage now i gave a start through the mask i looked into statiliuss anxious eyes backstage he hissed come quick a daggerblood panurgusmurder from beyond the maze of screens and awnings and platforms i occasionally heard the playing of the pipes and actors voices raised in argument followed by the muffled roar of the audience laughing backstage the company of quintus roscius ran about in a panic changing costumes fitting masks onto one anothers heads mumbling lines beneath their breath sniping at each other or exchanging words of encouragement and in every other way trying to act as if this were simply another hectic performance and a corpse was not lying in their midst the body was that of the slave panurgus he lay on his back in a secluded little alcove in the alley that ran behind the temple of jupiter the place was a public privy one of many built in outoftheway nooks on the perimeter of the forum screened by two walls a sloping floor tilted to a hole that emptied into the cloaca maxima panurgus had apparently come here to relieve himself between scenes now he lay dead with a knife plunged squarely into his chest above his heart a large red circle stained his bright yellow costume a sluggish stream of blood trickled across the tiles and ran down the drain he was older than i had thought almost as old as his master with gray in his hair and a wrinkled forehead his mouth and eyes were open wide in shock his eyes were green and in death they glittered dully like uncut emeralds eco gazed down at the body and reached up to grasp my hand statilius ran up beside us he was dressed again in blue and held the mask of megadorus in his hands his face was ashen madness he whispered bloody madness shouldnt the play be stopped roscius refuses not for a slave he says and he doesnt dare tell the crowd imagine a murder backstage in the middle of our performance on a holiday consecrated to jupiter himself in the very shadow of the gods templewhat an omen what magistrate would ever hire roscius and the company again no the show goes oneven though we must somehow figure out how to fill nine roles with five actors instead of six oh dear and ive never learned the nephews lines statilius it was roscius returning from the stage he threw off the mask of euclio his own face was almost as grotesque contorted with fury what do you think youre doing standing there mumbling if im playing euclio you have to play the nephew he rubbed his squinting eyes then slapped his forehead but no thats impossiblemegadorus and the nephew must be onstage at the same time what a disaster jupiter why me the actors circled one another like frenzied bees the dressers hovered about them uncertainly as useless as drones all was chaos in the company of quintus roscius i looked down at the bloodless face of panurgus who was beyond caring all men become the same in death whether slave or citizen roman or greek genius or pretender at last the play was over the old bachelor megadorus had escaped the clutches of marriage miserly euclio had lost and then recovered his pot of gold the honest slave who restored it to him had been set free the quarreling cooks had been paid by megadorus and sent on their way and the young lovers had been joyously betrothed how this was accomplished under the circumstances i do not know by some miracle of the theater everything came off without a hitch the cast assembled together on the stage to roaring applause and then returned backstage their exhilaration at once replaced by the grim reality of the death among them madness statilius said again hovering over the corpse knowing how he felt about his rival i had to wonder if he was not secretly gloating he seemed genuinely shocked but that after all could have been acting and who is this barked roscius tearing off the yellow cloak he had assumed to play the miser my name is gordianus men call me the finder roscius raised an eyebrow and nodded ah yes ive heard of you last springthe case of sextus roscius no relation to myself im glad to say or very distant anyway you earned yourself a name with parties on both sides of that affair knowing the actor was an intimate of the dictator sulla whom i had grossly offended i only nodded so what are you doing here roscius demanded it was i who told him said statilius helplessly i asked him to come backstage it was the first thing i thought of you invited an outsider to intrude on this tragedy statilius fool whats to keep him from standing in the forum and announcing the news to everyone who passes the scandal will be disastrous i assure you i can be quite discreetfor a client i said oh i see said roscius squinting at me shrewdly but perhaps thats not a bad idea provided you could actually be of some help i think i might i said modestly already calculating a fee roscius was after all the most highly paid actor in the world rumor claimed he made as much as half a million sesterces in a single year he could afford to be generous he looked down at the corpse and shook his head bitterly one of my most promising pupils not just a gifted artist but a valuable piece of property but why should anyone murder the slave panurgus had no vices no politics no enemies its a rare man who has no enemies i said i could not help but glance at statilius who hurriedly looked away there was a commotion among the gathered actors and stagehands the crowd parted to admit a tall cadaverous figure with a shock of red hair chaerea where have you been growled roscius the newcomer looked down his long nose first at the corpse then at roscius drove down from my villa at fidenae he snapped tersely axle on the chariot broke missed more than the play it appears gaius fannius chaerea whispered statilius in my ear he was panurguss original owner when he saw the slave had comic gifts he handed him over to roscius to train him as partowner they dont seem friendly i whispered back theyve been feuding over how to calculate the profits from panurguss performances so quintus roscius sniffed chaerea tilting his nose even higher this is how you take care of our common property bad management i say slaves worthless now ill send you a bill for my share what you think im responsible for this roscius squinted fiercely slave was in your care now hes dead theater people so irresponsible chaerea ran his bony fingers through his orange mane and shrugged haughtily before turning his back expect my bill tomorrow he said stepping through the crowd to join a coterie of attendants waiting in the alley or ill see you in court outrageous said roscius you he pointed a stubby finger at me this is your job find out who did this and why if it was a slave or a pauper ill have him torn apart if it was a rich man ill sue him blind for destroying my property ill go to hades before i give chaerea the satisfaction of saying this was my fault i accepted the job with a grave nod and tried not to smile i could almost feel the rain of glittering stiver on my headthen i glimpsed the contorted face of the dead panurgus and felt the full gravity of my commission for a dead slave in rome there is seldom any attempt to find justice i would find the killer i silently vowed not for roscius and his silver but to honor the shade of an artist cruelly cut down in his prime very well roscius ill need to ask some questions see that no one in the company leaves until im done id like to talk with you in private first perhaps a cup of wine would calm us both late that afternoon i sat on a bench beneath the shade of an olive tree on a quiet street not far from the temple of jupiter eco sat beside me pensively studying the play of leafy shadows on the paving stones so eco what do you think have we learned anything at all of value he shook his head gravely you judge too quickly i laughed consider we last saw panurgus alive during his scene with statilius at the close of the first act then those two left the stage the pipers played an interlude and next the quarreling cooks came on then there was a scream that must have been panurgus when he was stabbed it caused a commotion backstage roscius checked into the matter and discovered the body in the privy word quickly spread among the others roscius put on the dead mans mask and a yellow cloak the closest thing he had to match panurguss costume which was ruined by blood and rushed onstage to keep the play going statilius meanwhile put on a cooks costume so that he could jump into the audience and plead for my help therefore we know at least one thing the actors playing the cooks were innocent as were the pipe players because they were onstage when the murder occurred eco made a face to show he was not impressed yes i admit this is all very elementary but to build a wall we must begin with a single brick now who was backstage at the time of the murder has no one to account for his whereabouts at the moment of the scream and might have wanted panurgus dead eco bounded up from the bench ready to play the game he performed a pantomime jabbering with his jaw and waving his arms at himself i smiled sadly the unflattering portrait could only be my talkative and selfabsorbed friend statilius yes statilius must be foremost among the suspects though i regret to say it we know he had cause to hate panurgus so long as the slave was alive a man of inferior talent like statilius would never be given the best roles we also learned from questioning the company that when the scream was heard no one could account for statiliuss whereabouts this may be only a coincidence given the ordinary chaos that seems to reign backstage during a performance statilius himself vows that he was busy in a corner adjusting his costume in his favor he seems to have been truly shocked at the slaves deathbut he might only be pretending i call the man my friend but do i really know him i pondered for a moment who else eco he hunched his shoulders scowled and squinted yes roscius was also backstage when panurgus screamed and no one seems to remember seeing him at that instant it was he who found the corpseor was he there when the knife descended roscius is a violent man all his actors say so we heard him shouting angrily at someone before the play begando you remember fool incompetent why cant you remember your lines others told me it was panurgus he was shouting at did the slaves performance in the first act displease him so much that he flew into a rage lost his head and murdered him it hardly seems likely i thought panurgus was doing quite well and roscius like statilius seemed genuinely offended by the murder but then roscius is an actor of great skill eco put his hands on his hips and his nose in the air and began to strut haughtily ah chaerea i was coming to him he claims not to have arrived until after the play was over and yet he hardly seemed taken aback when he saw the corpse he seems almost too unflappable he was the slaves original owner in return for cultivating panurguss talents roscius acquired halfownership but chaerea seems to have been thoroughly dissatisfied with the arrangement did he decide that the slave was worth more to him dead than alive chaerea holds roscius culpable for the loss and intends to coerce roscius into paying him half the slaves worth in silver in a roman court with the right advocate chaerea will likely prevail i leaned back against the olive tree dissatisfied still i wish we had uncovered someone else in the company with as strong a motive and the opportunity to have done the deed yet no one seems to have borne a grudge against panurgus and almost everyone could account for his whereabouts when the victim screamed of course the murderer may be someone from outside the company the privy where panurgus was stabbed was accessible to anyone passing through the alley behind the temple yet roscius tells us and the others confirm that panurgus had almost no dealings with anyone outside the troupehe didnt gamble or frequent brothels he borrowed neither money nor other mens wives his craft alone consumed him so everyone says even if panurgus had offended someone the aggrieved party would surely have taken up the matter not with panurgus but with roscius since he was the slaves owner and the man legally responsible for any misdeeds i sighed with frustration the knife left in his heart was a common dagger with no distinguishing features no footprints surrounded the body no telltale blood was found on any of the costumes there were no witnesses or none we know of alas the shower of silver in my imagination dried to a trickle with nothing to show i would be lucky to press roscius into paying me a days fee for my trouble even worse i felt the shade of dead panurgus watching me i had vowed i would find his killer and it seemed the vow was rashly made that night i took my dinner in the ramshackle garden at the center of my house the lamps burned low tiny silver moths flitted among the columns of the peristyle sounds of distant revelry occasionally wafted up from the streets of the subura at the foot of the hill bethesda the meal was exquisite i said lying with my usual grace perhaps i could have been an actor i thought but bethesda was not fooled she looked at me from beneath her long lashes and smiled with half her mouth she combed one hand through the great unbound mass of her glossy black hair and shrugged an elegant shrug then began to clear the table as she departed to the kitchen i watched the sinuous play of her hips within her loose green gown when i bought her long ago at the slave market in alexandria it had not been for her cooking her cooking had never improved but in many other ways she was beyond perfection i peered into the blackness of the long tresses that cascaded to her waist i imagined the silver moths lost in those tresses like twinkling stars in the blueblack firmament of the sky before eco had come into my life bethesda and i had spent almost every night together just the two of us in the solitude of the garden i was startled from my reverie by a hand pulling at the hem of my tunic yes eco what is it eco reclining on the couch next to mine put his fists together and pulled them apart up and down as if unrolling a scroll ah your reading lesson we had no time for it today did we but my eyes are weary eco and yours must be too and there are other matters on my mind he frowned at me in mock dejection until i relented very well bring that lamp nearer what would you like to read tonight eco pointed at himself and shook his head then pointed at me he cupped his hands behind his ears and closed his eyes he preferred it and secretly so did i when i did the reading and he could enjoy the luxury of merely listening all that summer on lazy afternoons and long summer nights the two of us had spent many such hours in the garden while i read pisos history of hannibal eco would sit at my feet and watch elephants among the clouds while i declaimed the tale of the sabine women he would lie on his back and study the moon of late i had been reading to him from an old tattered scroll of plato a castoff gift from cicero eco understood greek though he knew none of the letters and he followed the subtleties of the philosophers discourses with fascination though occasionally in his big brown eyes i saw a glimmer of sorrow that he could never hope to engage in such debates himself shall i read more plato then they say philosophy after dinner aids digestion eco nodded and ran to fetch the scroll he emerged from the shadows of the peristyle a moment later gripping it carefully in his hands suddenly he stopped and stood statuelike with a strange expression on his face eco what is it i thought for a moment that he was ill bethesdas fish dumplings and turnips in cumin sauce had been undistinguished but hardly so bad as to make him sick he stared straight ahead at nothing and did not hear me eco are you all right he stood rigid trembling a look which might have been fear or ecstasy crossed his face then he sprang toward me pressed the scroll under my nose and pointed at it frantically ive never known a boy to be so mad for learning i laughed but he was not playing a game his expression was deadly serious but eco its only the same volume of plato that ive been reading to you off and on all summer why are you suddenly so excited eco stood back to perform his pantomime a dagger thrust into his heart could only indicate the dead panurgus panurgus and platoeco i see no connection eco bit his lip and scrambled about desperate to express himself at last he ran into the house and back out again clutching two objects he dropped them onto my lap eco be careful this little vase is made of precious green glass and came all the way from alexandria and why have you brought me a bit of red tile this must have fallen from the roof eco pointed emphatically at each object in turn but i could not see what he meant he disappeared again and came back with my wax tablet and stylus upon which he wrote the words for red and green yes eco i can see that the vase is green and the tile is red blood is red eco shook his head and pointed to his eyes panurgus had green eyes i saw them in my memory staring lifeless at the sky eco stamped his foot and shook his head to let me know that i was badly off course he took the vase and the bit of tile from my lap and began to juggle them from hand to hand eco stop that i told you the vase is precious he put them carelessly down and reached for the stylus again he rubbed out the words red and green and in their place wrote blue it seemed he wished to write another word but could not think of how to spell it he nibbled on the stylus and shook his head eco i think you must have a fever you make no sense at all he took the scroll from my lap and began to unroll it scanning it hopelessly even if the text had been in latin it would have been a tortuous job for him to decipher the words and find whatever he was searching for but the letters were greek and utterly foreign to him he threw down the scroll and began to pantomime again but he was excited and clumsy i could make no sense of his wild gesturing i shrugged and shook my head in exasperation and eco suddenly began to weep with frustration he seized the scroll again and pointed to his eyes did he mean that i should read the scroll or did he point to his tears i bit my lip and turned up my palms unable to help him eco threw the scroll in my lap and ran crying from the room a hoarse stifled braying issued from his throat not the sound of normal weeping it tore my heart to hear it i should have been more patient but how was i to understand him bethesda emerged from the kitchen and gazed at me accusingly then followed the sound of ecos weeping to the little room where he slept i looked down at the scroll in my lap there were so many words on the parchment which ones had keyed an idea in ecos memory and what could they have to do with dead panurgus red green bluei vaguely remembered reading a passage in which plato discoursed on the nature of light and color but i could scarcely remember it not having understood much of it in the first place some scheme about overlapping cones projected from the eyes to an object or from the object to the eyes i couldnt remember which was this what eco recalled and could it have made any sense to him i rolled through the scroll looking for the reference but was unable to find it my eyes grew weary the lamp began to sputter the greek letters all began to look alike normally bethesda would have come to put me to bed but it seemed she had chosen to comfort eco instead i fell asleep on my dining couch beneath the stars thinking of a yellow cloak stained with red and of lifeless green eyes gazing at an empty blue sky eco was ill the next day or feigned illness bethesda solemnly informed me that he did not wish to leave his bed i stood in the doorway of his little room and spoke to him gently reminding him that the roman festival continued and that today there would be a wild beast show in the circus maximus and another play put on by another company he turned his back to me and pulled the coverlet over his head i suppose i should punish him i whispered to myself trying to think of what a normal roman father would do i suppose you should not whispered bethesda as she passed me her haughtiness left me properly humbled i took my morning stroll alonefor the first time in many days i realized acutely aware that eco was not beside me the subura seemed a rather dull place without tenyearold eyes through which to see it i had only my own eyes to serve me and they had seen it a million times before i would buy him a gift i decided i would buy them each a gift for it was always a good idea to placate bethesda when she was haughty for eco i bought a red leather ball such as boys use to play trigon knocking it back and forth to each other using their elbows and knees for bethesda i wanted to find a veil woven of blue midnight shot through with silver moths but i decided to settle for one made of linen on the street of the cloth merchants i found the shop of my old acquaintance ruso i asked to see a veil of dark blue as if by magic he produced the very veil i had been imagining a gossamer thing that seemed to be made of blueblack spiderwebs and silver it was also most expensive item in the shop i chided him for taunting me with a luxury beyond my means ruso shrugged goodnaturedly one never knows might have just been playing dice and won a fortune by casting the venus throw here these are more affordable he smiled and laid a selection before me no i said seeing nothing i liked ive changed my mind then something in a lighter blue perhaps a bright blue like the sky no i think not ah but see what i have to show you first felix felix fetch me one of the new veils that just arrived from alexandria the bright blue ones with yellow stitching the young slave bit his lip nervously and seemed to cringe this struck me as odd for i knew ruso to be a temperate man and not a cruel master go on thenwhat are you waiting for ruso turned to me and shook his head this new slaveworse than useless i dont think hes very smart no matter what the slave merchant said he keeps the books well enough but here in the shop look hes done it again unbelievable felix what is wrong with you do you do this just to spite me do you want a beating i wont put up with this any longer i tell you the slave shrank back looking confused and helpless in his hand he held a yellow veil all the time he does this wailed ruso clutching his head he wants to drive me mad i ask for blue and he brings me yellow i ask for yellow and he brings me blue have you ever heard of such stupidity i shall beat you felix i swear it he ran after the poor slave brandishing a measuring rod and then i understood my friend statilius as i had expected was not at his lodgings in the subura when i questioned his landlord the old man gave me the sly look of a confederate charged with throwing hounds off the scent and told me that statilius had left rome for the countryside he was in none of the usual places where he might have been on a festival day no tavern had served him and no brothel had admitted him he would not even think of appearing in a gambling house i told myselfand then knew that the exact opposite must be true once i began to search the gaming places in the subura i found him easily enough in a crowded apartment on the third floor of an old tenement i discovered him in the midst of a crowd of welldressed men some of them even wearing their togas statilius was down on his elbows and knees shaking a tiny box and muttering prayers to fortune he cast the dice the crowd contracted in a tight circle and then drew back exclaiming the throw was a good one iii iii iii and vithe remus throw yes yes statilius cried and held out his palms the others handed over their coins i grabbed him by the collar of his tunic and pulled him squawking into the hall i should think youre deeply enough in debt already i said quite the contrary he protested smiling broadly his face was flushed and his forehead beaded with sweat like a man with a fever just how much do you owe flavius the moneylender a hundred thousand sesterces a hundred thousand my heart leaped into my throat but not any longer you see ill be able to pay him of now he held up the coins in his hands i have two bags full of silver in the other room where my slaves looking after them andcan you believe ita deed to a house on the caelian hill ive won my way out of it dont you see at the expense of another mans life his grin became sheepish so youve figured that out but who could have foreseen such a tragedy certainly not i and when it happened i didnt rejoice in panurguss deathyou saw that i didnt hate him not really my jealousy was purely professional but if the fates decided better him than me who am i to argue youre a worm statilius why didnt you tell roscius what you knew why didnt you tell me what did i know really someone completely unknown might have killed poor panurgus i didnt witness the event but you guessed the truth all the same thats why you wanted me backstage wasnt it you were afraid the assassin would come back for you what was i your bodyguard perhaps after all he didnt come back did he statilius youre a worm you said that already the smile dropped from his face like a discarded mask he jerked his collar from my grasp you hid the truth from me i said but why from roscius what tell him i had run up an obscene gambling debt and had a notorious moneylender threatening to kill me perhaps hed have loaned you the money to pay off the debt never you dont know roscius he thinks im lucky just to be in his troupe believe me hes not the type to hand out loans to an underling in the amount of a hundred thousand sesterces and if he knew panurgus had mistakenly been murdered instead of meoh roscius would have been furious one panurgus is worth ten statilii thats his view i would have been a dead man then with flavius on one side of me and roscius on the other the two of them would have torn me apart like a chicken bone he stepped back and straightened his tunic the smile flickered and returned to his lips youre not going to tell anyone are you statilius do you ever stop acting i averted my eyes to avoid his charm well roscius is my client not you but im your friend gordianus i made a promise to panurgus panurgus didnt hear you the gods did finding the moneylender flavius was a simpler mattera few questions in the right ear a few coins in the right hands i learned that he ran his business from a wine shop in a portico near the circus flaminius where he sold inferior vintages imported from his native tarquinu but on a festival day my informants told me i would be more likely to find him at the house of questionable repute across the street the place had a low ceiling and the musty smell of spilled wine and crowded humanity across the room i saw flavius holding court with a group of his peersbusinessmen of middle age with crude country manners dressed in expensive tunics and cloaks of a quality that contrasted sharply with their wearers crudeness closer at hand leaning against a wall and looking strong enough to hold it up was the moneylenders bully the blond giant was looking rather drunk or else exceptionally stupid he slowly blinked when i approached a glimmer of recognition lit his bleary eyes and then faded festival days are good drinking days i said raising my cup of wine he looked at me without expression for a moment then shrugged and nodded tell me i said do you know any of those spectacular beauties i gestured to a group of four women who loitered at the far corner of the room near the foot of the stairs the giant shook his head glumly then you are a lucky man this day i leaned close enough to smell the wine on his breath i was just talking to one of them she tells me that she longs to meet you it seems she has an appetite for men with sunny hair and big shoulders she tells me that for a man such as you i whispered in his ear the veil of lust across his face made him look even stupider he squinted drunkenly which one he asked in a husky whisper the one in the blue gown i said ah he nodded and burped then pushed past me and stumbled toward the stairs as i had expected he ignored the woman in green as well as the woman in coral and the one in brown instead he placed his hand squarely upon the hip of the woman in yellow who turned and looked up at him with a surprised but not unfriendly gaze quintus roscius and his partner chaerea were both duly impressed by my cleverness i explained later that night to bethesda i was unable to resist the theatrical gesture of swinging the little bag of silver up in the air and onto the table where it landed with a jingling thump not a pot of gold perhaps but a fat enough fee to keep us all happy through the winter her eyes became as round and glittering as little coins they grew even larger when i produced the veil from rusos shop oh but what is it made of midnight and moths i said spiderwebs and silver she tilted her head back and spread the translucent veil over her naked throat and arms i blinked and swallowed hard and decided that the purchase was well worth the price eco stood uncertainly in the doorway of his little room where he had watched me enter and had listened to my hurried tale of the days events he seemed to have recovered from his distemper of the morning but his face was somber i held out my hand and he cautiously approached he took the red leather ball readily enough but he still did not smile only a small gift i know but i have a greater one for you still i dont understand protested bethesda youve said the blond giant was stupid but how can anyone be so stupid as to not be able to tell one color from another eco knows i said smiling ruefully down at him he figured it out last night and tried to tell me but he didnt know how he remembered a passage from plato that i read to him months ago i had forgotten all about it here i think i can find it now i reached for the scroll which still lay upon my sleeping couch one may observe i read aloud that not all men perceive the same colors although they are rare there are those who confuse the colors red and green and likewise those who cannot tell yellow from blue still others appear to have no perception of the various shades of green he goes on to offer an explanation of this but i cannot follow it then the bodyguard could not tell blue from yellow said bethesda even so the moneylender came to the theater yesterday intending to make good on his threat to murder statilius no wonder flavius gave a start when i leaned over and said today youll see the pot of goldfor a moment he thought i was talking about the debt statilius owed him he sat in the audience long enough to see that statilius was playing megadorus dressed in blue no doubt he could recognize him by his voice then he sent the blond assassin backstage knowing the alley behind the temple of jupiter would be virtually deserted there to lie in wait for the actor in the blue cloak eco must have overheard snatches of his instructions if only the word blue he sensed that something was amiss even then and tried to tell me at the time but there was too much confusion with the giant stepping on my toes and the audience howling around us am i right eco nodded and slapped a fist against his palm exactly right unfortunately for poor panurgus in his yellow cloak the colorblind assassin was also uncommonly stupid he needed more information than the color blue to make sure he murdered the right man but he didnt bother to ask for it or if he did flavius would only have sneered at him and rushed him along unable to understand his confusion catching panurgus alone and vulnerable in his yellow cloak which might as well have been blue the assassin did his joband bungled it knowing flavius was in the audience and out to kill him learning that panurgus had been stabbed and seeing that the hired assassin was no longer in the audience statilius guessed the truth no wonder he was so shaken by panurguss death knowing that he was the intended victim so another slave is murdered and by accident and nothing will be done bethesda said moodily not exactly panurgus was valuable property the law allows his owners to sue the man responsible for his death for his full market value i understand that roscius and chaerea are is each demanding one hundred thousand sesterces from flavius if flavius contests the action and loses the amount will be doubled knowing his greed i suspect hell tacitly admit his guilt and settle for the smaller figure small justice for a meaningless murder i nodded and small recompense for the destruction of so much talent but such is the only justice that roman law allows when a citizen kills a slave a heavy silence descended on the garden his insight vindicated eco turned his attention to the leather ball he tossed it in the air caught it and nodded thoughtfully pleased at the way it fit his hand ah but eco as i was saying there is another gift for you he looked at me expectantly its here i patted the sack of silver no longer shall i teach you in my own stumbling way how to read and write you shall have a proper tutor who will come every morning to teach you both latin and greek he will be stern and you will suffer but when he is done you will read and write better than i do a boy as clever as you deserves no less ecos smile was radiant i have never seen a boy toss a ball so high the story is almost done except for one final outcome much later that night i lay in bed with bethesda with nothing to separate us but that gossamer veil shot through with silver threads for a few fleeting moments i was completely satisfied with life and the universe in my relaxation without meaning to i mumbled aloud what i was thinking perhaps i should adopt the boy and why not bethesda demanded imperious even when half asleep what more proof do you want from him eco could not be more like your son even if he were made of your own flesh and blood and of course she was right the tale of the treasure house tell me a story bethesda it was the hottest night of the hottest summer i could ever remember in rome i had pulled my sleeping couch out into the peristyle amid the yew trees and poppies so as to catch any breeze that might happen to pass over the esquiline hill overhead the sky was moonless and full of stars still sleep would not come bethesda lay on her own divan nearby we might have lain together but it was simply too hot to press flesh against flesh she sighed an hour ago you asked me to sing you a song master an hour before that you asked me to wash your feet with a wet cloth yes and the song was sweet and the cloth was cool but i still cant sleep neither can you so tell me a story she touched the back of her hand to her lips and yawned her black hair glistened in the starlight her linen sleeping gown clung like gossamer to the supple lines of her body even yawning she was beautifulfar too beautiful a slave to be owned by a common man like myself ive often thought fortune smiled on me when i found her in that alexandrian slave market ten years ago was it i who selected bethesda or she who selected me why dont you tell a story bethesda suggested you love to talk about your work now youre wanting me to put you to sleep you always find it boring when i talk about my work not true she protested sleepily tell me again how you helped cicero in resolving the matter of the woman of arretium everyone down at the market still talks about it how gordianus the finder must be the cleverest man in rome to have found the solution to such a sordid affair what a schemer you are bethesda thinking you can flatter me into being your storyteller you are my slave and i order you to tell me a story she ignored me or tell me again about the case of sextus roscius she said before that great cicero had never defended a man charged with murder much less a man accused of killing his own father how he needed the help of gordianus the finder to think it would end with you killing a giant who came out of the cloaca maxima while cicero was giving his speech in the forum i would hate to have you for my biographer bethesda the man was not exactly a giant it was not exactly i who killed him and while it happened in the public latrine behind the shrine of venus the giantthat is the mandid not come out of the sewer and it wasnt the end of the affair either we lay for a long moment in the darkness listening to the chirring of the crickets a shooting star passed overhead causing bethesda to mutter a low incantation to one of her strange egyptian animalgods tell me about egypt i said you never talk about alexandria its such a great city so old so mysterious ha you romans think anything is old if it came before your empire alexander and his city were not even a dream in the mind of osiris when cheops built his great pyramid memphis and thebes were already ancient when the greeks went to war with troy over a woman i commented which shows that they were not completely stupid of course they were idiots to think that helen was hiding in troy when she was actually down in memphis with king proteus the whole time what i never heard such a thing everyone in egypt knows the story but that would mean that the destruction of troy was meaningless and since it was the trojan warrior aeneas who fled troy and founded the roman race then the destiny of rome is based on a cruel joke of the gods i suggest you keep this particular story to yourself bethesda and not go spreading it around the market too late for that even in the darkness i could see the wicked smile on her lips we lay in silence for some moments a gentle breeze stirred amid the roses bethesda finally said you know men such as you are not the only ones who can solve mysteries and answer riddles you mean the gods can do so as well no i mean that women can is that a fact yes thinking about helen in egypt reminded me of the story of king rhampsinitus and his treasure house and how it was a women who solved the mystery of the disappearing silver but i suppose you must already know that story master since it is so very famous king rhampsiwhat i asked bethesda snorted delicately she finds it difficult sometimes living in a place as culturally backward as rome i smiled up at the stars and closed my eyes bethesda i order you to tell me the tale of king rhampsiwhatever and his treasure house very well master king rhampsinitus came after king proteus who played host to helen and before king cheops who built the great pyramid cheops must have been a very great king an awful king the most hated man in all the long history of egypt but why precisely because he built the great pyramid what does a pyramid mean to common people except unending labor and terrible taxes the memory of cheops is despised in egypt egyptians spit when they say his name only visitors from rome and greece look at his pyramid and see something wonderful an egyptian looks at the pyramid and says look theres the stone that broke my greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfathers back or theres the ornamental pylon that bankrupted my greatgreatgreatgreatgranduncles farm no king rhampsinitus was much more to the peoples liking and what was this rhampsinitus like very rich no king in any kingdom since has been even half so rich not even midas not even him king rhampsinitus had great wealth in precious stones and gold but his greatest treasure was his silver he owned plates of silver and goblets of silver silver coins and mirrors and bracelets and whole bricks made of pure solid shining silver there was so much of it that he decided to built a treasure house just for his silver so the king hired a man to design and build this treasure house in a courtyard outside his bedchamber incorporating it into the wall that surrounded his palace the project took several years to complete as the wall was hollowed out and the massive stones were cut and polished and hoisted into place the architect was a man of strong mind but frail health and though he was only of middle age he barely lived long enough to see his design completed on the very day that the great silver hoard was moved piece by piece into the chamber and the great doors were closed and sealed the architect died he left behind a widow and two sons who had just come into manhood king rhampsinitus called the sons before him and gave each of them a silver bracelet in token of his gratitude to their father a rather small gift i said perhaps they say that king rhampsinitus was prudent and evenhanded to a fault neither tightfisted nor overly generous he reminds me of cicero bethesda cleared her throat demanding silence once a month the king would have the seals broken away and would spend an afternoon in his treasure house admiring his silver wares and counting his silver coins months passed the nile flooded and receded as happens every summer and the crops were good the people were happy egypt was at peace but the king began to notice something quite disturbing pieces of silver were missing from his treasure house at first he thought he only imagined it since there was no way that the great doors could be opened without breaking the seals and the seals were broken only for his own official visits but when his servants tallied up the inventory of his silver sure enough there were a great number of coins missing and other small items as well the king was sorely puzzled on his next visit there was even more silver missing including a solid silver crocodile the size of a mans forearm which had been one of the kings most treasured pieces the king was furious and more baffled than ever then it occurred to him to set traps inside the treasure house so that anyone sorting through the coins and coffers might be caught and held fast in an iron cage and this he did sure enough on his next visit the king discovered that one of the traps had been sprung but inside the cage instead of a desperate pleading thief there was a dead body bethesda paused ominously but of course i murmured looking up sleepily at the stars the poor thief had starved or else been frightened to death when the cage landed on him perhaps but he had no head what i blinked his head was nowhere to be found how strange indeed bethesda nodded gravely and was more silver missing yes then there must have been another thief with him i deduced perhaps bethesda said shrewdly but king rhampsinitus was no closer to solving the mystery then it occurred to him that perhaps the hapless thief had relatives in memphis in which case they would want to have his body back so that they could purify it and send it on its journey to the afterlife naturally no one could be expected to come forward to claim the body so rhampsinitus decided to have the headless corpse put on display before the palace wall this was announced as a warning to the thieves of memphis but the true purpose was to capture anyone who might know the truth of the thiefs strange fate the kings two most trusted guardsbig bearded fellows the same ones who usually protected the seals at the treasure housewere assigned to stand watch over the corpse day and night and to seize any person who broke into weeping or lamentation the next morning as soon as he had risen king rhampsinitus hurried to the palace wall and looked over the edge for the mystery of the missing silver had come to dominate his thoughts whether sleeping or awake and what should he see but the two guards lying fast asleep each of them with half his face cleanshavenand the headless body gone rhampsinitus ordered that the guards be brought before him they stank of wine and their memories were muddled but they did remember that a merchant passed by just as the sun was going down pushing a cart full of wineskins one of the wineskins had sprung a leak the guards each seized a cup and caught some of the flowing wine thanking their good luck the merchant had been outragedfor no good reason since it was hardly the guards fault if the wineskin had broken they managed to calm the merchant with some peaceful words and he paused for a while by the palace wall explaining that he was weary and irritable from a long days work to make up for his rudeness he offered each guard a cupful of his very best wine after that neither of the guards could quite remember what happened or so they both maintained the next thing they knew it was dawn king rhampsinitus was screaming down at them from the palace wall their faces had been halfshaven and the headless body had vanished bethesda i interrupted giving a slight start at the sudden leap of a cricket amid the yew trees i do hope that this will not turn out to be one of those egyptian horror stories where dead bodies go walking about on their own she reached over and playfully danced her long nails over my naked arm giving me gooseflesh i batted her fingers away she leaned back and laughed a low throaty laugh after a moment she continued when it came to describing the wine merchant the guards were vague one said he was young the other said he was middleaged one said he had a beard the other insisted he had only stubble on his jaw the wine or whatever was in it must have befuddled their senses i said presuming they were telling the truth however that may be rhampsinitus had all the wine merchants in memphis rounded up and paraded before the guards and did the guards recognize the culprit among them they did not king rhampsinitus knew no more than he had before to make matters worse the two sleeping halfshaven guards had been seen by some of the merchants opening their shops that morning and word had quickly spread that the kings chosen guards had been made fools of rumors about the headless corpse and the pilfered treasure spread through the city and soon all memphis was gossiping behind the kings back king rhampsinitus was very displeased i should think so so displeased that he ordered that the guards should remain halfshaven for a month for all to see a mild punishment surely not in the old days in memphis to be seen halfshaven would have been as shameful as for a roman noble to be seen in the forum wearing sandals instead of shoes with his toga unthinkable but fortune is a blade with two edges as you romans say and in the end it was a good thing for the king that this gossip spread for it quickly reached the ears of a young courtesan who lived over a rug shop very near the palace gates her name was naia and she was already privy to whisperings about the mystery within the palace walls as not a few of her clientele were members of the royal entourage mulling over all she had heard about the affair and everything she knew about the treasure house and the manner in which it was built and guarded she believed she saw the solution to the mystery naia might have gone straight to the king and named the thieves but two things gave her pause first she had no real proof and second as ive already told you the king was not famous for generous rewards he might have merely thanked her and given her a silver bracelet and sent her on her way so when she went to rhampsinitus she said only that she had a plan for solving the mystery and that to implement this plan would cost her time and money if her scheme came to nothing she would pay her own losses a terrible idea i always demand expenses and a fee no matter whether i solve the mystery or not but if she was able to identify the thieves and explain how the silver had been stolen then rhampsinitus would have to pay her as much silver as her mule could carry and grant her a wish besides at first this struck the king as too steep a price but the more he thought about it the fairer it seemed after all more silver than a mule could carry had already vanished from his treasure house and would go on vanishing until the thieving was stopped and what sort of wish could a courtesan make that the king of all egypt could not grant with a mere wave of his hand besides it seemed unlikely that a young courtesan would be able to solve the mystery that had confounded the king and all his advisors he agreed to the bargain naia made a few inquiries it did not take long to discover the name of the man she suspected and where he lived she sent her servant to watch his movements and to alert her immediately when this man should next pass near her window a few days later the servant came running to her chamber out of breath and told her to look out the window a young man wearing new clothes and sandals was looking at some expensive rugs displayed outside the shop below naia took a seat in her window and sent her servant to give the man a message she accused him then and there i said of course not the servant told the young man that his mistress had noticed him from her window and perceived him to be a man of taste and means and wished to invite him up to her room when the young man looked up naia was posed in the window in such a way that very few men could have resisted the invitation this naia i said is beginning to remind me of a certain other egyptian woman i know bethesda ignored me the young man came straight to her room the servant brought cool wine and fresh fruit and then sat outside the door softly playing a flute naia and her guest talked for a while and soon it became evident that the young man desired her greatly but naia insisted that they play a game first relaxed by the heat of the day his tongue loosened by wine and desire the young man agreed this was the gamethat each of them should reveal to the other two secrets beginning with the young man what was the greatest crime of his life and what was his cleverest trick these questions gave the young man pause and a shadow of sadness crossed over his face followed by a laugh i can answer you easily enough he said but im not sure which is which my greatest crime was cutting off my brothers head my greatest trick was putting his head and body back together again or perhaps its the other way around he smiled ruefully and looked at naia with desiring eyes and you he whispered naia sighed like you she said im not sure which is which i think my greatest trick was discovering the thief who has been robbing king rhampsinituss treasure house and my greatest crime will be when i hand him over to the king or perhaps it will end up being the other way around the young man gave a start and came to his senses he rose and ran toward the window but a great iron cage like the one that had trapped his brother came down on him from the ceiling he could not escape naia sent her servant to fetch the kings guards and now she said while we wait perhaps you can explain to me what i dont already know about the plundering of the kings silver the young man was at first furious and then he began to weep realizing the fate that awaited him death was the sweetest punishment he could hope for more likely he would have his hands and feet chopped off and would live the rest of his life as a cripple and a beggar but you must know everything already he cried how did you find me out naia shrugged i thought for a while that the two guards might be in collusion and that the headless body was a third confederate whom they killed when he was captured so that he could not betray them but the guards knew of the traps and so could have avoided them and i doubt that any man in memphis would allow himself to appear halfshaven before the king even to disguise his own guilt besides everyone agrees that the treasure house doors cannot be opened without breaking the seals so there must have been some other way in how could that be unless the architect planned it and who could know of any secret entrance except the architects two sons its true the young man said my father showed it to before he dieda secret entrance opened by pressing on a single stone in the palace wall impossible to find unless you know the exact measurements two men or even one can open it with a simple push take whatever they can carry from the treasure house and then seal the door behind them so that no one could ever find it i told my older brother that we were taking too much and that the king would notice but our father had told us that the king sorely underpaid him for all his years of effort and that by his design we should always have a steady income but then your brother was caught in the iron cage said naia yes he could stick his head outside the bars but nothing more he begged me to cut off his head and take it with me otherwise someone in the palace would recognize him and all our family would be brought to ruin and you did as he demanded how terrible for you how brave but you were a good brother you reclaimed his body united it with the head and sent him on his way to the afterlife i might not have done so but my mother insisted i disguised myself and deceived the guards into drinking drugged wine in the darkness i cut down my brothers body and hid him among the wineskins in the cart before i carried him off i shaved the guards so that the king would not suspect them of conspiring with me naia looked out the window and here are those two guards now hurrying this way across the square please the young man begged thrusting his head outside the cage cut off my head let me share my brothers fate otherwise who knows what horrible punishments the king will inflict on me naia picked up a long blade and pretended to consider it no she said at last even as the guards footsteps were booming on the stairs i think we will let justice take its course so the young man was brought before king rhampsinitus along with naia who came to claim her reward the thiefs cache of silver was found hidden in his home and restored to the treasure house the secret entrance was sealed over and naia was allowed to load a mule with as much silver as the beast could carry as for the fate of the thief rhampsinitus announced that he would allow the dishonored guards to take their revenge on him first and in the morning he would decide on the punishment either beheading him or chopping off his hands and feet as he was leaving the audience chamber naia called after him do you remember the rest of our bargain great king rhampsinitus looked back at her puzzled you said you would grant me a wish naia reminded him ah yes the king nodded and what is it you wish for i wish for you to forgive this young man and set him free rhampsinitus looked at her aghast what she asked was impossiblebut there was no way to deny her request then he smiled why not he said the mystery is solved the silver is restored the secret entrance is sealed i had thought that this thief was the cleverest man in egyptbut you are even cleverer naia another shooting star passed overhead the crickets chirred i stretched my limbs and i suppose the two of them married so the story goes it makes sense that a woman as clever as naia would settle only for a man as clever as the thief with the silver she had obtained and the combined quickness of their wits i have no doubt that they lived very happily and king rhampsinitus his memory is still revered as the last of the good kings before cheops began a long dynasty of disasters they say that after the mystery of the missing silver was solved he went down to the place the greeks and romans call hades and played dice with demeter one game he won and one game he lost when he came back she gave him a golden napkin and that is why the priests blindfold themselves with yellow cloths when they follow the jackals to the temple of demeter on the night of the spring festival i must have dozed for i missed the rest of whatever new story bethesda had begun when i awoke she was silent but i could tell by her breathing that she was still awake bethesda i whispered what was your greatest crime and your greatest trick after a moment she said i think they are both yet to come and you come here and ill whisper them to you the night had grown cooler a steady breeze wafted gently up from the valley of the tiber bethesda rose from her couch and came to mine i put my lips to her ear but i did not whisper secrets instead we did something else and the next day down on the street of the silversmiths i bought her a simple silver braceleta memento of the night she told me the tale of king rhampsinitus and his treasure house a will is a way lucius claudius was a sausagefingered plumcheeked cherrynosed nobleman with a fuzzy wreath of thinning red hair on his florid pate and a tiny pouting mouth the name claudius marked him not only as a nobleman but a patrician hailing from that small group of old families who first made rome great or who at least fooled the rest of the romans into thinking so not all patricians are rich even the best families can go to seed over the centuries but from the gold seal ring that lucius wore and from the other rings that kept it companyone of silver set with lapis another of white gold with a bauble of flawless green glassi suspected he was quite rich indeed the rings were complemented by a gold necklace from which glittering glass baubles dangled amid the frizzled red hair that sprouted from his fleshy chest his toga was of the finest wool and his shoes were of exquisitely tooled leather he was the very image of a wealthy patrician not handsome and not very brightlooking either but impeccably groomed and dressed his green eyes twinkled and his pouting lips pursed easily into a smile betraying a man with a naturally pleasant personality wealthy well born and with a cheerful disposition he struck me as a man who shouldnt have a worry in the world except that he obviously did or else he would never have come to see me we sat in the little garden of my house on the esquiline once upon a time a man of luciuss social status would never have been seen entering the house of gordianus the finder but in recent years i seem to have acquired a certain respectability i think the change began after my first case for the young advocate cicero apparently cicero has been saying nice things about me behind my back to his colleagues in the law courts telling them that he actually put me up in his house once and it turned out that gordianus professional ferret and consorter with assassins notwithstanding knew how to use a bowl and spoon and an indoor privy after all and could even tell the difference between them lucius claudius filled the chair i had pulled up for him almost to overflowing he shifted a bit nervously and toyed with his rings then smiled sheepishly and held up his cup a bit more he said making an ingratiatingly silly face of course i clapped my hands bethesda more wine for my guest the best from the green clay bottle bethesda rather sullenly obeyed taking her time to rise from where she had been sitting crosslegged beside a pillar she disappeared into the house her movements were as graceful as the unfolding of a flower lucius watched her with a lump in his throat he swallowed hard a very beautiful slave he whispered thank you lucius claudius i hoped he wouldnt offer to buy her as so many of my wealthier clients do i hoped in vain i dont suppose youd consider he began alas no lucius claudius but i was going to say i would sooner sell my extra rib ah he nodded sagely then wrinkled his fleshy brow what did you say oh a nonsense expression i picked up from bethesda according to her ancestors on her fathers side the first woman was fashioned from a rib bone taken from the first man by a god called jehovah that is why some men seem to have an extra rib with no match on the other side do they lucius poked at his rib cage but i think he was much too well padded to actually feel a rib i took a sip of wine and smiled bethesda had told me the hebrew tale of the first man and woman many times each time she tells it i clutch my side and pretend to bleat from pain until she starts to pout and we both end up laughing it seems to me a most peculiar tale but no stranger than the stories her egyptian mother told her about jackalheaded gods and crocodiles who walk upright if it is true this hebrew god is worthy of respect not even jupiter could claim to have created anything half as exquisite as bethesda i had spent enough time putting my guest at ease tell me lucius claudius what is it that troubles you you will think me very foolish he began no i will not i assured him thinking i probably would well it was only the day before yesterdayor was it the day before that it was the day after the ides of maius of that im sure whichever day that was i believe that was the day before yesterday i said bethesda reappeared and stood in the shadows of the portico awaiting a nod from me i shook my head telling her to wait another cup of wine might serve to loosen luciuss tongue but he was befuddled enough already and what transpired on the day before yesterday i happened to be in this very neighborhoodwell not up here on the esquiline hill but down in the valley in the subura the subura is a fascinating neighborhood i said trying to imagine what attraction its tawdry streets might hold for a man who probably lived in a mansion on the palatine hillgaming houses brothels taverns and criminals for hirethese came to mind you see he sighed my days are very idle ive never had a head for politics or finance like others in my family i feel useless in the forum ive tried living in the country but im not much of a farmer cows bore me i dont like entertaining eitherstrangers coming to dinner all of them twice as clever as i am and me obliged to think up some way to amuse them such a bother i get bored rather easily you see so very very bored yes i prompted suppressing a yawn so i go wandering about the city over to tarentum to see the old people easing their joints in the hot springs out to the field of mars to watch the chariot racers train their horses all up and down the tiber to the fish markets and the cattle markets and the markets with foreign goods i like seeing other people at work i relish the way they go about their business with such determination i like watching women haggle with vendors or listening to a builder argue with his masons or noticing how the women who hang from brothel windows slam their shutters when a troupe of rowdy gladiators come brawling down the street all these people seem so alive so full of purpose soso very opposite of bored do you understand gordianus i think i do lucius claudius then youll understand why i love the subura what a neighborhood one can almost smell the passion the vice the crowded tenements the strange odors the spectacle of humanity the winding narrow little streets the dark dank alleys the sounds that drift down from the upperstory windows of strangers arguing laughing making lovewhat a mysterious and vital place the subura is theres nothing so very mysterious about squalor i suggested ah but there is insisted lucius and to him i suppose there was tell me about your adventure two days ago on the day after the ides certainly but i thought you sent the girl for more wine i clapped my hands bethesda stepped from the shadows the sunlight glinted on her long blueblack tresses as she filled luciuss cup he seemed unable to look up at her he swallowed smiled shyly and nodded vigorously at the quality of my best wine which was probably not good enough to give to his slaves he continued that morning quite early i happened to be strolling down one of the side streets off the main subura way whistling a tune noticing how spring had brought out all sorts of tiny flowers and shoots between the paving stones beauty asserts itself even here amid such squalor i thought to myself and i considered composing a poem except that im not very good at poems and then something happened i prompted oh yes a man shouted down to me from a secondstory window he said please citizen come quick a man is dying i hesitated after all he might have been trying to lure me into the building to rob me or worse and i didnt even have a slave with me for protectioni like going out alone you see then another man appeared at the window beside the first and said please citizen we need your help the young man is dying and hes made out a willhe needs seven citizens to witness it ad we already have six wont you come up well i did go up its not very often that anybody needs me for anything how could i refuse the apartment turned out to be a rather nicely furnished set of rooms not at all shabby and certainly not menacing in one of the rooms a man lay wrapped in a blanket upon a couch moaning and shivering an older man was attending to him daubing his brow with a damp cloth there were six others crowded into the room no one seemed to know anyone elseit seemed we had each been summoned off the street one by one to witness the will of the dying man yes his name was asuvius from the town of larinum he was visiting the city when he was struck by a terrible malady he lay on the bed wet with sweat and trembling with fever the illness had aged him terriblyaccording to his friend he wasnt yet twenty yet his face was haggard and lined doctors had been summoned but had been of no use young asuvius feared that he would die at any moment never having made a willsuch a young man after allhe had sent his friend to procure a wax tablet and a stylus i didnt read the document as it was passed among us of course but i saw that it had been written by two different hands he must have written the first few lines himself in a faltering unsteady hand i suppose his friend finished the document for him seven witnesses were required so to expedite matters the older man had simply called for citizens to come up from the street while we watched the poor lad scrawled his name with the stylus and pressed his seal ring into the wax after which you signed and sealed it yourself yes along with the others then the older man thanked us and urged us to leave the room so that young asuvius could rest quietly before the end came i dont mind telling you that i was weeping like a fountain as i stepped onto the street and i wasnt the only one i strolled about the subura in a melancholy mood thinking about that young mans fate about his poor family back in larinum and how they would take the news i remember walking by a brothel situated at the end of the block hardly a hundred paces from the dying mans room and being struck by the contrast the irony that within those walls there lurked such pleasure and relief while only a few doors down the mouth of pluto was opening to swallow a dying country lad i remember thinking what a lovely poem such an irony might inspire no doubt it would in the hands of a truly great poet i acknowledged quickly so did you ever learn what became of the youth a few hours later after strolling about the city in a haze i found myself back on that very street as if the invisible hand of a god had guided me there it was shortly after noon the landlord told me that young asuvius had died not long after i left the older manoppianicus his name was also of larinum had summoned the landlord to the room weeping and lamenting and had shown the landlord the body all wrapped up in a sheet later the landlord saw oppianicus and another man from larinum carry the body down the stairs and load it into a cart to take it to the embalmers outside the esquiline gate lucius sighed i tossed and turned all night thinking about the fickleness of the fates and the way that fortune can turn her back even on a young man starting out in life it made me think of all the days ive wasted all the hours of boredom before he could conceive of yet another stillborn poem i nodded to bethesda to refill his cup and my own a sad tale lucius claudius but not uncommon life in the city is full of tragedies strangers die around us every day we persevere but thats just the pointyoung asuvius isnt dead i saw him just this morning strolling down the subura way smiling and happy oh he still appeared a bit haggard but he was certainly up and walking perhaps you were mistaken impossible he was with the older man oppianicus i called to them across the street oppianicus saw meor at least i thought he didbut he took the younger mans arm and they disappeared into a shop on the corner i followed after them but a cart was passing in the street and the stupid driver almost ran me down when i finally stepped into the shop they were gone they must have passed through the shop into the cross street beyond and disappeared he sat back and sipped his wine i sat down in a shady spot by the public fountain and tried to think it through then i remembered your name i think it was cicero who mentioned you to me that young advocate who did a bit of legal work for me last year i cant imagine who else might help me what do you say gordianus am i mad or is it true that the shades of the dead walk abroad in the noonday sun the answer to both questions may be yes lucius claudius but that doesnt explain whats occurred from what youve told me i should think that something quite devious and all too human is afoot but tell me what is your concern you dont know either of these men what is your interest in this mystery dont you understand gordianus after all ive told you i spend my days in idle boredom peering into the windows of other peoples lives now something has happened that actually titillates me i would investigate the circumstances by myself onlythe great bulk of his body shrank a bitim not exactly brave i glanced at the glittering jewelry about his fingers and throat i should tell you then that im not exactly cheap and i am not exactly poor lucius insisted on accompanying me though i warned him that if he feared boredom my initial inquiries were likely to prove more excruciating than he could bear searching through the subura for a pair of strangers from out of town was hardly my idea of excitement but lucius wanted to follow my every step i could only shrug and allow it if he wanted to trail after me like a dog he was certainly paying well enough for the privilege i began at the house where the young man had supposedly died and where lucius had witnessed the signing of his will the landlord had nothing more to say than what he had already said to luciusuntil i nudged my client and indicated that he should rattle his coin purse the musical jingling induced the landlord to sing the older man oppianicus had been renting the room for more than a month he and a circle of younger friends from larinum were much given to debaucherythe landlord could deduce that much from the sour smell of spilled wine that wafted from their room from the raucous gambling parties they held and from the steady parade of prostitutes who visited them from the brothel down the street and the younger man asuvius the one who died i asked yes what of him he was equally debauched the landlord shrugged you know how it isthese young men from small towns especially the lads who have a bit of money they come to rome and they want to live a little sad that this one should die instead that has nothing to do with me the landlord protested i keep a safe house it wasnt as if the boy was murdered in one of my rooms he took sick and died did he look particularly frail not at all but debauchery can ruin any mans health not in a months time when illness strikes it strikes neither man nor god can lengthen a mans time once the fates have measured out the thread of his life wise words i agreed i pulled a few coins from luciuss purse and slapped them into the mans waiting palm the brothel down the street was one of the suburas more respectable which is to say more expensive houses of entertainment several welldressed slaves lingered outside the door waiting for their masters to come out inside the floor of the little foyer was decorated with a black and white mosaic of priapus pursuing a wood nymph rich tapestries of red and green covered the walls the clientele was not shoddy either while we waited for the master of the house a customer passed us on his way to the door he was at least a minor magistrate to judge from his gold seal ring and he seemed to know lucius at whom he cast a puzzled gaze youlucius claudiushere in priapuss palace yes and what of it gaius fabius but id never have dreamed you had a lustful bone in your body lucius sniffed at the ceiling i happen to be here on important business if you dont mind oh i see but of course dont let me interrupt you the man suppressed a laugh until he was out the door i heard him braying in the street harrumph let him laugh and gossip about me behind my back said lucius i shall compose a satirical poem for my revenge so witheringly spiteful that it shall render that buffoon too limp to visit thiswhat did he call this place priapuss palace piped an unctuously friendly voice the master of the house suddenly appeared between us and slid his arms around our shoulders and what pleasures may i offer to amuse two such fine specimens of roman manhood the man smiled blandly at me then at lucius then at the baubles that decorated luciuss neck and fingers he licked his lips and slithered to the center of the room turned and clapped his hands a file of scantily clad women began to enter the room actually i said hurriedly weve come on behalf of a friend oh a regular client of your establishment in recent days i believe a young visitor to rome named asuvius from the corner of my eye i saw a sudden movement among the girls one of them a honey blonde tripped and thrust out her hands for balance she turned a pair of startled blue eyes in my direction oh yes that handsome lad from larinum gushed our host we havent seen him for at least a day and a halfi was beginning to wonder what had become of him were here on his behalf i said thinking it might not be a lie when all was said and done he sent us to fetch his favorite girlbut i cant seem to remember her name can you remember it lucius lucius gave a start and blinked his eyes which were trained on the girls and threatened to pop from their sockets me oh no i cant remember a thing a look of pure avarice crossed our hosts face his favorite ah let me think yes that would be merula most definitely merula another clap of his hands fetched a slave who put an ear to his masters whispering lips then ran from the room a moment later merula appeared a stunning ethiopian so tall that she had to bow her head to pass through the doorway her skin was the color of midnight and her eyes flashed like shooting stars lucius was visibly impressed and reached for his purse but i stayed his hand it occurred to me that our host was offering us his most expensive property not the one which had necessarily been the favorite of young asuvius no no i said im sure i would have remembered a name like merula ah and she sings like a blackbird as well interjected out host nevertheless i think we were meant to fetch that one i nodded at the honey blonde who gazed back at me with apprehensive blue eyes the tavern across the street was pleasantly cool and dark and almost deserted columba sat within the cloak lucius had thrown over her transparent gown looking pensive the day before yesterday she frowned yes the day after the ides of maius offered lucius certain at last that he had his chronology straight and eager to help and you say that you saw asuvius in his room deathly ill she continued to frown so it appeared when this man oppianicus called me up to the room lucius leaned on one elbow gazing at her raptly and ignoring his cup of wine he was not used to being so near such a beautiful girl i could tell and this was in the morning columba asked yes quite early in the morning but asuvius was with me can you be sure of that certainly because he had slept the whole night with me at my room at the palace and we didnt wake until quite late that morning even then we didnt leave the room ah youth i sighed she blushed faintly and we stayed in my room to eat our midday meal so you see you must have the days mixed up or else yes well its the oddest thing some of asuviuss freedmen were by the palace only yesterday asking for him they seemed not to know where he was they seemed rather worried she looked at me suddenly suspicious what is your interest in asuvius im not really sure i said truthfully does it matter i took a coin from luciuss purse and slid it across the table to her she looked at it coolly then slipped her tiny white hand over it i should hate it if anything has really happened to asuvius she said quietly he really is a sweet boy do you know he told me it was his very first time when he came to the palace a month ago i could believe it too with all the fumbling and all the she broke off with a wistful sigh laughed sadly then sighed again i shall hate it if its true thats he taken sick and died so suddenly oh but he hasnt said lucius thats why were here thats what we dont understand i saw him alive and well with my own eyes this very morning but then how can you say he was deathly ill two days ago and that the landlord saw his body taken away in a cart columba frowned i tell you he was with me the whole morning asuvius was never sick at all you must be confused then you last saw him on the day before yesterday the same day that lucius claudius was called up to witness the lads will i said tell me columba and this might be very important was he wearing his seal ring he was wearing very little at all she said frankly columba that is not an answer well of course he wears his ring always doesnt every citizen im sure he was wearing it that morning you seem awfully certain surely he wasnt signing documents here in your room she looked at me coolly then spoke very slowly sometimes when a man and woman are being intimate there is cause to notice that one of them happens to be wearing a ring perhaps one feels a certain discomfort or a bit of a snag yes im sure he was wearing his ring i nodded satisfied when did he leave you after we ate our midday meal of course after we ate we shall we say it was two hours after noon his friends from larinum came to collect him not his freedmen no asuvius doesnt have much use for servants he says they only get in his way hes always sending them off on silly errands to keep them away from him he says theyll only carry gossip back to his sisters in larinum and to his parents as well i suppose alas asuvius has no parents his mother and father died in a fire only a year ago it was a hard year that followed having to take on his fathers duties in such a hurry and after such a terrible tragedy all the big farms he owns and all the slaves all the paperwork counting up figures so hell know what hes worth to hear him talk youd think a rich man has more work to do than a poor one so it may seem to a young lad whod rather be footloose and carefree i noted this trip to rome was to be his holiday after such a hard year of grieving and labor it was his friends who suggested the trip ah the same friends who came for him the day before yesterday yes crusty old oppianicus and his young friend vulpinus vulpinus a peculiar name has he a snout and a tail oh his real name is marcus avillius but all the girls at the palace call him vulpinus on account of his foxy disposition always nosing into things never seems to be completely honest even when theres no point in lying quite a charmer though and not bad looking i know the sort i said he plays a sort of older brother to asuvius since asuvius has no brothersbrought him to the city arranged for a place for him to stay showed him how to have a good time i see and two days ago as they were leaving priapuss palace did oppianicus and the fox give any hint as to where they were taking young asuvius more than a hint they said they were off to the gardens what gardens why the ones outside the esquiline gate oppianicus and vulpinus had been telling asuvius how splendid they are with splashing fountains and flowers in full bloommaius is a perfect month to visit them asuvius was very eager to go there are so many sights here in the city that he hasnt yet seen having spent so much of his time well enjoying indoor pleasures columba smiled a bit crookedly hes hardly stepped outside the subura i dont think hes even been down to see the forum ah yes and of course a young visitor from larinum would hardly want to miss seeing the famous gardens outside the esquiline gate i suppose not from the way oppianicus and vulpinus described themleafy green tunnels and beautiful pools meadows of blossoms and lovely statues i wish i could see them myself but the master hardly ever lets me out of the house except for business would you believe that ive been in rome for almost two years and id never even heard of the gardens i can believe that i said gravely but asuvius said if the place turned out to be as special as his friends claimed he might take me there himself in a few days as a treat she brightened a bit i sighed we escorted her back to priapuss palace her owner was surprised to see her back so soon but he made no complaint about the fee outside the street darkened for a moment as a cloud obscured the sun no matter whose account is accurate young asuvius most assuredly did not die in his bed the day before yesterday i said either he was with columba very much alive and well or if indeed you saw him lying feverish in his apartment he recovered and you saw him on the street this morning still i begin to fear for the lad i fear for him most desperately why asked lucius you know as well as i lucius claudius that there are no gardens outside the esquiline gate one passes from the city of the living through the esquiline gate into the city of the dead on the left side of the road is the public necropolis of rome where the mass graves of slaves and the modest tombs of the roman poor are crowded close long ago when rome was young the lime pits were discovered nearby just as the city of the living sprang up around the river and the forum and the markets so the city of the dead sprang up around the lime pits and the crematoria and the temples where corpses are purified on the right side of the road are the public refuse pits where the residents of the subura and surrounding neighbor hoods dump their trash all manner of waste lies heaped in the sand pitsbroken bits of crockery and furniture rotting scraps of food discarded garments soiled and torn beyond even a beggars use here and there the custodians light small fires to consume the debris then rake fresh sand over the smoldering embers no matter in which direction one looks there are certainly no gardens outside the esquiline gate unless one counts the isolated flowers that spring up among the moldering debris of the trash heaps or the scraggly vines which wind their way about the old neglected tombs of the forgotten dead i began to suspect that oppianicus and the fox had a cruel sense of humor indeed a glance at lucius told me that he was having second thoughts about accompanying me on this part of my investigation the subura and its vices might seem colorful and quaint but even lucius could find no charm in the necropolis and the rubbish tips he wrinkled his nose and batted a swarm of flies from his face but he did not turn back we passed back and forth between the right side of the road and the left questioning the few people we met about three strangers they might have seen two days beforean older man a foxy young rogue and a mere lad the tenders of the dead waved us aside having no patience to deal with the living the custodians of the trash heaps shrugged and shook their heads we stood at the edge of the sand pits surveying a prospect that might have looked like hades if there were a sun to shine through the hazy smoke of hades onto its smoldering wastes suddenly there was a low hissing noise behind us lucius started my hand jumped to my dagger the maker of the noise was a shuffling stooped derelict who had been watching us from behind a heap of smoldering rubbish what do you want i asked keeping my hand close to the dagger the lump of filthy hair and rags swayed a bit and two milky eyes stared up at me i hear youre looking for someone the man finally said perhaps then perhaps i can help you speak plainly i know where youll find the young man what young man are you talking about the figure stooped and looked up at me sidelong i heard you asking one of the workers a moment ago you didnt see me but i saw you and i listened i heard you asking about the three men who were by here two days ago the older man and the boy and the one between i know where the boy is show us the creature held out a hand so stained and weathered it looked like a stump of wood lucius drew back appalled but reached for his purse i stayed his hand after you show us i said the thing hissed at me it stamped its foot and growled finally it turned and waved for us to follow i grabbed luciuss arm and whispered in his ear you mustnt come such a creature is likely to lure us into a trap look at the jewels you wear the purse you carry go to the crematoria where youll be safe ill follow the man alone lucius looked at me his lips pursed his eyes open wide gordianus you must be joking no power of man or god will stop me from seeing whatever this man has to show us the creature shambled and lurched over the rubbish heaps and drifts of dirty sand we strode deeper and deeper into the wastes the heaps of ash and rubble rose higher around us hid ing us from the road the creature led us around the flank of a low sandy hill an orange haze engulfed us an acrid cloud of smoke swirled around us i choked lucius reached for his throat and began to cough the hot breath of an open flame blew against my face through the murk i saw the derelict silhouetted against the fire he bobbed his head up and down and pointed at something in the flames what is it i wheezed i see nothing lucius gave a start he seized my arm and pointed there within the inferno amid the indiscriminate heap of fiery rubbish i glimpsed the remains of a human body the flaming heap collapsed upon itself sending out a spray of orange cinders i covered my face with my sleeve and put my arm around luciuss shoulder together we fled from the blazing heat and smoke the derelict scampered after us his long brown arm extended palm up there is no proof that the body the derelict showed us was that of asuvius i said it might have been another derelict for all we know the truth is beyond proving that is the crux of the matter took a long sip of wine night had descended on rome crickets chirred in my garden bethesda sat beneath the portico nearby beside a softly glowing lamp she pretended to stitch a torn tunic but listened to every word lucius claudius sat beside me staring at the moons reflection in his cup tell me gordianus how exactly do you explain the discrepancies between what i saw and the tale that columba told us what really happened the day after the ides of maius i should think that the sequence of events is clear even so very well this is how i would tell the story there was once a wealthy young orphan in a town called larinum who chose his friends very poorly two of those friends an old rogue and a young predator talked him into going to rome for a long holiday the three of them took up residence in one of the seedier parts of town and proceeded to indulge in just the sorts of vices that are likely to lull a green country lad into a vulnerable stupor away from the boys watchful sisters and the town gossips in larinum the fox and old oppianicus were free to hatch their scheme on a morning when asuvius was dallying with his favorite prostitute the fox pretended to be the boy and took to his bed feigning a mortal illness oppianicus summoned strangers off the street to act as witnesses to a willpeople who wouldnt know asuvius from alexander oppianicus made at least one mistake but he got away with it what was that someone must have asked the dying mans age oppianicus without thinking said he was not yet twenty you told me so true enough if he meant asuvius but it was the fox who lay on the bed pretending to be asuvius and i gather that the fox is well beyond twenty even so you yourself ascribed the discrepancy to illnesshaggard and lined you said he looked as if terribly aged from his sickness the other witnesses probably thought the same thing people will go to great lengths to make the evidence of their own eyes conform to whatever someone tells them is the truth lucius frowned why was the will in two different handwritings yes i remember you mentioning that the fox began it feigning such a weak hand that he couldnt finish it such a ploy would help to explain why his signature would not be recognizable as the hand of asuviusanyone would think it was the scrawl of a man nearly dead but the fox pressed his own seal ring into the wax protested lucius i saw him do it it couldnt have been the true seal of asuvius who was with columba wearing his ring ill come to that now once the will was witnessed all around you and the others were shunted from the room oppianicus wound the fox up in a sheet tore his hair and worked tears into his eyes then called for the landlord who saw a corpse who thought he saw a corpse all he saw was a body in a sheet he thought asuvius had died of a sudden illness he took no pains to examine the corpse but later he saw two men taking the body away in a cart he saw oppianicus and the fox who had changed back into his clothes carrying out something wrapped up in a sheet a sack of millet for all we know ah and once they were out of sight they got rid of the cart and the millet and went to fetch asuvius from the brothel yes for their appointed stroll through the gardens the derelict witnessed the rest how they ushered the confused boy to a secluded spot where the fox strangled him to death how they stripped his body and hid his corpse amid the rubbish that was when they stole the seal ring from his finger later they must have rubbed the foxs seal from the wax and applied the true seal of asuvius to the will theres a law against that said lucius without much conviction yes the cornelian law enacted by our esteemed senate just three years ago why do you think they passed such a law because falsifying wills has become as commonplace as senators picking their noses in public so the man i saw with oppianicus in the street was indeed the same man whose will i witnessed yes but it was the fox all along not asuvius lucius nodded and so the scheme is complete the false will cheats asuviuss sisters and other relatives no doubt and leaves a tidy fortune to his dear friends oppianicus and marcus avilliusalso known as the fox for good reason i nodded we must do something yes but what i suppose you could bring a suit against the culprits and attempt to prove that the will is fraudulent that should take up a great deal of your time and money if you think you suffer from boredom now wait until youve spent a month or two bustling from clerk to clerk filing actions down in the forum and if oppianicus and the fox find an advocate half as crafty as they are youll likely as not be laughed out of court forget the fraudulent will these men are guilty of coldblooded murder but will you be able to prove it without a corpse and with no reliable witness even if you could find him again our derelict friend is not the sort of man whose testimony would impress a roman jury youre telling me that weve come to the end of it im telling you that if you wish to proceed any further what you need is an advocate not gordianus the finder ten days later lucius claudius came knocking at my door again i was more than a little surprised to see him having set me on the trail of young asuvius and having followed me to its end i expected him to quickly lose interest and lapse into his customary boredom instead he informed me that he had been doing a bit of legwork on his own he invited me for a stroll while we walked he talked of nothing in particular but i noticed that we were drawing near to the street where the whole story had begun lucius remarked that he was thirsty we stepped into the tavern across from priapuss palace ive been thinking a great deal about what you said gordianus about roman justice youre right we cant trust the courts anymore advocates twist words and laws to their own purposes pervert the sentiments of jurors resort to intimidation and outright bribery still true justice must be worth pursuing i keep thinking of the flames and the sight of that young mans body thrown into a rubbish pit and burned to ashes by the way oppianicus and the fox are back in town oh did they ever leave they were on their way back to larinum when i saw them that day before i came to you oppianicus made a great production of showing asuviuss will to anyone who cared to look then filed it with the clerks in the forum at larinum so my messengers to larinum tell me messengers yes i thought i would get in touch with asuviuss sisters a band of his freedmen arrived in rome just this morning i see and oppianicus and the fox are here already yes oppianicus is staying with friends in a house over on the aventine hill but the fox is just across the street in the apartment where they played their little charade i turned and looked out the window from where we sat i could see the groundfloor door of the tenement and the window above the same window from which lucius had been summoned to witness the will the shutters were drawn what a neighborhood said lucius some days i think that almost anything could happen in the subura he craned his neck and looked over my shoulder from up the street i heard the noise of an approaching mob there were twenty of them or more brandishing knives and clubs they gathered outside the tenement where they banged their clubs against the door and demanded entrance when the door did not open they broke it down and streamed inside the shutters were thrown back a face appeared at the window above if the fox was handsome and charming as columba had told us it was impossible to tell at that moment his eyes were bulging in panic and all the blood had drained from his cheeks he stared down at the street and swallowed hard as if working up his courage to jump he hesitated a moment too long hands gripped his shoulders and yanked him back into the room a moment later he was thrust stumbling from the doorway the mob surrounded him and hounded him up the street vendors and idlers scattered and disappeared into doorways windows flew open and curious faces peered down hurry said lucius throwing back the last of his wine or well miss the fun the fox has been run out of his hole and the hounds will pursue him all the way to the forum we hurried into the street as we passed priapuss palace i looked up columba stood at a window gazing down in confusion and excitement lucius waved to her flashing an enormous grin she gave a start and smiled back at him he cupped his hands and shouted come with us when she bit her lip in hesitation he waved with both hands columba vanished from the window and a moment later was running up the street to join us her master appeared at the door gesticulating and stamping his foot lucius turned and shook his purse at the man asuviuss freedmen roared all the way to the forum the outer circle banged their clubs against walls and passing wagons the inner circle kept the fox closely hemmed in they took up a chant justice justice justice by the time we reached the forum the fox was looking quite runtoearth indeed the gang of freedman shoved the fox around and around in a dizzying circle at last we came to the tribunal of the commissioners whose most neglected duty is keeping order in the streets and who also incidentally conduct investigations preliminary to bringing charges for crimes of violence beneath the shade of a portico the unsuspecting commissioner for the subura quintus manilius sat squinting at a stack of parchments he looked up in alarm when the fox came staggering before him the freedmen excited to fever pitch by their parade through the streets all began speaking at once creating an indecipherable roar manilius wrinkled his brow he banged his fist against the table and raised his hand everyone fell silent even then i thought that the fox would get the best of his users he had only to stand upon his rights as a citizen and to keep his mouth shut but the wicked are often cowards even the coldest heart may be haunted by crime and human foxes as often as not step into traps of their own devising the fox rushed up to the bench weeping yes yes i murdered him its true oppianicus made me do it i would never have come up with such a plot on my own it was oppianicuss idea from the start to create the false will and then murder asuvius if you dont believe me call oppianicus before this bench and force him to tell you the truth i turned and gazed at lucius claudius who looked just the same as he had always lookedsausagefingered plumcheeked cherrynosedbut who no longer looked to me the least bit foolish or dimwitted his eyes glinted oddly he looked a bit frightening in fact and terribly sure of himself which is to say that he looked like what he was a roman noble on his face was a smile such as great poets must smile when they have finished a magnum opus the rest of the tale is both good and bad mixed together i wish that i could report that oppianicus and the fox received their just desserts but alas roman justice prevailed which is to say that the honorable commissioner quintus manilius proved not too honorable to take a bribe from oppianicus that at least is what the forum gossips say manilius first announced he would bring a charge of murder against the fox and oppianicus then suddenly dropped the case lucius claudius was bitterly disappointed i advised him to take heart from my own experience villains like oppianicus and the fox eventually come to a bad end though many others may suffer before they reach it perhaps not coincidentally at about the same time that the murder charges were dropped the fraudulent will went missing in larinum in consequence the property of the late asuvius was divided between his surviving blood relations oppianicus and the fox did not profit from his death the owner of priapuss palace was furious with columba for leaving the establishment without his permission and threatened to chastise her by putting hot coals to her feet whereupon lucius claudius offered to buy her on the spot i have no doubt that she is well treated in her new household lucius may not be the endlessly virile young man that asuvius was but that has not kept him from acting like a young man in love these days i see lucius claudius quite often in the forum in the company of reasonably honest advocates like cicero and hortensius rome can always use another honest man in the forum he tells me that he recently completed a book of love poems and is thinking of running for office he holds occasional dinner parties and spends his quiet time in the country overseeing his farms and vineyards as the etruscans used to say it is an ill will that doesnt bring someone good fortune the unfortunate asuvius may not have left a will after all but i think that lucius claudius was his beneficiary nonetheless the lemures the slave pressed a scrap of parchment into my hand from lucius claudius to his friend gordianus greetings if you will accompany this messenger on his return i will be grateful i am at the house of a friend on the palatine hill there is a problem which requires your attention come alonedo not bring the boythe circumstances might frighten him lucius need not have warned me against bringing eco for at that moment the boy was busy with his tutor from the garden where they had found a patch of morning sunlight to ward off the october chill i could hear the old man declaiming while eco wrote the days latin lesson on his wax tablet bethesda i called out but she was already behind me holding open my woolen cloak as she slipped it over my shoulders she glanced down at the note in my hand she wrinkled her nose unable to read bethesda regards the written word with suspicion and disdain from lucius claudius she asked raising an eyebrow why yes but how then i realized she must have recognized his messenger slaves often take more notice of one another than do their masters i suppose he wants you to go gaming with him or to taste the new vintage from one of his vineyards she tossed back her mane of jetblack hair and pouted her luscious lips i suppose not he has work for me a smile flickered at the corner of her mouth not that it should be any concern of yours i added quickly since i had taken eco in from the streets and legally adopted him bethesda had begun to behave less and less like a concubine and more and more like a wife and mother i wasnt sure i liked the change i was even less sure i had any control over it frightening work i added probably dangerous but she was already busy adding my fee to the household accounts in her head as i stepped out the door i heard her humming a happy egyptian tune from her childhood the day was bright and crisp drifts of leaves lined either side of the narrow winding pathway that led from my house down the slope of the esquiline hill to the subura below the tang of smoke was on the air rising from kitchens and braziers the messenger drew his dark green cloak more tightly about his shoulders to ward off the chill neighbor citizen a voice hissed at me from the wall to my right i looked up and saw two eyes peering down at me over the top of the wall surmounted by the dome of a bald knobby head neighboryes you gordianus they call you am i right looked up at him warily yes gordianus is my name and finder they call youyes i nodded you solve puzzles plumb mysteries answer riddles sometimes then you must help me perhaps citizen but not now a friend summons me this will only take a moment even so i grow cold standing here then come inside ill open the little door in the wall and let you in noperhaps tomorrow no now they will come tonight i know itor even this afternoon when the shadows lengthen see the clouds are coming up if the sun grows dim they may come out at midday beneath the dark brooding sky they whom do you mean citizen his eyes grew large yet his voice became quite tiny like the voice of a mouse the lemures he squeaked lucius claudiuss messenger clutched at his cloak i felt the sudden chill myself but it was only a cold dry wind gusting down the pathway that made me shiver or so i told myself lemures the man repeated the unquiet dead leaves scattered and danced about my feet a thin finger of cloud obscured the sun dimming its bright cold light to a hazy gray vengeful the man whispered full of spite empty of all remorse human no longer spirits sucked dry of warmth and pity desiccated and brittle like shards of bone with nothing left but wickedness dead but not gone from this world as they should be revenge is their only food the only gift they offer is madness i stared into the mans dark sunken eyes for a long moment then broke from his gaze a friend calls me i said nodding for the slave to go on but neighbor you cant abandon me i was a soldier for sulla i fought in the civil war to save the republic i was woundedif youll step inside youll see my left leg is nogood at all i have to hobble and lean against a stick while you youre young and whole and healthy a young roman like you owes me some respect pleasetheres no one else to help me my business is with the living not the dead i said sternly i can pay you if thats what you want sulla gave all his soldiers farms up in etruria i sold minei was never meant to be a farmer i still have silver left i can pay you a handsome fee if you help me and how can i help you if you have a problem with lemures consult a priest or an augur i have believe me every spring in the month of maius i take part in the lemuria procession to ward off evil spirits i mutter the incantations i cast the black beans over my shoulder perhaps it works the lemures never come to me in spring and they stay away all summer but as surely as leaves wither and fall from the trees they come to me every autumn they come to drive me mad citizen i cannot they cast a spell inside my head citizen i must go please he whispered i was a soldier once brave afraid of nothing i killed many men fighting for sulla for rome i waded through rivers of blood and valleys of gore up to my hips and never quailed i feared no one and now he made a face of such selfloathing that i turned away help me he pleaded perhaps when i return he smiled pitifully like a doomed man given a reprieve yes he whispered when you return i hurried on the house on the palatine like its neighbors presented a rather plain facade despite its location in the citys most exclusive district except for two pillars in the form of caryatids supporting the roof the porticos only adornment was a funeral wreath of cypress and fir on the door the short hallway flanked on either side by the wax masks of noble ancestors led to a modest atrium on an ivory bier a body lay in state i stepped forward and looked down at the corpse i saw a young man not yet thirty unremarkable except for the grimace that contorted his features normally the anointers are able to remove signs of distress and suffering from the faces of the dead to smooth wrinkled brows and unclench tightened jaws but the face of this corpse had grown rigid beyond the power of the anointers to soften it its expression was not of pain or misery but of fear he fell said a familiar voice behind me i turned to see my onetime client then friend lucius claudius he was as portly as ever and not even the gloomy light of the atrium could dim the cherryred of his cheeks and nose we exchanged greetings then turned our eyes to the corpse titus explained lucius the owner of this house for the last two years anyway he died from a fall yes theres a gallery that runs along the west side of the house with a long balcony that overlooks a steep hillside titus fell from the balcony three nights ago he broke his back and died at once no he lingered through the night and lived until nightfall the next day he told a curious tale before he died of course he was feverish and in great pain despite the draughts of nepenthe he was given lucius shifted his considerable bulk uneasily inside his vast black cloak and reached up nervously to scratch at his frizzled wreath of coppercolored hair tell me gordianus do you have any knowledge of lemures a strange expression must have crossed my face for lucius frowned and wrinkled his brow have i said something untoward gordianus not at all but this is the second time today that someone has spoken to me of lemures on the way here a neighbor of minebut i wont bore you with the tale all rome seems to be haunted by spirits today it must be this oppressive weather this gloomy time of year or indigestion as my father used to say it was not indigestion that killed my husband nor was it a cold wind or a chilly drizzle or a nervous imagination the speaker was a tall thin woman a stola of black wool covered her from neck to feet about her shoulders was a wrap of dark blue her black hair was drawn back from her face and piled atop her head held together by silver pins and combs her eyes were a glittering blue her face was young but she was no longer a girl she held herself as rigidly upright as a vestal and spoke with the imperious tone of a patrician this said lucius is gordianus the man i told you about the woman acknowledged me with a slight nod and this he continued is my dear young friend cornelia from the sullan branch of the cornelius family i gave a slight start yes she said blood relative to our recently departed and deeply missed dictator lucius cornelius sulla was my cousin we the lemures were quite close despite the difference in our ages i was with him just before he died down at his villa in neapolis a great man a generous man her imperious tone softened she turned her gaze to the corpse on the bier now titus is dead too i am alone defenseless perhaps we should withdraw to the library suggested lucius yes said cornelia its cold here in the atrium she led us down a short hallway into a small room my sometime client cicero would not have called it much of a librarythere was only a single cabinet piled with scrolls against one wallbut he would have approved of its austerity the walls were stained a somber red and the chairs were backless a slave tended to the brazier in the center of the room and departed how much does gordianus know cornelia asked lucius very little i only explained that titus fell from the balcony she looked at me with an intensity that was almost frightening my husband was a haunted man haunted by whom or what lucius spoke to me of lemures not plural but singular she said he was tormented by one lemur only was this spirit known to him yes an acquaintance from his youth they studied law together in the forum the man who owned this house before us his name was furius this lemur appeared to your husband more than once it began last summer titus would glimpse the thing for only a momentbeside the road on the way to our country villa or across the forum or in a pool of shadow outside the house at first he wasnt sure what it was he would turn back and try to find it only to discover it had vanished then he began to see it inside the house that was when he realized who and what it was he no longer tried to approach it quite the opposite he fled the thing quaking with fear did you see it as well she stiffened not at first titus saw it the night he fell whispered lucius he leaned forward and took cornelias hand but she pulled it away that night she said titus was brooding pensive he left me in my sitting room and stepped onto the balcony to pace and take a breath of cold air then he saw the thingso he told the story later in his delirium it came toward him beckoning it spoke his name titus fled to the end of the balcony the thing came closer titus grew mad with fear somehow he fell the thing pushed him she shrugged whether he fell or was pushed it was his fear of the thing that finally killed him he survived the fall he lingered through the night and into the next day twilight came titus began to sweat and tremble even the least movement was agony to him yet he thrashed and writhed on the bed mad with panic he said he could not bear to see the lemur again at last he died do you understand he chose to die rather than confront the lemur again you saw his face it was not pain that killed him it was fear i pulled my cloak over my hands and curled my toes it seemed to me that the brazier did nothing to banish the cold from the room this lemur i said how did your husband describe it the thing was not hard to recognize it was furius who owned this house before us its flesh was pocked and white its teeth broken and yellow its hair was like bloody straw and there was blood all around its neck it gave off a foul odor but it was most certainly furius except yes except that it looked younger than furius at the end of his life it looked closer to the age when furius and titus knew one another in the forum in the days of their young manhood when did you first see the lemur yourself last night i was on the balconythinking of titus and his fall i turned and saw the thing but only for an instant i fled into the house and it called after me what did it say two words now you oh cornelia drew in a quick sharp breath she clutched at her wrap and gazed at the fire i stepped closer to the brazier spreading my fingers to catch the warmth what a strange day i muttered what can i say to you cornelia except what i said to another who told me a tale of lemures earlier today why do you consult me instead of an augur these are mysteries about which i know very little tell me a tale of a missing jewel or a stolen document call on me with a case of blackmail or show me a corpse with an unknown killer with these i might help you about such matters i know more than a little but how to placate a lemur i do not know of course i will always come when my friend lucius claudius calls me but i begin to wonder why i am here at all cornelia studied the crackling embers and did not answer perhaps i ventured you believe this lemur is not a lemur at all if in fact it is a living man it doesnt matter what i believe or dont believe she snapped i saw in her eyes the same pleading and desperation i had seen in the soldiers eyes no priest can help me there is no protection against a vengeful lemur yet perhaps the thing is really human after all such a pretense is possible isnt it possible i suppose then you know of such cases of a man masquerading as a lemur i have no personal experience thats why i asked lucius to call you if this creature i in fact human and alive then you may be able to save me from it if instead it is what it appears to be a lemur thenthen nothing can save me i am doomed she gasped and bit ha knuckles but if it was your husbands death the thing desired havent you been listening i told you what it said to me new you those were the words it spoke cornelia shuddered violently lucius went to her side slowly she calmed herself very well cornelia ill help you if i can first questions from answers come answers can you speak she bit her lips and nodded you say the thing has the face of furius did your husband think so my husband remarked on it over and over he saw the thing very close more than once on the night he fell the creature came near enough for him to smell its fetid breath he recognized it beyond a doubt and you you say you saw it for only an instant last night before you fled are you sure it was furius you saw on the balcony yes an instant was all i needed horriblediscolored distorted wearing a hideous grinbut the face of furius i have no doubt and yet younger than you remember yes somehow the cheeks the mouth what makes a face younger or older i dont know i can only say that in spite of its hideousness the thing looked as furius looked when he was a younger man not the furius who died two years ago but furius when he was a slender beardless youth i see in such a case three possibilities occur to me could this indeed have been furiusnot his lemur but the man himself are you certain that hes dead yes there is no doubt no doubt at all she shivered and seemed to leave something unspoken i looked at lucius who quickly looked away then perhaps this furius had a brother a twin perhaps a brother yes but much older besides he died in the civil war oh fighting against sulla i see then perhaps furius had a son the very image of his father cornelia shook her head his only child was an infant daughter his only other survivors were his wife and mother and a sister i think and where are the survivors now cornelia averted her eyes im told they moved into his mothers house on the caelian hill so furius is assuredly dead he had no twinno living brother at alland he left no son and yet the thing which haunted your husband by his own account and yours bore the face of furius cornelia sighed exasperated useless i called on you only out of desperation she pressed her hands to her eyes oh my head pounds like thunder night will come and how will i bear it go now please i want to be alone lucius escorted me to the atrium what do you think he said i think that cornelia is a very frightened woman and her husband was a frightened man why was he so fearful of this particular lemur if the dead man had been his friend an acquaintance gordianus not exactly a friend is there something more that i should know he shifted uncomfortably you know how i detest gossip and really cornelia is not nearly as venal as some people think there is a good side of her that few people see it would be best if you told me everything lucius for cornelias sake he pursed his small mouth furrowed his fleshy brow and scratched his bald pate oh very well he muttered as i told you cornelia and her husband have lived in this house for two years it has also been two years since furius died and this is no coincidence furius was the original owner of this house titus and cornelia acquired it when he was executed for his crimes against sulla and the state i begin to see perhaps you do furius and his family were on the wrong side of the civil war political enemies of sulla when sulla achieved absolute power and compelled the senate to appoint him dictator he purged the republic of his foes the proscriptions names posted on lists in the forum yes i remember only too well once a man was proscribed anyone could hunt him down and bring his head to sulla for a bounty i dont have to remind you of the bloodbath you were here you saw the heads mounted on spikes outside the senate and furiuss head was among them yes he was proscribed arrested and beheaded you ask if cornelia is certain that furius is dead yes because she saw his head on a spike with blood oozing from the neck meanwhile his property was confiscated and put up for public auction but the auctions were not always public i said sullas friends usually had first pick of the finest farms and villas as did sullas relations added lucius wincing when furius was caught and beheaded titus and cornelia didnt hesitate to contact sulla at once and put their mark on this house cornelia had always coveted it why pass up the opportunity to possess it and for a song he lowered his voice the rumor is that they placed the only bid for the unbelievable sum of a thousand sesterces the price of a mediocre egyptian rug i said quite a bargain if cornelia has a flaw its her avarice greed is the great vice of our age but not the only vice what do you mean tell me lucius was this furius really such a great enemy of our late lamented dictator was he such a terrible threat to the security of the state and to sullas personal safety that he truly belonged on the proscription lists i dont understand there were those who ended up on the lists because they were too rich for their own good because they possessed things that others coveted lucius frowned gordianus what ive already told you is scandalous enough and ill ask you not to repeat it i dont know what further inference you may have drawn and i dont care to know i think we should drop the matter friend he may be but lucius is also of patrician blood the cords that bind the rich together are made of gold and are stronger than iron i made my way homeward pondering the strange and fatal haunting of titus and his wife i had forgotten completely about the soldier until as i neared my own house i heard him hissing at me over his garden wall finder you said youd come back to help me and here you are come inside he disappeared and a moment later a little wooden door in the wall opened inward i stopped and stepped inside to find myself in a garden open to the sky surrounded by a colonnade a burning smell filled my nostrils an elderly slave was gathering leaves with a rake and arranging them in piles about a small brazier in the center of the garden the soldier smiled at me crookedly i judged him to be not too much older than myself despite his bald head and the gray hairs that bristled from his eyebrows the dark circles beneath his eyes marked him as a man in desperate need of sleep he hobbled past me and pulled up a chair for me to sit on tell me neighbor did you grow up in the countrysidehis voice cracked slightly as if pleasant discourse was a strain to him no i was born in rome ah i grew up near arpinum myself i only mention it because i saw you staring at the leaves and the fire i know how city folk dread fires and shun them except for heat and cooking its a country habit burning leaves dangerous but im careful the smell of burning leaves reminds me of my boyhood as does this garden i looked up at the trees that loomed in stark silhouette against the cloudy sky among them were some cypresses and yews that still wore their shaggy graygreen coats but most were bare a weirdly twisted little tree hardly more than a bush stood in the corner surrounded by a carpet of round yellow leaves the old slave walked slowly toward the bush and began to rake its leaves in among the others have you lived in this house long i asked for three years i cashed in the farm sulla gave me and bought this place i retired before the fighting was finished my leg was crippled another wound made my sword arm useless my shoulder still hurts me now and again especially at this time of year when the weather turns cold this is a bad time of year all around he grimaced whether at a phantom pain in his shoulder or at phantoms in the air i could not tell when did you first see the lemures i asked since the man insisted on taking my time there was no point in being subtle just after i moved into this house perhaps the lemures were here before you arrived no he said gravely they must have followed me here he limped toward the brazier stooped stiffly gathered up a handful of leaves and scattered them on the fire only a little at a time he said softly wouldnt want to be careless with a fire in the garden besides it makes the pleasure last a little today a little more tomorrow burning leaves reminds me of boyhood how do you know they followed you the lemures i mean because i recognize them who were they i never knew their names he stared into the fire but i remember the etruscans face when my sword cut open his entrails and he looked up at me gasping and unbelieving i remember the bloodshot eyes of the sentries we surprised one night outside capua theyd been drinking the fools when we stuck our swords into their bellies i could smell the wine amid the stench that came pouring out i remember the boy i killed in battle onceso young and tender my blade sliced clear through his neck his head went flying off one of my men caught it and cast it back at me laughing it landed at my feet i swear the boys eyes were still open and he knew what was happening to him he stooped groaning at the effort and gathered another handful of leaves the flames make all things pure again he whispered the odor of burning leaves is the smell of innocence he watched the fire for a long moment they come at this time of year the lemures seeking revenge they cannot harm my body they had their chance to do that when they were living and they only succeeded in maiming me it was i who killed their bodies i who triumphed now they seek to drive mad they cast a spell on me they cloud my mind and draw me into the pit they shriek and dance about my head they open their bellies over me and bury me in offal they dismember themselves and drown me in a sea of blood and gore somehow ive always struggled free but my will grows weaker every year one day theyll draw me into the pit and ill never come out again he covered his face go now im ashamed that you should see me like this when you see me again it will more terrible than you can imagine but you will come when i send for you you will come and see them for yourself a man as clever as you might strike a bargain even with the dead he dropped his hands i would hardly have recognized his facehis eyes were red his cheeks gaunt his lips trembling swear to me that youll come finder if only to bear witness to my destruction i wont make an oath then promise me as a man and leave the gods out of it i beg you to come when i call ill come i sighed wondering if a promise to a madman was truly binding the old slave clucking and shaking his head with worry ushered me to the little door i fear that your master is already mad i whispered these lemures are from his own imagination oh no said the old slave i have seen them too you yes just as he describes and the other slaves we have all seen the lemures i looked into the old slaves calm unblinking eyes for a long moment then i stepped through the passage and he shut the door behind me a veritable plague of lemures i said as i reclined upon my couch taking dinner that night rome is overrun by them bethesda who sensed the unease beneath my levity tilted her head and arched an eyebrow but said nothing and that silly warning lucius claudius wrote in his note this morning do not bring the boy the circumstances might frighten him ha what could be more appealing to a twelveyearold boy than the chance to see a genuine lemur eco chewed a mouthful of bread and watched me with round eyes not sure whether i was joking or not the whole affair seems quite absurd to me ventured bethesda she crossed her arms impatiently as was her custom she had already eaten in the kitchen and merely watched while eco and i feasted as even the stupidest person in egypt knows the bodies of the dead cannot survive unless they have been carefully mummified according to ancient laws how could the body of a dead man be wandering about rome frightening this titus into jumping off a balcony especially a dead man who had his head cut off it was a living fiend who pushed him off the balcony that much is obvious ha ill wager it was the wife who did it then what of the soldiers haunting his slave swears that the whole household has seen the lemures not just one but a whole swarm of them fah the slave lies to excuse his masters feeblemindedness he is loyal as a slave should be but not necessarily honest even so i think i shall go if the soldier calls me to judge with my own eyes and the matter of the lemur on the palatine hill is worth pursuing if only for the handsome fee that cornelia promises bethesda shrugged to change the subject i turned to eco and speaking of outrageous fees what did that thief of a tutor teach you today eco jumped from his couch and ran to fetch his stylus and wax tablet bethesda uncrossed her arms if you do continue with these matters she said her voice now pitched to conceal her own unease i think that your friend lucius claudius gives you good advice there is no need to take eco along with you hes busy with his lessons and should stay at home hes safe here from evil men and evil spirits alike i nodded for i had been thinking the same thing myself the next morning i stepped quietly past the haunted soldiers house he did not hear me and call out though i knew he must be awake and in his garden i smelled the tang of burning leaves on the air i had promised lucius and cornelia that i would come again to the house on the palatine but there was another call i wanted to make first a few questions in the right ears and a few coins in the right hands were all it took to find the house of furiuss mother on the caelian hill where his survivors had fled after he was proscribed beheaded and dispossessed the house was small and narrow wedged in among other small narrow houses that might have been standing for a hundred years the street had somehow survived the fires and the constant rebuilding that continually change the face of the city and seemed to take me into an older simpler rome when rich and poor alike lived in modest private dwellings before the powerful began to flaunt their wealth with great houses and the poor were pressed together into manystoried tenements a knock upon the door summoned a veritable giant a hulking thickchested slave with squinting eyes and a scowling mouthnot the door slave of a secure and respectable home but quite obviously a bodyguard i stepped back a few paces so that i did not have to strain to look up at him and asked to see his master if you had legitimate business here youd know that there is no master in this house he growled of course i said i misspoke i meant to say your mistressthe mother of the late furius he scowled do you misspeak again stranger or could it be that you dont know that the old mistress had a stroke not long after her sons death she and her daughter are in seclusion and see no one what was i thinking i meant to say of course furiuss widow but the slave had had enough of me and slammed the door in my face i heard a cackle of laughter behind me and turned to see a toothless old slave woman sweeping the portico of the house across the street youd have had an easier time getting in to see the dictator sulla when he was alive she laughed i smiled and shrugged are they always so unfriendly with strangers yes you cant blame thema house full of women with no man around but a bodyguard no man in the housenot since furius was executed you knew him asked the slave woman not exactly but i know of him terrible what they did to him he was no enemy of sullas furius had no stomach for politics or fighting a gentle man wouldnt have kicked a dog from his front step but his brother took up arms against sulla and died fighting him that was his brother not furius i knew them both from when they were boys growing up in that house with their mother furius was a peaceful child and a cautious man a philosopher not a fighter what was done to him was a terrible injusticenaming him an enemy of the state taking all his property cutting off his she stopped her sweeping and cleared her throat she hardened her jaw who are you another schemer come to torment his womenfolk not at all because ill tell you right now that youll never get in to see his mother or sister ever since his death and after that the old womans stroke they havent stirred out of that house a long time to be in mourning you might say but furius was all they had his widow goes out to do the marketing with the little girl they still wear black they all took his death very hard at that moment the door across the street opened a blond woman emerged draped in a black stola beside her reaching up to hold her hand was a little girl with haunted eyes and black curls closing the door and following behind was the giant who saw me and scowled on their way to market whispered the old slave woman she usually goes at this time of morning ah look at the precious little one so seriouslooking yet so pretty not so much like her mother not so fair no the very image of her aunt ive always said her aunt not her father him too of course i talked with the old woman for a few moments then hurried after the widow i hoped for a chance to speak with her but the bodyguard made it plain that i should keep my distance i fell back and followed them in secret observing her purchases as she did her shopping in the meat market at last i broke away and headed for the house on the palatine lucius and cornelia hurried to the atrium even before the slave announced my arrival their faces were drawn with sleeplessness and worry the lemur appeared again last night said lucius the thing was in my bedchamber cornelias face was pale i woke to see it standing beside the door it was the smell that woke mea horrible stench i tried to rise and couldnt i wanted to cry out but my throat was frozenthe thing cast a spell on me it said the words again now you then it disappeared into the hallway did you pursue it she looked at me as if i were mad and then i saw the thing said lucius i was in the bedchamber down the hall i heard footsteps and called out thinking it was cornelia there was no answer and the footsteps grew hurried i leaped from my couch and stepped into the hall and you saw it only for an instant i called out the thing paused and turned then disappeared into the shadows i would have followed itreally gordianus i swear i would havebut at that instant cornelia cried out for me i turned and hurried to her room so the thing fled and no one pursued it i stifled a curse im afraid so said lucius wincing but when the thing turned and looked at me in the hallway a bit of moonlight fell on its face you had a good look at it then yes gordianus i didnt know furius well but well enough to recognize him across a street or in the forum and this creaturedespite its broken teeth and the tumors on its flesh this fiend most certainly had the face of furius cornelia suddenly gasped and began to stagger lucius held her up and called for help some of the household women escorted her to her bedchamber titus was just the same before his fall sighed lucius shaking his head he would faint and suffer fits grow dizzy and be unable to catch a breath they say such afflictions are frequently caused by spiteful lemures perhaps i said or by a guilty conscience i wonder if the lemur left any other manifestations behind show me where you saw the thing lucius led me down the hallway there he said pointing to a spot a few steps beyond the door to his room at night a bit of light falls just there everything beyond is dark i walked to the place and looked about then sniffed the air lucius sniffed as well the smell of putrefaction he murmured the lemur has left its fetid odor behind a bad smell to be sure i said but not the odor of a rotting corpse look here a footprint just below us two faint brown stains in the shape of sandals had been left on the tiled floor in the bright morning light other marks of the same color could be seen extending in both directions those toward cornelias bedchamber where many other feet had traversed quickly became confused and unreadable those leading away showed only the imprint of the forefeet of a pair of sandals with no heel marks the thing came to a halt here just as you said then it began to run leaving these abbreviated impressions why should a lemur run on tiptoes i wonder and what is this stain left by the footsteps i knelt down and peered closely lucius shedding his patrician dignity got down on his hands and knees beside me he wrinkled his nose the smell of putrefaction he said again not putrefaction i countered common excrement come lets see where the footprints lead we followed them down the hallway and around a corner where the footprints ended before a closed door does this lead outside i asked why no said lucius suddenly a patrician again and making an uncomfortable face that door opens into the indoor toilet how interesting i opened it and stepped inside as i would have expected in a household run by a woman like cornelia the fixtures were luxurious and the place was quite spotless except for some telltale footprints on the limestone floor there were windows set high in the wall covered by iron bars a marble seat surmounted the hole peering within i studied the lead piping of the drain straight down the slope of the palatine hill and into the cloaca maxima and thence into the tiber commented lucius patricians may be prudish about bodily functions but of roman plumbing they are justifiably proud not nearly large enough for a man to pass through i said what an awful idea even so i called for a slave who managed to find a chisel for me what are you doing gordianus here those tiles are made of fine limestone you shouldnt go chipping away at the corners not even to discover this i slid the chisel under the edge of one of the stones and lifted it up lucius drew back and gasped then leaned forward and peered down into the darkness a tunnel he whispered so it appears someone must go down it lucius said he peered at me and raised an eyebrow not even if cornelia doubled my fee i wasnt suggesting that you go gordianus he looked up at the young slave who had fetched the chisel the boy looked slender and supple enough when he saw what lucius intended he started back and looked at me imploringly no lucius claudius i said no one need be put at risk not yet who knows what the boy might encounterif not lemures and monsters then booby traps or scorpions or a fall to his death first we should attempt to determine the tunnels egress it may be a simple matter if it merely follows the logical course of the plumbing which it did from the balcony on the western side of the house it was easy enough to judge where the buried pipes descended the slope into the valley between the palatine and the capitoline where they joined with the cloaca maxima underground at the foot of the hill directly below the house in a wild rubbishstrewn region behind some warehouses and granaries i spied a thicket even stripped of their leaves the bushes grew so thick that i could not see far into them lucius insisted on accompanying me though his bulky frame and expensive garb were ill suited for scrambling down a steep hillside we eventually reached the foot of the hill then pushed our way into the thicket ducking beneath branches and snapping twigs out of the way at last we came to the heart of the thicket where our perseverance was rewarded hidden behind the dense shaggy branches of a cypress tree was the tunnels other end the hole was crudely made lined with rough dabs of mortar and broken bricks it was just large enough for a man to enter but the foul smell that issued from within was enough to keep out vagrants or curious children at night hidden behind the storehouses and sheds such a place would be quite lonely and secluded a manor a lemur for that mattermight come and go completely unobserved cold complained lucius cold and damp and dark it would have made more sense to stay in the house tonight where its warm and dry we could lie in wait in the hallway and trap this fiend when he emerges from his secret passage why instead are we huddling here in the dark and cold watching for who knows what and jumping in fright every time a bit of wind whistles through the thicket you need not have come lucius claudius i didnt ask you to cornelia would have thought me a coward if i didnt he pouted and what does cornelias opinion matter i snapped and bit my tongue the cold and damp had set us both on edge a light drizzle was falling obscuring the moon and casting the thicket into even greater darkness we had been hid ing among the brambles since shortly after nightfall i had warned lucius that the watch was likely to be long and uncomfortable and possibly futile but he had insisted on accompanying me he had offered to hire some ruffians to escort us but if my suspicions were correct we would not need them nor did i want more witnesses to be present than was necessary a gust of icy wind whipped beneath my cloak and sent a shiver up my spine luciuss teeth began to chatter my mood grew dark what if i was wrong after all what if the thing we sought was not human but something else a twig snapped then many twigs something had entered the thicket it was moving toward us it must be a whole army whispered lucius clutching at my arm no i whispered back only two persons if my guess is right two moving shapes obscured by the tangle of branches and the deep gloom came very near to us and then turned toward the cypress tree that hid the tunnels mouth a moment later i heard a mans voice cursing someone has blocked the hole i recognized the voice of the growling giant who guarded the house on the caelian hill perhaps the tunnel has fallen in when lucius heard the second voice he clutched my arm again not in fear but in surprise no i said aloud the tunnel was purposely blocked so that you could not use it again there was a moment of silence followed by the noise of two bodies scrambling in the underbrush stay where you are i said for your own good stay where you are and listen to me the scrambling ceased and there was silence again except for the sound of heavy breathing and confused whispers i know who you are i said i know why youve come here i have no interest in harming you but i must speak with you will you speak with me furia furia whispered lucius the drizzle had ended and moonlight illuminated the confusion on his face there was a long silence then more whisperingthe giant was trying to dissuade his mistress finally she called out who are you my name is gordianus you dont know me but i know that you and your family have suffered greatly furia you have been wronged most unjustly perhaps your vengeance on titus and cornelia is seemly in the eyes of the godsi cant judge but youve been found out and the time has come to stop your pretense im going to step toward you now there are two of us we carry no weapons tell your slave that we mean no harm and that to harm us will profit you nothing i stepped slowly toward the cypress tree a great shaggy patch of black amid the general gloom beside it stood two forms one tall the other short with a gesture furia bade her slave to stay where he was then stepped toward us a patch of moonlight fell on her face lucius gasped and started back even though i expected it the sight still sent a shiver through my veins i confronted what appeared to be a young man in a tattered cloak his short hair was matted with blood and blood was smeared all around his throat and neck as if his neck had been severed and then somehow fused together again his eyes were dark and hollow his skin was as pale as death and dotted with horrible tumors his lips were parched and cracked when furia spoke her sweet gentle voice was a strange contrast to her horrifying appearance you have found me out she said yes are you the man who called at my mothers house this morning yes who betrayed me it couldnt have been cleto she whispered glancing at the bodyguard no one betrayed you we found the tunnel this afternoon ah my brother had it built during the worst years of the civil war so that we might have a way to escape in a sudden crisis of course when the monster became dictator there was no way for anyone to escape was your brother truly an enemy of sullas not in any active way but there were those willing to paint him as suchthose who coveted all he had furius was proscribed for no reason no reason but the bitchs greed her voice was hard and bitter i glanced at lucius who was curiously silent at such an assault on cornelias character it was titus whom you haunted first only so that cornelia would know what awaited her titus was a weakling a nobody easily frightened ask cornelia she could always intimidate him into doing whatever she wished even if it meant destroying an innocent man it was cornelia who convinced her dear cousin sulla to insert my brothers name in the proscription lists merely to obtain our house because the men of our line have perished because furius was the last she thought that her calumny would go unavenged forever but now it must stop furia you must be content with what you have done so far no a life for a life i said titus for furius no ruin for ruin the death of titus will not restore our house our fortune our good name nor will the death of cornelia if you proceed now you are sure to be caught you must be content with half a portion of vengeance and push the rest aside you intend to tell her then now that youve caught me at it i hesitated first tell me truly furia did you push titus from his balcony she looked at me unwaveringly the moonlight making her eyes glimmer like shards of onyx titus jumped from the balcony he jumped because he thought he saw the lemur of my brother and he could not stand his own wretchedness and guilt i bowed my head go i whispered take your slave and go now back to your mother and your niece and your brothers widow never come back i looked up to see tears streaming down her face it was a strange sight to see a lemur weep she called to the slave and they departed from the thicket we ascended the hill in silence luciuss teeth stopped chattering and instead he began to huff and puff outside cornelias house i drew him aside lucius you must not tell cornelia but how else we will tell her that we found the tunnel but that no one came that her persecutor has been frightened off for now but may come again in which case she can set her own guard yes let her think that the unknown threat is still at large plotting her destruction but surely she deserves she deserves what furia had in store for her did you know that cornelia had placed furiuss name on the lists merely to obtain his house i lucius bit his lip i suspected the possibility but gordianus what she did was hardly unique everyone was doing it not everyone not you lucius true he said nodding sheepishly but cornelia will fault you for not capturing the impostor shell refuse to pay your full fee i dont care about the fee ill make up the difference said lucius i laid my hand on his shoulder what is rarer than a camel in gaul i said lucius wrinkled his brow an honest man in rome i laughed and squeezed his shoulder lucius shrugged off the compliment with typical chagrin i still dont understand how you knew the identity of the impostor i told you that i visited the house on the caelian hill this morning what i didnt tell you was what the old slave woman across the street revealed to me that furius not only had a sister but that his sister bore a striking resemblance to himso close in fact that with her softer more feminine features she might have passed for a younger version of furius but her horrid appearance an illusion when i followed furiuss widow to market i saw her purchase a considerable quantity of calfs blood she also gathered a spray of juniper berries which her little girl carried for her berries the cankers pasted on furias facejuniper berries cut in half the blood was for matting her hair and daubing on her neck as for the rest of her appearance her ghastly makeup and costuming you and i can only guess at the ingenuity of a household of women united toward a single goal furia has been in seclusion for months which explains the almost uncanny paleness of her fleshand the fact that she was able to cut off her hair without anyone taking notice i shook my head a remarkable woman i wonder why she never married i suppose the turmoil of the civil war must have destroyed any plans she had and the death of her brothers ruined her prospects forever misery is like a pebble cast into a pond sending out a wave that spreads and spreads i headed home that night weary and wistful there are days when one sees too much of the worlds wickedness and only a long sleep in the safe seclusion of home can restore an appetite for life i thought of bethesda and eco and tried to push the face of furia from my thoughts the last thing on my mind was the haunted soldier and his legion of lemures i passed by the wall of his garden smelled the familiar tang of burning leaves but thought nothing of it until i heard the little wooden door open behind me and the voice of his old retainer finder thank the gods youve finally returned he whispered hoarsely he seemed to be in the grip of a strange malady for even though the door allowed him more room to stand he remained oddly bent his eyes gleamed dully and his jaw trembled the master sent messengers to your houseonly to be told that youre out but may return at any time but when the lemures come time stops please come save the mastersave us all from beyond the wall i heard the sound of moaning not from one man but from many i heard a woman shriek and the sound of heavy objects being overturned what madness was taking place within the soldiers house please help us the lemures the lemures the old slave made a face of such horror that i started back i reached inside my tunic and felt my dagger but of what use would a dagger be to deal with those already dead i stepped through the little door my heart pounded like a hammer in my chest the air of the garden was dank and smoky after the drizzle a clammy cold had descended like a blanket on the hills of rome holding down the smoke of hearth fires making the air thick and stagnant i breathed in an acrid breath and coughed the soldier came running from within the house he tripped fell and staggered forward on his knees wrapped his arms around my waist and looked up at me in abject terror there he pointed back toward the house they pursue me gods have mercythe boy without a head the soldier with his belly cut open all the others i peered into the hazy darkness but saw nothing except a bit of whorling smoke i suddenly felt dizzy and lightheaded it was because i had not eaten all day i told myself i should have been less proud and presumed upon cornelias hospitality for a meal then while i watched the whorl of smoke began to expand and change shape a face emerged from the murky darknessa boys face twisted with agony see cried the soldier see how the poor lad holds his own head in his fist like perseus holding the head of the gorgon see how he stares blaming me indeed out of the darkness and smoke i began to see exactly what the wretched man described a headless boy in battle garb clutching his dismembered head by the hair and holding it aloft i opened my mouth in awe behind the boy other shapes began to emergefirst a few then many then a legion of phantoms covered with blood and writhing like maggots in the air it was a terrifying spectacle i would have fled but i was rooted to the spot the soldier clutched my knees the old slave began to weep and babble from within the house came the sound of others in distress moaning and crying out dont you hear them cried the soldiers the lemures shrieking like harpies the great looming mass of corpses began to keen and wailsurely all of rome could hear it like a drowning man the mind in great distress will clutch at anything to save itself a bit of straw will float but will not support a thrashing man a plank of wood may give him respite but best of all is a steady rock within the raging current so my mind clutched at anything that might preserve it in the face of such overwhelming inexplicable horror time had come to a stop just as the old slave had said and in that endlessly attenuated moment a flood of images memories schemes and notions raged through my mind i clutched at straws madness pulled me downward like an unseen current in black water i sankuntil i suddenly found the solid truth to cling to the bush i whispered the burning bush which speaks aloud the soldier thinking i spied something within the mass of writhing lemures clutched at me and trembled what bush ah yes i see it too no the bush here in your garden that strange gnarled tree among the yews with yellow leaves all around but now the leaves have all been swept in among the others burnt with the others in the brazier the smoke hangs in the air i pulled the soldier out of the garden through the small door and onto the pathway i returned for the old slave and then one by one for the others they huddled together on the cobblestones trembling and confused their eyes wide with terror and red with blood there are no lemures i whispered hoarsely my throat sore from the smokeeven though i kept glimpsing the lemures above the wall cackling and dangling their entrails in the empty air the slaves shrieked and clutched one another the soldier hid behind his hands as the slaves grew more manageable i led them in groups to my house where they huddled together frightened but safe bethesda was perplexed and displeased at the sudden invasion of halfmad strangers but eco was delighted at the opportunity to stay up until dawn under such novel circumstances it was a long cold night marked by fits of panic and orgies of mutual reassurance while we waited for sanity to return the first light of morning broke bringing a cold dew that was a tonic to senses still befuddled by sleeplessness and poisoned by smoke my head pounded like thunder with a hangover far worse than any i had ever gotten from wine a ray of pale sunlight was like a knife in my eyes but i no longer saw visions of lemures or heard their mad wailing the soldier haggard and dazed begged me for an explanation the truth came to me in a flash i said your annual ritual of burning leaves and the annual visitation of the lemures the smoke that filled your garden and the plague of spirits these things were all somehow connected that odd twisted tree in your garden isnt native to rome or to italy how it came here i have no idea but i suspect the seeds for it came from the east where plants which induce visions are not uncommon there is the snake plant of ethiopia the juice of which causes such terrible visions that it drives men to suicide men convicted of sacrilege are forced to drink it as punishment the rivergleam plant that grows on the banks of the indus is famous for making men rave and see weird visions but i suspect that the tree in your garden may be a specimen of a rare bush found in the rocky mountains east of egypt bethesda tells a tale about it what tale said bethesda you rememberthe tale your hebrew father passed on to you about his ancestor called moses who encountered a bush which spoke aloud to him when it burned the leaves of your bush neighbor not only spoke but cast powerful visions yet why did i see what i saw you saw that which you feared the mostthe vengeful spirits of those you killed fighting for sulla but the slaves saw what i saw and so did you we saw what you suggested just as you began to see a burning bush when i said the words he shook his head it was never so powerful before last night was more terrible than ever probably because in the past you happened to burn only a few of the yellow leaves at a time and the cold wind carried away much of the smoke the visions came upon some but not all of the household and in varying degrees but last night you happened to burn a great many of the yellow leaves at once the smoke filled the garden and spread through your house everyone who breathed it was intoxicated and stricken with a temporary madness once we escaped the smoke the madness passed like a fever burning itself out then the lemures never existed i think not and if i uproot that accursed bush and cast it in the tiber i will never see the lemures again perhaps not though you may always see them in your nightmares i thought so it was just as i told you said bethesda that afternoon bringing a moist cloth to cool my forehead flashes of pain still coursed through my temples from time to time and whenever i closed my eyes alarming visions loomed in the blackness just as you told me nonsense i said you thought that titus was pushed from his balconyand that his wife cornelia did it a woman pretending to be a lemur drove him to jump which is almost the same she insisted and you said the soldiers old slave was lying about having seen the lemures himself when in fact he was telling the tilth what i said was that the dead cannot go walking about unless they have been properly mummified and i was absolutely right and it was i who once told you about the burning bush which speaks remember without that you would never have figured the cause fair enough i admitted deciding it was impossible to win the argument this quaint roman idea about lemures haunting the living is completely absurd she went on about that i am not so sure but with your own eyes you have seen the truth by your own wits you have proved in not one but two instances that what everyone thought to be lemures were not lemures at all only a vengeful pretense in one case intoxicating smoke in the other and at the root of both cases a guilty conscience you miss the point bethesda what do you mean lemures do existperhaps not as visitors perceptible to the senses but in another way the dead do have power to spread misery among the living the spirit of a man can carry on and cause untold havoc from beyond the grave the more powerful the man the more terrible his legacy i shiverednot at lurid visions remembered from the soldiers garden but at the naked truth which was infinitely more awful rome is a haunted city the lemur of the dictator sulla haunts us all dead he may be but not departed his wickedness lingers on bringing despair and suffering upon his friends and foes alike to this bethesda had no answer i closed my eyes and saw no more monsters but slept a dreamless sleep until dawn of the following day little caesar and the pirates well met gordianus tell me have you heard what theyre saying down in the forum about mariuss young nephew julius caesar it was my good friend lucius claudius who called to me on the steps of the senian baths he appeared to be on his way out while i was on my way in if you mean that old story about pretty young caesar playing queen to king nicomedes while he was in bithynia ive heard it all beforefrom you i believe more than once and with increasingly more graphic details each time no no that bit of gossip is ancient history now im talking about this tale of pirates ransom revengecrucifixions i looked at him blankly lucius grinned which caused his two chins to meld into one his chubby cheeks were pink from the heat of the baths and his frizzled orange curls were still damp the twinkle in his eyes held that special joy of being the first to relate an especially juicy bit of gossip i confessed to him that my curiosity was piqued however as it appeared that lucius was leaving the baths while i had only just arrived and as i was especially looking forward to the hot plunge given the slight nip that lingered in the spring airalas the story would have to wait what and let someone else tell it to you and get the details all confused i think not gordianus no ill accompany you he gestured to his entourage to turn around the dresser the barber the manicurist the masseur and the bodyguards all looked a bit confused but followed us compliantly back into the baths this turned out to be a stroke of luck for me as i was in need of a bit of pampering bethesda did her best at cutting my hair and as a masseuse her touch was golden but lucius claudius was wealthy enough to afford the very best in body servants there is something to be said for having occasional access to the services of a rich mans slaves as my fingernails and toenails were carefully clipped and filed and buffed my hair expertly trimmed and my beard painlessly shorn lucius kept trying to begin his tale and i kept putting him off wanting to make sure i received the full treatment it was not until our second visit to the hot plunge that i allowed him to begin in earnest amid clouds of steam with our heads bobbing on the water like little islands in the mist he related his nautical tale as you know gordianus in recent years the problem of piracy has grown increasingly severe blame it on sulla and marius and the civil war i said wars mean refugees and refugees mean more bandits on the highways and more pirates on the sea yes well whatever the cause we all see the results ships seized and looted cities sacked roman citizens taken hostage while the senate vacillates as usual what can they do would you have them grant a special naval command to some powermad general who can then use the forces we give him to attack his political rivals and set off another civil war i shook my head trapped between warlords and brigands with the roman senate to lead ussometimes i despair for our republic as do all thinking men agreed lucius we shared a moment of silent contemplation on the crisis of the roman state then he eagerly launched into his tale again anyway when i say that the pirates have grown so bold as to kidnap roman citizens i dont simply mean some merchant they happened to pluck from a trading vessel i mean citizens of distinction noble romans whom even ignorant pirates should know better than to molest i mean young julius caesar himself when was this just as winter was setting in caesar had spent the summer on the island of rhodes studying rhetoric under apollonius molo he was due to serve as an attache to the governor of cilicia but he lingered on rhodes as long as he could and set out at the very close of the sailing season just off the island of pharmacusa his ship was given chase and captured by pirates caesar and his whole entourage were taken prisoner lucius raised an eyebrow which prompted a curious pattern of wrinkles across his fleshy brow now keep in mind that caesar is only twentytwo which may explain how he could be so recklessly bold remember also that his good looks wealth and connections have pretty much always gotten him whatever he wants imagine he finds himself in the clutches of cilician pirates the most bloodthirsty people on earth does he cringe beneath their threats bow his head make himself humble and meek far from it exactly the opposite he taunted his captors from the very beginning they told him they were planning to demand a ransom of half a million sesterces caesar laughed in their faces for a captive such as himself he told them they were fools not to demand at least a millionwhich they did interesting i said by placing a greater value on his life he forced the pirates to do likewise i suppose even bloodthirsty killers tend to take better care of a millionsesterce hostage than one worth only half as much so you think the gambit shows caesars cleverness his enemies ascribe it to simple vanity but i give him full credit for what he did next which was to arrange for the release of almost everyone else in his party his numerous secretaries and assistants were let go because caesar insisted that the ransom of a million sesterces would have to be raised from various sources in various places requiring the labor of his whole entourage the only ones he kept with him were two slavesthat being the absolute minimum to see to a noblemans comfortand his personal physician whom caesar can hardly do without because of his bouts of falling sickness well they say caesar spent nearly forty days in the pirates clutches and treated his captivity as if it were a vacation if he had a mind to take a nap and the pirates were making too much noise he would send one of his slaves to tell them to shut up when the pirates engaged in exercises and games caesar joined them and as often as not bested them treating them as if they were not his captors but his guards to fill his idle time he wrote speeches and composed verses such as he had learned to do under apollonius molo and when he finished a work he would make the pirates sit quietly and listen to him if they interrupted him or made critical remarks he called them barbarians and illiterates to their faces he made jokes about having them whipped as if they were unruly children and even joked about having them put to death on the cross for insulting the dignity of a roman patrician the pirates put up with such insolence they seemed to adore it caesar exercised a kind of fascination over them by sheer power of his will the more he abused and insulted them the more they were charmed at last the ransom arrived and caesar was released right away he headed for miletus took charge of some ships and went straight back to the island where the pirates were stationed he took them by surprise captured most of them and not only reclaimed the ransom money but took the pirates hoard as well claiming it as the spoils of battle when the local governor hesitated over deciding the pirates fate trying to think of some legal loophole whereby he could claim the booty for his treasury caesar took it upon himself to tend to the pirates punishment many times while he was their captive he boasted that he would see them crucified and they had laughed thinking the threat was mere boyish bravadobut in the end it was caesar who laughed when he saw them nailed naked upon crosses let men learn to take me at my word he said i shivered despite the heat of the bath you heard this in the forum lucius yes its on everyones lips caesar is on his way back to rome and the story of his exploits precedes him just the sort of moral tale that romans love to hear i grunted no doubt the ambitious young patrician plans a career in politics this is the very thing to build up his reputation with the voters well caesar needs something to recover his dignity after having given it up to king nicomedes said lucius with a leer yes in the eyes of the mob nothing enhances a romans dignity like having another man nailed to a cross i said glumly and nothing more diminishes his dignity than being nailed himself even if by a king observed lucius this water grows too hot it makes me irritable i think i could use the services of your masseur now lucius claudius the tale of caesar and the pirates proved to be immensely popular over the next few months as spring wanned to summer i heard it repeated by many tongues in many variations in taverns and on street corners by philosophers in the forum and by acrobats outside the circus maximus it was a clear example of how terribly out of hand the problem of piracy had gotten men said nodding gravely but what really impressed them was the idea of a brash young patrician charming a crew of bloodthirsty pirates with his haughtiness and in the end inflicting upon them the full measure of roman justice it was on a sweltering midsummer day in the month of sextilis that i was called to the home of a patrician named quintus fabius the house was situated on the aventine hill the structure looked at once ancient and immaculately kepta sign that its owners had prospered there for many generations the foyer was lined with scores of wax effigies of the household ancestors the fabu go all the way back to the founding of the republic i was shown to a room off the central courtyard where my hosts awaited me quintus fabius was a man of middle age with a stern jaw and graying temples his wife valeria was a strikingly beautiful woman with hazel hair and blue eyes they sat in backless chairs each attended by a slave with a fan a chair was brought in for me along with a slave to fan me usually i find that the higher a client ranks on the social scale the longer he takes to explain his business quintus fabius lost no time however in producing a document what do you make of it he said as yet another slave conveyed the scrap of papyrus to my hands you can read cant you asked valeria her tone more anxious than insulting oh yesif i go slowly i said thinking to buy more time to study the letter for a letter it was and to figure out what the couple wanted from me the papyrus was waterstained and torn at the edges and had been folded several times rather than rolled the handwriting was childish but strong with gratuitous flourishes on some of the letters to pater and to mater dearest by now my friends must have told you of my abduction it was foolish of me to go off swimming by myselfforgive me i know that you must be stricken with fear and grief but do not fret overmuch i have lost only a little weight and my captors are not too cruel i write to convey their demands they say you must give them sesterces this is to be delivered to a man in ostia on the morning of the ides of sextilis at a tavern called the flying fish have your agent wear a red tunic from their accents and their brutish manner i suspect these pirates are cilicians it may be that some of them can read though i doubt it so i cannot be completely frank but know that i am in no greater discomfort than might be expected soon we shall be reunited that is the fervent prayer of your devoted son spurius while i pondered the note from the corner of my eye i saw that quintus fabius was drumming his fingers on the arm of his chair his wife anxiously fidgeted and tapped her long fingernails against her lips i suppose i finally said that you would like me to go ransom the boy oh yes said valeria leaning forward and fixing me with a fretful gaze hes not a boy said quintus fabius his voice surprisingly harsh hes seventeen he put on his manly toga over a year ago but you will accept the job said valeria i pretended to study the letter why not send someone from your own household a trusted secretary perhaps quintus fabius scrutinized me im told that youre rather clever you find things out it hardly requires someone clever to deliver a ransom who knows what unexpected contingencies may arise im told that i can trust your judgmentand your discretion poor spurius said valeria her voice breaking youve read his letter you must see how badly hes being treated he makes light of his tribulations i said he would if you knew my son how cheerful he is by nature youd realize just how desperate his situation must be for him to even mention his suffering if he says hes lost a little weight he must be half starved what can such men be feeding himfish heads and moldy bread if he says these monsters are not too cruel imagine how cruel they must be when i think of his ordealoh i can hardly bear it she stifled a sob where was he kidnapped and when it happened last month said quintus fabius twentytwo days ago said valeria with a sniffle twentytwo endless days and nights he was down at baiae with some of his friends explained quintus fabius we have a summer villa above the beach and a town house across the bay at neapolis spurius and his friends took a little skiff and went sailing among the fishing boats the day was hot spurius decided to take a swim his friends stayed on the boat spurius is a strong swimmer said valeria her pride steadying the tremor in her voice quintus fabius shrugged my son is better at swimming than at most things while his friends watched he made a circuit swimming from one fishing boat to another his friends saw him talking and laughing with the fishermen spurius is very outgoing his mother explained he swam farther and farther away quintus fabius continued until his friends lost sight of him for a while and began to worry then one of them saw spurius on board what they had all thought to be a fishing vessel though it was larger than the rest it took them a moment to realize that the vessel had set sail and was departing the boys tried to follow in the skiff but none of them has any real skill at sailing before they knew it the boat had disappeared and spurius with it eventually the boys returned to the villa at baiae they all thought that spurius would turn up sooner or later but he never did days passed without a word imagine our worry said valeria we sent frantic messages to our foreman at the villa he made inquiries of fishermen all around the bay trying to find anyone who could explain what had happened and identify the men who had sailed off with spurius but his investigations led nowhere quintus fabius sneered the fishermen around neapolis well if youve ever been down there you know the sort descendants of old greek colonists whove never given up their greek ways some of them dont even speak latin as for their personal habits and vices the less said the better such people can hardly be expected to cooperate with finding a young roman patrician abducted by pirates on the contrary i said i should think that fishermen would be the natural enemies of pirates whatever their personal prejudices against the patrician class however that may be my man down in baiae was unable to discover anything said quintus fabius we had no definite knowledge of what had become of spurius until we received his letter a few days ago i looked at the letter again your son calls the pirates cilicians that seems rather farfetched to me why said valeria everyone says theyre the most bloodthirsty people on earth one hears about them making raids everywhere along the coasts from asia all the way to africa and spain true but here on the coast of italy and in the waters around baiae its shocking news ill agree said quintus fabius but what can you expect with the problem of piracy getting worse and worse while the senate does nothing i pursed my lips and doesnt it seem odd to you that these pirates want the ransom brought to ostia just down the tiber from rome thats awfully close who cares about such details said valeria her voice breaking who cares if we have to go all the way to the pillars of hercules or just a few steps to the forum we must go wherever they wish to get spurius safely home i nodded what about the amount the ides is only two days away a hundred thousand sesterces amounts to ten thousand gold pieces can you raise that sum quintus fabius snorted the money is no problem the amount is almost an insult though i have to wonder if the boy is worth even that price he added under his breath valeria glared at him i shall pretend that i never heard you say such a thing quintus and in front of an outsider she glanced at me and quickly lowered her eyes quintus fabius ignored her well gordianus will you take the job i stared at the letter feeling uneasy quintus fabius bridled at my hesitation if its a matter of payment i assure you i can be generous payment is always an issue i acknowledged though considering the yawning gulf in my household coffers and the mood of my creditors i was in no position to decline will i be acting alone of course naturally i intend to send along a company of armed men i raised my hand just as i feared no quintus fabius absolutely not if you entertain a fantasy of taking your son alive by using force i urge you to forget it for the boys safety as well as my own i cannot allow it gordianus i will send armed men to ostia very well but theyll go without me he took a deep breath and stared at me balefully what would you have me do then after the ransom is paid and my son released is there to be no force at hand with which to capture these pirates is capturing them your intent its one use for armed men i bit my lip and slowly shook my head i was warned that you were a bargainer he growled very well consider this if you successfully arrange the release of my son and afterward my men are able to retrieve the ransom i shall reward you with onetwentieth of what they recover over and above your fee the jangling of coins rang like sweet music in my imagination i cleared my throat and calculated in my head onetwentieth of a hundred thousand sesterces was five thousand sesterces or five hundred gold pieces i said the figure aloud to be sure there was no misunderstanding quintus fabius slowly nodded five hundred pieces of gold would pay my debts repair the roof on my house buy a new slave to be my bodyguard a necessity i had gone without for too long and give me something left over on the other hand there was a bad smell about the whole affair in the end for a generous fee plus the prospect of five hundred pieces of gold i decided i could hold my nose before i left the house i asked if there was a picture of the kidnapped boy that i could see quintus fabius withdrew leaving me in his wifes charge valeria wiped her eyes and managed a weak smile as she showed me into another room a woman artist named iaia painted the family just last year when we were down at baiae on holiday she smiled obviously proud of the likenesses the group portrait was done in encaustic wax on wood quintus fabius stood on the left looking stern valeria smiled sweetly on the right between them was a strikingly handsome hazelhaired young man with lively blue eyes who was unmistakably her son the portrait stopped at his shoulders but showed that he was wearing a manly toga the portrait was done to celebrate your sons coming of age yes almost as beautiful as his mother i said stating the matter as fact not flattery people often remark at the resemblance i suppose he might have a bit of his father about the mouth she shook her head spurius and my husband are not related by blood no my first husband died in the civil war when quintus married me he adopted spurius and made him his heir spurius is his stepson then axe there other children in the household only spurius quintus wanted more children but it never happened she shrugged uneasily but he loves spurius as he would his own flesh im sure of it though he doesnt always show it its true theyve had their differences but what father and son dont always fighting about money spurius can be extravagant ill admit and the fabu are famous for stinginess but the harsh words you heard my husband utter earlierpay them no attention this terrible ordeal has put us both on edge valeria turned back to the portrait of her son and smiled sadly her lips trembling my little caesar she whispered caesar oh you know whom i meanmariuss nephew the one who was captured by pirates last winter and got away oh spurius loved hearing that story young caesar became his idol whenever he saw him in the forum he would come home all breathless and say mater do you know whom i saw today i would laugh knowing it could only be caesar to make him so excited her lips trembled and now by some jest of the gods spurius himself has been captured by pirates so i call him my little caesar knowing how brave he must be and i pray for the best i left the next day for ostia accompanied by the armed force which quintus fabius had hired and outfitted for the occasion the band was made up of army veterans and freed gladiators men with no prospects who were willing to kill or risk being killed for a modest wage there were fifty of us in all jammed together in a narrow boat sailing down the tiber the men took turns rowing sang old army songs and bragged about their exploits on the battlefield or in the arena if one were to believe all their boasting taken together they had slaughtered the equivalent of several cities the size of rome their leader was an old sullan centurion named marcus who had an ugly scar that ran from his right cheekbone down to his chin cutting through both lips perhaps the old wound made it painful for him to speak he could hardly have been more tightlipped when i tried to discover what sort of orders quintus fabius had given him marcus made it clear at once that i would learn no more and no less than he cared to tell me which for the moment was nothing i was an outsider among these men they looked away when i passed whenever i did manage to engage one of them in conversation the man quickly found something more important to do and in short order i found myself talking to empty air but there was one among their number who took a liking to me his name was belbo to some degree he was ostracized by the others as well for he was not a free man but a slave owned by quintus fabius he had been sent along to fill out the ranks on account of his great size and strength a previous owner had trained him as a gladiator but quintus fabius used him in his stables the hair on belbos head was like straw while the hair on his chin and chest was a mixture of red and yellow he was by far the largest man in the company the others joked that if he moved too quickly from one side of the boat to the other he was likely to capsize us i expected that nothing would come of questioning him but soon discovered that belbo knew more than i thought he confirmed that young spurius was not on the best of terms with his stepfather theres always been a grudge between them the mistress loves the boy and the boy loves his mother but the master has a hard spot for spurius which is odd because the boy is actually more like his stepfather in most ways even if he is adopted really he looks just like his mother yes and sounds and moves like her too but thats all a kind of mask if you ask me like warm sunlight sparkling on cold water underneath hes as stern as the master and just as willful ask any of the slaves whove made the mistake of displeasing him perhaps thats the trouble between them i suggested that theyre too much alike and vie for the attentions of the same woman we reached ostia where the boat was moored on a short pier that jutted into the tiber farther down the riverfront at the end of the docks i could just glimpse the open sea gulls circled overhead the smell of salt water scented the breeze the strongest of the men unloaded the chests containing the ten thousand pieces of gold and loaded them into a wagon which was wheeled into a warehouse on the docks about half the men were sent to stand guard over it i expected the rest of the men to head for the nearest tavern but marcus kept order and made them stay on the boat their celebration would come the next day after the ransom and whatever else resulted as for me i intended to seek lodgings at the flying fish the tavern mentioned in spuriuss letter i told marcus i wanted to take belbo with me no the slave stays here he said i need him for a bodyguard quintus fabius said nothing about that you mustnt attract attention ill be more conspicuous without a bodyguard marcus considered this for a moment then agreed good someone called as belbo stepped onto the dock the giant takes up the room of three men at this belbo laughed goodnaturedly perceiving no insult i found the flying fish on the seaside waterfront where the larger seafaring vessels pitched anchor the building had a tavern with a stable attached on the ground floor and tiny cubicles for rent on the second floor i took a room treated myself and belbo to a delicious meal of stewed fish and mussels then took a long walk around the town to reacquaint myself with the streets it had been a while since id spent any time in ostia as the sun sank beneath the waves setting the horizon aflame i rested on the waterfront making idle conversation with belbo and looking at the various small ships along the dock and the larger ones moored farther out in the deeper water most were trading vessels and fishing boats but among them was a warship painted crimson and bristling with oars the enormous bronze rams head at its prow glittered bloodred in the slanting sunlight belbo and i passed a skin of watered wine back and forth which kept his tongue loose eventually i asked him what orders his master had given to the centurion marcus regarding the armed company his answer was blunt were to kill the pirates as simple as that well were not to kill the boy in the process of course but the pirates are not to escape alive if we can help it youre not to capture them for sentencing by a roman magistrate no were supposed to kill them on the spot every one of them i nodded gravely can you do that belbo if you have to kill a man he shrugged im not like some of the others on the boat i havent killed hundreds and hundreds of men i suspect most of the men on the boat were exaggerating really still i wasnt a gladiator for long i didnt kill all that many men no no only he wrinkled his brow calculating only twenty or thirty the next morning i rose early and put on a red tunic as the ransom letter had specified before i went downstairs to the tavern i told belbo to find a place in front of the building where he could watch the entrance if i leave follow me but keep your distance do you think you can do that without being noticed he nodded i looked at his strawcolored hair and his hulking physique and was dubious as the day warmed the tavern keeper rolled up the screens which opened the room to the fresh air and sunlight the waterfront grew busy i sat patiently just inside the tavern and watched sailors and merchants pass by some distance away belbo had found a discreet shady spot to keep watch leaning against a little shed the bovine expression on his face and the fact that he seemed hardly able to keep his eyes open made him look like an idler eluding his master for as long as he could and trying to steal a few moments of sleep the deception was either remarkably convincing or else belbo was as dull as he looked i didnt have long to wait a young man who looked hardly old enough to have grown his beard stepped into the tavern blinked at the sudden dimness then saw my tunic and approached me who sent you he asked his accent sounded greek to me not cilician quintus fabius he nodded then studied me for a moment while i studied him his long black hair and shaggy beard framed a lean face that was accustomed to sun and wind there was a hint of wildness in his wide green eyes there were no scars visible on his face or his darkly tanned limbs as one might expect to see on a battlehardened pirate nor did he have the look of desperate cruelty common to such men my name is gordianus i said and what shall i call you he seemed surprised at being asked for a name then finally said cleon in a tone which suggested he would have given a false name but couldnt think of one the name was greek like his features i looked at him dubiously were here for the same purpose are we not for the ransom he said lowering his voice where is it where is the boy hes perfectly safe ill have to be sure of that he nodded i can take you to him now if you wish i do follow me we left the tavern and walked along the waterfront for a while then turned onto a narrow street that ran between two rows of warehouses cleon walked quickly and began to turn abruptly at each intersection changing our course and sometimes doubling back the way we had come i kept expecting to walk into belbo but he was nowhere to be seen either he was unexpectedly skilled at secret pursuit or else we had eluded him we drew alongside a wagon the bed of which was covered with a heavy sail cloth looking around nervously cleon shoved me toward the wagon and told me to crawl under the cloth the driver of the wagon set the horses into motion from where i was lying i could see nothing the wagon took so many turns that i lost count and finally gave up trying to keep track of our direction the wagon at last came to a stop hinges creaked the wagon pulled forward a bit doors slammed shut even before the cloth was thrown back i knew from the smells of hay and dung that we must be in a stable i could smell the sea as well we had not gone too far inland i sat up and looked around the tall space was lit by only a few stray beams of sunlight which entered through knotholes in the walls i glanced toward the driver who turned his face away cleon gripped my arm you wanted to see the boy i stepped down from the wagon and followed him we stopped before one of the stalls at our approach a figure in a dark tunic rose from the hay even in the dim light i recognized him from his portrait in the flesh young spurius looked even more like valeria but where her skin had been milky white his was deeply browned by the sun which caused his eyes and teeth to sparkle like alabaster and while his mother had worn an expression of anxious melancholy spurius looked sarcastically amused in the portrait he had shown some baby fat which could stand melting away he was leaner now and it suited him as for suffering he did not have the haunted look of a youth who had been tortured he looked like a young man who had been on an extended holiday his manner however was businesslike what took you so long he snapped cleon looked at him sheepishly and shrugged if the boy meant to imitate caesars bravado perhaps he had succeeded spurius looked at me skeptically who are you my name is gordianus your father sent me to ransom you did he come himself i hesitated no i finally said nodding cautiously toward the pirate and trying to communicate to spurius that in the presence of his captors we should discuss no more details than were necessary you brought the ransom its waiting elsewhere i wanted to have a look at you first good well hand the money over to these barbarians and get me out of here im bored to death of consorting with rabble im ready to get back to rome and some good conversation not to mention some decent cooking he crossed his arms well go on the pirates are all around us just out of sight dont doubt that theyll gladly kill us both if you give them any excuse bloodthirsty beasts youve seen im alive and well once they have the ransom theyll let me go so off with you both hurry up i returned to the wagon cleon covered me with the cloth i heard the stable door open the wagon began to roll again we turned and turned until at last the vehicle came to a stop cleon pulled back the cloth i rubbed my eyes at the sudden brightness and stepped onto the street we were back where we had started on the waterfront only a short distance from the flying fish as we walked toward the tavern my heart fell to see belbo in the very spot where i had last seen him leaning against the shed across from the tavernwith his mouth slightly open and his eyes shut was it possible that he hadnt followed us at all but had dozed through the whole episode standing upright ill leave you now said cleon where shall i collect the ransom i described to him the location of the warehouse on the tiber he would bring his wagon and some men once the gold was loaded i would go with them alone and when they were safely away they would deliver spurius into my custody what assurance do i have that the boy will be released or for that matter that ill be released its the ransom we want not you and not the boy his voice broke oddly in an hours time then he turned and vanished into the crowd i waited for a moment then spun around intending to march up to belbo and at the very least kick his shins instead i collided headlong with a large immovable objectbelbo himself as i tumbled backward belbo caught me and righted me handling me as if i were a child i thought you were asleep i said he laughed pretty good at playing dead arent i that trick saved my life in the arena once the other gladiator thought id fainted from fear the fool put his foot on my chest and smiled up at his patronand the next thing he knew he was tasting dirt and had my sword at his throat fascinating well did you follow us or not belbo hung his head i followed yes but i lost you early on did you at least see when i got into the wagon no numas balls then we have no idea where the boy is being kept theres nothing to do but wait for cleon to come for the ransom i stared at the uncaring sea and the wheeling gulls above our heads tell me belbo why do the circumstances of this kidnapping have such an odd smell do they i smell something fishy we are on the waterfront said belbo i clapped my hands a ray of light descends from the heavens to pierce the fog he stared at the clear sky above and wrinkled his brow i mean belbo that i suddenly perceive the truth i think but i still had a very very bad feeling about the situation do you understand its absolutely essential that you and your men make no attempt to follow when cleon carts off the gold the centurion marcus looked at me skeptically and you with it whats to keep you from running off with these pirates and the gold quintus fabius entrusted me with handling the ransom that should be enough for you and he entrusted me with certain instructions as well marcus crossed his brawny arms which bristled with black and silver hairs look here marcus i think i know these mens intentions if im right the boy is perfectly safe marcus snorted ha honor among pirates perfectly safe i continued as long as the ransom proceeds exactly as they wish and also if im right youll be able to retrieve the ransom easily enough afterward if you attempt to follow or foil the transaction as it happens then its you wholl be putting the boys life at risk along with my own marcus chewed his cheeks and wrinkled his nose if you dont do as i ask i went on and something happens to the boy consider how quintus fabius will react well cleon and his men will be here any moment what do you say marcus muttered what i took to be his assent then turned as one of his gladiators trotted up to us four men and a wagon sir coming this way marcus raised his arm his men disappeared into the shadows of the warehouse there was a tap on my shoulder what about me asked belbo shall i try to follow again like i did this morning i shook my head and looked nervously at the open door of the warehouse but youll be in danger said belbo a man needs a bodyguard make the pirates take both of us hush belbo go hide with the others now i pushed him with both hands and realized i would probably have better luck pushing over a yew tree at last he gave way and lumbered off looking unhappy a moment later cleon appeared at the open door followed by the wagon with its driver and two other young men like cleon they looked greek to me i showed him the chests of gold and opened the lid of each one in turn even in the dim light the glitter seemed to dazzle him he grinned and looked a little embarrassed so much i wondered what it would look like but i couldnt picture it i kept trying to imagine ten thousand golden minnows he shook his head as if to clear it and set to work with his companions loading the heavy chests into the wagon a group of bloodthirsty pirates might be expected to dance a gleeful jig at the proximity of so much booty but they went about their work in a somber almost fretful manner the labor done cleon wiped a trickle of sweat from his brow and indicated a long narrow space between the trunks in the bed of the wagon room enough for you to lie down i think he looked uneasily into the shadows of the warehouse and raised his voice and ill say it again no one had better follow us we have watchers posted along the way theyll know if anyone comes after us if anything happens to arouse our suspicions anything at all i cant be responsible for the outcome understood he posed the question to the empty air as much as to me understood i said as i stepped into the wagon i gripped his forearm to steady myself and spoke in his ear so the others couldnt hear cleon you wouldnt really hurt the boy would you he gave me a strangely plaintive look like a man long misunderstood who suddenly finds a sympathetic ear then he hardened his face and swallowed he wont be hurt as long as nothing goes wrong he said hoarsely i settled myself in the gap between the trunks the sail cloth was thrown over the wagon bed the wagon lurched into motion moving ponderously under its heavy load from this point i thought there was no reason for anything to go wrong with the ransoming marcus had agreed not to follow cleon had the gold soon i would have spurius even if my assumption about the kidnapping was wrong there would be no reason for his captors to harm the boy or myself our deaths could profit them nothing as long as nothing went wrong perhaps it was the cramped suffocating darkness that set my thoughts spinning into the awful void i had taken marcuss muttering as an agreement to postpone his pursuit but had i read him rightly his men might be following us even now clumsily showing themselves alerting the watchers and sending them into a panic someone would cry out there would be an assault on the wagon swords would clash and clang a blade would rip through the sail cloth heading straight for my heart the fantasy seemed so real that i gave a jerk as if waking from a nightmare but my eyes were wide open i took a breath to steady myself but found my thoughts spinning even more recklessly out of control what if i had completely misjudged cleon what if his soulful green eyes and uncertain manner were a crafty deception a deliberate disguise for a hardened killer the petulant beautiful boy i had seen that morning might already be dead his bravado cut short along with his throat the wagon would return to the stable where they had murdered him and as soon as the pirates were sure that no one had followed they would pull me from the wagon stuff a gag into my mouth tie me up and lug me off to their ship laughing raucously and dancing the jig they had suppressed while they loaded their booty cilician pirates the crudest men ever born i would be taken off to sea kicking and screaming into my gag by the light of the moon they would set my clothes afire and use me for a torch and when they were tired of hearing me scream they would toss me overboard i could almost smell the stench of my own burning flesh hear the hiss of the flames expiring as the hard water burst open and then slapped shut above me taste the stinging salt in my nostrils what would be left after the fishes made a feast of me in the cramped space i managed to wipe my sweaty forehead on a bit of my red tunic such morbid fantasies were nonsense i told myself i had to trust my own judgment and my judgment decreed that cleon was not the sort of fellow who could murder anyone at least not in cold blood not even roscius the actor could mime such innocence a strange sort of pirate indeed then a new fear struck me more chilling than all the rest belbo had said that quintus fabius wanted the pirates to be slaughtered were not to kill the boy in the process of coursebut was he only inferring this he could hardly be expected to know every secret order that his master had given to marcus spurius was not of his own blood quintus fabius spoke of him with contempt what if he actually wanted his stepson dead he had sent the ransom yes but he could hardly have refused to do that if only to placate valeria and to save face in public but if in the end the boy were to be murdered by the pirates or if it could be made to look that way it was even possible that quintus fabius himself had arranged to have his stepson kidnappeda clever way to get rid of spurius without drawing suspicion to himself the idea was monstrous but i had known men devious enough to concoct such a scheme but if that were the case why had he engaged my services to demonstrate his conscientious concern by calling in an outsider perhaps to prove to valeria and the rest of the world that he was quite serious about rescuing his kidnapped stepson in which case part of his plan for getting rid of spurius would have to include the unfortunate death of the finder sent to handle the tragically botched ransom the journey seemed to go on forever the road became rockier and rougher the wagon rattled and lurched my extravagant fantasies of treachery and death suddenly paled beside the imminent danger of being crushed if one of the heavy trunks should be pitched onto me by hercules the wagon bed was hot by the time the wheels ground to a halt my tunic was as soaked as if i had taken a dip in the sea the sail cloth was thrown back i was chilled by a salty breeze i had expected that we would return to the stable where i had seen spurius instead we were on a strip of sandy beach beneath low hills somewhere outside the city the tiny cove terminated in boulders at both ends a small relay boat was drawn up in the shallows a larger vessel was anchored out in the deeper water i sprang from the wagon glad to breathe fresh air again cleon and his three companions hurriedly began to move the trunks from the wagon into the relay boat damned heavy grunted one of them well never be able to move it all in one trip itll take at least two wheres the boy i demanded grabbing cleons arm here i am i turned and saw spurius approaching from a group of sheltering boulders at the end of the little beach in the heat of the day he had stripped off his tunic and was wearing only a loincloth it was all he usually wore if he wore even that his lean chiseled torso and long limbs were deeply and evenly bronzed by the sun i looked at cleon his brows were drawn together as if he had pricked his finger he stared at the boy and swallowed hard its about time spurius crossed his arms and glared at me petulance made him even more beautiful perhaps youd like to put on your tunic i suggested and well be on our way if youll point the way to ostia cleon well begin walking unless you intend to leave us the wagon cleon stood dumbly spurius stepped between us and drew me aside did anyone follow the wagon he whispered i dont think so are you certain i cant be absolutely certain i glanced at cleon who appeared not to be listening the little relay boat was heading out to the larger ship with its first load riding low in the water under the weight of the gold well did pater send along a troop of armed guards or not answer me spurius spoke to me as if i were a slave young man i said sternly my duty at this moment is to your mother and father my stepfather spurius wrinkled his nose and spat out the word as if it were an expletive my job is to see that you get home alive until were safely back in ostia keep your mouth shut he was shocked into silence for a moment then gave me a withering look well anyway he said raising his voice theres no way these fellows will release me until all the gold is loaded onto the ship correct cleon what oh yes said cleon the sea breeze whipped his long black hair about his face he blinked back tears as if the salt stung his eyes spurius gripped my arm and led me farther away now listen he growled did that miserly pater of mine send along an armed force or not or did he send you alone ive already asked you to keep quiet and im ordering you to give me an answer unless you want me to make a very unsatisfactory report about you to my parents why did spurius insist on knowing and why now it seemed to me that my suspicions about the kidnapping were confirmed if there was no armed force then spurius might as well stay with his socalled captors if only to stay close to the gold or his portion of it perhaps his stepfather could be had for a second ransom but if an armed force was waiting to act then it would be best for him to be rescued by me now to allow the fishermenfor surely these neapolitan greeks were anything but piratesto make their escape immediately along with the gold lets suppose there is an armed force i said in that case your friends had better get out of here at once lets suppose they get clean away how will you get your share of the gold then spurius stared at me blankly then flashed such a charming smile that i could almost understand why cleon was so hopelessly smitten with the boy its not as if i dont know where they live down on the bay they wouldnt dare try to cheat me i could always denounce them and have every one of them crucified theyll keep my share safe for me until im ready to claim it what sort of bargain did you strike with them ninetenths of the gold for you onetenth for them he smiled as if caught at doing something wicked but clever not quite that generous actually how did you find these pirates i jumped in the bay at neapolis and swam from boat to bat until i found the right crew it didnt take long to realize that cleon would do anything for me then the idea for this escapade was entirely your own of course do you think a halfwitted fisherman could come up with such a scheme these fellows were born to be led they were like fish in my net they worship mecleon does anywayand why not i scowled while youve been romping naked in the sun enjoying your holiday with your admirers your mother has been desperate with worry does that mean nothing to you he crossed his arms and glared a little worry wont kill her its her fault anyway she could have made the old miser give me more money if shed had the nerve to stand up to him but she wouldnt so i had to come up with my own scheme to get pater to cough up a bit of whats rightfully mine anyway and what about these fishermen youve put them all in terrible danger they know the risks they also know how much they stand to profit and cleon i looked over my shoulder and caught him staring doeeyed at spurius the poor fellow is heartsick what did you do to make him that way nothing to embarrass pater if thats what youre getting at nothing that pater hasnt done himself with the prettier boy slaves from time to time i know my place and whats proper for a man of my station we take pleasure we dont give it not like caesar playing boywife to nicomedes venus played a joke on poor cleon making him fall in love with me it suited my purposes well enough but i shall be glad to be rid of him all that attention is cloying id rather be waited on by a slave instead of pursued by a suitor you can get rid of a slave just by clapping your hands cleon could be hurt before this is over he might even be killed if something goes wrong spurius raised his eyebrows and looked beyond me at the low hills then there is an armed guard it was a stupid scheme spurius did you really think it would work it will work no unfortunately for you young man i have a vested interest not only in rescuing you but in recovering the ransom as well a portion of that gold will be mine challenging him outright was a mistake he might have offered to buy my silence but spurius was even more miserly than his stepfather he waved to cleon who came running is all the gold loaded this is the last trip said cleon the words seemed to catch in his throat the relay boat is loaded and ready im going with them and you are you coming with us spurius spurius scanned the hills above the beach im still not sure but one things for certainthis man will have to be silenced cleon stared plaintively at spurius then glanced uneasily at me well said the boy you have a knife cleon and he doesnt it should be simple go ahead and do it or do i need to summon another of the men from the relay boat cleon looked miserable well do it cleon you told me you once killed a man in a brawl in some ratinfested tavern down in pompeu thats one of the reasons i chose you to help me you always knew it might come to this cleon swallowed hard and reached to the scabbard that hung from his belt he pulled out a jaggededged knife of the sort fishermen use to gut and clean their catch cleon i said i know everything the boy is simply using you you must know that your affection is wasted on him put down the knife well think of some way to rectify what youve done spurius laughed and shook his head cleon may be a fool but hes not an idiot the die is cast he has no choice but to follow through and that means getting rid of you gordianus cleon groaned he kept his eyes on me but spoke to spurius that day on the bay when you swam up to our boat and climbed aboard the moment i laid eyes on you i knew youd bring me nothing but trouble your mad ideas you seemed to like my ideas well enough especially when i mentioned the gold forget the gold it was the others who cared about that i only wanted yes cleon i know what you really want spurius rolled his eyes and i promise one of these days ill let you but right now spurius waved his hands impatiently pretend hes a fish gut him once thats done well climb into the relay boat and be off with the gold back to neapolis youre coming with us of course but not until this one is silenced he knows too much hell give us all away cleon stepped closer i considered fleeing but thought better of it cleon had to be more used to running on sand than i was and i couldnt stand the idea of that jagged knife in my back i considered facing him headon we were about the same size and i probably had more experience at fighting hand to hand but that didnt count for much as long as he had a knife and i didnt my only advantage was that he was acting without conviction there was heartsickness in his voice whenever he talked to spurius but also a tinge of resentment if i could play on that perhaps i could stave him off i tried to think of a way to exploit his frustration to turn him against the boy or at least keep him confused but before i could speak i saw the change in cleons face he made his decision quite literally in the twinkling of an eye for the briefest instant i thought he might lunge at spurius like a cur turning on its master how would i ever explain to valeria that i stood by helplessly while her darling son was stabbed to death before my eyes but that was a wishful fantasy cleon didnt lunge at spurius he lunged at me we grappled i felt a sudden burning sensation run down my right arm more as if i had been lashed by a whip than cut by a blade but a cut it must have beenas the world spun dizzily around us i glimpsed a patch of sand spattered with blood we tumbled onto the ground i tasted gritty sand between my teeth i felt the heat and smelled the sweat of cleons body he had been working hard loading the gold into the relay boat he was already tired that was a good thing for me i had just enough strength to fend him off until a figure came running from the boulders at the end of the beach one instant cleon was atop me crushing the strength from my arms bringing his blade closer and closer to my throat the next moment it seemed that a god had snatched him by the back of his tunic and sent him soaring skyward in fact it was belbo who plucked him off me lifted him into the air and then slammed him to the ground only the lenient sand prevented him from being broken in two he managed to hold on to his knife but a sideways kick from belbo sent it flying through the air belbo dropped to his knees onto cleons chest knocking the breath out of him and raised his fist like a hammer no belbo dont youll kill him i cried belbo turned his head and gave me a quizzical frown cleon flailed like a fish beneath the weight on his chest meanwhile cleons three friends clambered out of the relay boat so long as it was cleon against me they had stayed where they were but now that cleon was down and outnumbered they came to his rescue drawing their knives as they ran i got to my feet and ran after cleons knife i picked it up feeling queasy at the sight of my own blood on the jagged blade belbo was back on his feet his own dagger drawn cleon remained flat on his back gasping for breath so i thought three against two all parties armed i had a giant on my side but my right arm was wounded did that make the odds even apparently not for the fishermen suddenly stopped in their tracks bumped against one another in confusion then ran back to their boat calling for cleon to follow i basked for a moment in the illusion that i had frightened them off with a little help from belbo of course then realized that before they turned and ran they had been looking at something above and beyond me i turned around sure enough marcus and his men had appeared atop the low hills and were running toward the beach with swords drawn back in the relay boat two of the fishermen scrambled for their oars while the third leaned toward the beach crying for cleon to join them cleon had managed to get to his hands and knees but couldnt seem to stand upright i looked at marcus and his men then at the fishermen in the boat then at spurius who stood not far from cleon with his arms crossed scowling as if he were watching a dismally unfunny comedy for the love of hercules spurius why dont you at least help him to his feet i cried then ran to do it myself cleon staggered up and i pushed him in the direction of the boat run i said run unless you want to be a dead man he did as i told him and went splashing into the surf then he suddenly stopped the relay boat was pulling away but he turned and stared at spurius who gave him a sardonic stare in return run i screamed run you fool the men in the boat called to him as well even as they began to row rapidly away but as long as spurius met his gaze cleon remained frozen struggling to stand upright in the waves his face a mask of misery i ran to spurius put my hands on his shoulders and spun him around get your hands off me he snarled but the spell was broken cleon seemed to wake his face hardened he turned and plunged into the waves swimming after the relay boat i dropped onto the sand clutching my bleeding arm a moment later marcus and his men arrived on the beach brandishing their swords marcus satisfied himself that spurius was unharmed then turned his wrath on me you let one of them escape i saw you help the man to his feet i heard you telling him to run shut up marcus you dont understand i understand that theyre getting away too far out now for us to swim after them damn just as well well let them reach the bigger ship and then the crimson ram can take care of the lot of them before i could puzzle out what he meant belbo let out a cry and pointed toward the water cleon had finally reached the relay boat his friends were pulling him aboard but something was wrong the heavyladen boat began to tip the experienced fishermen should have been able to right it but they must have panicked all at once the relay boat was upside down marcus snarled spurius yelped together they cried the gold farther out the fishermen on the larger ship were scrambling to set sail they seemed awfully quick to abandon their friends i thought then saw the reason for their hurry they had been able to see the approach of the warship before those of us on the beach could see it it was the crimson warship i had seen anchored in the water off ostia the bristling oars sliced into the water in unison the bronze rams head butted the spuming waves the crimson ram marcus had called her as soon as she came into sight around the bend of the cove marcus gave a signal to one of his men back on the hill who began to wave a red capea signal that spurius had been rescued and the action against the pirates could commence it seems impossible that what came to pass was intended by anyone but then that might describe everything about the whole disastrous affair surely the crimson ram meant to outflank the fishing vessel and board her to recover the gold a warship should have been able to achieve such a capture with ease but there was no accounting for the actions of the hapless fishermen just as their fellows in the relay boat had panicked so did they when the crimson ram moved to draw alongside the fishing vessel seemed to turn as if intent on deliberate selfdestruction like a gladiator impaling himself on an enemys sword and offered her starboard flank to the massive bronze rams head we heard the distant impact the splintering of wood the cries of the fishermen the sail collapsed the fishing boat convulsed and folded in on itself the vessel vanished into the rolling sea almost before i could comprehend the horror of it by the gods muttered belbo the gold snarled marcus all that gold sighed spurius the men from the capsized relay boat had set out swimming for their ship now they floundered in the water trapped between the crimson ram and marcuss men on shore theyll have to head in eventually marcus muttered along with any survivors from the other ship well ring the cove and strike them down one by one as they crawl from the water men listen up no marcus i clutched my arm and staggered to my feet you cant kill them the kidnapping was a hoax a hoax was it and the lost goldi suppose that was only an illusion but those men arent pirates theyre simple fishermen spurius put them up to the whole thing they acted on his orders they defrauded quintus fabius they dont deserve to die thats not for you to say stay out of this finder no i ran into the surf the scattered fishermen struggled in the waves too far out for me to tell which was cleon stay back i screamed theyll kill you as you come ashore something struck the back of my head sea and sky merged into a solid white light that flared and then winked into darkness i awoke with a throbbing headache and a dull pain in my right arm i reached up to find that my head was bandaged so was my arm awake at last belbo leaned over me with a look of relief i was beginning to think cleon and the others shhhh lean back youll set your arm to bleeding again i should know i learned a thing or two about wounds when i was a gladiator hungry thats the best thing to eat puts the fire back in your blood hungry yes and thirsty well youre in the right place for both here at the flying fish theyve got everything a stomach needs i looked around the little room my head was beginning to clear wheres spurius and marcus gone back to rome with the rest yesterday marcus wanted me to go too but i wouldnt someone had to stay with you the master will understand i cautiously touched the back of my head through the bandages someone hit me belbo nodded marcus belbo shook his head spurius with a rock he would have hit you again after you were down but i stopped him then i stood over you to make sure he didnt do it again the vicious little it made sense of course his scheme foiled the best spurius could hope for was to silence everyone who knew about his plot including me cleon and the rest belbo lowered his eyes the soldiers did as marcus ordered but they cant have killed them all it was horrible to watch seeing men die in the arena is bad enough but at least theres some sport when its two armed men both trained to fight but the sight of those poor fellows coming out of the water worn out and gasping for breath pleading for mercy and marcuss men slaughtering them one after another what about cleon him too so far as i know kill every one of them was what marcus said and his men did just that spurius helped pointing and yelling whenever he saw one of them about to come ashore they killed the pirates one by one and threw their bodies back into the sea i pictured the spectacle and my head began to throb they werent pirates belbo there never were any pirates suddenly the room became blurry it wasnt from the blow to my head it was only the tears welling up in my eyes a few days later i was back at the senian baths lying naked on a bench while one of lucius claudiuss slaves massaged me my battered body needed pampering my bruised conscience needed the release of pouring the whole sordid tale into luciuss spongelike ear appalling he finally muttered youre very lucky to be alive i should think and when you got back to rome did you call on quintus fabius of course to collect the balance of my fee not to mention your share of the gold i should think i winced and not from the massage that was something of a sore point as quintus fabius pointed out i was to be paid onetwentieth of whatever portion of the gold was actually recovered since the ransom was lost he cheated you on a technicality how typical of the fabu but surely some of the gold washed up on the shore didnt they go diving for it they did and marcuss men recovered a little but only a tiny fraction my share hardly came to a handful of gold only that after all your labor and after putting yourself in so much danger quintus fabius must be as miserly as his stepson claims i suppose you told him the truth about the kidnapping yes unfortunately the very men who could back me up the fishermenare dead and spurius continues to blithely insist that he was kidnapped by pirates the baldfaced young liar surely quintus fabius knows better than to believe him publicly at least he accepts his stepsons version of the story but thats only to save himself the embarrassment of a scandal i think he probably suspected the truth all along i think thats the real reason he hired me to find out for certain and thats why he ordered marcus to kill his stepsons accomplices on the spot to keep the truth from getting out oh yes he knows what really happened he must detest spurius more than ever and the enmity is mutual ah the type of family bitterness that so often ends in murder i said daring to utter the unlucky word aloud i wouldnt care to wager which will outlive the other and the boys mother valeria her son subjected her to agonizing worry just to satisfy his greed i thought she had a right to know that but when i tried to tell her she suddenly seemed to go deaf if she heard a word i said she didnt show it when i was done she politely thanked me for rescuing her son from those awful pirates then dismissed me lucius shook his head but i did get something i wanted from quintus fabius yes since he refused to give me a full share of the ransom i insisted that he give me something else he owned a possession he clearly undervalued ah yes your new bodyguard lucius glanced at belbo who stood across the room with folded arms sternly guarding the niche that held my clothing as if it contained a senators ransom the fellow is a treasure the fellow saved my life on that beach outside ostia it may not be the last time every now and again business takes me south to the vicinity of neapolis and the bay i always make a point of visiting the waterfront where the fishermen congregate i ask in greek if any of them knows of a young man named cleon alas the neapolitans are a closelipped suspicious bunch not one of them has ever admitted to knowing a fisherman by that name though surely someone in neapolis must have known him i scan the faces on the fishing boats on the chance that i might see him for no good reason i have convinced myself that he somehow eluded marcuss men on that fateful day and made his way home once i was almost certain that i did get a glimpse of him the man was cleanshaven not bearded but his eyes were cleons eyes i called out from the dock but the boat slipped by before i could get a better look i was never able to confirm whether it was cleon i saw or not perhaps it was a relative or merely a man who resembled him i didnt pursue the matter as fully as i might have perhaps afraid that the truth would disappoint me i prefer to believe that it was cleon after all proof or no proof could there be two men in the world with the same soulful green eyes the disappearance of the saturnalia silver gambling in the forum really gordianus who can countenance such behavior cicero sniffed turning his nose up at the nearby circle of men busy casting dice on the paving stones but cicero it is saturnalia i said wearily eco and i had run into him on our way to the house of lucius claudius and cicero had insisted that we walk with him he was in a testy mood and i couldnt imagine why he wanted our company unless it was simply to swell the ranks of his little retinue of secretaries and hangerson as he walked through the forum a roman politician can never be seen with too large an entourage even if its members include a citizen of dubious respectability like myself and a thirteenyearold mute the clatter of dice was followed by squeals of glee and moans of defeat then the jingling of coins changing hands yes saturnalia sighed cicero by tradition the city commissioners must allow such behavior in public during the midwinter festival and roman traditions are always to be revered still it pains me to see such demeaning activity in the very heart of the city i shrugged men gamble all the time in the subura yes in the subura he said his polished orators voice dripping disdain for the precinct where i lived but not here in the forum from nowhere a group of drunken revelers appeared and went careening through the midst of ciceros retinue the revelers whirled about making the hems of their loose gowns spin above their knees with their forefingers they raised their felt skullcaps off their heads and spun them in the air making blurs of red blue and green in the midst of the celebrants held aloft in a litter chair was a hunchback dressed like old king numa in a bright yellow gown with a papyrus crown atop his head he nodded tipsily squirting wine into his lips from a wineskin in one hand while waving a gnarled walking stick in the other as if it were a scepter eco delighted by the spectacle opened his mouth in a silent laugh and clapped his hands cicero was not amused surely saturnalia is my least favorite of festivals no matter how wise our ancestors were to establish it he grumbled all this drunken revelry and licentiousness has no place in a sensible society as you see im wearing my toga today as usual no matter what custom decrees for the holiday no loose gown for me thank you men whirling about to show off their naked legs indeed loose clothing leads to loose morals a toga keeps a man all in one piece if you take my meaning he squared his shoulders and shook his elbows slightly making the folds of his toga fell into an orderly pattern then gathered one arm to his chest to keep the folds in place to look respectable in a toga my father used to say a man must have a spine of iron the toga suited cicero well he lowered his voice worst of all are the liberties granted to slaves for the holiday yes i give mine a day of rest and i allow them to speak their minds freely within reason but i draw the line at letting them go carousing through the streets wearing colored felt caps like free men imagine a day when you cant tell whether a stranger in the forum is a citizen or someone elses property the festival is consecrated to saturn but it might as well be chaos and i absolutely refuse to follow the absurd custom of allowing my slaves to wear my clothes and recline upon my dining couch while i serve them dinner but cicero it happens only once a year which is once too often there are those who would say its a good practice to turn things upside down every so oftento let a hunchback be a king and set masters to wait upon their slaves what better time for a bit of whimsy than midwinter when the harvesting is all done ships are safely docked old magistrates are about to be booted out of their offices so that new ones can take their place and the whole republic lets out a collective sigh of relief at having survived yet another year of corruption greed backstabbings and betrayals why shouldnt rome slip into some loose clothing for a few days and uncork a new wineskin you make rome out to be a whore said cicero disapprovingly instead of a scowling politician with a stiff neck i think that rome is both depending on which side one looks at dont forget they say that saturnalia was established by the god janus and janus has two faces cicero harrumphed but im sure you observe at least one of the traditions of saturnalia i said which is the exchange of gifts with friends and family i made this comment with no ulterior motive only to remind him of the finer aspects of the holiday he stared at me gloomily then a smile broke out across his ace as if he suddenly dropped a mask that i do he said and clapped for one of his slaves who brought him a small bag from which he drew a tiny object which he placed in my hand for you gordianus he laughed aloud at the expression of surprise on my face what did you think i made you walk across the forum with me just so i could regale you with my low opinion of the revelry eco drew close to me and together we peered down at the tiny round object which glittered on my open palm beneath the dead white winter sun it seemed to be a simple silver bead flawed by some irregularity but when i held it closer i saw that it was fashioned like a miniature chickpeathe cicer bean from which ciceros family took its name eco let out a noiseless gasp cicero im honored i said from the weight of the little thing it had to be solid silver silver is the substance of choice for saturnalia giftgiving among those who can afford such extravagance im giving my mother a whole necklace of them cicero said proudly i had them made last year in athens during my studies there well i said gesturing to eco to reach inside the pouch he carried i have nothing to match it i fear only this no man goes out during saturnalia without gifts to offer should the need arise and i had given eco a pouch to carry before we went out containing a bundle of wax tapers eco handed me one which i then held out to cicero it was the traditional gift of a poorer man to a man better off and cicero accepted it graciously its of the highest quality i said from a little shop on the street of the candlemakers dyed deep blue and scented with hyacinth though perhaps given your feelings about the holiday you wont be out tonight with the rest of the throng holding up your burning taper to set the forum aglow actually my brother quintus is joining me for a small family celebration tonight im sure well stay in but i often stay up late reading i shall use your gift to light my way when next i ponder a scroll of law the scent will remind me of the sweetness of our friendship hearing such honey from his lips who could doubt that young cicero was well on his way to becoming the bestknown orator in rome eco and i took our leave of cicero and made our way up the palatine hill even here in the citys poshest neighborhood there was open gambling and drunken revelry in the streets the only difference was that the gambling was for higher stakes and the revelers wore gowns made of finer stuff we came to the house of my friend lucius claudius who answered the door himself reduced to a door slave he laughed would you believe i told the slaves to take the whole day off and they took me quite seriously saturn alone knows where they all are or what theyre up to with his red nose and plump cheeks lucius claudius was the very image of benevolence especially with his features suffused as they now were with a beaming and slightly tipsy smile i dont imagine theyll get very far unless they have purses to carry them i said oh but they do i gave each one of them a purse with a few coins and a felt cap well how can they enjoy themselves if they cant join in the gambling i shook my head in mock disdain now i wonder eco what cicero would make of our friend luciuss reckless liberality eco took the cue at once and launched into an uncanny impersonation of cicero drawing his holiday gown about him like a toga throwing back his head and wrinkling his nose lucius laughed so hard he began to cough and his face turned redder than ever at last he caught his breath and wiped tears from his eyes no doubt cicero would say that a slave owner with such a lax disposition is shirking his responsibility to maintain peace and order in societybut ask me if i care come let me show you why im in such a good mood the presents arrived only this morning we followed him through the vestibule through an immaculate garden decorated with a splendid bronze statue of minerva down a long hallway and into a small dark room at the back of the house there was a thumping noise and a stifled curse as lucius banged his knee against some sort of low chest set against one wall light must have light he muttered leaning over the chest and fiddling with the latched shutters of one of the tall narrow windows here master let me do that said a hoarse voice from the darkness eco gave a little jump beside me his eyes are quite keen but even he had not seen the owner of the voice when we entered the room the ability to be invisible is a much soughtafter trait among household slaves and appeared to be one of the skills of luciuss righthand man an ancient whitehaired greek named stephanos who had been in charge of running the house on the palatine for many years he walked with a stifflimbed gait from window to window unlatching the narrow shutters and pulling them open to admit cold air and bright sunshine lucius muttered a word of thanks to the slave who muttered some formula in return but i hardly heard them like eco i stood transfixed by a sudden blaze of silver before our dazzled eyes the sunlight which poured in through the windows was transformed into a white liquid fire that shimmered sparkled and danced i glanced at eco and saw his wondering face lit up by lozenges of reflected light then returned my gaze to the splendor before us the piece of furniture lucius had bumped his knee against was a thighhigh wooden chest in itself it was a marvelous piece of work beautifully crafted and inlaid with bits of shell and obsidian spread across the hinged lid was a bloodred cloth laid out atop the cloth was the most stunning collection of silver objects i had ever seen magnificent arent they said lucius i merely nodded rendered as mute as eco by the display note the ewer said lucius enthusiastically the shape so elegant see how the handle is in the form of a caryatid hiding her face the piece was exquisite as was the silver comb inlaid with camelian alongside a matching silver brush upon the back of which was an image in relief of a satyr spying on some bathing nymphs a necklace of silver and amber was laid beside another of silver and lapis and yet another of silver and ebony and each had a pair of matching earrings and matching bracelets two silver cups were embossed with hunting scenes around the base while another pair of cups were decorated with a geometrical greek design most impressive of all if only for its size was a great silver plate as broad as a mans forearm its border was a circle of embossed acanthus leaves while in the center the spirit of mirth silenus ran riot amid a dizzying array of satyrs fauns and nymphs when lucius looked away for a moment eco pointed to the face of silenus and then nodded toward our host i saw what he meant while all images of silenus might be said to bear a family resemblance to lucius claudius sharing as they do a plump round face atop a plump round body this depiction of silenus was too exactly like lucius to be anything but a portrait you must have had these pieces made especially for you i said yes i commissioned a shop of artisans down on the street of the silversmiths these pieces are proof i think that one can find just as high a quality of workmanship here in rome as among pieces imported from alexandria and elsewhere yes i agreed provided one has the purse to pay for it well it was a bit extravagant lucius admitted but the raw silver comes from spain instead of the east which helps to bring down the price anyway itll be worth the expense to see the look on their faces when my cousins see what im giving them for saturnalia silver is traditionally what one gives of course if one can afford it i muttered but in the past im afraid some of my relatives have proclaimed me a bit of a miser well i have no wife or child so i suppose i have no training in lavishing my wealth on those around me and its sometimes hard to catch the holiday spirit when one is a bachelor but not this yearthis year ive gone all out as you can see you have indeed i agreed thinking that even jaded wealthy patricians like those of the claudian clan would have to be impressed with luciuss generosity lucius stood for a moment gazing upon the various vessels and pieces of jewelry then turned to the slave who lingered close by but stephanos whats this what are you doing skulking about here in the dark on such a splendid day you should be out cavorting with the others cavorting master said the wrinkled slave dryly as if to indicate that the likelihood of his doing such a thing was quite remote well you know what i meanyou should be out enjoying yourself i enjoy myself quite well enough here master well amusing yourself then i assure you im just as capable of amusing myself here as anywhere else said stephanos it seemed dubious that he could be amused under any circumstances very well laughed lucius have it your way stephanos that is after all the point of the holiday lucius paused once again before the chest and lovingly fingered the ewer he had first pointed out and to which he seemed especially attached then he led the way to the atrium and offered each of us a cup of wine much watered in ecos case i said as lucius served us from a simple silver ewer that was brimming with frothy purple wine eco frowned but held out his cup willing to take what he could get from past experience i knew that lucius kept a stock of only the finest vintages and for myself i requested very little water so as to savor the fine bouquet at full strength for a man so used to being waited on lucius did a creditable job of serving us then served himself and sat down to join us considering how hard you work gordianus i suppose you must enjoy the leisure of the holiday immensely actually i often find myself busier on festival days than at other times really crime takes no holidays i said or more accurately crime enjoys the holidays immensely you have no idea how many thefts and murders occur on festival daysnot to mention indiscretions and infidelities i wonder why i shrugged the normal constraints of society are loosened people find themselves more open to temptation and do things they ordinarily wouldnt for all sorts of reasonsgreed spite or simply for a joke families are gathered together whether they like one another or not that can lead to a few heads being bashed and the expense of entertaining can drive even a wealthy man to deeds of desperation as for those already of a criminal disposition consider the advantages to their trade during the festivals when people let down their guard and stupefy themselves with too much food and wine oh yes a roman holiday is an invitation to crime and they are often my busiest days of the year then i count myself lucky to have your company today gordianus said lucius raising his cup at that moment we heard the front door open followed by loud voices from the vestibule and then a pair of young slaves came tripping into the atrium their cheeks were ruddy from the cold almost as red as the felt caps on their heads their eyes were bleary from drinking but they straightened considerably at the sight of their master thropsus zoticus i trust that youre enjoying yourselves called lucius heartily thropsus who was slender and blond suddenly stiffened not sure how to react while his companion who was stocky and dark abruptly sputtered with laughter and ran with a whoop through the atrium toward the back of the house yes master very much master said thropsus finally he shifted from foot to foot as if waiting to be dismissed finally lucius picked up a crust of bread and threw it at the boy go on he laughed thropsus hurried after zoticus looking thoroughly confused we drank in silence for a while enjoying the wine you certainly strive for informality lucius i remarked wryly even when it makes the poor slave a bit uncomfortable thropsus is new in the household he doesnt understand its saturnalia said lucius grandly he had just finished his second cup of wine and was reaching to pour himself another i turned to eco expecting him to wink at me in amusement but instead he seemed distracted and was looking toward the back of the house and will you go so far as to wait upon your slaves at dinner i asked remembering how cicero had balked at performing such a reversal well noafter all gordianus there are so very many of them in the household and only one of me ill already be worn out from visiting with my cousins this afternoon and handing out my presents but i do let the slaves recline upon the dining couches as if they were guests and take turns serving each other while i take my meal in my bedchamber they always seem to enjoy the little charade judging from all the noise they make and you will you play servant to your household slaves at dinner there are only two of them ah yes your bodyguard that lumbering belbo and of course your egyptian concubine the beautiful bethesda what man could refuse to wait upon her lucius sighed and then shivered he has always been smitten with bethesda and more than a little intimidated by her eco and i will be going home to prepare their dinner immediately after we take our leave of you i said and tonight before the people mass in the streets with their lit tapers eco and i will serve the two of them dinner while they recline upon our couches delicious i should come to watch only if youre willing to carry a tray like the other citizens in the house well at that moment from the corner of my eye i saw eco jerk his head toward the back of the house with a sudden birdlike motion his hearing can be quite acute and so it was that he heard the approach of the young slave before lucius or i did a moment later thropsus came running into the atrium with a look of shock and dismay on his face he opened his mouth but well thropsus what is it said lucius wrinkling his fleshy brow something terrible master yes its old stephanos master yes yes spit it out thropsus wrung his hands and made a face please master come see for yourself now what could be so terrible that the slave cant even utter it said lucius making light of the matter as he laboriously rose from his chair come gordianus its probably a matter for you he said laughing but all laughter ceased when we followed young thropsus into the room where lucius had shown us his silver ah the windows were shuttered except one close by the chest by the cold light that entered we surveyed the disaster which had tied thropsuss tongue the red cloth was still thrown over the chest but now it was all askew and every piece of silver had vanished in front of the chest on the floor the old slave stephanos lay unmoving on his side with his arms raised to his chest his forehead was dented with a bloody gash and though his eyes were wide open i had seen enough dead men to know that stephanos had departed from the service of lucius claudius forever by hercules whats happened gasped lucius the silver and stephanos is he eco knelt down to feel for a pulse and put his ear to the dead slaves parted lips he looked up at us and shook his head gravely but whats happened cried lucius thropsus what do you know about this nothing master i came into the room and found it exactly as it is now and then came to you right away and zoticus said lucius darkly where is he i dont know master what do you mean you came in together yes but i had to relieve myself so i went to the privy at the other corner of the house afterward i went looking for zoticus but i couldnt find him well go and find him now blustered lucius thropsus meekly turned to leave no wait i said it seems to me that theres no hurry to find zoticus if indeed hes still in the house i think it might be more interesting to discover why you happened to come into this room at all thropsus i was looking for zoticus as i said he lowered his eyes but why here this is one of your masters private rooms i shouldnt think that anyone is supposed to come in here except a slave of stephanoss rank or perhaps a cleaning girl why were you looking for zoticus here thropsus ii thought i heard a noise what sort of noise thropsus made a pained face i thought i heard someone laughing eco suddenly clapped his hands for our attention and nodded vigorously what are you saying eco that you heard this laughter too he nodded and made a motion with his hands to indicate that from the atrium it had sounded faint and far away the laughter came from this room thropsus i thought so first the laughter and then then a kind of rattling noise and a banging or a thud not very loud i looked at eco who pursed his lips ambivalently and shrugged he too seated in the atrium had heard something from the back of the house but the sound had been indistinct was it zoticus laughing i asked i suppose so said thropsus dubiously come now was it zoticus or not surely youre familiar with his laughteryou were both laughing when you came in from the street a while ago it didnt sound like zoticus but i suppose it must have been unless theres someone else in the house theres no one said lucius im certain of that someone could have come in i said stepping toward the open shutters curiousthis latch seems to have snapped was it broken before i dont think so said lucius whats outside the window a small garden and what surrounds the garden the house on three sides and a wall on the other and on the other side of the wall the street oh dear i see what you mean yes i suppose someone young and agile enough could have scaled the wall and broken into the house could the same wall be scaled from this side as well i suppose even by a man with a bag full of silver over his shoulder gordianus you dont think that zoticus i hope not for his sake but stranger things have happened when a slave is given a small taste of freedom the experience of spending a few coins and a little too much wine merciful fortune breathed lucius the silver he walked to the chest and reached out as if to touch phantom vessels where the silver had vanished the ewer the jewelry the cupsall gone theres no sign of a weapon i said looking about the room perhaps one of the missing pieces was used to strike that blow to stephanoss head something with a rather straight hard edge by the look of the wound perhaps the plate what a horrid idea poor stephanos lucius rested his hands on the lid of the chest and suddenly drew back with a gasp of horror he held up his hand and i saw that the palm was smeared with blood where did that come from i said the cloth atop the chest its hard to see in this light the cloth being red but theres a spot thats wet with blood here its been pushed all askew lets put it as it was before we straightened the cloth and discovered that the bloody spot was right above the edge of the top of the chest as if he hit his forehead on the hard wood said lucius yes as if he fellor was pushed i said thropsus cleared his throat master should i go and look for zoticus now lucius raised an eyebrow we shall look for him together a quick search of the slaves quarters revealed that zoticus was not in the house we returned to the pilfered treasure room should i go search for zoticus in the streets master the quaver in thropsuss voice indicated that he was well aware of the delicacy of his position if zoticus had committed murder and theft was it not likely that his friend thropsus had been a partner in the scheme even if thropsus was entirely innocent the testimony of slaves is by law extracted through torture if the silver was not retrieved and the matter resolved quickly thropsus was likely to face an ugly predicament my friend lucius has a good heart but he comes from a very old patrician family after all and the patricians of rome didnt get to be where they are today by being altruistic or squeamish especially in handling their property human or otherwise lucius dismissed thropsus to his quarters and then turned to me gordianus what shall i do he moaned at that moment not sounding very patrician at all keep thropsus here of course out on his own he might panic and get some mad idea about running off and that always ends badly for a slave besides i added under my breath he just might be guilty of conspiring to steal your silver i also suggest you hire some gladiators if you can find any who are sober to go round up zoticus if they can find him and if he hasnt got the silver on him then its up to you to decide how to go about obtaining the truth from him what if he protests his innocence i suppose its possible that some outsider might have come over the wall and stolen your silver another of your slaves perhaps or someone from the street of the silversmiths who would have known about your recent purchases but find zoticus first and find out what he knows eco who had been looking pensive for some time suddenly demanded my attention he pointed at the corpse of stephanos and then performed a mime smiling stupidly and pretending to laugh lucius was taken aback really theres nothing funny about it no lucius you misunderstand are you saying eco that it was stephanos whom you heard laughing eco nodded in such a way as to indicate that he had been debating his judgment of the matter and had finally made up his mind about it stephanos laughing said lucius in the same tone he might have used if eco had indicated that he had seen stephanos breathing fire or juggling his eyeballs he did seem a rather dour fellow i agreed giving eco a skeptical look and if it was stephanos who laughed then why didnt thropsus say so probably because he had never heard stephanos laugh before said lucius i dont think i ever heard such a thing myself he looked down at the corpse with a puzzled expression are you sure it was stephanos you heard laughing eco eco crossed his arms and nodded gravely he had made up his mind ah well perhaps well never know for sure i said walking toward the door youre not staying to help me gordianus alas lucius claudius i must take my leave for now theres a dinner to be prepared and a concubine to be served eco and i managed to get home relatively unscathed a group of giggling prostitutes impeded our progress for a while by dancing in a ring around us another king numa carried aloft in a litter poured a cup of wine over my head and a drunken gladiator vomited on one of ecos shoes but the trip from the palatine to the subura was otherwise uneventful the fare we prepared for dinner was very simple as suited my talents even so bethesda seemed barely able to keep out of the kitchen every so often she peered through the doorway wearing a skeptical frown and shaking her head as if the very way i held a knife betrayed my utter incompetence in culinary matters at last as the winter sun was beginning to sink into the west eco and i emerged from the kitchen to find bethesda and belbo comfortably ensconced on the dining couches normally reserved for ourselves eco pulled up the little dining tables while i fetched the various coursesa lentil soup a millet porridge with ground lamb an egg pudding with honey and pine nuts belbo seemed content with his meal but then belbo enjoys every meal so long as theres enough of it he smacked his lips ate with his fingers and laughed out loud at the novelty of sending his young master eco to fetch more wine accepting the tradition of reversing roles as a lark bethesda on the other hand approached each dish with an air of cool detachment as always her typically aloof demeanor masked the true depth of what was going on inside her which i suspected was as complex and subtle as the most exquisite ragout partly she was skeptical of my cooking partly she enjoyed the novelty of being served and the pretense of being a roman matron and partly she wished to hide any outward sign of her enjoyment because ah well because bethesda is bethesda she did however deign to compliment me on the egg pudding for which i took a bow and how was your day master she asked casually settling back on the couch i stood close by my arms clasped deferentially behind my back in her imagination was i reduced to a slaveor worse to a husband i recounted to her the days events as slaves are often called upon to do by their masters at the end of the day bethesda listened abstractedly running her hands through her luxurious black hair and tapping at her full red lips when i described my encounter with cicero her dark eyes flashed for she has always been suspicious of any man who has a greater appetite for books than for women or food when i told her i had called on lucius claudius she smiled for she knows how susceptible he is to her beauty when i told her of stephanoss demise and the disappearance of the silver she became deeply pensive she leaned forward to rest her chin on her hand and it suddenly occurred to me that she was very dangerously close to performing a parody of me after i had explained the unfortunate events she asked me to explain them again then called on eco who had been performing some childish handslapping game with belbo to come over and clarify some aspects of the story again as he had at luciuss house he insisted that it was stephanos whom he had heard laughing master said bethesda thoughtfully will this slave thropsus be tortured possibly i sighed if lucius is unable to recover the silver he may lose his headlucius i mean though thropsus could eventually lose his head as well literally and if zoticus is found without the silver protesting his innocence he will almost certainly be tortured i said lucius would lose face with his family and his colleagues if he were to allow himself to be duped by a slave duped by a slave murmured bethesda thoughtfully nodding then she shook her head and put on her most imperious expression master you were there how could you not have seen the truth what do you mean you were drinking the wine of lucius claudius straight werent you it must have addled your judgment many liberties are allowed to slaves during saturnalia but this was too much bethesda i demand we must go to the house of lucius claudius at once bethesda sprang to her feet and ran to fetch herself a cloak eco looked at me for direction i shrugged fetch your cloak eco and mine as well the night may be chilly you might as well come along too belbo if you can manage to lift yourself off that couch the streets will be wild tonight i will not recount the madness of crossing rome on saturnalia night suffice to say that on certain stretches of the journey i was very glad to have belbo with us his hulking presence alone was usually enough to clear a way through the raucous throng when we at last rapped upon luciuss door it was once again answered by the master of the house gordianus oh im glad to see you this day only becomes worse and worse oh and eco and belboand bethesda his voice broke a little as he said her name and his eyes widened he blushed if it was possible for his florid face to turn a brighter red he led us through the garden the statue of minerva gazed down upon us her wise countenance a study in moonlight and shadow lucius led us into a sumptuously appointed room just off the garden heated by a flaming brazier i took your advice he said i hired men to search for zoticus they found him quickly enough as drunk as a satyr and gambling in the street outside a brothel in the suburatrying to win enough to go inside he says and the silver no sign of it zoticus swears that he never saw the silver or even knew that it existed he says he slipped out the back of the house through a window in the slaves quarters he says that thropsus was boring him and he wanted to go out alone do you believe him lucius clutched his head oh i dont know what to believe all i know is that zoticus and thropsus came in zoticus slipped out and at some point in between stephanos was killed and the silver was taken i just want the silver back my cousins came calling today and i had nothing to give them of course i didnt want to explain the situation i told them my presents were late and id come to see them tomorrow gordianus i dont want to torture the young men but what else can i do you can take me to the room where you kept the silver said bethesda stepping forward and slipping off her cloak which she tossed onto a nearby chair her cascade of black hair glittered with flashes of deep blue and purple in the light of the flaming brazier her face was impassive and her eyes were steadily fixed on lucius claudius who blinked under her gaze i quailed a bit myself looking at her in the firelight for while she wore her hair down like a slave and was dressed in a simple slave womans gown her face had the same compelling majesty as the brazen face of the goddess in the garden bethesda kept her gaze on lucius who reached up to dab a bead of sweat from his forehead the brazier was hot but not that hot of course he said though theres nothing to see now i had the body of stephanos removed to another room his voice trailed off as he turned and led the way to the back of the house taking a lamp from a sconce on the wall to light the way under the lamps flickering light the room seemed very empty and slightly eerie the shutters were closed and the bloodstained cloth had been removed from atop the chest which shutters were open when you found stephanos dead said bethesda ththese said lucius with a slight stutter at his touch they parted the latch seems to be broken he explained trying to push them shut again broken because the shutters were not opened by the latch but forced said bethesda yes we figured that out this morning he said they must have been pushed open from outside some outsider forced his way in i think not said bethesda what if one were to seize the top of the shutters and pull them open like so at another window she wrenched the shutters open breaking the little latch at the middle but why would anyone do that asked lucius i parted my lips and drew in a breath beginning to see what bethesda had in mind i almost spoke but caught myself the idea was hers after all i would let her reveal it the slave thropsus said he heard first laughter then a rattling noise then a banging the laughter according to eco came from stephanos lucius shook his head thats hard to imagine because you never heard stephanos laugh i can tell you why because he laughed only behind your back ask some of the slaves who have been here longer than thropsus and see what they tell you how can you know this protested lucius the man ran your household did he not he was your chief slave here in rome believe me from time to time he laughed at you behind your back lucius seemed taken aback at such an idea but bethesda was not to be argued with as for the rattling thropsus heard you heard the same noise just now when i wrenched open those shutters then thropsus heard a banging a thudthat was the sound of stephanoss head striking the hard edge of the chest she winced then he fell to the ground here i should think clutching his chest and bleeding from his head she pointed to the very spot where we had found stephanos but the most significant sound was the one that no one heardthe clanging of silver which would surely have made a considerable noise if anyone had hurriedly stuffed all the vessels into a bag and then run off with it but what does all this mean said lucius it means that your woodenfaced slave whom you believed to have no sense of humor had his own way of celebrating saturnalia this year stephanos pulled a little joke on you in secretthen laughed out loud at his own impertinence but he laughed too hard stephanos was very old wasnt he old slaves have weak hearts when their hearts fail they are likely to fall and reach for anything to support them she seized the top of the shutters and jerked them open these were a poor support he fell and struck his head and then kept falling to the floorwas it the blow to his head that killed him or his heart who can say but the silver demanded lucius where is it where stephanos carefully and silently hid it away thinking to give his master a fright i held my breath as bethesda opened the lid of the chest what if she were wrong but there inside nestled atop some embroidered coverlets glittering beneath the lamplight were all the vessels and necklaces and bangles which lucius had shown us that morning lucius gasped and looked as if he might faint from relief but i still cant believe it he finally said stephanos never pulled such a prank before oh did he not said bethesda slaves pull such jokes all the time lucius claudius the point of such pranks is not that their masters should find out and feel foolish for then the impertinent slave would be punished no the point is that the master should never even realize that hes been made the butt of a joke stephanos was probably planning to be out in the street enjoying himself when you found the silver missing he would have let you rush about in a panic for a while then he would have come home and when you frantically told him the silver was missing he would have shown it to you in the trunk but i would have been furious all the better to amuse stephanos for when you asked him why he had put the silver there he would have said that you told him to and that he was only following your orders but i never gave him such instructions ah but you did master he would have said shaking his head at your absentmindedness and with his stern humorless expression you would have had no choice but to believe him think back lucius claudius and i suspect that you may remember other occasions when you found yourself in a fix and stephanos was constrained to point out that it was due to your own forgetfulness well now that you mention it said lucius looking distinctly uncomfortable and all the while stephanos was having a laugh at you behind your back said bethesda i shook my head i should have seen the truth when i was here earlier i said ruefully nonsense said bethesda you are wise in the ways of the world master but you can never know the secret workings of a slaves mind for you have never been one she shrugged when you told me the story i saw the truth at once i did not have to know stephanos to know how his mind worked there is a way of looking at the world common to all slaves i think i nodded and then stiffened a bit does this mean that sometimes when i cant find something or when i distinctly remember giving you an order but you convince me that it slipped my mind bethesda smiled ever so slightly as the goddess of wisdom might smile when contemplating a secret joke too rich for mere mortals later that night we joined the throng in the forum holding up our wax tapers so that the great public squares and the looming facades of the temples were illuminated by thousands and thousands of flickering lights lucius came with us and joined in the joyful chanting of yo yo saturnalia which echoed and boomed about the forum from the giddy smile on his face i could see that he had regained his good humor bethesda smiled too and why not on her wrist glittering like a circle of liquid fire beneath the flicker of her taper was a bracelet of silver and ebony the saturnalia gift of a grateful admirer king bee and honey gordianus and eco how was your journey ill tell you as soon as i get off this horse and discover whether i still have two legs lucius claudius let out a goodnatured laugh why the ride from rome is only a few hours and a fine paved road all the way and glorious weather that was true enough it was a day in late aprilis one of those golden spring days that one might wish could last forever sol himself seemed to think so the sun stood still in the sky as if enraptured by the beauty of the earth below and unwilling to move on and the earth was indeed beautiful especially this little corner of it tucked amid the rolling etruscan countryside north of rome the hills were studded with oaks and spangled with yellow and purple flowers here in the valley groves of olive trees shimmered silver and green in the faint breeze the orchards of fig trees and lime trees were in full leaf bees hummed and flitted among the long rows of grape leaves there was bird song or the air mingled with a tune being sung by a group of slaves striding through a nearby field and swinging their scythes in unison i breathed deeply the sweet odor of tall grass drying in the sun even my good friend lucius looked unusually robust like a plumpcheeked silenus with frizzled red hair all he needed to complete the image was a pitcher of wine and a few attendant wood nymphs i slipped off my horse and discovered i still had legs after all eco sprang from his mount and leaped into the air oh to be a fourteenyearold boy and to never know a stiff muscle a slave led our horses toward the stable lucius gave me a hearty slap across the shoulders and walked me toward the villa eco ran in circles around us like an excited pup it was a charming house low and rambling with many windows their shutters all thrown open to let in the sunlight and fresh air i thought of houses in the city all narrow and crammed together and windowless for fear of robbers climbing in from the street here even the house seemed to have sighed with relief and allowed itself to relax you see i told you said lucius look at that smile on your face the last time i saw you in the city you looked like a man wearing shoes too small for his feet i knew this was what you neededan escape to the countryside for a few days it always works for me when all the politicking and litigation in the forum becomes too much i flee to my farm youll see a few days and youll be a reborn man and eco will have a splendid time climbing the hills swimming in the stream but you didnt bring bethesda no she i began to say she refused to come which was the exact truth but i feared that my highborn friend would smirk at the idea of a slave refusing to accompany her master on a trip bethesda is a creature of the city you know hardly suited for the countryside so i left her at home with belbo to look after her shed have been useless to me here oh i see lucius nodded she refused to come well i began to shake my head then gave it up and laughed out loud of what use were citified pretensions here where sol stood still and cast his golden light over a perfect world lucius was right best to leave such nonsense back in rome on an impulse i reached for eco and when he made a game of slipping from my grasp i gave chase the two of us ran in circles around lucius claudius who threw back his head and laughed that night we dined on asparagus and goose liver followed by mushrooms sauteed in goose fat and a guinea hen in a honeyvinegar sauce sprinkled with pine nuts the fare was simply but superbly prepared i praised the meal so profusely that lucius called in the cook to take a bow i was surprised to see that the cook was a woman and still in her twenties her dark hair was pulled back in a tight bun no doubt to keep it out of her way in the kitchen her plump cheeks were all the plumper for the beaming smile on her face she appreciated praise her face was pleasant if not beautiful and her figure even in her loose clothing appeared to be quite voluptuous davia started as an assistant to my head cook at my house in rome lucius explained she helped him shop measured out ingredients that sort of thing but when he fell ill last winter and she had to take his place she showed such a knack that i decided to give her the run of the kitchen here at the farm so you approve gordianus indeed everything was splendid davia eco added his praise but his applause was interrupted by a profound yawn too much good food and fresh air he explained gesturing to the table and sucking in a deep breath he excused himself and went straight to bed lucius and i took chairs down to the stream and sipped his finest vintage while we listened to the gurgling of the water and the chirring of the crickets and watched thin clouds pass like shredded veils across the face of the moon ten days of this and i think i might forget the way back to rome ah but not the way back to bethesda ill wager said lucius i was hoping to see her shes a city flower yes but put her in the country and she might put out some fresh blossoms that would surprise you ah well it will be just us three fellows then no other guests no no no i specifically waited until i had no pending social obligations so that we should have the place all to ourselves he smiled at me under the moonlight then turned down his lips in a mock frown its not what youre thinking gordianus and what am i thinking that for all his homely virtues your friend lucius claudius is still a patrician and subject to the snobbery of his class that i chose a time to invite you here when thered be no one else around so as to avoid having you seen by my more elevated friends but thats not the point at all i wanted you to have the place to yourself so that you wouldnt have to put up with them oh if you only knew the sort of people im talking about i smiled at his discomfort my work does occasionally bring me into contact with the highborn and wealthy you know ah but its a different matter socializing with them i wont even mention my own family though theyre the worst oh there are the fortunehunters the ones on the fringes of society who think they can scrape and claw their way to respectability like a ferret and the grandpas the boring selfimportant old farts who never let anyone forget that some ancestor of theirs served two terms as consul or sacked a greek temple or slaughtered a shipload of carthaginians back in the golden age and the crackpots who claim theyre descended from hercules or venusmore likely medusa judging from their table manners and the too rich spoiled young men who cant think of anything but gambling and horse racing and the too pretty girls who cant think of anything but new gowns and jewels and the parents who cant think of anything but matching up the boys and girls so that they can breed more of the same you see gordianus you meet these people at their worst when theres been a dreadful murder or some other crime and theyre all anxious and confused and need your help but i see them at their best when theyre preening themselves like african birds and oozing charm all over each other like honey and believe me at their best theyre a thousand times worse oh you cant imagine some of the dreadful gatherings ive had to put up with here at the villa no no nothing like that for the next ten days this shall be a respite for you and me alikefor you from the city and for me from my socalled circle of friends but it was not to be the next three days were like a foretaste of elysium eco explored every corner of the farm as fascinated by butterflies and ant beds as he was by the arcane mechanics of the olive oil press and the wine press he had always been a city boyhe was an abandoned child of the streets before i adopted himbut it was clear he could develop a taste for the country as for me i treated myself to davias cooking at least three times a day toured the farm with lucius and his foreman and spent restful hours lying in the shade of the willows along the stream scrolling through trashy greek novels from luciuss small library the plots all seemed to be the samehumble boy meets noble girl girl is abducted by piratesgiantssoldiers boy rescues girl and turns out to be of noble birth himselfbut such nonsense seemed to fit my mood perfectly i allowed myself to become pampered and relaxed and thoroughly lazy in body mind and spirit and i enjoyed every moment then came the fourth day and the visitors they arrived just as twilight was falling in an open traveling coach drawn by four white horses and followed by a small retinue of slaves she was dressed in green and wore her auburn curls pinned in the peculiar upright fan shape that happened to be stylish in the city that spring it made a suitable frame for the striking beauty of her face he wore a dark blue tunic that was sleeveless and cut above the knees to show off his athletic arms and legs and an oddly trimmed little beard that seemed designed to flout convention they looked to be about my age midway between thirty and forty i happened to be walking back to the villa from the stream lucius stepped out of the house to greet me looked past me and saw the new arrivals numas balls he exclaimed under his breath borrowing my own favorite epithet friends of yours i said yes he could not have sounded more dismayed if he was being paid a visit by hannibals ghost he it turned out was a fellow named titus didius she was antonia his second wife they had both divorced their first spouses in order to marry each other generating enormous scandal and no small amount of envy among their unhappily married peers according to lucius who took me aside while the couple settled into the room next to mine they drank like fish fought like jackals and stole like magpies i noticed that the slaves discreetly put away the costliest wines the best silver and the most fragile arretine vases shortly after they arrived it seems they were planning to spend a few days up at my cousin maniuss place explained lucius but when they arrived no one was there well i know what happenedmanius went down to rome just to avoid them surely not surely yes i wonder that they didnt pass him on the way so now theyve come here asking to stay awhile just a day or two before we head back to the city we were so looking forward to some time in the country you will be a dear wont you lucius and let us stay just for a bit more likely ten days than two i shrugged they dont look so awful to me oh wait just wait well if theyre really as terrible as that why dont you let them stay the night and then turn them away turn them away he repeated the phrase as if id stopped speaking latin turn them away you mean send away titus didius old marcus didiuss boy refuse my hospitality to antonia but gordianus ive known these people since i was a child i mean to avoid them like cousin manius has done well thats one thing but to say to them to their faces never mind i understand i said though i didnt really whatever their faults the couple had one overriding virtue they were charming so charming indeed that on that first night dining in their company i began to think that lucius was wildly exaggerating certainly they showed none of the characteristic snobbishness of their class toward eco and me titus wanted to hear all about my travels and my work for advocates like cicero is it true he asked leaning toward me earnestly that hes a eunuch eco was obviously fascinated by antonia who was even more remarkably beautiful by lamplight she made a game of flirting with him but she did so with a natural grace that was neither condescending nor mean they were both witty vibrant and urbane and their sense of humor was only slightly charmingly vulgar they also appreciated good cooking just as i had done after my first meal at the villa they insisted on complimenting the cook when davia appeared tituss face lit up with surprise and not just at the fact that the cook was a young woman when lucius opened his mouth to introduce her titus snatched the name from his lips davia he said the word left a smile on his face a look of displeasure flashed in antonias eyes lucius looked back and forth between davia and titus speechless for a moment then you already know davia why of course we met once before at your house in the city davia wasnt the cook though only a helper in the kitchen as i recall when was this asked antonia smiling sweetly titus shrugged last year the year before at one of luciuss dinner parties i suppose an odd thingyou werent there as i recall something kept you home that night my dear a headache perhaps he gave his wife a commiserating smile and then looked back at davia with another kind of smile and how is it that you happened to meet the cooks helper antonias voice took on a slight edge oh i think i must have gone into the kitchen to ask a favor of the cook or something like that and then i well i met davia didnt i davia yes davia looked at the floor though it was hard to tell by the lamplight it seemed to me that she was blushing well said titus clapping his hands together you have become a splendid cook davia entirely worthy of your masters famously high standards about that were all agreed yes gordianus eco lucius antonia everyone nodded in unison some more enthusiastically than others davia muttered her thanks and disappeared back into the kitchen luciuss new guests were tired from traveling eco and i had enjoyed a long full day everyone turned in early the night was warm windows and doors were left open to take advantage of the slight breeze there was a great stillness on the earth of a sort that one never experiences in the city as i began to drift into the arms of morpheus in the utter quiet i thought i could hear the distant dreamy rustling of the sheep in their pen the hushed sighing of the high grass far away by the toad and even a hint of the streams gentle gurgling eco with whom i shared the room began to snore very gently then the fighting began at first i could hear only voices from the next room not words but after a while they started shouting her voice was higher and carried better than his you filthy adulterer bad enough that you take advantage of the girls in our own household but picking off another mans slaves titus shouted something presumably in his defense she was not impressed oh you filthy liar you cant fool me i saw the way you looked at her tonight and dont you dare try to bring up that business about me and the pearldiver at andros that was all in your own drunken imagination titus shouted again antonia shouted this went on for quite some time there was a sound of breaking pottery silence for a while and then the shouting resumed i groaned and pulled the coverlet over my head after a while i realized that the shouting had stopped i rolled onto my side thinking i might finally be able to sleep and noticed that eco was standing on his knees on his sleeping couch his ear pressed against the wall between our room and theirs eco what in hades are you doing he kept his ear to the wall and waved at me to be quiet theyre not fighting again are they he turned and shook his head what is it then the moonlight showed a crooked smile on his face he pumped his eyebrows up and down like a leering street mime made a circle with the fingers of one hand and a pointer with the opposite forefinger and performed a gesture all the street mimes know oh i see well stop listening like that its rude i rolled to my other side and pulled the coverlet over my head i must have slept for quite some time before the moonlight traveling from ecos side of the room to mine struck my face and woke me i sighed and rearranged the coverlet and saw that eco was still up on his knees his ear pressed fervently against the wall the two of them must have been at it all night long for the next two days lucius claudius repeatedly drew me aside to fret over the intrusion on my holiday but eco went about his simple pleasures i still found time to read alone down by the stream and to the extent that titus and antonia intruded on us they were in equal measure irritating and amusing no one could be more delightful than titus at dinner at least until the cup of wine that was one cup too many after which his jokes became a little too vulgar and his jabs a little too sharp and no one could be more sweetly alluring over a table of roasted pig than antonia until something happened to rub her the wrong way she had a look which could send a hot spike through a man as surely as the beast on the table had been spitted and put on to toast i had never met a couple quite like them i began to see how none of their friends could refuse them anything i also began to see how they drove those same friends to distraction with their sudden fits of temper and their allconsuming passion for each other which ran hot and cold and could scald or chill any outsider who happened to come too close on the third day of their visit lucius announced that he had come up with something special that we could all do together have you ever seen honey collected from a hive eco no i thought not and you gordianus no what about you two why no actually said antonia she and her husband had slept until noon and were just joining the rest of us down by the stream for our midday meal does that water have to gurgle so loud titus rubbed his temples did you say something about bees lucius i seem to have a swarm of them buzzing in my head this morning it is no longer morning titus and the bees are not in your head but in a glen downstream a bit said lucius in a chiding tone antonia wrinkled her brow how does one collect the honey i suppose ive never given it much thoughti just enjoy eating it oh its quite a science said lucius i have a slave named ursus whom i bought specifically for his knowledge of beekeeping he builds the hives out of hollowed strips of bark tied up with vines and then covered with mud and leaves he keeps away pests makes sure the meadow has the right kind of flowers and collects the honey twice a year now that the pleiades have risen in the night sky he says its time for the spring harvest where does honey come from i mean where do the bees get it said antonia puzzlement gave her face a deceptively vulnerable charm who cares said titus taking her hand and kissing her palm you are my honey oh and you are my king bee they kissed eco made a face confronted with actual kissing his adolescent prurience turned to squeamishness where does honey come from i said and do bees really have kings well i shall tell you said lucius honey falls from the sky of course like dew so ursus says and he should know the bees gather it up and concentrate it until it becomes all gooey and thick to have a place to put it they gather tree sap and the wax from certain plants to build their combs inside the hives and do they have kings oh yes they will gladly give their lives to protect him sometimes two different swarms go to war the kings hang back plotting the strategy and the clash can be terrificacts of heroism and sacrifice to rival the iliad and when theyre not at war said antonia a hive is like a bustling city some go out to work in the fields collecting the honeydew some work indoors constructing and maintaining the combs and the kings lay down laws for the common good they say jupiter granted the bees the wisdom to govern themselves as repayment for saving his life when baby jupiter was hidden in a cave to save him from his father saturn the bees sustained him with honey you make them sound almost superior to humans said titus laughing and tracing kisses on antonias wrist oh hardly theyre still ruled by kings after all and havent advanced to having a republic like ourselves explained lucius earnestly not realizing that he was being teased so who wants to go and see the honey collected i shouldnt want to get stung said antonia cautiously oh theres little danger of that ursus sedates the bees with smoke it makes them dull and drowsy and well stand well out of the way eco nodded enthusiastically i suppose it would be interesting said antonia not for me said titus lying back on the grassy bank and nibbing his temples oh titus dont be a dull drowsy king bee said antonia poking at him and pouting come along no titus there was a hint of menace in antonias voice lucius flinched in anticipation of a row he cleared his throat yes titus come along the walk will do you good get your blood pumping no my minds made up antonia flashed a brittle smile very well then have it your way you will miss the fun and so much the worse for you shall we get started lucius the natural enemies of the bee are the lizard the woodpecker the spider and the moth droned the slave ursus walking beside eco at the head of our little procession those creatures are all jealous of the honey you see and will do great damage to the hives to get at it ursus was a big stout man of middle years with a lumbering gait hairy all over to judge from the thatches that showed at the openings of his longsleeved tunic several other slaves followed behind us on the path that ran along the stream carrying the embers and hay torches that would be used to make the smoke there are plants which are enemies of the bees as well ursus went on the yew tree for example you never put a hive close to a yew tree because the bees will sicken and the honey will turn bitter and runny but they thrive close to olive trees and willows for gathering their honeydew they like red and purple flowers bloodred hyacinth is their favorite if theres thyme close by theyll use it to give the honey a delicate flavor they prefer to live close to a stream with shaded mossy pools where they can drink and wash themselves and they like peace and quiet as you will see eco the secluded place where we keep the hives has all these qualities being close by the stream surrounded by olives and willows and planted with all the flowers that most delight the bees i heard the bees before i saw them their humming joined the gurgling of the stream and grew louder as we passed through a hedge of cassia shrubs and entered a sundappled flowerspangled little glen that was just as ursus had described there was magic to the place satyrs and nymphs seemed to frolic in the shadows just out of sight one could almost imagine the infant jupiter lying in the soft grass living off the honey of the bees the hives ten in all stood in a row on waisthigh wooden platforms in the center of the clearing they were shaped like tall domes and with their coverings of dried mud and leaves looked as if they had been put there by nature ursus was a master of craft as well as lore each hive had only a tiny break in the bark for an entrance and through these openings the bees were busily coming and going a figure beneath a nearby willow caught my eyes and for a startled instant i thought a satyr had stepped into the clearing to join us antonia saw it at the same instant she let out a little gasp of surprise then clapped her hands in delight and what is this fellow doing here she laughed and stepped closer for a better look he watches over the glen said ursus the traditional guardian of the hives scares away honeythieves and birds it was a bronze statue of the god priapus grinning lustfully with one hand on his hip and a sickle held upright in the other he was naked and eminently rampantly priapic antonia fascinated gave him a good lookingover and then touched his upright grotesquely oversized phallus for luck my attention at that moment was drawn to eco who had wandered off to the other side of the glen and was stooping amid some purple flowers that grew low to the ground i hurried to join him be careful of those eco dont pick any more go wash your hands in the stream whats the matter said ursus this is etruscan startongue isnt it i said yes if youre as careful about what grows here as you say im surprised to see it the plant is poisonous isnt it to people perhaps said ursus dismissively but not to bees sometimes when a hive takes sick its the only thing to cure them you take the roots of the startongue boil them with wine let the tonic cool and set it out for the bees to drink it gives them new life but it might do the opposite for a man yes but everyone on the farm knows to stay away from the stuff and the animals are too smart to eat it i doubt that the flowers are poisonous its the roots that hold the beetonic well even so go wash your hands in the stream i said to eco who had followed this exchange and was looking at me expectantly the beekeeper shrugged and went about the business of the honey harvest as lucius had promised it was fascinating to watch while the other slaves alternately kindled and smothered the torches producing clouds of smoke ursus strode fearlessly into the thick of the sedated bees his cheeks bulged with water which he occasionally sprayed from his lips in a fine mist if the bees began to rouse themselves one by one he lifted up the hives and used a long knife to scoop out a portion of the honeycomb the wafting clouds of smoke ursuss slow deliberate progress from hive to hive the secluded magic of the place and not least the smiling presence of the watchful priapus gave the harvest the aura of a rustic religious procession so men have collected the sweet labor of the bees since the beginning of time only one thing occurred to jar the spell as ursus was lifting the very last of the hives a flood of ghostly white moths poured out from underneath they flitted through the smoky reek and dispersed amid the shimmering olive leaves above from this hive ursus would take no honey saying that the presence of the bandit moths was an ill omen the party departed from the glen in a festive mood ursus cut pieces of honeycomb and handed them out everyones fingers and lips were soon sticky with honey even antonia made a mess of herself when we reached the villa she ran ahead king bee she cried i have a sweet kiss for you and a sweet reason for you to kiss my fingertips your honey is covered with honey what did she see when she ran into the foyer of the house surely it was no more than the rest of us saw who entered only a few heartbeats after her titus was fully dressed and so was davia perhaps there was a fleeting look on their faces which the rest of us missed or perhaps antonia sensed rather than saw the thing that set off her fury whatever it was the row began then and there antonia stalked out of the foyer toward her room titus quickly followed davia blushing hurried off toward the kitchen lucius looked at me and rolled his eyes what now a strand of honey thin as spiders silk dangled from his plump chin the chill between antonia and titus showed no signs of abating at dinner while lucius and i made conversation about the honey harvest and eco joined in with eloquent flourishes of his hands his evocation of the flight of the moths was particularly vivid antonia and titus ate in stony silence they retired to their bedchamber early that night there were no sounds of reconciliation titus alternately barked and whined like a dog antonia shrieked and wept eco slept despite the noise but i tossed and turned until at last i decided to take a walk the moon lit my way as i stepped out of the villa made a circuit of the stable and strolled by the slaves quarters coming around a corner i saw two figures seated close together on a bench beside the portico that led to the kitchen though her hair was not in a bun but let down for the night the moon lit up her face well enough for me to recognize davia by his bearish shape i knew the man who sat with one arm around her stroking her face ursus they were so intent on each other that they did not notice me i turned and went back the way i had come wondering if lucius was aware that his cook and his beekeeper were lovers what a contrast their silent devotions made to the couple in the room next to me when i returned to my bed i had to cover my head with a pillow to muffle the sounds of titus and antonia arguing but the morning seemed to bring a new day while lucius eco and i ate a breakfast of bread and honey in the little garden outside luciuss study antonia came walking up from the direction of the stream bearing a basket of flowers antonia said lucius i should have thought you were still abed not at all she said beaming i was up before dawn and on a whim i went down to the stream to pick some flowers arent they lovely i shall have one of my girls weave them into a garland for me to wear at dinner tonight your beauty needs no ornament said lucius indeed antonia looked especially radiant that morning and where is mmm dare i call him your king bee antonia laughed still asleep i imagine but i shall go and rouse him at once this day is too beautiful to be missed i was thinking that titus and i might take a basket of food and some wine and spend most of the day down by the stream just the two of us she raised her eyebrows lucius understood ah yes well gordianus and i have plenty to occupy us here at the villa and ecoi believe you were planning to do some exploring up on the hill today werent you eco not quite understanding nodded nonetheless well then it looks as though you and the king bee will have the stream all to yourselves said lucius antonia beamed lucius you are so very sweet she paused to kiss his blushing pate a little later as we were finishing our leisurely breakfast we saw the couple walking down toward the stream without even a slave to bear their basket and blanket they held hands and laughed and doted on each other so lavishly that eco became positively queasy watching them by some acoustical curiosity a sharp noise from the stream could sometimes carry all the way up to the house so it was some time later standing by lucius in front of the villa while he discussed the days work with his foreman that i thought i heard a shout and then a hollow crack from that direction lucius and the foreman one talking while the other listened seemed not to notice but eco poking about an old wine press nearby pricked up his ears eco may be mute but his hearing is extremely sharp the shout had come from titus we had both heard his raised voice too often over the last few days not to recognize it the spouses had not made up after all i thought the two of them were at it again then a little later antonia screamed we all heard it it was not the familiar shriek of antonia in a rage it was a scream of pure panic she screamed again we ran all the way eco in the lead lucius huffing and puffing in the rear by hercules he shouted he must be killing her but antonia wasnt dying titus was he was flat on his back on the blanket his short tunic twisted all askew and hitched up about his hips he stared at the leafy canopy above his pupils hugely dilated dizzy spinning he gasped he coughed and wheezed and grabbed his throat then bent forward his hands went to his belly clutching at cramps his face was a deathly shade of blue what in hades exclaimed lucius what happened to him antonia gordianus what can we do cant breathe titus said mouthing words with no air behind them the end the end of me oh it hurts he grabbed at his loincloth damn the gods he pulled at his tunic as if it constricted his chest the foreman gave me his knife i cut the tunic open and tore it off leaving titus naked except for the loose loincloth about his hips it did no good except to show us that his whole body was turning blue i turned him on his side and reached into his mouth thinking he might be choking but that did no good either he kept struggling until the end fighting to breathe it was a horrible death to watch at last the wheezing and clenching stopped his limbs unfurled the life went out of his staring eyes antonia stood by stunned and silent her face like a petrified tragedy mask oh no she whispered dropping to her knees and embracing the body she began to scream again and to sob wildly her agony was almost as hard to watch as tituss death throes and there seemed as little to be done about it how in hades did this happen said lucius what caused it eco and the foreman and i looked at each other dumbly her fault wailed antonia what said lucius your cook that horrible woman its her fault lucius looked around at the scattered remains of food crusts of bread a little jar of honey black olives a wineskin there was also a clay bottle brokenthat had been the hollow crack i had heard what do you mean are you saying davia poisoned him antonias sobs caught in her throat yes thats it yes it was one of my own slaves who put the food in the basket but shes the one who prepared the food davia the witch poisoned him she poisoned everything oh dear but that means lucius knelt he gripped antonias arms and looked into her eyes you might be poisoned as well antonia do you feel any pain gordianus what should we do for her i looked at him blankly i had no idea antonia showed no symptoms she was not poisoned after all but something had killed her husband and in a most sudden and terrible fashion her slaves soon came running we left her grieving over the body and went back to the villa to confront davia lucius led the way into the kitchen davia do you know whats happened she looked at the floor and swallowed hard they say that one of your guests had died master yes what do you know about it she looked shocked i nothing master nothing they were eating food prepared by you when titus took ill do you still say you know nothing about it master i dont know what you mean davia i said you must tell us what was going on between you and titus didius she stammered and looked away davia the man is dead his wife accuses you youre in great danger if youre innocent the truth could save you be brave now tell us what passed between you and titus didius nothing i swear it by my mothers shade not that he didnt try and keep trying he approached me at the masters house in the city that night he first saw me he tried to get me to go into an empty room with him i wouldnt do it he kept trying the same thing here following me cornering me touching me i never encouraged him yesterday while you were all down at the hives he came after me pulling at my clothes pinching me kissing me i just kept moving away he seemed to like that chasing me when you all finally came back i almost wept with relief he harassed you then said lucius sadly well id believe that my fault i suppose i should have told him to keep his hands off my property but was it really so terrible that you had to poison him no i never youll have to torture her if you want the truth antonia stood in the doorway her fists were clenched her hair disheveled she looked utterly distraught like a vengeful harpy torture her lucius thats what they do when a slave testifies in a court its your rightyoure her master its your dutyyou were tituss host i demand that you torture her until she confesses and then put her to death davia turned as white as the moths that had flown from the hive she fainted to the floor antonia mad with grief retired to her room davia regained consciousness but seemed to be in the grip of some brainfever she trembled wildly and would not speak gordianus what am i to do lucius paced back and forth in the foyer i suppose ill have to torture the girl if she wont confess but i dont even know how to go about such a thing none of my farm slaves would make a suitable torturer i suppose i could consult one of my cousins talk of torture is premature i said wondering if lucius would actually go through with such a thing he was a gentle man in a cruel world sometimes the worlds expectations won out over his basic nature he might surprise me i didnt want to find out i think we should have another look at the body now that weve calmed down a bit we returned to the stream titus lay as we had left him naked except for his loincloth someone had closed his eyes you know a lot about poisons gordianus said lucius what do you think there are many poisons and many reactions i cant begin to guess what killed titus if we should find some store of poison in the kitchen or if one of the other slaves observed davia doing something to the food eco gestured to the scattered food mimed the act of feeding a farm animal then vividly enacted the animals deathan unpleasant pantomime to watch having just witnessed an actual death yes we could verify the presence of poison in the food that way at the waste of some poor beast but if it was in the food we see here why wasnt antonia poisoned as well eco bring me those pieces of the clay bottle do you remember hearing the sound of something breaking at about the time we heard titus cry out eco nodded and handed me the pieces of fired clay what do you suppose was in this i said wine i imagine or water said lucius but theres a wineskin over there and the inside of this bottle appears to be as dry as the outside i have a hunch lucius would you summon ursus ursusbut why i have a question for him the beekeeper soon came lumbering down the hill for such a big bearish fellow he was very squeamish in the presence of death he stayed well away from the body and made a face every time he looked at it im a city dweller ursus i dont know very much about bees ive never been stung by one but ive heard that a bee sting can kill a man is that true ursus he looked a bit embarrassed at the idea that his beloved bees could do such a thing well yes it can happen but its rare most people get stung and it goes away soon enough but some people have you ever seen anyone die of a bee sting ursus no but with all your lore you must know something about it how does it happen how do they die its their lungs that give out they strangle to death cant breathe turn blue lucius looked aghast do you think thats it gordianus that he was stung by one of my bees lets have a look the sting would leave a mark wouldnt it ursus oh yes a red swelling and more than that youd find the poisoned barb it stays behind when the bee flies off snagged in the flesh just a tiny thing but not hard to find we examined tituss chest and limbs rolled him over and examined his back we combed through his hair and looked at his scalp nothing said lucius nothing i admitted what are the chances anyway that a bee happened to fly by the bottle eco when did we hear it break before titus cried out or after after gestured eco rolling his fingers forward he clapped twice immediately after yes thats how i remember it too a bee a cry a broken bottle i pictured antonia and titus as i had last seen them together hand in hand doting on one another as they headed for the stream two people in love alone on a grassy bank what might they reasonably be expected to get up to what do you mean gordianus i think we shall have to examine titus more intimately what do you mean i think we shall have to take off his loincloth its already loosened you see probably by antonia as i thought we might we found the red swollen bee sting in the most intimate of places of course to be absolutely certain we should find the stinger and remove it ill leave that task to you lucius he was your friend after all not mine lucius located and dutifully extracted the tiny barb funny he said i thought it would be bigger what the stinger no his well the way he always bragged i thought it must be oh never mind confronted with the truth antonia confessed she had never meant to kill titus only to punish him for his pursuit of davia her early morning trip to the stream ostensibly to gather flowers had actually been an expedition to capture a bee for this purpose she used the clay bottle plugged it with a cork stopper then hid it beneath the flowers in her basket later titus himself unwittingly carried the bee in the bottle down to the stream hidden in the basket of food it was the priapus in the glen that had given antonia the idea ive always thought the god looks so vulnerable like that she told us if she could inflict a wound on titus in that most vulnerable part of the male anatomy she thought the punishment would be not only painful and humiliating but stingingly appropriate as they lazed on their blanket beside the stream antonia drew titus into an amorous embrace they cuddled and loosened their clothing titus became aroused just as she planned while he lay back closing his eyes with a dreamy smile antonia reached for the clay bottleshe shook it to agitate the bee then unstoppered it and quickly pressed the opening against his aroused member the sting was inflicted before titus realized what was happening he bolted up cried out and knocked the bottle from her hand it broke against the trunk of a willow tree antonia was ready to flee knowing he might explode with anger instead titus began to clutch at his chest and choke the catastrophe that swiftly followed took her utterly by surprise titus was dead within moments antonias shock and grief were entirely genuine she had meant to hurt him but never to murder him but she could hardly admit what she had done impulsively she chose davia as a scapegoat davia was ultimately to blame anyway she thought for tempting her husband it was agreed that lucius would not spread the whole truth of what had happened their circle of friends would be told that titus had died of a bee sting but not of antonias part his death had been unintentional after all not deliberate murder antonias grief was perhaps punishment enough but her scapegoating of davia was unforgivable would she have seen the lie through all the way to davias torture and death lucius thought so he allowed her to stay the night then sent her packing back to rome along with her husbands body and told her never to visit or speak to him again ironically titus might have been spared had he been a little more forthcoming or a little less amorous lucius later learned in all the talk that followed tituss death that titus had once been stung by a bee as a boy and had fallen very ill titus had never talked about this boyhood incident to his friends or to antonia only his old nurse and his closest relatives knew about it when he hung back from seeing the honey harvest i think he did so partly because he wanted time alone to pursue davia but also because he was quite reasonably afraid to go near the hives and unwilling to admit his fear if he had told us then of his extreme susceptibility to bee stings i am certain that antonia would never have attempted her vengeful scheme eco and i saw out the rest of our visit but the days that followed antonias departure were melancholy lucius was moody the slaves always superstitious about any death were restless davia was still shaken and her cooking suffered the sun was as bright as when we arrived the flowers as fragrant the stream as sparkling but the tragedy cast a pall over everything when the day came for our departure i was ready for the forgetful hustle and bustle of the city and what a story i would have to tell bethesda before we left i paid a visit to ursus and took a last look at the hives down in the glen have you ever been stung by a bee yourself ursus oh yes many times it must hurt it smarts but not too terribly i suppose otherwise youd stop being a beekeeper ursus grinned yes bees can sting but i always say that beekeeping is like loving a woman you get stung every so often but you keep coming back for more because the honey is worth it oh not always ursus i sighed not always the alexandrian cat we were sitting in the sunshine in the atrium of lucius claudiuss house discussing the latest gossip from the forum when a terrible yowling pierced the air lucius gave a start at the noise and opened his eyes wide the caterwauling terminated in a feline shriek followed by a scraping scrambling noise and then the appearance of a gigantic yellow cat racing across the roof above us the red clay tiles offered little traction to the creatures claws and it skittered so close to the edge that for a moment i thought it might fall right into luciuss lap lucius seemed to think so too he scrambled up from his chair knocking it over as he frantically retreated to the far side of the fish pond the big cat was quickly followed by a smaller one which was solid black the little creature must have had a particularly aggressive disposition to have given chase to a rival so much larger than itself but its careless ferocity proved to be its downfellliterally for while its opponent managed to traverse the root without a misstep the black cat careered so recklessly across the tiles that at a critical turning it lost its balance after an earrending cacophony of feral screeching and claws scraping madly against tiles the black cat came plummeting feetfirst into the atrium lucius screamed like a child then cursed like a man the young slave who had been filling our wine cups came running accursed creature cried lucius get it away from me get it out of here the slave was joined at once by others who surrounded the beast there was a standoff as the black cat flattened its ears and growled while the slaves held back wary of its fangs and claws regaining his dignity lucius caught his breath and straightened his tunic he snapped his fingers and pointed at the overturned chair one of the slaves righted it whereupon lucius stepped onto it no doubt he thought to put as much distance between himself and the cat as possible but instead he made a terrible error for by raising himself so high he became the tallest object in the atrium without warning the cat gave a sudden leap it broke through the cordon of slaves bounded onto the seat of luciuss chair ran vertically up the length of his body scrambled over his face onto the top of his head then pounced onto the roof and disappeared for a long moment lucius stood gaping at last assisted by his slaves many of whom seemed about to burst out laughing lucius managed to step shakily from the chair as he sat a fresh cup of wine was put into his hand and he raised it to his lips unsteadily he drained the cup and handed it back to the slave well he said go on now all of you the excitements over as the slaves departed from the atrium i saw that lucius was blushing no doubt from the embarrassment of having so thoroughly lost his composure not to mention having been got the better of by a wild beast in his own home and in front of his slaves the look on his chubby florid face was so comic that i had to bite my lips to keep from grinning cats he said at last accursed creatures when i was a boy you hardly saw them at all in rome now theyve taken over the city thousands of them everywhere wandering about at will squabbling and mating as they please and no one able to stop them at least one still doesnt see them much in the countryside farmers run them off because they frighten the other animals so badly weird fierce little monsters i think they come from hades actually i believe they came to rome by way of alexandria i said quietly oh yes sailors first brought them over from egypt or so ive heard seafarers like cats because they kill the vermin on their ships what a choicerats and mice or one of those fearsome beasts with its claws and fangs and you gordianusall this time youve sat there as if nothing was happening but i forget youre used to cats bethesda has a cat which she keeps as a sort of pet doesnt she as if the creature were a dog he made a face what does she call the thing bethesda always names her cats bast its what the egyptians call their catgod what a peculiar people worshiping animals as if they were gods no wonder their government is in constant turmoil a people who worship cats can hardly be fit to rule themselves i kept silent at this bit of conventional wisdom i might have pointed out that the catworshipers he so offhandedly disdained had managed to create a culture of exquisite subtlety and monumental achievements while romulus and remus were still suckling a shewolf but the day was too hot to engage in historical debate if the creature comes back i shall have it killed lucius muttered under his breath nervously eyeing the roof in egypt i said such an act would be considered murder punishable by death lucius looked at me askance surely you exaggerate i realize that the egyptians worship all sorts of birds and beasts but it doesnt prevent them from stealing their eggs or eating their flesh is the slaughter of a cow considered murder perhaps not but the slaying of a cat most certainly is in fact when i was a footloose young man in alexandria one of my earliest investigations involved the murder of a cat oh gordianus you must be joking youre not saying that you were actually hired to track down the killer of a cat are you it was a bit more complicated than that lucius smiled for the first time since we had been interrupted by the squabbling cats come gordianus dont tease me he said clapping his hands for the slave to bring more wine you must tell me the story i was glad to see him regain his good spirits very well i said i shall tell you the tale of the alexandrian cat the precinct called rhakotis is the most ancient part of alexandria the heart of rhakotis is the temple of serapis a magnificent marble edifice constructed on a huge scale and decorated with fabulous conceits of alabaster gold and ivory romans who have seen the temple begrudgingly admit that for sheer splendor it might mind you might rival our own austere temple of jupitera telling comment on roman provincialism rather than on the respective architectural merits of the two temples if i were a god i know in which house i would choose to live the temple is an oasis of light and splendor surrounded by a maze of narrow streets the houses in rhakotis made of hardened earth are built high and jammed close together the streets are strung with ropes upon which the inhabitants hang laundry and fish and plucked fowl the air is generally still and hot but occasionally a sea breeze will manage to cross the island of pharos and the great harbor and the high city wall to stir the tall palm trees which grow in the little squares and gardens of rhakotis in rhakotis one can almost imagine that the greek conquest never occurred the city may be named for alexander and ruled by a ptolemy but the people of the ancient district are distinctly egyptian darkly complected with dark eyes and the type of features one sees on the old statues of the pharaohs these people are different from us and so are their gods who are not the greek and roman gods of perfect human form but strange hybrids of animals and men frightful to look at one sees many cats in rhakotis they wander about as they wish undisturbed warming themselves in patches of sunlight chasing grasshoppers dozing on ledges and rooftops staring at inaccessible fish and fowl hung well beyond their reach but the cats of rhakotis do not go hungry far from it people set bowls of food out on the street for them muttering incantations as they do so and not even a starving beggar would consider taking such consecrated food for himselffor the cats of rhakotis like all cats throughout egypt are considered to be gods men bow as they pass them in the street and woe unto the crass visitor from rome or athens who dares to snigger at such a sight for the egyptians are as vengeful as they are pious at the age of twenty after traveling to the seven wonders of the world i found myself in alexandria i took up residence in rhakotis for a number of reasons for one thing a young foreigner with little money could find lodgings there to suit his means but rhakotis offered far more than cheap dwellings to reed my stomach vendors at crowded street corners hawked exotic delicacies unheard of in rome to feed my mind i listened to the philosophers who lectured and debated one another on the steps of the library next to the temple of serapis it was there that i met the philosopher dio but that is another story as for the other appetites common to young men those were easily satisfied as well the alexandrians consider themselves to be the most worldly of people and any roman who disputes the point only demonstrates his own ignorance eventually i met bethesda in alexandria but that too is another story one morning i happened to be walking through one of the districts less crowded streets when i heard a noise behind me it was a vague indistinct noise like the sound of a roaring crowd some distance away the government of egypt is notoriously unstable and riots are fairly common but it seemed too early in the day for people to be raging through the streets nevertheless as i paused to listen the noise became louder and the echoing din resolved into the sound of angry human voices a moment later a man in a blue tunic appeared from around a bend in the street running headlong toward me his head turned to look behind him i hurriedly stepped out of the way but he blindly changed his course and ran straight into me we tumbled to the ground in a confusion of arms and legs numas balls i shouted for the fool had caused me to scrape my hands and knees on the rough paving stones the stranger suddenly stopped his mad scramble to get to his feet and stared at me he was a man of middle age well groomed and well fed there was absolute panic in his eyes but also a glimmer of hope you curse in latin he said hoarsely youre a roman then like me yes countrymansave me by this time we were both on our feet again but the stranger moved in such a spastic manner and clutched at me so desperately that he nearly pulled us to the ground again the roar of angry voices grew nearer the man looked back to the way he had come fear danced across his face like a flame he clutched me with both hands i swear i never touched the beast he whispered hoarsely the little girl said i killed it but it was already dead when i came upon it what are you saying the cat i didnt kill the cat it was already dead lying in the street but theyll tear me limb from limb these mad egyptians if i can only reach my house at that moment a number of people appeared at the bend in the street men and women dressed in the tattered clothing of the poorer classes more people appeared and more shouting and twisting their faces into expressions of pure hatred they came rushing toward us some of them brandishing sticks and knives others shaking their bare fists in the air help me the man shrieked his voice breaking like a boys save me ill reward you the mob was almost upon us i struggled to escape his grip at last he broke away and resumed his headlong flight as the angry mob drew nearer for a moment it seemed that i had become the object of their fury indeed a few of them headed straight for me and i saw no possibility of escape death comes as the end goes the old egyptian poem and i felt it drawing very near but a man near the front of the crowd notable for his great long beard curled in the babylonian fashion saw the mistake and shouted in a booming voice not that one the man in blue is the one we want up there at the end of the street quick or hell escape us again the men and women who had been ready to strike me veered away at the last moment and ran on i drew into a doorway out of sight and marveled at the size of the mob as it passed by half the residents of rhakotis were after the roman in blue once the main body of the mob had passed i stepped back into the street following behind were a number of stragglers among them i recognized a man who sold pastries from a shop on the street of the breadmakers he was breathing hard but walked at a deliberate pace in his hand he clutched a wooden rod for rolling dough i knew him as a fat cheerful baker whose chief joy was filling other peoples stomachs but on this morning he wore the grim countenance of a determined avenger menapis what is happening i said falling into step beside him he gave me such a withering look that i thought he did not recognize me but when he spoke it was all too clear that he did you romans come here with your pompous ways and your illgotten wealth and we do our best to put up with you you foist yourselves upon us and we endure it but when you turn to desecration you go too far there are some things even a roman cant get away with menapis tell me whats happened he killed a cat the fool killed a cat just a stones throw from my shop did you see it happen a little girl saw him do it she screamed in terror naturally enough and a crowd came running they thought the little girl was in danger but it turned out to be something even worse the roman fool had killed a cat wed have stoned him to death right on the spot but he managed to slip away and start running the longer the chase went on the more people came out to join it hell never escape us now look up aheadthe roman rat must be trapped the chase seemed to have ended for the mob had come to a stop in a wide square if they had overtaken him the man in blue must already have been trampled to a pulp i thought with a feeling of nausea but as i drew nearer the crowd began to chant come out come out killer of the cat beside me menapis took up the chant with the others slapping his rolling pin against his palm and stamping his feet it seemed that the fugitive had taken refuge in a prosperouslooking house from the faces that stared in horror from the upperstory windows before they were thrown shut the place appeared to be full of romansthe mans private dwelling it seemed that he was a man of no small means i had already presumed from the quality of his blue tunic but the size of his house confirmed it a rich merchant i thoughtbut neither silver nor a silvery tongue was likely to save him from the wrath of the mob they continued to chant and began to beat upon the door with clubs menapis shouted clubs will never break such a door well have to make a battering ram i looked at the normally genial baker beside me and a shiver ran up my spine all this for a cat i withdrew to a quieter corner of the square where a few of the local residents had ventured out of their houses to watch the commotion an elderly egyptian woman impeccably dressed in a white linen gown gazed at the mob disparagingly what a rabble she remarked to no one in particular what are they thinking of attacking the house of a man like marcus lepidus your neighbor i said for many years as was his father before him an honest roman trader and a greater credit to alexandria than any of this rabble will ever be are you a roman too young man yes i thought so from your accent well i have no quarrel with romans dealing with men like marcus lepidus and his father made my late husband a wealthy man whatever has marcus done to bring such a mob to his door they accuse him of killing a cat she gasped a look of horror contorted her wrinkled face that would be unforgivable he claims to be innocent tell me who else lives in that house marcus lepidus lives with his two cousins they help him run his business and their wives the cousins are married but their wives and children remain in rome marcus is a widower he has no children look there what madness is this moving through the mob like a crocodile through lily pads was a great uprooted palm tree at the head of those who carried it i saw the man with the babylonian beard as they aligned the tree perpendicular to the door of marcus lepiduss house it purpose became unmistakable it was a battering ram i didnt kill the cat marcus lepidus had said and help me save me andno less significantly to my earsill reward you it seemed to me as a fellow roman who had been called on for help that my course was clear if the man in blue was innocent of the crime it was my duty to help him if duty alone was insufficient my growling stomach and empty purse tipped the scales conclusively i would need to act swiftly i headed back the way i had come the way to the street of the breadmakers usually thronged with people was almost deserted the shoppers and hawkers had all run off to kill the roman it seemed the shop of menapis was empty peering within i saw that piles of dough lay unshapen on the table and the fire in his oven had gone out the cat had been killed he said only a stones throw from his shop and it was at about that distance around the corner on a little side street that i came upon a group of shavenheaded priests who stood in a circle with bowed heads peering between the orange robes of the priests i saw the corpse of the cat sprawled on the paving stones it had been a beautiful creature with sleek limbs and a coat of midnight black that it had been deliberately killed could not be doubted for its throat had been cut the priests knelt down and lifted the dead cat onto a small funeral bier which they hoisted onto their shoulders chanting and lamenting they began a slow procession toward the temple of bast i looked around not quite sure how to proceed a movement at a window above caught my eye but when i looked up there was nothing to see i kept looking until a tiny face appeared then quickly disappeared again little girl i called softly little girl after a moment she reappeared her black hair was pulled back from her face which was perfectly round her eyes were shaped like almonds and her lips formed a pout you talk funny she said do i like that other man what other man she appeared to ponder this for a moment but did not answer would you like to hear me scream she said not waiting for a reply she did so the highpitched wail stabbed at my ears and echoed weirdly in the empty street i gritted my teeth until she stopped that i said is quite a scream tell me are you the little girl who screamed earlier today maybe when the cat was killed i mean she wrinkled her brow thoughtfully not exactly are you not the little girl who screamed when the cat was killed she considered this did the man with the funny beard send you she finally said i thought for a moment and recalled the man with the babylonian beard whose shout had saved me from the mob in the streetthe man in blue is the one we wantand whom i had seen at the head of the battering ram a babylonian beard you mean curled with an iron yes she said all curly like sun rays shooting out from his chin he saved my life i said it was the truth oh then i suppose its all right to talk to you she said do you have a present for me too a present like the one he gave me she held up a doll made of papyrus reeds and bits of rag very pretty i said beginning to understand did he give you the doll for screaming she laughed isnt it silly would you like to hear me scream again i shuddered later perhaps you didnt really see who killed the cat did you silly nobody killed the cat not really the cat was just playacting like i was ask the man with the funny beard she shook her head at my credulity of course i said i knew that i just forgot so you think i talk funny yes i do she said mocking my roman accent alexandrian children acquire a penchant for sarcasm very early in life you do talk funny like the other man you said yes you mean the man in the blue tunic the one they ran after for killing the cat her round face lengthened a bit no i never heard him talk except when the baker and his friends came after him and then he screamed but i can scream louder she seemed ready to demonstrate so i nodded quickly who then who talks like i do ah yes the man with the funny beard i said but i knew i must be wrong even as i spoke for the man had looked quite egyptian to me and certainly not roman no not him silly the other man what other man the man who was here yesterday the one with the runny nose i heard them talking together over there on the corner the funny beard and the one who sounds like you they were talking and pointing and looking serious the one with the beard pulling on his beard and the one with the runny nose blowing his nose but finally they thought of something funny and they both laughed and to think your cousin is such a lover of cats said the funny beard i could tell that they were planning a joke on somebody i forgot all about it until this morning when i saw the funny beard again and he asked me to scream when i saw the cat i see he gave you the doll then he showed you the cat yes looking so dead it fooled everybody even the priests just now the man with the funny beard showed you the cat you screamed people came runningthen what happened the funny beard pointed at a man who was walking up the street and he shouted the roman did it the man in blue he killed the cat she recited the lines with great conviction holding up her doll as if it were an actor the man with the runny nose who talked like me i said youre sure there was mention of his cousin oh yes i have a cousin too i play tricks on him all the time what did this man with a runny nose and a roman accent look like she shrugged a man yes but tall or short young or old she thought for a moment then shrugged again just a man like you like the man in the blue tunic all romans look the same to me she grinned then she screamed again just to show me how well she could do it by the time i got back to the square a troop of king ptolemys soldiers had arrived from the palace and were attempting with limited success to push back the mob the soldiers were vastly outnumbered and the mob would be pushed back only so far rocks and bricks were hurled against the building from time to time some of them striking the already cracked shutters it appeared that a serious attempt had been made to batter down the door but the door had stood firm a factotum from the royal palace a eunuch to judge by his high voice appeared at the highest place in the square this was a rooftop next to the besieged house he tried to quiet the mob below assuring them that justice would be done it was in king ptolemys interest of course to quell what might become an international incident the murder of a wealthy roman merchant by the people of alexandria could cause him great political damage the eunuch warbled on but the mob was unimpressed to them the issue was simple and clear a roman had ruthlessly murdered a cat and they would not be satisfied until the roman was dead they took up their chant again drowning out the eunuch come out come out killer of the cat the eunuch withdrew from the rooftop i had decided to get inside the house of marcus lepidus caution told me that such a course was madfor how could i ever get out alive once i was inand at any rate apparently impossible for if there was a simple way to get into the house the mob would already have found it then it occurred to me that someone standing on the same rooftop where ptolemys eunuch had stood could conceivably jump or be lowered onto the roof of the besieged house it all seemed like a great deal of effort until i heard the plaintive echo of the strangers voice inside my head help me save me and of course ill reward you the building from which the eunuch spoke had been commandeered by soldiers as had the other buildings adjacent to the besieged house as a precaution to keep the mob from gaining entry through an adjoining wall or setting fire to the whole block it took some doing to convince the guards to let me in but the feet that i was a roman and claimed to know marcus lepidus eventually gained me an audience with the kings eunuch royal servants come and go in alexandria those who fail to satisfy their master become food for crocodiles and are quickly replaced this royal servant was clearly feeling the pressure of serving a monarch who might snuff out his life with the mere arching of an eyebrow he had been sent to quell an angry mob and to save the life of a roman citizen and at the moment his chances of succeeding looked distinctly uncertain he could call for more troops and slaughter the mob but such a bloodbath might escalate into an even graver situation complicating matters even more was the presence of a high priest of bast who dogged if i may use that expression the eunuchs every step yowling and waving his orange robes and demanding that justice be done at once in the name of the murdered cat the beleaguered eunuch was receptive to any ideas that i might have to suggest youre a friend of this other roman the man the mob is after he asked the murderer the high priest corrected an acquaintance of the man yes i saidand truthfully if having exchanged a few desperate words after colliding in the street could be called an acquaintance in fact im his agent hes hired me to get him out of this mess this was also true after a fashion and i think i know who really killed the cat this was not quite true but might become so if the eunuch would cooperate with me you must get me into marcus lepiduss house i was thinking that your soldiers might lower me onto his roof by a rope the eunuch became thoughtful by the same route we might rescue marcus lepidus himself by having him climb the same rope up onto this building where my men can better protect him rescue a cat killer give him armed protection the priest was outraged the eunuch bit his lip at last it was agreed that the kings men would supply a rope by which i could make my way onto the roof of the besieged house but you cannot return to this building by the same route the eunuch insisted why not i had a sudden vision of the house being set aflame with myself inside it or of an angry mob breaking through the door and killing all the inhabitants with knives and clubs because the rope will be visible from the square snapped the eunuch if the mob sees anyone leaving the house theyll assume its the man theyre after then theyll break into this building no ill allow you passage to your countrymans house but after that youll be on your own i thought for a moment and then agreed behind the eunuch the high priest of bast smiled like a cat no doubt anticipating my imminent demise and purring at the idea of yet another impious roman departing from the shores of the living as i was lowered onto the merchants roof his household slaves realized what was happening and sounded an alarm they surrounded me at once and seemed determined to throw me into the square below but i held up my hands to show them that i was unarmed and i cried out that i was a friend of marcus lepidus my latin seemed to sway them at last they took me down a flight of steps to meet their master the man in blue had withdrawn to a small chamber which i took to be his office for it was cluttered with scrolls and scraps of papyrus he looked at me warily then recognized me youre the man i ran into on the street but why have you come here because you asked for my help marcus lepidus and because you offered me a reward i said bluntly my name is gordianus beyond the shuttered window which faced the square the crowd began to chant again a stone struck the shutters with a crash marcus gave a start and bit his knuckles these are my cousins rufus and appius he said introducing two younger men who had just entered the room like their older cousin they were well groomed and well dressed and like him they appeared to be barely able to suppress their panic the guards outside are beginning to weaken said rufus shrilly what are we going to do marcus if they break into the house theyll slaughter us all said appius youre obviously a man of wealth marcus lepidus i said a trader i understand all three cousins looked at me blankly baffled by my apparent disregard for the crisis at hand yes said marcus i own a small fleet of ships we carry grain and slaves and other goods between alexandria and rome talking about his work calmed him noticeably as reciting a familiar chant calms a worshiper in a temple do you own the business jointly with your cousins i the business is entirely my own said marcus a bit haughtily i inherited it from my father yours alone you have no brothers none and your cousins are merely employees not partners if you put it that way i looked at rufus the taller of the cousins was it fear of the mob i read on his face or the bitterness of old resentments his cousin appius began to pace the room biting his fingernails and casting what i took to be hostile glances at me i understand you have no sons marcus lepidus i said no my first wife gave me only daughters they all died of fever my second wife was barren i have no wife at present but i soon will when the girl arrives from rome her parents are sending her by ship and they promise me that she will be fertile like her sisters this time next year i could be a proud father at last he managed a weak smile then bit his knuckles but whats the use of contemplating my future when i have none curse all the gods of egypt to have put that dead cat in my path i think it was not a god who did so i said tell me marcus lepidus though jupiter forbid such a tragedyif you should die before you marry before you have a son who would inherit your property then my cousins in equal portions rufus and appius both looked at me gravely another stone struck the shutters and we all gave a start it was impossible to read their faces for any subtle signs of guilt i see tell me marcus lepidus who could have known yesterday that you would be walking up that side street in rhakotis this morning he shrugged i make no secret of my pleasures there is a house on that street where i spend certain nights in the company of a certain catamite having no wife at present then either of your cousins might have known that you would be coming home by that route this morning i suppose he said shrugging if he was too distracted to see the point his cousins were not rufus and appius both stared at me darkly and glanced dubiously at one another at that moment a gray cat came sauntering into the room its tail flicking its head held high apparently oblivious to the chaos outside the house or the despair of those within the irony of it wailed marcus lepidus suddenly breaking into tears the bitter irony to be accused of killing a cat when i of all men would never do such a thing i adore the little creatures i give them a place of honor in my home i feed them from my own plate come precious nefer he stooped down and made a cradle for the cat who obligingly leaped into his arms the cat twisted onto its back and purred loudly marcus lepidus held the animal close to him caressing it to soothe his distress rufus appeared to share his older cousins fondness for cats for he smiled weakly and joined him in stroking the beasts belly i had reached an impasse it seemed to me quite certain that at least one of the cousins had been in league with the bearded egyptian in deliberately plotting the destruction of marcus lepidus but which if only the little girl had been able to give me a better description all romans look the same indeed you and your cursed cats said appius suddenly wrinkling his nose and retreating to the far corner of the room its the cats that do this to me they cast some sort of hateful spell alexandria is full of them making my life a misery every time i get close to one the same thing happens i never sneezed once in my life before i came here and with that he sneezed and snorted and pulled a cloth from his tunic to blow his runny nose what followed was not pretty though it may have been just i told marcus lepidus all i had learned from the little girl i summoned him to the window and opened the shutters enough to point out the man with the babylonian beard who was now overseeing the construction of a bonfire in the square below marcus had seen the man before in the company of his cousin appius what outcome did i expect i had meant to help a fellow roman far from home to save an innocent man from the wrath of an unreasoning mob and to gain a few coins for my purse in the processall honorable pursuits did i not realize that inevitably a man would die i was younger then and did not always think a thing through to its logical result the unleashed fury of marcus lepidus took me by surprise perhaps it should not have considering the terrible shock he had suffered that day considering also that he was a successful businessman and therefore to some degree ruthless considering finally that treachery within a family often drives men to acts of extreme revenge quailing before marcus lepidus appius confessed his guilt rufus whom he declared to be innocent of the plot begged for mercy on his cousins behalf but his pleadings were ineffectual though we might be hundreds of miles from rome the rule or the roman family held sway in that house in alexandria and all power resided in the head of the household when marcus lepidus stripped off his blue tunic and ordered that his cousin appius should be dressed in it the slaves of the household obeyed appius resisted but was overwhelmed when marcus ordered that appius should then be thrown from the window into the mob it was done rufus pale and trembling withdrew into another room marcus made his face as hard as stone and turned away the gray cat twined itself about his feet but the solace it offered was ignored the bearded egyptian not realizing the substitution screamed to the others in the mob to take their vengeance on the man in blue it was only much later when the mob had largely dispersed and the egyptian was able to get a closer look at the trampled bloody corpse that he realized the mistake i shall never forget the look on his face which changed from a leer of triumph to a mask of horror as he approached the body studied its face and then looked up at the window where i stood he had overseen the killing of his own confederate perhaps it was fitting that appius received the fate which he had intended for his cousin no doubt he thought that while he waited safe and sound in the family house the bearded egyptian would proceed with the plot as they had planned and his older cousin would be torn to pieces on the street of the breadmakers he did not foresee that marcus lepidus would be able to elude the crowd and flee all the way to his house where all three cousins became trapped nor did he foresee the intervention of gordianus the finderor for that matter the intervention of the gray cat which caused him to betray himself with a sneeze thus ended the episode of the alexandrian cat whose death was terribly avenged some days after telling this tale to lucius claudius i chanced to visit him again at his house on the palatine i was surprised to see that a new mosaic had been installed on his doorstep the colorful little tiles pictured a snarling molossian mastiff together with the stern caption cave canem a slave admitted me and escorted me to the garden at the center of the house as i approached i heard a yapping noise accompanied by deepthroated laughter i came upon lucius claudius who sat with what appeared to be a gigantic white rat on his lap what on earth is that i exclaimed this is my darling my sweet my adorable little momo your doorstep shows a molossian mastiff which that animal most certainly is not momo is a melitene terriertiny true but very fierce said lucius defensively as if to prove her masters point the little lapdog began to yap again then she nervously began lapping at luciuss chin which he appeared to enjoy immensely the doorstep advises visitors to beware the dog i said skeptically as indeed they shouldespecially unwelcome visitors of the fourfooted variety you expect this dog to keep cats away i do never again shall my peace be violated by those accursed creatures not with little momo here to protect me is that not right momo are you not the fiercest cat chaser who ever lived brave bold little momo i rolled my eyes and caught a glimpse of something black and sleek on the roof it was almost certainly the very cat who had terrified lucius on my last visit an instant later the terrier was out of her masters lap performing a frantic circular dance on the floor yapping frantically and baring her teeth up on the roof the black cat arched its back hissed and disappeared there you see gordianus beware this dog all you cats of rome lucius scooped the terrier up in his arms and kissed her nose there there momo and disbelieving gordianus doubted you i thought of a truism i had learned from bethesda there are those in this world who love cats and those who love dogs and never shall the two close ranks but we could at least share a cup of wine lucius claudius and i and exchange the latest gossip from the forum the house of the vestals what do you know about the vestal virgins said cicero only what every roman knows that there are six of them that they watch over the eternal flame in the temple of vesta that they serve for no less than thirty years during which time they take a vow of chastity and that once every generation or so a terrible scandal erupts yes yes said cicero the litter gave a small lurch pitching him forward it was a moonless night and the litterbearers proceeding over the rough paving stones by torchlight were giving us a bumpy ride i bring up the matter only because one never knows nowadayswe live in such irreligious timesnot that i myself set any store by mindless superstition the sharpest mind in rome was rambling cicero was uncommonly agitated he had arrived at my door in the middle of the night called me from my bed and insisted i accompany him to an unspecified destination the bearers trotted along at a quick pace jostling us about i would almost have preferred to get out and trot myself i parted the curtains and peered outside within the covered box i had lost my bearings the darkened street looked like any other where are we going cicero he ignored my question as you noted gordianus the vestals are particularly vulnerable to scandal you have heard no doubt of the pending case against marcus crassus its the talk of every tavern in townthe richest man in rome is accused of corrupting a vestal and not just any vestal but licinia herself yes the virgo maxima high priestess of vesta and a distant cousin of crassus the charge is absurd of course crassus is no more likely to involve himself in such an affair than i would be like myself and unlike so many of our contemporaries crassus is above the base appetites of the flesh even so there are plenty of witnesses ready to testify that he has been seen in licinias company on numerous occasionsat the theater during festivals in the forumhovering about her in an unseemly fashion appearing almost to badger her i am told also that circumstantial evidence exists to indicate he has visited her during daylight hours in the house of the vestals without chaperones present even so there is no crime in that unless poor judgment is a crime men hate crassus only because hes made himself so rich that too is not a crime the great mind had begun to wander again the hour after all was late i cleared my throat will you be defending crassus in the courts or licinia neither my political career has entered a very delicate phase i cannot be seen to have any public connection with a scandal involving the vestals which is why the events of this evening are such a disaster at last i thought we shall get down to business i peered between the curtains again it seemed that we were approaching the forum what possible business could we have among the temples and public squares in the middle of the night as you probably know gordianus one of the younger vestals happens to be a relative of mine no i didnt know a relative by marriage anyway fabia is my wifes half sister and therefore my sisterinlaw but the vestal under investigation is the virgo maxima licinia yes the scandal involved only licinia until the events of this evening cicero are you being deliberately obscure very well something occurred earlier tonight in the house of the vestals something quite terrible unthinkable something which threatens not only to destroy fabia but to throw calumny upon the very institution of the vestals and to undermine the whole religious establishment of rome cicero lowered his voice which had begun to rise to orators pitch i have no doubt that the prosecution of licinia and crassus is somehow related to this latest disaster there is an organized conspiracy afoot to spread doubt and chaos in the city using the vestals as a starting point if my years in the forum have taught me anything it is that some roman politicians will stop at nothing he leaned forward and clutched my arm you are aware that this year marks the tenth anniversary of the fire which razed the temple of jupiter and destroyed the sibylline oracles the masses are superstitious gordianus they are quite ready to believe that on the tenth anniversary of such a terrible catastrophe something equally terrible must occur now it has whether it was manufactured by gods or by men that is the question the litter gave a final lurch and came to a halt cicero released his grip on my arm sat back and sighed we have reached your destination i pulled back the curtains and saw the colonnaded facade of the house of the vestals cicero i may not be an expert in religious matters but i do know that for a man to enter the house of the vestals after dark is an offense punishable by death i hope you dont expect me tonight is not like other nights gordianus cicero back at last the voice from the darkness was oddly familiar a shock of red hair entered the circle of torchlight and i recognized young marcus valerius messalla rufus called rufus on account of his flaming hairwhom i had not seen close at hand in the seven years since he had assisted cicero with the defense of sextus roscius he had been only sixteen then a boy with red cheeks and a freckled nose now he was a religious official one of the youngest men ever elected to the college of augurs entrusted with interpreting the will of the gods by reading omens in lightning and the flights of birds he still looked very much like a boy to me in spite of the obvious gravity of the moment his eyes shone brightly and he smiled as he stepped toward cicero and took his hand it seemed that his love for his mentor had not diminished over the years rufus will take you from here said cicero what youve roused me from bed in the middle of the night carried me halfway across rome given me no clear explanation and now you abandon me i thought i made it clear that i must not be seen to have any connection whatsoever with tonights events fabia called on the virgo maxima for help who called on rufus who is known to her together they summoned me knowing my family connection to fabia i fetched you gordianusand that is the end of my involvement he gestured impatiently for me to step from the litter as soon as my feet touched the paving stones without even a last farewell he clapped his hands and the litter lurched into motion rufus and i watched it depart in the direction of ciceros house on the capitoline hill there goes an extraordinary man sighed rufus i was thinking something quite different but bit my tongue the litter turned a corner and disappeared from sight before us was the entrance to the house of the vestals twin braziers stood at either side flickering shadows danced across the wide steep stairway but the house itself was dark its high wooden doors thrown shut normally they stood open day and nightfor who would dare to enter the abode of the vestals uninvited or with evil intent across the way the round temple of vesta was strangely lit up and from it came a soft chanting on the still night air gordianus said rufus how strange to see you again after so many years i hear of you now and again as i hear of you and see you occasionally presiding at some public or private invocation of the auspices nothing important can happen in rome without an augur present to read the omens you must stay very busy rufus he shrugged there are fifteen augurs in all gordianus im the youngest and only a beginner many of the mysteries are still just that to memysteries lightning on the left good lightning on the right bad and if the person youre divining for is displeased with the result you have only to face the opposite direction reversing right and left it seems rather simple rufus compressed his lips i see that youre as skeptical of religion as cicero yes a great deal of it is empty formula and politics but there is another element the perception of which requires i suppose a certain sensibility on the part of the perceiver and do you foresee lightning tonight i said sniffing the air he smiled faintly actually yes i think it may rain but we mustnt stand here talking where anyone could see us come along he started up the steps into the house of the vestals at this hour the virgo maxima herself is awaiting us gordianus come along dubiously i followed him up the stairs he knocked softly on one of the doors which swung silently inward taking a deep breath i followed him over the threshold we stood in a lofty foyer that opened onto a central courtyard surrounded all about by a colonnaded walkway all was dark not a single torch was lit the long shallow pool in the center of the courtyard was black and full of stars its glassy surface broken only by some reeds that grew from the center i felt a sudden superstitious dread hackles rose on the back of my neck a sheen of sweat erupted on my forehead and i was unable to breathe my heart pounded so hard that i thought the noise must be loud enough to wake a sleeping virgin i wanted to clutch rufuss arm and hiss into his ear that we must go back to the forum at onceso deep is the fear of the forbidden ingrained from childhood when one hears tales of men found skulking in sacred precincts and made to suffer unimaginable punishments ironically i thought it is only through association with the most respectable people in the worldlike cicero and rufusthat a man can suddenly unexpectedly find himself in the most forbidden spot in all rome at an hour when his mere presence could mean death one moment innocently asleep in my own bed and the nextin the house of the vestals there was a faint noise behind us i turned to see a vague white shape in the darkness which by degrees resolved itself into a woman she must have opened the door for us but she was not a slave she was one of the vestals as i could tell by her appearanceher hair was cut quite short and around her forehead she wore a broad white band like a diadem decorated with ribbons she was dressed in a plain white stola and about her shoulders she wore the white linen mantle of the vestals she flicked her fingers and i felt drops of water on my face be purified she whispered do you swear by the goddess of the hearth that you enter this house with no evil intent and at the request of the mistress of this house who is the virgo maxima the highest priestess of vesta i do said rufus i followed his example the vestal led us across the courtyard as we passed the pool i heard a soft splash i stiffened at the noise but saw only a gentle ripple traverse the black surface causing the reflected starlight to glimmer and wink i leaned close to rufuss ear and whispered a frog but surely not a male one he whispered back then gestured for me to be quiet we stepped beneath the colonnade into deep shadow and stopped before a door that was invisible except for the faint bar of light that escaped beneath its bottom edge the vestal knocked very gently and whispered something i couldnt hear then left us and disappeared into the shadows a moment later the door opened inward a face appearedfrightened beautiful and quite young she too wore the diadem of a vestal she pulled the door open to allow us to enter the room was dimly lit by a single lamp beneath which another vestal sat holding an open scroll she was older than her companion of middle age her short hair was touched with silver at the ternples as we approached she kept her eyes on the scroll and began to read aloud in greek her voice was soft and mellow evening star gatherer of all the bright daybreak parted you gather the sheep the goat you gather the child safe to its mother she laid the scroll aside and looked up first at rufus then at me she sighed in times of distress the poetess comforts me ate you familiar with sappho a little i said she laid the scroll aside i am licinia i looked at her more closely was this the woman for whom the richest man in rome had endangered his life the virgo maxima seemed in no way extraordinary at least not to my eye on the other hand what sort of woman could sit calmly and read sappho in the midst of what even staid cicero had decreed a catastrophe you are gordianus called the finder she said i nodded cicero sent word by rufus that you would come ah what would we have done tonight without cicero to help us like is he to a god immortal said rufus quoting another line from sappho there followed an uneasy silence the girl who had opened the door remained in the shadows lets get on with it then said licinia you must know already that i have been indicted for conduct forbidden to a vestal they accuse me of a dalliance with my kinsman marcus crassus so ive heard im far past my youth and have no interest in men the charge is absurd it is true that crassus seeks out my company in the forum and the theater and pesters me constantlybut if our accusers only knew what he talks about when were alone believe me it has nothing to do with matters of the heart crassus is as legendary for his greed as are the vestals for their chastitybut i will not elaborate crassus has his defense and i have mine and in three days the courts will hear our cases and decide there are no witnesses and no evidence of any act contrary to my vow the suit is nothing more than a nuisance intended to embarrass crassus and to undermine the peoples faith in the vestals no reasonable panel of judges could possibly find us guilty and yet after the events of this evening things could go very badly for us both she looked into the darkness and frowned and caressed the scroll in her lap as if the conversation had grown distasteful to her and she longed to escape again into the soothing rhythms of the lesbian poet when she spoke again her voice was languid and dreamy i was consecrated to vesta at the age of eight all vestals are chosen at an early age between six and ten we serve for no less than thirty years for the first ten years we are novices students of the mysteries like fabia here she gestured to the girl in the shadows in the second ten years we perform the sacred dutiespurify the shrine and make offerings of salt watch over the eternal flame consecrate temples attend the holy festivals guard the sacred relics in the third ten years we become teachers and instruct the novices passing on the mysteries at the end of thirty years we are permitted to leave the consecrated life but the few who choose to do so almost always end in misery she sighed within the house of the vestals a woman acquires certain habits and expectations falls into rhythms of life incompatible with the world outside most vestals die as they have lived in chaste service to the goddess and her everlasting hearth sometimes her voice quavered sometimes especially in the early years one can be tempted to stray from the vow of chastity the consequence of that is death and not a simple merciful death but a fate quite horrible to contemplate the last such scandal occurred forty years ago the virgin daughter of a good family was struck by lightning and killed her clothing was rent and her nakedness exposed soothsayers interpreted this to mean that the vestals had violated their vows three vestals were accused of impurity along with their alleged lovers and tried before the college of pontiffs one was found guilty the others were absolved but the people were not satisfied they raged and rioted until a special commission was set up the case was retired all three vestals were condemned licinias face grew long her eyes glinted in the lamplight do you know the punishment gordianus the lover is publicly scourged to death a gruesome matter but simple and quick not so with the vestal she is stripped of her diadem and linen mantle she is whipped by the pontifex maximus she is dressed like a corpse laid in a closed litter and carried through the forum attended by her weeping kindred forced to live through the misery of her own funeral she is carried to a place just inside the colline gate where a small vault is prepared underground containing a couch a lamp and a table with a little food a common executioner guides her down the ladder into the cell but he does not harm her you see her person is still sacred to vesta no man may kill her the ladder is drawn up the vault sealed the ground leveled it is left to the goddess to take the vestals life buried alive fabia whispered hoarsely the girl remained in the shadows her hands now nervously touching her lips yes buried alive licinias voice was steady but cold as death after a long moment she glanced down at her lap where the scroll of sappho lay crushed in her hand i think it is time now to explain to gordianus why he was called here she put aside the scroll and stood an intruder entered this house earlier tonight more precisely two intruders and possibly a third a man came to visit fabia after dark on her invitation he claims never said the girl licinia silenced her with a withering look he was discovered in her room but worse than thatyou shall see for yourself gordianus she picked up the lamp and led us through a short passageway to another room it was a simpler and more private chamber than the one in which she had greeted us ornamental curtains draped the walls their color a rich dark red that seemed to swallow the light of the brazier in one corner there were only two pieces of furniture a backless chair and a sleeping couch the couch i noticed looked freshly made up its pillows fluffed and straightened its coverlets neatly spread the man who sat in the chair looked up as we entered contrary to the prevailing fashion he was not cleanshaven but wore a neat little beard it seemed to me that he smiled very faintly he appeared to be a few years younger than myselfabout thirtyfive i guessed close to ciceros age unlike cicero he was quite remarkably attractive which is not to say that he was particularly handsome if i conjure up his face in my minds eye i can only remark that his hair and beard were dark his eyes a piercing blue his features regular but in his actual presence there was something indefinably appealing and a contagious playfulness in his eyes that seemed to dance like sparkling points of flame lucius sergius catilina he said standing and introducing himself the patrician clan of the sergu went back to the days of aeneas there was no more respectable name in the republic catilina himself i knew by his reputation some called him a charmer others a rogue all agreed that he was clever but some said too clever he gave me an odd half smile that suggested he was inwardly laughing at somethingbut at what he cocked his head tell me gordianus what do five of the people in this room have in common puzzled i glanced at rufus who scowled they are still breathing said catalina while the sixth is not he stepped toward the curtain hung across the far wall and pulled it back to reveal another passageway upon the floor contorted in a most unnatural way lay the body of a man who was surely dead rufus and licinia looked sternly disapproving of catilinas theatricality while fabia was close to tears but none of them betrayed surprise i drew in a breath then knelt and studied the crumpled body for a long moment i drew back and sat in the chair feeling slightly ill the sight of a man with his throat cut is never pleasant this is why you called me here licinia this is the disaster cicero spoke of a murder in the house of the vestals she whispered unheardof sacrilege i fought back my queasiness rufus had produced a cup of wine which he pressed into my hand i gratefully drank it down i think we had best begin at the beginning i said what in jupiters name are you doing here catilina he cleared his throat and swallowed a smile flickered or his lips and vanished as if it were only a nervous tick fabia summoned me or at least thats what i thought how so i received this earlier tonight he produced a scrap of folded parchment come at once to my room in the house of the vestals ignore the danger i beg you my honor is at stake and i dare not confide in anyone else only you can help me destroy this note after you have read it fabia i pondered it for a while did you send this note fabia never how was it delivered to you catilina a messenger came to my house on the palatine a hired boy from the streets are you in the habit of receiving messages from vestals not at all yet you believed this message to be genuine were you not surprised to receive such an intimate communication from a vestal he smiled indulgently the vestals live a chaste life gordianus not a secluded one it shouldnt surprise you that i know fabia were both from old families weve met at the theater in the forum at private dinners i have even though rarely and always in daylight and in the presence of chaperones visited her here in the house of the vestals we share an interest in greek poets and arretine vases our behavior in public has always been above reproach yes i was surprised to receive her message but only because it was so alarming yet you chose to do as it requestedto come here in the middle of the night to flout the laws of men and gods he laughed softly the blackness of his beard made his smile all the more dazzling really gordianus what better excuse to break those laws could a man ever hope for than to come to the rescue of a vestal in distress of course i came his face grew sober i realize now that i probably did not come alone you were followed at the time i wasnt sure walking alone in rome at night one always tends to imagine lurkers in the shadows but yes i think i may have been followed by one man or many he shrugged by this man i indicated the corpse catilina shrugged again ive never seen him before hes certainly dressed for stalkinga black cloak with a black hood to cover his head where is the weapon that killed him did you not see it he pushed back the curtains again and indicated a dagger that lay in a pool of blood farther down the passage i fetched a lamp and examined it a very nastylooking bladeas long as a mans hand and half as wide so sharp that even through the blood the edge glitters your knife catilina of course not i didnt kill him then who did if we knew that you wouldnt be here he rolled his eyes and then smiled as sweetly as a child at that moment it was hard to imagine him slitting another mans throat if this dagger doesnt belong to you catilina then where is your knife i have no knife what you went walking across rome on a moonless night and carried no weapon he nodded catilina how am i to believe you believe me or not the house of the vestals is only a short walk from my house through what is after all one of the better neighborhoods in the city i dont like to carry a knife im always cutting my fingers the half smile flickered on his lips again perhaps you should continue with your story of the nights events a fabricated note summoned you here you arrived at the entrance to find the doors open wide as usual i must admit it took some courage to step across the threshold but all was quiet and so far asi could tell no one saw me i have some knowledge of the layout of this place from visiting it in daylight i came directly to this room and found fabia sitting in her chair reading she seemed surprised to see me i must admit you must believe him said fabia speaking chiefly to licinia i would never have sent such a note i had no idea he was coming and then what happened i said catilina shrugged we shared a quiet laugh together you found the situation funny why not im always playing jokes on my friends and they on me i assumed that one of them had tricked me into coming here of all places you must agree its rich except that i see a dead body on the floor yes that he said wrinkling his nose i was preparing to gooh yes i lingered for a few moments savoring the delicious danger of the situation what man would notand then there came a terrible cry from behind that curtain the sort of sound a man makes i suppose when hes having his throat cut i pulled back the curtain and there he was writhing on the floor you saw no sign of the murderer only the knife on the floor still spinning about in that pool of blood you didnt pursue the killer i confess that i was paralyzed with shock a few moments later of course the vestals began arriving the cry was heard all over the house said licinia i arrived first the others came soon after and what did you see the body of course and fabia and catilina huddled together can you be more precise i dont understand licinia you force me to be crude how were they dressed why exactly as they are now catilina in his tunic fabia in her vestments and the bed was just as you see it unsleptin if you are insinuating i insinuate nothing licinia i only wish to see the event exactly as it occurred and quite a sight it was said catilina his eyelids droopy a bloody corpse a dagger six vestals swooning all around what an extraordinary moment when you think of it how many men can claim to have been at the center of such an wild and sensual tableau catilina you are absurd said rufus with disgust no one saw the killer escaping neither you licinia nor any of the others no to be sure the courtyard was dark as it is now but i lost no time in sending one of the slave girls to close and bar the door then its possible that you trapped the villain here in the house so i hoped but weve searched the premises already and found no one then he escaped unless of course catilina invented him altogether no cried fabia catilina speaks the truth it happened just as he says catilina turned up his palms and raised his eyebrows there you have it gordianus would a vestal lie catilina this is not a joke you must realize how the circumstances appear who else but you had cause to murder this intruder to this he had no reply im no expert in religious law i said but its hard to imagine a more serious offense than committing murder in the house of the vestals even if you can somehow explain away your presence here tonightand few judges would find a forged note or a practical joke an adequate excusethe fact of the corpse remains in an ordinary murder case a roman citizen has the option of fleeing to some foreign land rather than face trial and punishment but when desecration is involved the authorities have no option for leniency unless of course you flee the city tonight he fixed me with a steady gaze his eyes seemed impossibly blue as if blue flames danced behind them though i may joke and make riddles gordianus never doubt that i understand the circumstance in which i find myself no i will not flee rome like a frightened cur and leave a young vestal to face a change of iniquity alone fabia began to weep catilina bit his lip if this was more than a practical joke and the corpse is proof of thatthen i think i might know who is behind it that would be a start who the same man who is behind the prosecution against licinia and crassus his name is publius clodius do you know him i know of him certainly a rabblerouser troublemaker and a personal enemy of mine a constant schemer a man of such low moral character that he would have no qualms about involving the vestal virgins in a plot to bring down his enemies so you suspect publius clodius of luring you here with a forged message and of having you followed but why would he send his man in after you why not have him raise the alarm from outside the house trapping you inside we still have no motive for this mans murder catilina shrugged i can tell you no more i shook my head ill do what i can ill want to question the other vestals and whatever slaves were in the house tonight that can wait for morning i may be able to track down the boy who brought you that message and thus trace it back to clodius or whomever i may be able to ferret out the man or men who followed you on your way here tonight if they exist they might be induced to tell what they know about the dead man and his reason for being here all this is no more than circumstantial i fear but i might uncover something of use for your defense catilina still it looks very bad i see nothing more to be done tonight except perhaps to make another search of the premises we searched already and found nothing licinia said but we could search again said fabia please virgo maxima very well said licinia sternly summon some of the slave girls and see that theyre armed with knives from the kitchens well look again in every corner and crevice ill come with you said catilina to protect you he added looking at fabia the man were looking for is a desperate murderer after all licinia scowled but did not protest in the moonless courtyard beneath the colonnade i paused to let my eyes adjust to the darkness rufus bumped against me i stumbled and kicked a pebble that skittered across the stones the sound seemed loud in the stillness from the pool came a tiny splash the noise startled me and made my heart race only that frog again i thought still i saw phantoms in the shadows and shook my head at such imaginings in just such a way i thought catilina might have imagined being followed by men who were not there even so i felt in some way that rufus and i were not alone in the courtyard the faint chanting of the vestals from the nearby temple seemed to hover in the still air above us i sat on a bench close by the reeds at the edge of the pond and gazed at the stars that spangled its black surface rufus sat beside me what do you think gordianus i think we are in deep waters do you believe catilina do you not for a moment the man is false to the core all charm and no substance ah you compare him to cicero perhaps and find him wanting exactly and yet it seems true to his character that he would respond to such a reckless letter for the sheer novelty does it not that part of the story seems credible or is he so devious as to devise such a letter himself to use as a ruse if needed hes certainly wicked enough im not sure of that as for his innocence of the murder im impressed by his detail of finding the knife still spinning about in the pool of blood it seems too striking a detail to be invented on the spot you underestimate his cleverness gordianus or perhaps you underestimate his nobleness what if it was fabia who murdered the intruder and catilina is lying to protect her now that is truly absurd gordianus the girl is frail and timid and very much in love with catilina did you not see that rufus might she have killed in a frenzy to protect her lover this is too fantastic gordianus perhaps youre right the murmur of distant chanting and the pool full of stars carry me away i even find myself considering the possibility that it was licinia who wielded the knife the virgo maxima but for what purpose to deflect attention from her own impending trial to take vengeance on the young loversassuming they are lovers because she is insanely jealous of them or to protect them by killing the man sent to spy on thembecause she grows more sentimental as she grows older like myself except that her plan failed when the man cried out and the other vestals came running deep waters rufus agreed can we ever find the truth in bits and pieces i said and perhaps by looking where we dont expect to find it i rubbed my eyes and fought to stifle a yawn i closed my eyesfor just an instant i thought i awoke with a start at the touch of a hand on my shoulder and looked up to see catilina the search i said fruitless we looked behind every curtain under every couch inside every chamber pot i nodded then ill return to my house now if licinia will be kind enough to send some litterbearers to the foot of the stairs ill wait on the steps outside i began to walk toward the great barred doors i suppose this is the only time i shall ever be inside this place at such an hour of the night it has been a memorable experience not too unpleasant i hope said catilina he lowered his voice youll do what you can for me yes go snooping on my behalf locate that messenger boy uncover what you can about clodius and his schemes i dont forget my friends gordianus sometime in the future ill repay you of course i said and thought if you have a future catilina the vestal who had admitted us came to unbar the door she kept her eyes averted especially from catilina as the door swung open i heard a liquid plop from the pond i smiled at the vestal the frogs are restless tonight she shook her head wearily there are no frogs in the pond she said the door closed behind me i heard the bar fall i walked slowly down the steps a sudden wind blew through the forum carrying the smell of rain i looked up and saw the stars begin to vanish one by one behind a mantle of black clouds coming from the west suddenly i realized the truth i ran up the steps and knocked on the door at first softly when there was no answer i banged my fist against it the door gave a shudder and opened i slipped inside the vestal frowned at me confused catilina and fabia stood beside the pool with licinia and rufus nearby i walked to them quickly feeling the full strangeness of the starlight the distant chanting the atmosphere of sanctity and death within the forbidden walls the murderer is still here within the house i said here in our very presence suspicious glances passed from eye to eye licinia stepped back even fabia and catilina drew apart do you still have the knives you carried for your search licinia produced a kitchen knife from the folds of her stola as did fabia and you rufus he pulled out a short dagger as did i only catilina was without a weapon i walked to the edge of the pool when i entered the house of the vestals i saw reeds growing from the center of the poolonly from the center yet these reeds are very near the edge something keeps softly splashing yet there are no frogs in the pond i reached for the hollow reeds jerked them from the water and threw them onto the paving stones a moment later a man emerged from the water sputtering and choking he bolted and slipped struggling against the encumbrance of the sodden woolen cloak that hung on him like a coat of mail the cloak was black and hooded like the one his confederate had worn in the darkness he looked like a monster made of blackness emerging from a pool of nightmare then something swung through space glittering in the starlight he staggered toward me wielding his dagger it was catilina weaponless though he was who threw himself on the assassin the two of them tumbled into the water rufus and i ran after them into the pool but amid the foaming chaos it was impossible to strike a blow then the struggle was over as abruptly as it had begun catilina rose onto his hands and knees water dripping from his beard his eyes open wide as if he had surprised even himself with what he had done the assassin lay writhing in the water surrounded by an effusion that even in the dark water could not be mistaken for anything but blood the stars reflected in its murk were fiery red help me pull him from the water i said quickly rufus we dragged the man onto the paving stones his knife was plunged hiltdeep into his heart his fingers still gripped the handle his eyes were open wide he shuddered and twitched occasionally but his facebroadnosed beetlebrowed shadowed with stubblewas oddly peaceful the household slaves alerted by the noise gathered around from the temple of vesta the priestesses continued to chant oblivious like cicerolike catilina i suspecti am not a particularly religious man yet it seems to me that jupiter himself showed his favor to catilina at that moment would the assassin have confessed before he died had not a thin filament of jupiters own lightning bolted across the sky the dying man saw it his eyes grew wider rufus crouched over him and touched the mans hand where it gripped the pommel of his dagger i am an augur he said with a tone of authority that far exceeded his years despite his shock of red hair his freckles and bright brown eyes he did not look at all like a boy to me in that instant i read the auspices the lightning the man groaned on your righthand side the hand that grips the dagger in your heart a bad omen tell me augur the gods have come for you oh no look where they will find you in the house of the vestals with the blood of the man you murdered still warm they will be angry another bolt of lightning shattered the sky the heavens rumbled i have been an impious man i have offended the gods terribly yes and you had best appease them while you can confess what you have done here in the presence of the virgo maxima the man convulsed so violently that i thought he would die then and there but after a moment he rallied forgive me why did you come here i followed catilina on whose orders publius clodius i knew it whispered catilina what was your purpose we were to follow him into this house unseen we were to spy upon him in the vestals room i was to wait until the most compromising momentexcept that they never took their clothes off he laughed sharply and gasped with pain and then then i was to kill gnaeus the man who came with you yes but why why kill your partner how better to ruin catilina beyond hope than to have him caught naked with a vestal along with a corpse and a bloody dagger except that they wouldnt take off their clothes he barked out another laugh blood ran from the corner of his mouth so finally i went ahead and slit gnaeuss throat the poor fool never expected it then i was to escape in silence and raise an alarm outside the doors but i never counted on gnaeus making so loud a scream i dropped my knifeas clodius told me to do to be sure there was a weapon to incriminate catilina then i took gnaeuss knife and ran to the courtyard suddenly lamps began to appear from everywhere blocking my way to the doors i remembered a trick my old centurion taught me in the armyi slipped into the pool as quiet as a water snake and cut a reed to breathe through when i came up after a while to see how things stood the doors had been closed and barred with a vestal guarding it i slipped back under the water again and waited its like death beneath the water staring up at the black sky and all those stars lightning danced all around us both to the right and the left there was a great crack of thunder and the sky split open above our heads to release a torrent of rain the assassin gave a final convulsion stiffened and then grew limp as all rome knows the trials of the vestals licinia and fabia and their alleged paramours ended in acquittals all around licinia and crassus were tried simultaneously crassuss defense was novel but effective his reason for passionately pursuing licinia it turned out was not lust but simple greed it seems that she owned a villa on the outskirts of the city which he was determined to purchase at a bargain it is a measure of crassuss reputation for avarice that the judges accepted this excuse without question crassus was publicly embarrassed and made the butt of jokes for a season but i am told that he went on badgering licinia until he finally acquired the property at the price he wanted the separate trials of fabia and catilina quickly descended into political namecalling cicero remained noticeably absent from the proceedings but some of the most respected orators in rome spoke for the defense including piso catulus andprobably the only man in rome reputed to be more impervious to sexual temptation than ciceromarcus cato it was cato who made such bold insinuations about the machinations of clodius unprovable since the assassins were dead and the murder had been hushed up but damaging nonetheless that clodius found it convenient to flee rome and spend several months down in baiae waiting for the furor to pass afterward cicero privately thanked cato for defending his sisterinlaws honor cato haughtily replied that he did not do it for fabia but for the good of rome what a pair of prigs catilina was acquitted as well the insistence that he and fabia were discovered fully dressed weighed heavily in his favor for my own part i remain undecided about his guilt or innocence in regard to seducing fabia it seems strange to me that he should have spent so much time courting a young woman sworn to chastity unless his intentions were base and how did clodius know that catilina would respond to a forged note from fabia unless he had reason to believe that the two were already lovers the assassins repeated lament that they would not take off their clothes might seem on the surface to vindicate catilina and fabia but there are a great many things that two people can do while still more or less fully dressed catilinas intentions and motivations remain a mystery to me only time will tell what sort of character he truly is long after the trials were over i received an unexpected gift from the virgo maximaa scroll containing the collected poems of sappho eco seventeen now and a student of greek declares it his favorite book though i am not sure he is quite old enough to appreciate its manifold subtleties i like to take it from the shelf myself sometimes especially on long moonless nights and read from it softly aloud the moon is set and set are the pleiades and midnight soon so and the hour departing and i on my bedalone that passage in particular makes me think of licinia alone in her room in the house of the vestals
