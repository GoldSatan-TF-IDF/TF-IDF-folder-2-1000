jack higgins without mercy book in the sean dillon series to ed victor the mentor in my life with grateful thanks the gate of fear ibiza balearic islands the playa de toros in ibiza is a typical smalltown bullring a concrete circle benches ringed around average bulls toreros desperate to make their bones it was unbearably hot even on the shady side at four oclock in the afternoon as dillon waited at the barrera as the president led the procession on the band started to play the virgin of macarena that most poignant of paso dobles that promised only death down there in the ring death in the afternoon hemingway had called it the toreros tossed off their capes works of art in themselves to friends in the crowd who draped them over the barrera then the toreros were handed the plain fighting capes and made a few practice swings the horses of the picadors stirring uneasily there was a long moment a signal from the president and as a bugle sounded the red door on the far side the gate of fear burst open the bull came through from the darkness a runaway train that skidded to a halt as the crowd roared peons moved out to try him capes ready the scene looking like the most dangerous thing on earth but dillon knew no fear he vaulted over the barrera down into the arena the crowd roared as he ran forward and flung himself on his knees in front of the bull and bared his chest hey toro just for me the pass of death because he knew that was all it would take and he deserved it she was dead and it was his fault and the bull charged the crowd screamed and he cried out and came awake sitting up in bed soaked in sweat and more afraid than he had ever been washington it was washington early evening bad march weather but general charles ferguson comforted by the luxury of the hayadams hotel stood at a window of the bar and enjoyed a scotch and soda newly arrived from london he was curiously exhilarated by the rain pounding against the window and his proximity to the white house on the other hand he also just liked the hotel for its own sake in its sheer luxury it was everything a hotel should be and anybody who was anybody stayed there the great and the good and the power brokers whatever else he was he was certainly that the man responsible for running a special intelligence unit out of the ministry of defence in london responsible only to the prime minister of the day irrespective of politics the man for whom he waited blake johnson was head of a unit at the white house called the basement it had been in existence since the cold war days an intelligence unit answerable only to the current president totally separate from the cia fbi and the secret service they had achieved great things together ferguson could see the main entrance of the hotel where now a limousine drew up and two men got out and hurried up the steps blake johnson was a tall handsome man in his midfifties the man with him was very big and very black clancy smith once the youngest sergeant major in the marine corps and now the presidents favorite secret service man ferguson greeted them warmly great to see you both no dillon this trip johnson asked he was referring to sean dillon in the past a feared ira enforcer now ferguson s strong right hand there didnt seem any need and hes concerned about hannah bernstein shes really in a very bad way thanks to that russian bastard ashimov president cazalet will want to hear all about that lets go they drove along constitution avenue toward the white house where as usual these days and in spite of the weather there were demonstrators their driver tried the east entrance where they were greeted warmly by a secret service agent on duty who escorted them to the presidents secretary a pleasant and cheerful lady who admitted them to the oval office there they found jake cazalet in shirtsleeves at his desk as usual working his way through a pile of documents so you made it i heard the weather wasnt too good cazalet came round the desk and shook ferguson warmly by the hand good to see you general as always i think whiskey is in order considering this damn rain clancy if youd be kind enough to do the honors he turned to the other two and said to ferguson you took a bullet in the shoulder i understand i was lucky mr president a bad crease thanks to the ira mercenaries employed by belovs people but thats all josef belov the billionaire head of belov international had once been a colonel in charge of the kgbs old department his intentions now were as they had been then disruption of the western world as much as possible encouragement and financial support for terrorism of all kinds he had very nearly succeeded in assassinating president cazalet and thwarted in that he had been successful in injuring ferguson and putting one of his best operatives superintendent hannah bernstein of special branch in the hospital belov had been killed in a shootout in ireland along with his agents yuri ashimov and major greta novikova of the gru as well as assorted ira gunsforhire but the pain they had caused lingered on in both the body and the soul belov was backed by the russian government at the highest level clancy handed out the drinks and then stood against the wall behind them arms folded right tell me the worst cazalet said id say thats hannah bernstein blake told him cazalet was immediately concerned just how bad is she very ferguson told him ashimov ran her down in the street deliberately shes undergoing treatment at a specialized neurological unit right now anything we can do general just ask that goes without saying shes in good hands sir shes in the care of george dawson one of the best brain surgeons in the business but theres a limit to what the human body can stand mr president this could be the end of her career she wont like that there was silence for there was nothing to say after a while ferguson carried on thanks to the efforts of major roper our computer expert we established that major ashimov had fled to belovs house in county louth in company with novikova he also established that belov himself was there but about to leave for moscow and knowing dillon he decided to stop him ferguson nodded by a beach drop backed up by young billy salter our young gangster friend he does get around must have been difficult though mr president that is a particularly ira area there isnt a policeman for miles and strangers stick out like sore thumbs any kind of trouble people keep their heads down and stay indoors they dont want to know it was a very tricky drop so what was the body count three ira in the house plus ashimov novikova belov and an ira man named tod murphy made it out to sea in a boat but dillon had rigged it with a little semtex and detonated it by remote control by god hes a ruthless bastard cazalet said after that i think i could do with another one clancy clancy obliged and recharged their glasses it was blake who said the curious thing is this all took place three weeks ago and there hasnt been a word about it anywhere youd think that belovs death would have caused ripples at least the president turned to ferguson what does your major roper say that the ira link with belov international would explain the good people of drumore keeping their mouths shut but as regards the deaths of belov and the other six he shrugged they have to be accounted for one way or another blake said its as if it never happened not quite ferguson said which in part explains my visit roper picked up an item yesterday put out by belov international it concerns their huge development site at station gorky in eastern siberia which is about as far as you can get from the known world cazalet said they announced the arrival of their great leader one josef belov for an extended visit a photo was included are you sure it was him could have been an old photo blake put in ferguson shrugged sure looked like him which brings me to another interesting thing roper uncovered the other year when oil concessions were up for grabs in venezuela belov was in paris putting himself about on the social scene except we know something else as well he was also in venezuela pulling a fast one on the opposition and sewing up those oil concessions why is it i feel like applauding cazalet said go on tell me who was the belov in paris did you have it checked indeed we did a french intelligence source tells us it was one max zubin an actor of sorts cabaret that sort of thing big in jewish theater in moscow apparently its not the first time hes impersonated belov so where is he now station gorky wherever his masters need him blake said cazalet nodded sean dillon has always been extremely thorough so i see no reason to doubt that whats left of the real josef belov is at the bottom of the irish sea off drumore point so what are they playing at ive no idea ferguson said we cant have that cazalet finished his drink blake if general ferguson agrees id like you to grab a lift in his gulfstream go back to london with him and help resolve this puzzle thats fine by me mr president ferguson told him excellent i want this matter resolved now lets enjoy a nice dinner and you can bring me up to date on the european situation london ferguson hadnt bothered with a steward on the trip over just his usual two pilots squadron leader lacey and flight lieutenant parry they passed the coast at thirty thousand feet and started out over the atlantic after a while parry appeared our american cousins have been more than generous sir he told ferguson plenty of intriguing grub in the kitchen area champagne in the fridge whats our estimated time of arrival we should hit farley field spot on four oclock general he returned to the cockpit ferguson said im going to make some calls excuse me he called london on his codex four first bellamy the doctor in charge of rosedene the special medical unit maintained for secret security service personnel mainly the victims of some black operation or other he found bellamy in his office its me hows hannah well the head tests are fine so theyre transferring her back here for continuing care the thing is the traumas shes had in the last two years have really dragged her down her heart isnt good not good at all is she receiving visitors her grandfather and father theyre being sensible not overdoing it its dillon ive had to have words with ferguson frowned why hed be round every five minutes if id let him in a funny kind of way he seems to blame himself for hannah being in this situation nonsense if theres ever a woman who knows her own mind its hannah bernstein shes always done the job because she wants to do the job its everything to her ill look in this evening he thought about it for a while then called roper at regency square roper was permanently confined to a wheelchair as the result of an ira bomb several years ago and his groundfloor apartment was designed to enable a severely handicapped person to fend for himself everything was state of the art from kitchen to bathroom facilities his computer equipment was state of the art as well some of it highly secret and obtained by ferguson s liberal use of muscle roper was at his computer bank when the general called so how did it go ferguson told him of his talk with cazalet ive got blake with me hes going to stay at my place for a day or two while we see if we can make any sense out of all this blakes got a point when he said its as if it never happened and thats what belov international is confirming by announcing belovs visit to station gorky well one thing is certain you know this goes to the highest level in moscow and that includes putin himself the worldwide economics involved are simply too important whatever has happened theres bound to be a kremlin connection then cant you find out what dammit man there must be traffic somewhere out there in cyberspace that has something to do with it not that ive seen have we got anyone who could nose around at drumore do an undercover job pretend to be a tourist or something hmm thats an idea if you see dillon mention it to him would you ill see you later ferguson sat there for a moment frowning then went to the small bar and helped himself to a scotch blake said problem bellamy at rosedene says dillons going through some sort of guilt feeling over hannah its as if he feels responsible for her condition theyve always had a strange relationship those two ferguson nodded she could never forgive him all those years with the ira all those deaths she could never accept that his slate could be wiped clean and dillon always saw it as a great game hes a walking contradiction warm and humorous yet he kills at the drop of a hat theres nothing i could ask him to do that he would find too outrageous everything a challenge blake said nothing too dangerous and on so many occasions shes been dragged along with him and you think thats what makes him feel guilty now something like that and where would that leave you after all you give the orders charles dont you think i know that ferguson swallowed his scotch down and looked at the empty glass bleakly you know i think ill have the other half why not blake said and ill join you you look as if you could do with the company dillon arrived at rosedene in the middle of the afternoon parked his mini cooper outside and went in as he approached the desk professor henry bellamy came out of his office now look sean shes just been moved you know that give her a chance to settle in how is she dillons face was very pale what do you expect me to say as well as can be expected at that moment rabbi julian bernstein hannahs grandfather came out of the hospitality room he put both hands on dillons shoulders sean you look terrible bellamy eased himself away dillon said this life of hannahs rabbi ive said it before you must hate it you must hate us all my dear boy its the life she chose im a practical man jews have to be i accept that there are people who elect to take on the kind of work that ordinary members of society dont want to well soil their hands with youve seen her yes shes very tired but i think you may say hello show your face and then go room ten he patted dillon on the shoulder turned away and dillon passed through the doors to the rear corridor when he went in the room was in half darkness the matron maggie duncan drawing the curtains she turned and came forward her voice had a tinge of the scottish highlands about it here you are again sean what am i going to do with you she patted his face god knows ive patched you up enough times over the years you cant patch me up this time maggie how is she they both turned and looked at hannah bernstein festooned in a seemingly endless web of tubes and drips oxygen equipment and electronic screens her eyes were closed the lids almost translucent maggie said shes very weak its a huge load for her heart to bear it would be we expected too much from her all of us especially me dillon said when she was in last year when that party of god terrorist shot her we used to talk a lot and mainly about you shes very fond of you sean oh she might not approve but shes very fond id like to believe that dillon said but lets say i dont deserve it hannahs eyelids flickered open she said softly whats wrong sean feeling sorry for yourself the hard man of the ira damn sorry he told her and you putting the fear of god in me oh dear im in the wrong again maggie duncan said two minutes sean and ill be back she went out the door closed softly and dillon stood at the end of the bed mea culpa he said there you go blaming yourself again its a kind of selfjustification no worse an overindulgence is that some kind of irish thing damn you he said no damn you though thats been taken care of she frowned what a terrible thing to say how could i she reached out her thin left hand which he took and she gripped his hand with surprising strength youre a good man sean a good man in spite of yourself ive always known that the grip slackened and dillon almost choking with emotion let her hand go gently the eyes closed and when she spoke again her voice was barely more than a whisper night bless sean dillon made it out to the corridor where he leaned against the wall breathing deeply a young nurse pushing a trolley approached and paused at the door glancing at him with a frown she was pretty enough high cheekbones dark eyes are you all right her accent was dublin irish he nodded im fine what are you doing seeing to the superintendents medication i think shes gone to sleep again ah then it can wait she pushed the trolley away he paused watching her go then made for reception ignoring maggie duncans call from behind went down the entrance steps to the car park and headed for the mini cooper roper having fruitlessly tried some obvious routes through the computer sat back frustrated of course the real problem was that he didnt really know what he was looking for but one thing was certain there was something wrong here what was it blake had said it was as if it had never happened but it had time to get back to basics he said softly and called dillon on his codex four where are you i was with hannah at rosedene ive just parked outside saint pauls visiting the holy mother again are we how was hannah hanging in there good ive had a call from ferguson cazalet wants answers on the whole belov thing hes sent blake johnson over to help but its up to us and ferguson wants an explanation im going round to see the salters at the dark man so meet me there as soon as i can dillon had parked outside st pauls church around the corner from harley street for a reason the priest in charge was a professor of psychiatry at london university and was much used by people operating for ferguson who experienced mental problems this had applied to dillon on occasion he went up the steps to the entrance and entered through the small judas gate there was a smell of incense candles flaring beside a statue of the virgin and child a feeling of being apart separate from everyday life the sound of traffic outside very remote it reminded dillon of the church of his childhood in county down which was hardly surprising for st pauls church was anglocatholic the oldest branch of the church of england however it moved with the times enough to allow priests to marry and to allow a woman priest and there she was now a pleasant calm woman in cassock and clerical collar who had just opened the door of the vestry and was ushering a young woman inside she turned and there was immediate concern on her face sean she said then turned to the young woman go in for me mary put the kettle on she closed the door and said anxiously is it hannah shes not no dillon put a hand up in a strangely defensive gesture very poorly but not that the brains been cleared so shes been returned to rosedene but shes not good bellamys worried about the cumulative effect of all her injuries in the past few years it seems her hearts not as it should be but then youd expect that she embraced him holding him tight for a moment my dearest sean you want to see me as a psychiatrist or as a priest god knows isnt it what the truly wicked of this world do try and cover their backs his smile was cold and bleak anyway youre busy perhaps another time he walked to the great door and opened the small judas gate its appropriate dont you think especially for someone like me judas was a political terrorist called a zealot and my branch of the great game was the ira she shook her head gravely such talk is pointless sean he said tonelessly ashimov ran her down like a dog quite deliberately as i got to her she was trying to haul herself up by the railings and i told her youre all right just hold on to me but there was blood on her face and i was afraid it was different special in the wrong way when i was driving back to rosedene with her in the seat beside me i swore id kill ashimov if it was the last thing i did on top of the earth i thought it was billy who killed ashimov yes but i got all those others belov tod murphy even greta novikova im very evenhanded youve got to agree god bless you sean she said calmly for some reason it reminded him of hannahs last words to him at rosedene he recoiled god knows why stepped out through the judas gate stumbled down the steps to the mini cooper and drove away being a gangster was fine flashy and showy and menacing but harry salter had learned at the right stage in his life that the same talents employed in the business world could make you a fortune without costing you thirty years inside the dark man at wapping on cable wharf by the thames was the first property hed ever owned it was like a mascot in spite of everything else he had now the warehouse developments the clubs the casinos the millions hed made after giving up his career as one of the top guvnors in the london underworld it was a second home and it was there that dillon found him the bar was very victorian mirrors a long mahogany bar topped with marble porcelain beer pumps dora the barmaid reading the newspaper trade at that time of the afternoon was light salter sat in the corner booth with his nephew billy and his minders joe baxter and sam hall were enjoying a beer at the bar roper in his stateoftheart wheelchair wore a reefer coat his hair down to his shoulders his face a mass of scar tissue once a highly decorated bombdisposal expert his career had been terminated by one ira bomb too many in belfast soon a new career had beckoned and in the world of cyberspace he was already a legend so there you are roper said and twice as handsome harry salter put in dillon went to the bar and said to dora the usual she poured a large bushmills which he took down in a single swallow he put the glass down and she refilled it roper said to the others fergusons on his way back from washington after seeing cazalet about belov international the president wants answers so hes sent blake with him to help out dillon took down his second drink have you shared the news about belovs miraculous rebirth his appearance in siberia at station gorky i have rebirth my arse billy said come off it dillon all this talk of some double is rubbish the photo on the web site could have been taken anytime im not so sure about that harry said look at the second world war doubles all over the place hitler churchill even rommel id say the double story is genuine roper said that time in venezuela and paris he couldnt have been in two places at once yes but the important question isnt whether they have a fake belov out there harry said the question is why but never mind that for now i hear youve been to see the superintendent dillon how was she not good i never was very fond of coppers but bernstein is special harry salter said billy nodded a lovely lady if it hadnt been for her wed never have got together with you dillon roper said how was that really you never heard that story billy carried on well prime minister john major was hosting a function for president clinton at the house of commons there was a question of security dillon said it was crap and that he could make it onto the terrace dressed as a waiter he what roper was incredulous but it could only be done from the river see he conned bernstein into finding him the biggest expert on the river thames only it wasnt anyone in customs or the river police it was me harry said he smiled god bless her she never forgave dillon and why would that be wed a little bit of business diamonds on a boat from amsterdam coming upriver there was an informer at work bernstein knew we were going to be nicked that night here on the wharf wed have gone down the steps for ten years each only dillon here decided to be a naughty boy again which meant the police didnt catch us with the loot roper turned to dillon you dog dillon reached for the third bushmills dora had poured its been said before the superintendent wasnt pleased at all since she works for ferguson shes covered by the official secrets act which meant she couldnt open her mouth salter shook his head so as i said i dont think she ever forgave dillon for that especially as with our assistance he did indeed make it to the terrace at the house of commons dressed as a waiter and served canapés to president clinton the prime minister ferguson and let me guess roper said superintendent hannah bernstein to be accurate chief inspector as she was then billy said his uncle nodded and still a lovely girl he shook his head however if we were capable of getting dillon onto the terrace at the house of commons to serve canapés to the president of the united states we ought to be able to come up with an answer to this present puzzle and thats what it is roper said we all know what happened at drumore so whats all this business with belov international the thing is dillon said we know but for obvious reasons we cant advertise the fact belov international could be banking on that but for what purpose roper demanded life goes on even where big business is concerned especially where big business is concerned dillon said especially international companies worth six or seven billion with powerful government forces behind them and the bleeding cold war starting all over again harry said or so i was reading in the times last week there was a slightly stunned silence as they all looked at him and he shrugged so i read the times now and again thats where you learn about these things so what youre saying is that the new president of belov international might just be putin himself well it would be nice to think so because at least you can pronounce it harry replied not like most russian names anyway its clear that theyre staying mum about this and obviously ferguson cant say publicly that hes got a few wild men going round knocking off the opposition on behalf of the prime minister so its a stalemate roper said a kind of youknowthatweknowandweknowthatyouknow situation i still wish i knew why to hell with it billy said this is what i do know dillon and i went up to drumore place and took them on i personally shot ashimov in the shoulder turned him round and gave it to him in the back murphy novikova and belov fled out to sea but then dillon pointed his howler pressed the button and blew them to hell i saw it with my own eyes now can we all have a drink on it before dillon works his way through the bar stock at rosedene in late afternoon rabbi bernstein had left and professor bellamy had given him a lift it was quiet in the corridor as the young nurse dillon had spoken to earlier pushed her trolley along her name was mary killane and hed been right her accent was dublin although she was born in londonderry in the north of ireland in shed been taken to dublin at an early age because her father an ira activist had been condemned to the maze prison on five life sentences for murder and had died there of cancer something for which she had never forgiven the british government at the earliest opportunity she had joined the provisional ira and in spite of a respectable professional life remained a sleeper available when required the call to her present assignment had been out of the blue it had come from liam bell once chief of staff of the provisional ira now retired to dublin to lecture in english at the university and write a book or two for after all things were different with the peace process except that nothing had really changed that was the fault of the bloody brits and people like liam bell were still needed to carry on the fight just in a different way she was instructed to book with a nursing agency in london where a friend to the organization would see that she was allocated to the rosedene in st johns wood there she would await orders but she didnt have to wait long returning to her small flat in kilburn one night shed unlocked the door walked in and to her astonishment found liam bell himself sitting smoking a cigarette and a hard young man in a black bomber jacket dark hair curling down to his neck lounging by the window he was a dangerouslooking man with the air of a medieval bravo about him the shock she experienced was sexual in its intensity no need to worry girl dear bell reassured her theres work to be done of great importance to the movement and i know you can be relied on to do it no one has a greater right than you to strike back she was filled with emotion anything mr bell id give my life no need of that im back to dublin in the morning but dermot here dermot fitzgerald will look out for you hes a scholar and a gentleman a pleasure fitzgerald said the thing is bell told her theres a patient at the rosedene dangerous to our cause shes a special branch superintendent and responsible for the death or imprisonment of many of your comrades you can take my word for it oh i do shes been at the cromwell weve friends there and i understand shell be transferred back to the rosedene tomorrow he took a small envelope from an inner pocket and offered it to her this is something to help her on her way put her out of her suffering if you like its called dazone a special drug from the states if the hearts bad it helps thats one pill but three he shrugged its good night vienna are you up to this youve powerful memories concerning your father but say the word she took the envelope of course i will its a wonderful chance to serve good girl he patted her hand and got up ill be on my way look after her dermot i will mr bell and at the hospital you watch out for a man called sean dillon a damned traitor to us all he left and walked along the street to a mercedes where a man in a dark trench coat sat behind the wheel his name was igor levin and he was a commercial attaché at the russian embassy or claimed to be taken care of oh yes bell said you got a good look at her mary killane naturally keep a close eye just in case anything goes wrong the man fitzgerald do you want anything to happen to him afterwards jesus no hes too valuable hell be away out of it probably ibiza itll be a big payday for him levin said well well get you back to ballykelly then you wont have trouble at the airfield youve served time in the maze prison surely i have a false passport there are people in this town whod love to know what im up to always the old fox its whats kept me ahead of the game all these years so what happens now mary killane had asked after bell had gone dermot had kissed her boldly which thrilled her to her toes shed known there was something between them shed felt it we could start with that he said or we could go around the corner and have a drink and a bit to eat first whats your pleasure lass they ended up having the drink first and then dermot had bedded her and the whole thing felt like the most special time in her life now pushing the trolley up the corridor to hannahs room the moment of truth had arrived she felt surprisingly calm remembering what had been done to her father and to so many others and that this woman this police superintendent had been responsible for so much of it she opened the door and pushed the trolley in shed checked up on dazone it took half an hour to kick in which was why shed left it to the end of her shift the curtains were drawn the small bed light the only illumination hannah bernstein looked pale almost skeletal eyes closed mary killane had the pills ready in a small plastic cup a little water in another one hannahs eyes flickered open she said drowsily what is it your medication the woman said surprising how easy it was there you go ill help you drink and then it was over youll sleep now thank you came the murmur and mary killane pushed the trolley out in the staff room she didnt change out of her uniform simply pulled on a raincoat got her handbag from her locker and went out as she reached the entrance foyer maggie duncan emerged from her office another shift over mary thats right matron have you given any thought to what i said wed like to have you with us fulltime agency work is no way to live im thinking about it you do that is the superintendent all right ive seen to her good ill see you tomorrow then mary killane hurried across the car park speaking into her mobile at the same time its done good girl dermot fitzgerald replied ill be with you as arranged she hurried on excited now turned a corner and moved along a dark road a small bridge at the end crossing a canal there was only a single oldfashioned gas lamp giving any light but she felt no fear there was a footfall behind her and she turned to see him emerging out of the shadows a smile on his face jesus dermot well have to move it if were to get to the airport in time for the dublin plane he kissed her on the cheek lightly dont fret everythings fine youre sure you gave her the pills absolutely they kick in in half an hour but it will be quite a while before anyone twigs theres something wrong its her heart theyve been worried about anyway excellent youve done an amazing job pity it has to end this way what are you talking about she said bewildered his right hand came out of the pocket of his reefer coat clutching a silenced colt pistol he rammed it into her fired twice and pushed with his left hand so that she went backward over the rail into the canal below he walked to the end of the street and the lights of a mercedes switched on he got into the passenger seat and igor levin said thats it then mission accomplished your bag is in the back ill drop you at heathrow ibiza next stop fitzgerald lit a cigarette i cant wait to get in the water at rosedene hannah bernstein sighed gently and stopped breathing the alarm sounded a jarring ugly sound a young probationer nurse was nearest and got to her first followed by maggie duncan then bellamy within seconds the entire crash team was swinging into action not that it did any kind of good they finally switched off maggie was crying bellamys face was bleak time of death five thirtyfive agreed matron yes professor strange the turns of life he said so many people loved her yet at the end not one of them was here he shook his head id better make some phone calls im not looking forward to that especially dillon all of them really the gulfstream was an hour late due to bad headwinds it was just descending into the lights of farley field when ferguson got the call he listened his face grave im desperately sorry have you spoken to everybody yes how awful for her father and grandfather and dillon how was he i dont think he could take it in he was at the dark man with roper and the others he passed the phone to roper and apparently rushed out roper said he and the salters would go after him hes probably gone to rosedene you know her religion will have an impact here im not sure theyll allow an autopsy find out would you thank you doctor and well talk again ferguson sat there face grave as the gulfstream rolled to a halt then told blake the bad news blake was shocked how terrible he raised the inevitable question you mentioned an autopsy thats not certain generally theyre not allowed the jewish body is considered sacred and the corpse must be buried within twentyfour hours however if it can be argued that an autopsy could save another life for instance by helping to apprehend a killer and prevent him killing again then there are exceptions youd need an expert rabbi to determine that sounds complicated particularly as she worked for me under the official secrets act they disembarked and as they walked toward the small terminal fergusons daimler drew up and dillon got out from behind the wheel he leaned against the daimler and lit a marlboro his face was curiously expressionless blake charles good flight thought id come myself ferguson said im damn sorry sean damn sorry youll be sorry yourself when you hear my news get in and well move out they did sitting in the rear while dillon drove what have you got for me then ferguson asked the last person to see hannah alive was a dublin girl an agency nurse named mary killane maggie duncan spoke to her when she finished her shift half an hour later the alarm went off in hannahs room and she died in spite of the crash team whats your point sean ferguson was gentle an hour and a half ago a man walking his dog by the canal some ten minutes from rosedene found a dead woman halfin halfout of the water her handbag was still caught around one wrist it was mary killane my god blake said thats a strange coincidence and you know i dont believe in coincidences especially with two bullets in her dillon told him george langleys going to do the autopsy tonight hes at the scene of the crime now they traveled in silence for a while and it was blake who said it smells to high heaven hannah dies and then someone wastes the last nurse to deal with her and somehow a dead belov is walking around in siberia ferguson said ive got an uneasy feeling theyre all related but like billy said earlier dillon told him if theres one certainty in the matter its that belov is dead and what if he isnt blake put in i know what i did maybe something else happened something you werent aware of in your dreams dillon told him maybe but ill tell you what i think i was with the fbi for a long time and any good cop will tell you that experience tells you to go with your instincts and my instincts tell me that everything is linked to what happened at drumore place thats where weve got to begin and he was right of course drumore place dublin moscow three weeks earlier sean dillon and billy salter were at drumore place that great house that was josef belovs pride and joy engaged in a desperate firefight while the villagers kept their heads down inside their cottages at the royal george patrick ryan had the shutters up while his mother who was the cook at drumore place and old hamilton the butler cowered in the kitchen where ryan joined them mother mary its just like the old days she moaned sure and they never went away he told her which was true for this was still provisional ira country to the core he splashed whiskey into three glasses get that down you and shut up its none of our affair the nearest police are twenty miles up the coast one sergeant and three men and theyd drive the other way if they knew god save the good work he swallowed his whiskey down and crossed himself as sporadic shooting continued there was silence for a while and then they heard a boat engine start in to life down in the harbor it increased in power and ryan hurried through the bar opened the door and peered out it had left the tiny harbor and moved beyond the point when the explosion took place there was a momentary ball of fire and as it cleared he saw the boat half under the water the stern raised and it looked as if someone was scrambling over but he could not be certain for a cloud passed over the moon hamilton appeared beside him and the old lady what is it some sort of explosion on the kathleen i cant be sure but i think i saw someone im going to check youll need some help get some of the men dont be daft theyll all stay close to home this night he hurried out to his old land rover got behind the wheel and drove away down through the village following the narrow road toward the point no more than five minutes away got out and ran toward the top of the steps leading down to the small beach below it was very dark down there only the waves dashing in and then the cloud moved away and the moon shone through and he saw something head and shoulders perhaps and started down greta novikova had been standing in the stern of the kathleen belov and tod murphy in the wheelhouse when the explosion took place in the engine room the two men didnt stand a chance but the force of the blast a great wind drove her across the stern rail as the shattered boat lifted and then dove down to its last resting place she plunged headfirst into the water lucky enough to slide to one side and miss the propellers she went under and surfaced turning as the sea swallowed the kathleen an undertow sucked at her as if greedy to take her with it and frightened and dazed she screamed and kicked out toward the cliffs of the point there was a trench in the seabed at that place fully fifty fathoms deep so that as the kathleen descended rapidly there was turbulence on the surface waves driving toward the small beach increasing in force and taking her with them in the moonlight she saw ryan plunging kneedeep in the water to reach for her she cried out he grabbed waistdeep in water pulling her close ive got you he waded onto the beach pulling her behind him he held her close as she gasped for air who was with you belov tod murphy and kelly and the others there was a shootout at drumore place i dont know you must take me there jesus woman youre in no fit state to go anywhere theres blood on your face you must have taken a hell of a battering i must find out whats happened to major ashimov i must and it was kelly he was worried about after all if kelly was still around there was the ira to consider he patted her shoulder ive got the land rover at the top of the steps ill take you now yuri ashimov knew none of this for he was unconscious facedown at drumore place not dead in spite of the two bullets billy salter had pumped into him thanks to the nylonandtitanium vest hed been wearing beneath his shirt an invention of the wilkinson sword company it was efficient enough to block even a bullet on the other hand the shock to the cardiovascular system usually caused unconsciousness for a while lying there he stirred and groaned moved a little and pulled himself up he shook his head to clear it remembering firing his pistol at dillon knocking the ak from his hands thinking hed got the bastard and then the shot catching his shoulder spinning him round and his last memory billy salters face as hed fired the heart shot there was a chair nearby he reached for it pulled himself up and sat down he heard a footfall and one of kellys men toby mcguire appeared in the archway what happened to you ashimov asked harshly i was waiting in the summerhouse somebody jumped me knocked me out with a rifle stock where is everybody kellys dead and oneill i was up and around when dillon and the other guy came out on the terrace i kept out of the way but i heard what they were saying and what was that toby mcguire took a deep shuddering breath and told him about the kathleen and what had happened ashimov sat there thinking about it so thats what he said about major novikova if she wasnt willing to take the risks she shouldnt have joined that was it then he said to this guy billy i expect our day will come oh it will ashimov nodded you can count on it so they went he said he had all the keys to the cars in the courtyard two hours to belfast and then home thats what he said right ashimov rose picked up his pistol from the floor and put it in his waistband mcguire said what happens now its a right mess yes it is but we made some contingency plans well be all right the main thing is that youre still on board is that understood mcguire looked baffled right major it isnt so much what i say its what the man in dublin says the provisional ira will take care of the cleanup here therell be a new team to take over from kelly and youll be a part of it if you say so major i do now go to the kitchen and see if you can find some spare keys for the cars on my way mcguire went out and ashimov went along to belovs study and sat behind the desk with the satellite phone and rang a moscow number it was astonishing the clarity of these things he thought and also thought of greta surprised at how angry he felt a voice said in russian volkov whos this ashimov at drumore we have a problem explain when he was finished volkov said thats certainly inconvenient but our backup plans are in place youll need to come to moscow for a meeting at once of course send a jet for me youll make the new arrangements with the ira no need everythings still set excellent the death of belov would be very inconvenient to our business plans of course another performance from max zubin would be in order i think i agree on the other hand the fewer people who know the better the locals should not be told that belov is dead you mean i should withhold the information from the ira that would seem sensible all right good ill arrange the plane see you soon ashimov switched off the phone put it down and thats when he received the shock of his life he looked up to find greta novikova standing in the doorway patrick ryans arm around her and he was amazed at the feeling of joy that flooded through him he had never been a man to feel much emotion for anyone and surprised himself by rushing round the desk and embracing her greta i cant believe it i heard what happened he kissed her then held her at arms length my god what happened to you i cant believe im here she said what about you salter thought he killed me but i was wearing body armor belov murphy gone she said its a miracle im here and she explained about the blast there was blood on the left side of her head and he examined it its not too bad but it might need a couple of stitches well get that fixed by the good sisters at saint marys near ballykelly the sisters she was bewildered theyre a nursing order belov does a lot for them ryan had gone away and now returned with the kitchen firstaid box he rummaged in it and produced a large bandage and ashimov patched her up mcguire was hovering in the background greta staggered a little and ashimov caught her take it easy ill take you upstairs to your room so you can change what for were going to moscow a plane is coming to pick us up as he led her out he said to the other two wait for me in dublin liam bell sat in the sitting room of his apartment in a warehouse development he was reading the evening paper his spectacles giving him the look of a schoolteacher which in his youth hed been many years of dedicated service to the ira had take him as far as chief of staff hed resigned a year earlier to nurse his wife through terminal cancer and another had taken his place in the command structure now he was bored out of his mind and thirsting for action any kind of action and his phone rang and presented him with some ashimov said mr bell yuri ashimov several years ago you made a promise that we could call you if needed you still can do you know a man called sean dillon indeed i do if that bastards on your back youve got trouble listen to me would you be prepared to move in here with say half a dozen ira men id make it worth your while i thought you had dermot kelly and his boys not any longer what happened ashimov gave him a version of events that excluded any participation by belov anyway a general cleanup is in order you can rely on patrick ryan hes a good man i was two years in the maze prison with him hes one of our own bell laughed harshly what a bastard dillon is ive had my brushes with him anyway ive phone calls to make recruiting to do you can leave it with me and the disposal of the corpses im an expert in that department ill keep in touch ashimov walked through to the terrace and found ryan and mcguire standing by the body of kelly poor old kelly mcguire said he never knew what hit him and thats a fact ashimov took a silenced pistol from his lefthand pocket and shot mcguire in the side of the head he went down like a stone and patrick ryan jumped back hands raised fear on his face no for gods sake not you you fool but why because he knew josef belov is dead and that doesnt suit me or those involved with me in moscow listen here you know liam bell an old friend i think ryan was astonished of course i was in the same cell at the maze prison with him ive spoken to him in dublin hell be here within hours with a crew hell take over everything kelly was responsible for and hell take care of this lot he stirred mcguire with his foot theyll do a satisfactory disposal job i see hell expect you to fit in you know i could do that ryan said slowly i want you to be my eyes and ears ill make your fortune patrick put the royal george in your name would you like that ryans face lit up that would be grand one thing nobody not even liam bell must know that belov went down on that boat it was just tod murphy as far as bell knows ryan took a deep breath right im your man good mcguire should have some keys in his pocket get them would you ryan fished them out excellent they walked through to the hall and greta came down the great stairs in a fawn coat and black trouser suit a traveling bag slung over one shoulder you look better a lot better lets get moving ill be in touch patrick they went out and ryan waited he heard one of the cars start up outside and then move off it was very quiet too quiet but hed taken a step on the kind of journey from which there was no going back the convent looked more like a country house than anything else but inside it was a very different story the nuns were a nursing order the little sisters of pity and belov had put a great deal of money into the place a couple of operating theaters all sorts of medical facilities the result was a facility that was of great benefit to the local farming community and a further enhancement of the belov name the mother superior sister teresa was a general surgeon she saw greta at once in reception gave her a cursory check and frowned you have been in the wars what happened ashimov said quietly she was in an accident greta improvising said it was so stupid i was on a fishing boat moored in the harbor and i slipped stepping over the stern and fell several feet thats not good i fell into water such a fool well your heads going to need a stitch or two and i think well give you a quick scan do we have time for all that greta asked ashimov you can come and watch through the surgery window but not if you smoke sister teresa said and led greta out ashimov went outside to think things over and he did smoke in fact he smoked several going back over events he should have been dead but he wasnt thanks to belovs gift of the titanium vest ferguson would have been behind it because of what happened to bernstein the salters and dillon always dillon now belov was dead he thought of their years together in afghanistan iraq chechnya and this was what it had come to well they would all pay hed see to that his coded mobile rang and he answered it was volkov the plane should be with you in about thirty minutes has anything else happened ashimov told him of gretas astonishing escape thats good news she could be of great use liam bell is organizing things in dublin as we speak ive taken steps to ensure that he isnt aware of what really happened to belov i mean theres only one man left who knows besides myself and who would that be ashimov told him lets hope your judgment proves sound ill see you soon ashimov lit another cigarette volkov was one of the few men who impressed him a man of mystery way beyond the reach of any russian government organization he smiled slightly he was like ferguson in a way yes a russian ferguson responsible only to the president he threw the cigarette away as a plane roared overhead obviously coming in to land at the runway belov had ordered to be laid at the development there as he went back into reception mother teresa returned with greta five stitches im afraid but im good at embroidery no fracture but considerable bruising you must take care my dear my thanks ashimov told her but we must go that was our plane landing glad to have been of help give my regards to mr belov i certainly will he took gretas elbow and led her to the car are you all right he said as he helped her in the patch on the side of her forehead was neat enough and she touched it i had a local anesthetic i feel tired more than anything else he got behind the wheel you can sleep on the plane moscow next stop march in moscow was much as to be expected the snow had seemed to be on the verge of clearing but was back again when they landed a light powdering only but crisp and cold a limousine was waiting a mercedes and they drove away instantly to the belov international townhouse a place of some splendor but they had barely settled in when volkov called i need to see you at once bring the major with you where exactly the kremlin of course ashimov switched off and turned to greta how are you feeling shed slept like a log on the plane any better it was worse in chechnya not too good in iraq either come to think of it she smiled ill be fine yuri so you feel up to a visit to the kremlin her eyes sparkled my but we are moving in dangerous waters how exciting then lets go snow was falling lightly as they drove through the streets past the massive entrance to the kremlin moving through side streets until they emerged at an obscure entrance at the back they were passed through a series of checkpoints manned by uniformed guards but never once questioned simply waved through at each one until they reached a small courtyard behind high railings and halted at steps leading up to an archway they went up the door opened and a hard young man in an excellent suit appeared a pleasure to see you again major ashimov he inclined his head to greta major weve met before ashimov asked chechnya some years ago but i was a very junior officer you wouldnt remember my name is igor levin this way if you please general volkov is waiting he led the way through gloomy corridors and back stairs finally opening a door leading to a much larger and more ornate corridor there were gilt mirrors portraits from another age fine carpeting i must say this is beautiful i imagine that tsar nicholas thought so too levin said they came to an ornate door where a burly individual again in an excellent suit was seated in a high chair a machine pistol was on a small table beside him he didnt stand and didnt speak we like to be prepared for any eventuality levin said even in here greta said especially in here he opened a door and ushered them in without announcement and stood at the back of the room which was quite stunning very french its paneled walls were beautifully painted with formal scenes of the seventeenth century and there were portraits of the same period a magnificent fireplace with a real fire or so it appeared an exquisite mirror above it chairs and a settee decorated the room but the really striking thing was the huge desk in the center and the man who sat behind it he had looked up as they entered and was nothing like greta had expected he was perhaps sixty hair decidedly thinning wearing wire spectacles of an oldfashioned type a neat suit in navy blue a dark tie he could have been the manager of an insurance office this man who according to what ashimov had told her wielded such power when he spoke his voice was not much more than a whisper my dear ashimov so you made it in one piece again my luck is good comrade im never too sure whether you should call me that any longer old habits die hard volkov stood up came round the desk and shook hands with greta your luck is also good major yes comrade there was a power to him she realized that now and as he continued to hold her hand it flowed through her more than luck i think i believe in god you see like my blessed mother before me everything is for a purpose he patted her hand but i am a poor host and for a beautiful and brave young russian woman who has gone through the ordeal you have there is only one remedy the finest vodka we have he said to levin igor if you wouldnt mind of course not comrade general igor volkov told him gently i have told you never to use my title publicly i am suitably chastened comrade general hopeless come we sit by the fire and talk igor always seems to see the lighter side of life despite having served in afghanistan with the kgb at nineteen then the paratroopers in chechnya he was in the gru when he fell into my hands and now hes one of my security guards took a bullet for me once theres nothing like kgb training said ashimov yes now lets sit by the fire ive things to say levin opened a cupboard and produced an ice bucket containing a bottle of vodka and frosted glasses you will join us igor just one though you must remember your trigger finger the vodka was sublime and burned its way down excellent volkov told them damn ferguson and damn the prime minister another igor and then well get down to business they sat by the fire and volkov began this is the situation since the end of the iraq war belov international has continued to prosper since the vote for democracy in iraq the prospect is very real of the oil industry there returning to full flow indeed to achieve a level of production beyond all expectation and we are in the middle of it were talking a company worth fifteen billion and rising that would be staggering greta said and nothing must be allowed to put such success at risk in other words belov cant die igor will take you to see max zubin tonight well ship him off to station gorky to settle him in let the world know where he is and slip him back when necessary which will totally confuse ferguson and company in london ashimov said dillon having reported back on a successful mission and we mustnt forget president cazalet and that blake johnson man of his they always exchange information with their british cousins volkov pointed out greta said but after dillons report theyll know the belov in siberia is false yes but ferguson cant afford to disclose it admit that his agents acting on behalf of the prime minister conducted a slaughter in the republic of ireland a sovereign state where a highly important russian citizen happened to be at the same time so its a standoff ashimov said theres nothing the brits can do about it and we keep the world financial markets happy theres more to it than that this organization that ferguson runs the socalled prime ministers private army such typical british hypocrisy theyve been committing murders for years and getting away with it dillons record speaks for itself well the president thinks we should lance the boil as it were are you suggesting what i think you are yes total elimination of fergusons team once and for all the general himself his personal assistant this superintendent bernstein dillon of course and these salter people the london gangsters whove been helping him out during the last few years while youre at it perhaps cazalets man too blake johnson another thorough nuisance ill see what i can do ashimov said its a tall order i know but already started in a way that woman bernstein you ran down in london shes in a medical facility ferguson runs in saint johns wood it would be a good start to things if you could find some means of easing her on as you say comrade ashimov wasnt troubled in the slightest by the thought good volkov said i leave it all in your capable hands ive left you major novikova on the books of the london embassy as a commercial attaché it will bring you diplomatic immunity although im certain ferguson wont make a move against you at the worst they could only ask you to leave captain levin will have a similar situation at the embassy to act as backup the appropriate documentation is in the file on my desk he turned to ashimov i would think it prudent for you not to return to london if only because dillon would attempt retribution as you say comrade igor will take you to see max zubin to make certain he knows what is expected of him spend the night then return to ireland tomorrow igor will go with you i envy you your inevitable success i dont think theres anything more but there was for at that very moment a secret door in the wall swung open and president putin walked in they all leaped to their feet for it was an astonishing moment putin wore a tracksuit a towel around his neck you must excuse me comrades affairs of state got in the way of my hour in the gym this morning so ive been making up for it good to see you again major ashimov you must be feeling like a cat at the moment a tomcat naturally very much so comrade president putin turned to greta major novikova he offered his hand i hear good things about you even if you are gru it was his little joke a reference to the intense rivalry between the kgb to which he had once belonged and gru military intelligence greta said it would have been an honor to have served under you yes well in afghanistan this one did he tapped ashimov on the shoulder and captain levin the boy wonder he swiveled to look at volkov all of us served in good times and in bad served russia and each other i expect nothing less from you in this present matter there was a moments silence ashimov said it would be our honor putin nodded turned to volkov and handed him an envelope there is what you asked for read it volkov opened the envelope and took out a document which he unfolded aloud please from the office of the president of the russian federation at the kremlin the bearer of this letter acts with my full authority all personnel civil or military will assist in any way demanded signed vladimir putin it may help it may not its in your hands now putin stepped behind the secret door and it swung noiselessly back into place it was as if he had never been volkov replaced the letter in the envelope and gave it to ashimov such power you must guard it well now on your way he turned opened the secret door and disappeared as completely as had his master so there we are ashimov said what happens now im taking you out igor said theres a very acceptable nightclub called the green parrot its owned by the mafia but they know me there is a purpose to this i presume you want to see max zubin perform dont you on the way to the club it was greta who said were being followed good for you but its all right theyre my people theyll arrange zubins onward transportation to station gorky i dont understand greta said if zubin is so important why is he allowed to have so free a life to perform in public and so on because of his mother ashimov told her bella zubin greta was astounded the actress the great actress ashimov said one of russias finest unfortunately she dabbled too much in politics and was sent to the gulag i thought she was dead no very much alive at eightyfive and living in a comfortable condominium by the river her son would not wish to see her returned to a more uncomfortable situation thats why we could trust him not to make a run for it when he was playing belov in paris the other year greta shook her head i remember seeing her play the queen in hamlet when i was a little girl she was wonderful its a hard life greta ashimov said but some things are more important the green parrot was up a side street in an old brownstone house a neon sign advertising the fact over an arched doorway levin parked outside and the doorman stepped out you cant park there clear off the other limousine pulled in behind them and three men in black leather coats got out the doorman took one look and hurriedly backed off sorry comrades he opened the door behind him the three men went in first and levin ashimov and greta followed the club was small curiously oldfashioned a little like some joint in one of those cinema noir blackandwhite thrillers from the hollywood of the forties the headwaiter even wore a white tuxedo as if doing an impersonation of rick in casablanca he turned saw levin and his party and his face fell the tables were crowded but one of levins men brushed past the headwaiter as he came forward ignored the bearded man at the microphone who seemed to have the audience in stitches with his humor and leaned down to a table of five people in the front three women two men whatever he said was enough they vacated the table at once and moved away the man at the microphone said i know i can be bad but this is ridiculous levin called max youre looking good how about the piano a foggy day in london town you know how i love all those old numbers lets all cheer for fred astaire the yanks are our friends now he sat down with ashimov and greta the three minders stood against the wall max zubin shook his head and waving at the audience said the gru my friends what do you expect my master calls and i obey he went to the piano at the back of the stage a baby grand a drummer and a double bass player were already there and zubin sat down and started a driving complex version of foggy day that wouldnt have been out of place in any great piano bar in london or new york levin called the headwaiter over vodka on the house and dont forget the boys behind me it is my pleasure captain and a little beluga on toast the way i like it of course there was a roar of applause as zubin finished and levin stood up clapping marvelous he called more zubin moved into night and day and waiters appeared hurriedly with glasses of vodka on a tray each glass in a larger glass with crushed ice one waiter handing them out to the security guards the other to the party at the table the third distributing the beluga caviar as they started on the feast ashimov said you live well my friend i could be dead tomorrow thats what i learned in afghanistan and chechnya he crunched toast and savored the beluga wonderful isnt it greta said as she followed suit it was in the chechen capital i got a taste for it we took the grand hotel in a firefight a very bloody firefight found the beluga in the icebox behind the bar in the main kitchen a few of us survived that fight not many the twentyfirst independent parachute company made up of anyone they could reach out and grab we were wolfing that caviar down when we heard the piano start to play in the anteroom we went out to see what was going on and there he was an infantry captain named max zubin and what was he playing greta asked as time goes by i swear to god just like in casablanca you know the old movie ive seen it in american and ive seen it dubbed with bogart speaking russian and its just as fantastic he stood up applauded and called max lets do the grand in chechnya in memory of the twentyfirst and all those guys we left lets do as time goes by he sat down snapped his fingers for another vodka and ate some more toast and caviar somehow managing to hum the tune at the same time an enthusiast ashimov told greta the crowd seems to like it and indeed they did large sections singing along some in english others in russian zubin finished on a high people cheered stood up and clapped he waved to everyone nodded to the double bass player who put his instrument down and took over the piano then came down from the stage shaking hands on the way and sat down at the spare seat at the table levin smiled you havent lost your touch he handed him a vodka which zubin swallowed in one gulp then reached for another why are you being so nice to me igor levin said lets put it this way the beard suits you but its time to take it off again christ no max zubin groaned not that im afraid so surely you remember major ashimov from paris ill let him explain the zubin apartment was a time capsule from another age even the maid was aging and could have been out of a chekhov play the interior was more thirties than anything else with a grand piano covered by photos of the great and the good in silver frames levin ashimov and greta were admitted by the maid who viewed them all suspiciously is my mother at home sonia zubin asked where else would she be she is preparing to go to bed id like a word what a ridiculous time to call ill tell her youre here she went out and he lit a cigarette you must excuse sonia shes a failed actress who became my mothers dresser greta moved to the piano and examined the photos zubin sat at it and started to play falling in love again marlene dietrichs national anthem greta told him youll find her and my mother amongst the photos there greta was working her way through and picked one up my god this is her with laurence olivier in london where we did the three sisters a voice interrupted i made the mistake of coming back and there she was in the flesh wearing a silk robe her hair tied back powerful and thrilling in spite of her age ashimov stepped forward you look like some great warrior queen dont try flattery major i remember you well from that affair in paris so you need my son again im afraid so she turned to greta and whos this one major greta novikova of gru typecasting but good bone structure greta couldnt think of a thing to say bella did a surprising thing as sonia came in with the ritual glasses of vodka on a tray the old actress patted igor levin on the cheek he looks in on me from time to time this one a nice boy in spite of himself levin took her hand and kissed it no man could have a greater compliment they all took their vodka so this is state business direct from putin himself well to hell with him and to hell with the lot of you where are you taking him station gorky in siberia levin said for a while only youll see him again soon ashimov said and im supposed to believe that she turned to zubin youll have to get rid of the beard a pity it suits you she turned to levin can i have him for tonight where would he go levin smiled his escort will be downstairs i thought so all right the rest of you can get out id like some time with my son which they did there was not much else to say she turned to zubin who was still playing and raised her glass to sonia who came over with the vodka bottle if it wasnt for me you could make a run for it things are as they are mama so running is out of the question youre a good son max always were so its the same old thing as paris no i think this is rather more important theyve shown me a warrant from putin then god help us she swallowed her vodka down and tossed the glass into the fireplace onward from moscow the falcon rose to forty thousand feet and moved on into the night while levin slept and greta and ashimov talked in low voices whats the story on the boy wonder there she asked his father was an infantry colonel a military attaché at the london embassy his mother was english igor spent a couple of years at a posh public school in westminster london he should have gone to university but hes a strange one marches to his own drummer he went home on holiday and just decided to join the army without even consulting his father who couldnt do anything about it because it would have looked bad some kgb time was mentioned the paratroopers and now gru she said yes he became a war hero decorated twice the thing that singled him out for a commission was when he took out a chechnyan general as a sniper it was more complicated than that hes something of an actor and made a very convincing chechnyan worked himself close in slit the mans throat and walked off laughing my god thats the thing he really doesnt care not about anything his father was involved with belov in the old days so when the money started pouring in he got his share ten million sterling that kind of money he was killed in a car crash with his wife the other year which left igor very well fixed and all nicely stashed away in london so levin could be on the riviera champagne girls a yacht why not he reminds me of sean dillon in a way ashimov said dillon is also well fixed in the money department you could ask why he continues to live the life he does he poured greta a glass of champagne while she thought about it a kind of madness she asked a need to live on the dangerous edge you could have a point well if that means comparing him with dillon he must be mad when i was involved with dillon in iraq he seemed to be enjoying the whole business igor levin stirred and said its very simple life can be so boring he tilted up his seat if youve finished talking about me id like a glass of the old bubbles there ashimov said ah youre awake are you well first things first im going to need you igor so i have something for you when billy salter shot me at drumore my life was saved by a personal gift from belov a nylonandtitanium vest even stops a fortyfive fits nicely under your shirt he took a package from his briefcase my gift to you levin put it on the seat beside him frightfully good of you old boy but id still appreciate some champagne he spoke in an impeccable english public school accent greta poured him a glass theyll love you at the reform club i should damn well hope so he sipped some of the champagne i must say dillon sounds rather like the twin i never had i cant wait to meet him you wont have to wait long ashimov said after stopping at drumore were off to london for you to take up your new duties where i may be received with less than enthusiasm not when the ambassador sees your warrant from putin oh good im to have that am i he still spoke in that english upperclass accent ashimov opened a briefcase took out a file and passed it across heres everything you need to know on dillon ferguson roper and the salters these people are bad news my friend as bad as youve ever known levin flicked the file and it opened by chance at a printout about bernstein he went through it quickly what a woman this is an incredible record well dont fall in love with her shes the first one to go a nice jewish girl and you forget my father was jewish your mother was christian ashimov said you can only be a jew through your mother an academic argument all those wonderful genes they never go away if i was religious id say it was a blessing from god personally im rather proud of it good for you now read the file and see what youre getting into ill fill you in on the ira side of things later as you say levin settled back with the file while ashimov poured greta some more champagne and used his satellite phone to contact liam bell he found him at drumore place its me he said how are you fine weve moved in got things arranged no trouble from the villagers life shall we say is back to normal what about you well ive a target for you during the coming weeks and what would that be sean dillon ferguson and company jesus a tall order well discuss it in detail when im there however im going to need someone from your side of the coin a hit man wholl do the job no questions asked no argument no sentimentality what you mean is youre looking for the original coldblooded bastard no thats you ashimov told him what im looking for is a reasonable facsimile i know the peace process is supposed to have brought an end to the glorious cause of irish unity but i believe you do have sleepers in london young men and women in good suits who work in the stock exchange and hanker after the romance of the struggle bell said you might be surprised by how many of those there are what would you be offering oh to you a big payday funds for the organization of course not for the personal bank account in spain what you pay for him or indeed her to eradicate someone for me is your business would you be involved not personally ill be staying there for a while with major novikova im bringing a young colleague from moscow wholl handle the london end hell work out of the london embassy the target is legitimate from your point of view a highranking special branch officer whos put more of your friends inside the last few years than shes had hot dinners itll be a pleasure bell said ive got ideas right away leave it with me well see you soon levin looked up dillon really is quite something now im really looking forward to meeting him make sure it isnt your last meeting ashimov told him and poured another glass of champagne london when igor levin flew from ireland to london it was in a belov international jet and liam bell flew with him under a false identity levin didnt approach the embassy not then he stayed in an indifferent hotel in kensington next door to bell waited patiently while the man from dublin made his arrangements with mary killane and dermot fitzgerald and then after the outcome delivered fitzgerald to heathrow for the flight to ibiza he wasnt impressed in his opinion the whole business had been badly handled the killane girl for example anyone with half a brain would find it too much a coincidence that she the last person to treat the bernstein woman had been murdered so soon afterward and so close to the hospital perhaps things were done differently in belfast maybe the ira had employed such fear such power that they thought they could get away with anything or maybe they were just used to getting away with anything never mind igor he mused after delivering bell to the airfield for his return flight youre just the hired help hed already rented a mercedes but now taking advantage of his wealth he moved into a suite at the dorchester hotel overlooking hyde park only the best igor he said and drove down to the embassy of the russian federation situated in kensington palace gardens there was a snag at first when he discovered the ambassador was in paris but a further inquiry revealed that the senior commercial attaché colonel boris luhzkov in reality head of station for the gru was lunching in the pub across the high street levin went out the main gates waited for a break in the traffic then crossed the road luhzkov was in a window seat on his own devouring shepherds pie a halfempty glass of red wine before him levin got two more and went across he put one of the glasses on the table you always like two luhzkov looked astonished my god igor it is you i had a message from moscow this morning it said you were joining my staff not quite true old son in a way its you who are joining my staff what on earth do you mean levin took the envelope from his inside pocket extracted the putin warrant and passed it over read that he sat down and lit a cigarette when luhzkov handed it back his hand shook for gods sake youd better not lose it but what does it mean igor that im on a special assignment for the president himself i need a front so im to be a commercial attaché any quarrel with that of course not for the moment i need an office and all that goes with it i wont need an embassy car ive hired a mercedes and i dont need housing im staying at the dorchester its nice to be back isnt it boris and what better place for a russian intelligence officer to stay than the best hotel in london luhzkov had totally capitulated anything you say igor good the shepherds pie looks delicious i think ill have some and levin turned and waved to a waitress later when the necessary office had been provided he worked his way through grus computer records crossreferencing them with the file ashimov had provided him ferguson dillon the salters names computer printouts addresses he even checked on bells past and that of his men whom hed met at drumore an unsavory bunch no finesse on the other hand bell must have had something going for him to have become chief of staff of one of the most notorious organizations in the world dillon was a totally different article his exploits spoke for themselves the thing that impressed levin the most was that in all those years with the ira the police and secret intelligence hadnt touched him once levin was lost in admiration even the salters surprised him they were far from the usual run of gangsters harry salters aging face spoke for itself and billys deeds were remarkable men who didnt give a damn the salters and dillon just like me levin said softly hannah bernstein filled him with a strange kind of regret when he read her file again and looked at her photo shed been a remarkable woman you had to be to make superintendent rank in special branch an oxford psychologist and yet shed killed more than once and the jewish background it made him feel uncomfortable and he knew why that was her death of course had had nothing to do with him shed been close to death anyway thanks to ashimov the drug the nurse had used might not even have been necessary ashimov had killed her really trying to comfort yourself igor he murmured levin the honorable man well not after what youve done boyo he tapped into the police security facility and all the details of the mary killane killing were there the murder scene the names of those at scotland yard handling the case the fact that there was a press blackout the forensic pathologist in charge of the autopsy was a professor george langley levin checked him out on the computer langley normally worked out of church street mortuary off kensington high street quite convenient for the russian embassy however there was nothing on the police incident screen referring to hannah bernstein and levin sat back lit a cigarette and went to the small icebox in the corner opened it found the vodka and poured a large one it calmed him down helped him think so it would seem reasonable that an autopsy on hannah bernstein would be performed by the same eminent pathologist who was performing it on mary killane a strong chance surely he had another shot of vodka returned the bottle there was just one more thing to do luhzkovs remark in the pub that hed better not lose the putin warrant had stuck in his mind so he took the letter out and put it through the office copier he made three copies put two in the office safe one in his briefcase in an envelope and returned the original to his inside pocket he phoned ashimov on his coded mobile and found him at the royal george with greta just reporting in bell got back without incident yes whats happening there levin brought him up to date im just about to go out and start sniffing around yes do that ashimov told him frankly ive not been impressed with the way things went here it may have suited bell but if thats the best the ira can do theyre a bunch of clodhoppers the way fitzgerald disposed of that girl was ridiculous and unnecessary were in the death business igor theres no time for finesse he switched off and greta novikova said trouble just igor sounding off he isnt impressed with the ira well thats all right greta told him neither am i in his office at the ministry of defence ferguson sat with rabbi julian bernstein and blake johnson dillon sat on the windowsill there was a knock at the door and hannahs father arnold bernstein came in sorry im late i had an operation thats all right ferguson said carry on rabbi well as you know a jewish body should not be desecrated by an autopsy and should be buried within the twentyfourhour window but an expert rabbi may determine otherwise in exceptional circumstances i have made a judgment and in view of the murder of the young nurse and the circumstances surrounding hannahs death i believe it is necessary to establish exactly what happened with the blessing of my son i give my permission for the autopsy i know how difficult this must be for you but im most grateful ill phone professor langley now it was raining hard so levin wore a raincoat and trilby hat and carried a black umbrella the church street mortuary was surprisingly busy with quite a number of cars outside it was an aging building probably victorian like many in that part of london with the look of being a rather shabby oldfashioned school inside it was well decorated and surprisingly pleasant with two girls behind the reception desk and a number of people milling around apparently reporters come on gail a young man said to one of the receptionists so was the killane woman murdered or wasnt she whats all the mystery i cant tell you that the girl named gail said all i know is that professor langleys on another case is there a link thats not for me to say she moved away leaving the other girl in charge as ferguson dillon the bernsteins and blake came in levin recognized all of them from their files ferguson announced himself oh this way gentlemen she led them through to the back corridor and they disappeared through a door the young reporter said disconsolately nobody ever tells you a thing ill get hell at the office he took out a cigarette and levin gave him a light who are you with northern echo what about you evening standard well just have to see wont we they found langley in a room lined with white tiles fluorescent lights making everything look harsh and unreal there were steel operating tables and hannah bernstein lay on top of one of them she looked calm eyes closed the top of her head covered blood seeping through a little in turn both the bernsteins leaned over and kissed her forehead ferguson said forgive me professor but will you confirm what you told me on the telephone yes in my opinion hannah bernstein was murdered her heart was in a poor state anyway but ive found traces of the drug dazone in her system a drug which had not been part of her medications at rosedene ive checked on that recently introduced into her system and in overdose quantity there was a dreadful silence then ferguson said you will appreciate the significance of this to the mary killane case im afraid so ive never had much faith in coincidence ive been told the time killane gave hannah her medication the dazone kicks in in half an hour at the most which fits into the time scale of killanes murder well it saves one trial in the matter ferguson said now we have to find out who shot killane she has an ira connection what happens now dillon demanded i invoke the official secrets act and put the matter before a special crown coroner hell give whats called a closed court order no jury necessary a burial order will also be issued and you rabbi may bury your granddaughter all that will take place quickly you may alert your undertaker i cant say how sorry we all are may she rest in peace the response from dillon was uncontrollable well im damned if i will he turned and brushed past the young receptionist gail who had been standing at the door and went out dillon went through the crowd angry beyond belief pushing against levin who said hey watch it old man dillon shook his head sorry he pushed on and went out into the rain levin waited and the young reporter said somethings going on ferguson and the others emerged pushed through the crowd and went out and the receptionist appeared what was all that about gail the young reporter asked dont be daft we have our ethics here anyway its more than my jobs worth to talk to you useless bitch thanks very much she said as she pulled on her coat levin said to the young reporter loud enough for her to hear you shouldnt speak to a lady like that its not on she flashed him a smile of gratitude said to the other receptionist im going for my break and went out levin followed she hesitated on the step faced by the pouring rain and he put up his umbrella it took a russian schooled at one of londons greatest public schools to sound so charming and it had just the right rough edge to it some people just have no manners but to speak to a lady like that he shook his head i should have punched him in the mouth oh hes just stupid but thanks for being so nice i dont know where youre going but youll get soaked without my umbrella where are you going by the way oh the grenadier pub im on a half shift until nine tonight so i have sandwiches and a coffee there what a coincidence i was going to call in there myself shall we go together he shielded her from the heavy rain an arm slightly around her waist are you a reporter too she asked so they tell me they reached the pub come on in we go it was still early and there was plenty of room he helped her off with her coat may i join you i could do with a sandwich too she was obviously attracted why not prawn on salad and tea oh we can do better than that he went to the bar gave the waitress an order and came back with two glasses of champagne there you go i say this is nice she was sparkling with pleasure you deserve it youre in the death business not many people could do what you do oh i dont know she drank the champagne and ate her sandwiches and he bought her another glass and got to work the things you have to put up with in your work i mean look at what happened earlier she was a little tipsy and very flushed well i must admit it was very unusual you were there well i showed them all in to the professor so i was standing by the door when he told them his findings just a moment levin got up went to the bar and returned with two more what were you saying it must have been awful well i shouldnt really say anything but she leaned forward the whole story came out naturally and then she checked her watch and gasped oh im late already she jumped up and he helped her into her coat ill walk you back it was still raining he said a pity youre on shift tonight we could have had dinner oh my boyfriend wouldnt like that levin managed to stop himself laughing out loud he took her to the mortuary entrance through the rain take care he said and walked away and then as he went to the entrance and paused to look back he noticed a black hearse something made him pause rabbi julian bernstein emerged behind him pallbearers came out with a coffin he watched it being put into the hearse and the rear door closed as rabbi bernstein got into the front of the hearse behind the driver and the pallbearers got into another limousine levin cut back there was the name and telephone number of the undertaker in gold leaf under the tailgate he memorized it and walked on to the embassy once in his office he phoned ashimov things have moved tell me levin did i told you theyd been clumsy your ira chums it wont take a man like dillon long to see which way things have gone youd better see that fitzgerald keeps his head down in ibiza do you want me to go out there and take care of him dont be stupid igor i need these people stay there check out the funeral and keep an eye out for ferguson and company so you dont want me to knock off dillon for you not now just obey orders igor levin sat back and thought about it then rang the undertakers im hoping to send flowers as a token of respect for miss hannah bernstein im not sure whether the body will be there or at home oh here overnight and the funeral ten oclock in the morning at golders green so kind he thought about things for a while then decided to go for a drive which took him to wapping and cable wharf and the dark man it was almost night lights on the river and he parked one of many cars so things were busy he went and stood on the edge of the wharf and lit a cigarette hed always liked rivers the smell of them the boats but now he felt curiously empty it was bernstein he kept thinking of her photo the look on her face dammit her death was not really his affair there was an inevitability to it so why did he feel as he did the jewish link but that was nonsense it had always meant little to him and death had been a way of life for years pull yourself together igor he murmured and flicked his cigarette into the thames he took a small leather pouch from his pocket extracted a minuscule earpiece another device developed by the gru and pushed it into his right ear the chip it contained enhanced sound considerably then he crossed the wharf and entered the dark man ferguson dillon and the salters were all there including roper in his wheelchair they had the corner booth but the bar itself was busy levin got a large vodka and helped himself to an evening standard someone had left he had luck then for a man and a woman in a small twoperson booth next to his quarry got up to go and levin moved fast to take their place he was protected from view by the wooden wall between the booths but when he gave his earpiece a quarter turn he could hear what was going on perfectly he started to work his way through the newspaper and listened attentively billy salter was talking whats going on this bird this mary killane whats the connection it was roper who intervened an ira connection from childhood her father was a provo hard man he died of cancer years ago in the maze prison the mother took the girl to dublin when she was very young youve checked out what happened to her thoroughly charles i could tell you the schools she went to where she trained as a nurse all that have you checked whether she was a member of the ira herself as well as i could and she wasnt was she a member of any political groups anything like that as far as i can tell which is considerable shes not a member of any group connected to sinn fein i can guarantee that it was dillon who cut in she wouldnt be her worth would be her being in the republic and uninvolved going by her age shed be a sleeper what in the hell is a bleeding sleeper harry asked the new wave harry nice decent professional people who work in hospitals or offices or universities a lot of them london irish born here english accents a perfect cover until theyre activated in a way that applies to you sean ferguson said your father brought you here as a little boy your education was english true you dont need an irish accent to be irish the ira discovered that with me a long time ago and these days its even more important if you think theyve given up youre sadly mistaken so mary killanes task was to give hannah bernstein an overdose ferguson said but why there was silence roper said as a special branch officer hannah not only put members of the ira away she killed them so what are you saying blake said somebody in the hierarchy waits until shes almost dying anyway before deciding to have her put down like a dog dillons voice was almost toneless without feeling billy went to the bar and ordered more drinks they were still sitting in silence when he returned revenge is the only thing that makes sense whoever it was wanted their own back because of the ira connection were assuming its the ira but could she have been doing it for somebody else one of the waitresses brought the drinks dillon looked at his bushmills and swallowed it down whoa billy a girl like her her whole background smacks of decency i bet she went to mass twice a week and shes a nurse she chose a caring profession a girl like that wouldnt kill a fly normally she would need strong persuasion to do what she did when i was a boy the jesuits at school right here in london taught me an important thing by the small things shall thou know them it was billy in many ways dillons other self who said and the small thing here is the fact that her father was an ira activist who died in a british prison roper said a girl like her would need to believe fervently dillon said shed have to believe it was the right thing to do a girl who goes to mass so what would make her do such a thing she would need to believe it was acceptable if you like a political act in a way roper said ferguson shook his head an act of war which explains why the ira connection is so important harry salter said but who would it be who put her up to it roper said and then was reckless enough to knock her off afterward ferguson said well the murder squad is working hard at it theyll get nowhere dillon said bleakly you leave this with me ill find the truth here if its the last thing i do nothing stupid dillon oh hes always that billy said ferguson nodded which leads us to a bit of business the terrible thing thats happened has left us shorthanded in my department i could ask for someone from special branch to replace hannah but ive decided not to billy youve impressed me more than you know in the past few years you know what it entails youve helped out enough killed on many occasions now youre being nice to me what is this ferguson took an envelope from his pocket in there you will find a warrant card making you an agent of the secret intelligence service in my employ filling the gap left by superintendent hannah bernstein the photo was easy blame major roper for obtaining the more complicated information harry salter turned to roper you conniving bastard billy said shut up he took out the warrant card and opened it he turned to dillon then back to ferguson what is it the yanks say proud to serve excellent do remember one thing when you present yourself at the ministry of defence do wear one of your better suits dillon of course has his own standards you dont need to report at nine oclock in the morning i intend to be present at golders green at ten oclock at superintendent bernsteins interment im sure ill see you there harry salter said i think youll see us all there he turned to roper dont worry about your wheelchair old son weve got a people traveller thing takes eight well go together what about you dillon dillon was very pale his eyes dark holes ill see you there ill make my own way he went to the bar got another drink and came back blake johnson said id join you but ive got a plane standing by as i said before my instincts tell me that some of the answers to the belov affair might be found at drumore place i was thinking of dropping in at belfast airport on my way back hiring a car and driving down there an american tourist on the way through to dublin how does that sound jesus billy said are you sure dillon said your plane is official booked out by the embassy of course right we took out kelly and his boys but that still is ira country id take a walther ppk for your armpit and a colt twentyfive with hollowpoint cartridges in an ankle holster if they find the walther theres a chance theyll miss the colt that bad ive said its ira country kellys gone someone comes in to fill the vacuum shall i go with him billy asked dont be silly youd spoil his american tourist image weve got things to do here anyway im leaving ill see you in the morning dillon turned and left and levin glancing up caught his eye levin went back to his newspaper dillon on his way out frowned there was something there but he was tired and his brain wasnt functioning as well as normal there was a terrible pressure on him his one thought hannah and what had happened to her all the violence everything hed done for ferguson the killings the mayhem and she had been thrown into it and dillon as he walked to the mini cooper was left with the inescapable feeling that it had somehow been his fault behind as the rest of the group stirred levin got up and left he went back to his mercedes got in and phoned ashimov have i got news for you ashimov was sitting after dinner beside the open fire in the great hall of drumore place with greta and liam bell tell me he said and listened after a while he said excellent you stay on in london and keep a close eye on dillon leave blake johnson to me he switched off turned to bell and greta and said were going to have an interesting visitor one of president jake cazalets most trusted associates whats he coming for greta asked to find out whats happened here since kelly and the rest of us faded from the scene he told her what levin had heard hes good damn good but so is blake johnson ill pull his photo out of the computer for you he told bell a war hero in vietnam then the fbi now the presidents most trusted security man well give him a warm welcome bell said greta put in if he sniffs around and finds nothing wouldnt that be better possibly but ashimovs eyes were glittering all right weve seen off bernstein but what a coup to get johnson that would really hurt cazalet hurt all of them he turned to bell well make a decision when he turns up tomorrow im your man bell said and finished his drink irelandlondon for blake it started early the following morning his first stop was the american embassy in grosvenor square to call on the ambassador as a matter of protocol the ambassador was all cordiality i appreciate we havent been able to do much for you this time blake its a matter of security i understand absolutely blake told him a matter under presidential warrant with you that usually means dealings with charles ferguson i notice your gulfstream is using farley field that small raf base ferguson uses for his special operations thats right enough said my transport people tell me you have a stopover in belfast a visit to make ill only be on the ground a few hours blake we first knew each other in saigon thirtyfive years ago i know what kind of visit you make he came round the desk and embraced blake warmly god bless my friend and take care my regards to the president an embassy mercedes and a chauffeur took him from there to the chapel in a very short space of time it stood on the edge of the cemetery and there were a number of limousines parked outside drivers in uniform standing around a large notice at the door said private bereavement blake went in and found a modest company assembled rabbi bernstein was being helped by another rabbi who was wearing black ribbons and handing them out to people who were obviously family members up at the front who pinned them to their clothes the coffin was very plain in accordance with jewish custom and closed ferguson the salters and roper stood at the back of the pews dillon slightly apart though billy salter stood close to him they both wore black suits and ties and crisp white shirts and looked like the devils henchmen in a strange way it was as if they were brothers faces bone white skin stretching taut over cheekbones a eulogy was made the other rabbi whispered to bernstein who made a hand motion he said to the assembly my grief speaks for itself that my beloved granddaughter is taken too early there is one person who knows her worth more than most billy turned to look at dillon but bernstein carried on major general charles ferguson for whom she worked on secondment from special branch for a number of years ferguson walked down the aisle and joined the two rabbis what can i say about this truly remarkable and gifted human being a scholar of oxford university who chose the life of a police officer who placed her life at risk who was wounded more than once who rose to the rank of detective superintendent in special branch these are extraordinary achievements dillon took a step back blake was aware of that ferguson turned to bernstein and said rabbi excuse me if i preempt your role but i must quote with your permission from proverbs with my permission and my blessing julian bernstein told him in a strong voice ferguson said a woman of worth who can find for her price is far above rubies dillon took a huge choking breath stepped even farther back turned and went out and billy went after him dillon was standing by the mini cooper it had started to rain he took a trench coat out and pulled it on billy waved to joe baxter and sam hall who were standing by the people traveller and hall produced a large black umbrella and hurried over opening it dillon lit a cigarette hands shaking billy held the umbrella over him and said to baxter get the flask out baxter did and billy said bushmills get it down dillon stared at him vacantly shed expect you to dillon swallowed he paused then had another swallow he shook his head face flushed tell me billy why does it always rain at funerals id say its because the script demands it its life imitating art you want another one maybe just one at that moment igor levin arrived late he parked and went forward to the entrance glanced briefly at dillon then went on there was something more dillon was aware of that but his emotion was too great he drank a little more bushmills and returned the flask to joe baxter and a moment later people emerged from the chapel there was a family plot the open grave ready people huddled round a festoon of umbrellas against the rain dillon and billy stood at the rear ferguson and company on the other side levin hidden amongst a group of friends the umbrellas concealing everything as the coffin was lowered the other rabbi put an arm around julian bernstein and said in a loud voice may she come to her place in peace dillon turned to billy im out of it the rest is for family the kaddish the prayer for the dead ive no business with it im not sure if i was even a friend come off it dillon she thought the world of you not really billy i brought her too much grief i cant get that out of my head i dragged her into one lousy job after another no place she did not willingly go dillon so why do i feel so bloody guilty he got in the mini cooper ill be in touch billy blake johnson hurried over and leaned down sean are you okay see you blake take care in bandit country he drove away blake said what do you think a volcano waiting to explode i thought so anyway i have to go now take care in ireland i will blake went to his limousine and was driven away levin standing nearby anonymous in the umbrellaed crowd had heard the exchange between blake and billy now he returned to his mercedes and phoned ashimov telling him of events at the funeral so hes on his way ashimov asked so it seems well weve passed a computer printout of his photo to the lads i think hes assured of a warm welcome youre in charge levin said actually the smart thing he thought would be to allow blake johnson to nose around a little accept his pose as an american tourist and then send him on his way on the other hand hed already learned not to expect the smart thing from the ira and ashimov was beginning to worry him he was proving far too emotional but then that wasnt his business he just took orders and he drove away at farley field blake found his gulfstream waiting two american air force officers standing by in flying overalls any problems blake asked none sir good weather for belfast not raining hell it always rains in belfast sir i dont know how long ill be well see you must excuse me for a minute i have to go see someone by arrangement with ferguson he had an appointment in the operations room with the quartermaster an exguards sergeant major the man had the weaponry waiting as dillon had suggested a walther in a shoulder holster and a colt a snub nose with a silencer like you asked sir hollow point and the ankle holster you ordered will you be all right with this lot in belfast sir diplomatic immunity sergeant major i was wondering about the shoulder holster sir is that wise yes if things go that way with the people im dealing with theyll think theyve disarmed me only ill still have the ankle holster if your luck is good sir oh it always is sergeant major he went out to the gulfstream where he found a stewardess a young sergeant named mary who was there to cater to his needs onward to washington they took off and climbed to thirty thousand feet and she came and offered him refreshment all he had was a brandy and ginger ale funny as he sipped it he remembered the british navy commander whod introduced him to it in saigon back in good old vietnam all those years ago of course the brits werent supposed to be there but their navy with borneo experience had offered considerable expertise for american swift boats in the mekong delta to the royal navy this drink had been called a horses neck since time immemorial and blake especially when confronted with stress loved that mixture of brandy ice and ginger ale beyond most things it was the kind of thing that made life worth living he savored every drop and thought of the present situation which inevitably brought him back to his dear friend sean dillon so many things theyd accomplished together in various ways dillon had been part of saving two american presidents from an untimely end and in the affair with president clinton and the prime minister major hed taken wounds that had come close to ending his life but he was still here it was hannah bernstein who had gone and blake surprised at his own emotion waved to mary and ordered another brandy and ginger ale it was one too many but this was ireland after all so what awaited him in ballykelly and drumore to his surprise he found that he didnt really care hed survived vietnam the curse of most of his generation and had medals to prove it hed survived the worst the fbi could offer had taken a bullet to save his presidents life had survived even worse things since what can these ira clowns do to me he finished his horses neck opened his briefcase and took out a small miracle of modern technology that clipped low down behind the belt a backup if his mobile phone went which it well might to hell with the ira time to move on he said what will be will be the gulfstream descended landed and taxied all the way round to the special affairs arrivals mary opened the door and he got up okay son lets get it done he breathed it was what his old unit commander used to say in vietnam it was amazing how everything that ever touched you in your life stayed with you until the end see you later mary he said and went down the airstairs door his air force pilots were right it was raining as he drove out of the airport in a bmw hed already tasted the difference in the way people spoke hed certainly experienced an irish accent on many occasions but the northern irish one was totally different he switched on his routefinder and punched in his destination the details of where to go and how flowed through and he followed them and what a wonderful and beautiful place it was he thought as he drove through the mountains and then crossed the border into the irish republic and followed the coast road into county louth toward drumore an hour and a half later he came to ballykelly rain driving in came to the development and airstrip with a huge sign saying belov international he paused by the main entrance got out and looked a man in a security uniform came out of the gate hut and walked across can i help you blake said no im driving down to dublin from belfast i was surprised to see belov international i didnt know they were in ireland back home in texas theyre huge is drumore down the road it is sir eight or ten minutes blake nodded and drove away the security guard went back to his hut and phoned liam bell the americans just been here hes on his way to drumore now good man bell switched off his mobile and turned to ashimov and greta as they stood outside drumore place hes here what do you want to do ashimov glanced at greta he was very worked up all right lets see how he behaves greta said yuri let him nose around and then go theres no you no me and josef belov is supposedly a couple of thousand miles away hell find nothing and do no harm you dont see it greta this is one of our prime targets the american presidents righthand man if he dies here it will send a message she said ashimov appeared to struggle with himself all right he turned to bell well just go and observe him greta and i will stay out of the way see what happens but if he says or does anything suspicious take care of it good man yourself bell said leave it to me blake came down in the bmw and there was drumore place up on the hill and the village below the small port no more than half a dozen fishing boats perhaps thirty cottages and houses the pub the royal george and a fine view out to sea and a strong coastline blake took the car down went through the main street and ended up in the car park in front of the royal george he got out of his bmw and went toward the low wall and looked down at the harbor behind up on the hillside in the copse ashimov and greta were watching he passed her the glasses its him she looked and bell came forward so what do you want lets see what he does below blake went toward the royal george there was a strangeness to the village hed noticed that a lack of people which said a great deal he opened the door and went in patrick ryan was behind the bar and over by the window two of bells men casey and magee sat at a window table enjoying irish stew blake went to the bar and ryan said and what can i do for you sir im passing through on my way to dublin blake accentuated his american accent lovely harbor thought i could have some lunch indeed you can sir blake turned and glanced at casey and magee maybe ill have what those guys are having and a beer to go with it ryan gave him that returned from the kitchen and said its on its way sir blake said you know im from texas and one of our biggest firms is belov international i was amazed when i passed through ballykelly up the road to see they have a branch there a girl came through with his stew and put it on a nearby table blake sat down and ryan said a grand man mr belov done wonders for the community the village blake said brightly oh he comes here does he owns the big house drumore place we see him now and then but he goes around the world if you see what i mean was here recently but i believe hes in russia at the moment blake was already working his way through the irish stew he was aware of the two men by the window lighting up cigarettes sitting there staring at him it occurred to him that he could be in trouble here he wolfed down the stew finished his beer and went to the bar what do i owe you ryan said have it on the house sir we dont get many tourists this time of the year youre our first well thats damn nice of you blake said and went out when he got into the bmw however his keys were missing when he got out casey and magee were standing there up on the hill ashimov and greta each watched through binoculars and bell stood by casey said to blake what a pity but thats life he moved behind him and magee took a browning out of his waistband youve made a mistake my friend casey reached inside blakes jacket and removed the walther well would you look at that im amazed a tourist would get through security with that he put it in his pocket oh it happens blake said yes well you just come with us and well show you the grand place drumore is mr bells orders casey pushed him along and blake went magee in the rear all the way down to the tiny harbor and those few fishing boats and not a soul in the place they went along the wharf and pushed blake down to the deck of a fishing boat casey followed him magee cast off went in the wheelhouse and turned the engine on and moved through the harbor turning at the end of the point casey presented the browning and blake sat down in the stern took the colt from the ankle holster and shot casey between the eyes he went backward the browning flying from one hand and over the rail into the water the boat swerved magee killed the engine and came to the entrance of the wheelhouse blake shot him in the right thigh knocking him over he leaned down ive been good to you i could have killed you instead ive crippled you im sure your ira chums will see to you when ive gone he reached in magees jacket and found an old smith amp wesson ill see you in hell son the boat had bounced back against the wharf he went over the rail and up to the pub a gun in each hand and high on the hill greta said you got it wrong yuri and you liam at the royal george blake burst in the front door and discovered ryan turning from the bar hold it right there my keys id say youre the most likely to have them he held up the weapons like a gunfighter and ryan was terrified all right ive got them he handed them over and blake said so belovs in russia and youve got a new boss since mr kelly passed on a mr bell he smiled on a high ive got a friend named sean dillon he says he has an excellent remedy for people like you he rammed the colt against ryans left ear and fired ryan cried out and went down youre lucky you bastard blake said youre still alive he left ryan writhing on the floor went out got in the bmw and drove off on the hill greta lowered her binoculars well i dont know what were going to find inside the royal george but id say the whole thing has been a monumental cockup on his way back over the atlantic blake called ferguson and went over the experience my god youve been in the wars ferguson told him you say one of the men mentioned someone called bell as being in charge thats it see if that strikes a chord with dillon and id give it to roper as well he usually comes up with someone ill see to it safe journey blake regards to the president blake switched off and leaned back he felt great mary said can i get you anything sir actually you can mary he smiled you can get me a horses neck the carnage in the village was immediately apparent greta ashimov and bell stood on the wharf while two of his men assisted magee over the rail of the boat and into a land rover shall we pick up pat ryan at the pub as well hes lost half an ear mr bell what else would you do with him take them to the convent at ballykelly theyre in safe hands with sister teresa the men drove away beyond by the harbor entrance the body of jack casey floated up and was swept out to sea what happens to him greta said this is my patch bell said everybody keeps their head down nobody sees a thing none of this happened as for casey just on the other side of the jetty where the bodys drifting now theres a tenknot bore running because the tides turning itll take casey out into the irish sea fast food for fishes really how interesting she left him talking to ashimov and walked back to the pub and onward to drumore place she went into the great hall got herself a vodka went and stood by the fire thinking about it then phoned levin who was in the piano bar at the dorchester having a late lunch why greta darling girl none of that nonsense blake johnson arrived at drumore posing as an american tourist igor hes so old he was in vietnam hes fiftyfive at least he should have been in his box by now you know my mother was english but her mother was irish and whenever there was bad news that old irish lady would say to me it was as certain as the coffin lid closing well the coffin lids closed tight really he was laughing tell me the worst when she was finished he said so he sends one corpse drifting out to sea cripples another and disposes of half the ear of ryan the publican at the royal george theres more to it than that ryan said that when threatening him johnson mentioned bell having taken over from kelly he also mentioned his friend sean dillon oh dear whats happening to the walking wounded taken to the convent hospital at ballykelly the little sisters of pity theyll keep quiet enough i should hope so ashimov should have let johnson nose around have lunch and move on well he didnt hes on a holy crusade to get the lot of them and the chance of stiffing blake johnson was too good to miss what happens now i should imagine blake has already phoned ferguson who will ask dillon and the good major roper if the name bell means anything to them in connection with the ira its a mess she said its a can of worms my love however ill handle it ill phone volkov in moscow give him the bad news and cover your back as well as my own but thats only because i like you she thought about it for only a second he had something about him this young man she recognized that and took it on board right well see how it goes as far as yuris concerned if anyone gets blamed for it all coming out its me not you so keep your mouth shut fine she said ill leave it to you she switched off went and got another vodka and ashimov stamped in what a mess it was certainly that yuri he went and poured himself a drink i had him in my hand blake johnson the presidents man the ultimate coup it would have been a greater coup to allow him to pass through emptyhanded she said i told you but you just had to give bell the wink didnt you sometimes yuri i just dont know and she walked out in london at the ministry of defence ferguson listened to blake then called dillon and billy into his office he gave them an account of what blake had told him bloody marvelous billy said thats put the bastards in their place what do you think dillon so theres a new bunch in power from the provisional ira and some guy told blake that belov was in russia where does that get us maybe if we traced that bell person they mentioned does the name mean anything to you ferguson shook his head ill give it to roper he might find something what about the murder inquiry asked dillon still proceeding sean then maybe i should have a look myself id really rather you didnt dillon shrugged ill get on then outside he paused at his desk only for a moment billy said what are you going to do what do you think ill see you later and he went out wait for me dillon billy called and went after him on the phone to volkov levin explained everything that had happened he waited while volkov considered the matter finally he said i agree with you igor major ashimov has been foolish in this matter dillon is far from being an idiot hes probably already made the link between the nurse and the ira now this thing at drumore with ropers assistance dillon may hunt down the bell connection sooner than you think what should i do levin asked watch them all carefully igor one day soon well need to make hard decisions and well need to know what and who our liabilities are levin went into the dorchester but instead of going up to his suite he went into the piano bar it was half busy cheerful and sophisticated as usual he sat on one of the banquettes ordered a glass of champagne and glanced at the newspaper at that moment dillon and billy walked in the bar manager guiliano approached mr dillon a pleasure what can i do for you ill have the usual and the boy here orange juice and if you dont mind it ill give you a tune on liberaces grand piano there before your usual pianist comes in itd be a pleasure guiliano said levin slipped on his earpiece he could hear them perfectly so whats new im leaving it to roper for the time being lets see if this bell thing hangs together if anybody can find the answer its roper oh dear igor murmured as dillon walked down to the piano opened it and started to play we cant have that as he got up dillon seemed to look across at him levin smiled and called in his finest public school voice as time goes by old man never fails he walked out and went upstairs billy went to the piano who was that god knows dillon said i think ive seen him somewhere before but for the life of me i cant remember where good idea on the music though and he started to play the tune upstairs in his suite levin opened the file hed received in moscow found a number and rang it when there was an answer he said george moon thats right the midnight bell is ringing moon said thats fine by me silly buggers all this code stuff he thought ill see you in half an hour at the harvest moon pub in trenchard street ill recognize you be alone fine by me side entrance theres a light like a moon over the door a moon for a moon fitting right levin checked his briefcase the walther with the silencer in the room safe in the wardrobe of the suite he had five thousand pounds in mad money he took out two thousand in fifties stowed them in the briefcase put on his trench coat and left he took his mercedes drove in the general direction of soho and beyond brewer street he finally came to the pub in trenchard street an old victorian sort of place he parked some distance away and walked through the rain not bothering with an umbrella the light over the door in the side alley had the shape of a halfmoon on it sure enough levin glanced up then pressed the bell after a moment the door opened and a rather tarty young woman appeared ive an appointment with mr moon so whats your name mr nobody to you sweetheart just lead the way all right keep your shirt on she was quite attractive in her own way a cotton skirt tightening over her buttocks highheeled ankle boots on her feet she turned at the top of the stairs and paused to open a door had a good look did you definitely not to be missed cheeky bastard most men are she smiled in spite of herself you like having the last word dont you in here she opened a door and ushered him into a room lined with books like a small library there was a large desk with a lamp the light low and the man seated there was small balding wearing steel spectacles he nodded to levin and held out a limp hand without getting up behind him a man leaned against the wall hard brutal with the flattened nose of an exboxer and arms folded im george moon no need to say who you are i know your principals and thats sufficient cup of tea for me ruby although considering this gentlemans antecedents i expect hed prefer a large vodka yes o great one she went out levin said a lot of character there a lot of everything a very naughty girl harold the man behind him moved close enough to smell and it was not good ruby opened the door and said teas brewing george she had a bar tray a bottle of vodka and a glass on it harold said all right china arms wide his hands went for a body search levin said now whos being naughty i dont like that harold his right hand came out of his pocket clutching the walther and he rammed it under harolds chin now go back to propping up the wall like a good boy or ill castrate you harold in shock eased away do as the gentleman says harold that was moon levin turned to ruby who was smiling she said my god a right hard bastard whod have thought it ready for your vodka then why not she poured a large one and he drank it down fabulous ill have another he held the glass out and placed the walther on the desk as if daring harold who glowered at him so what can we do for you levin opened his briefcase and took out the money it contained in two packets its simple enough a man lives in regency square in a wheelchair most of the time a major roper i want him seen to permanently that would be the best solution after all anything could happen to somebody like that he could end up dead in his wheelchair the victim of an opportunistic burglar theres two thousand here if you accept the assignment another two on completion just one thing and what would that be you do it now tonight there was silence for a moment harold said regency squares only twenty minutes away thats true moon nodded as i know your principals he said to levin i presume this is a political matter none of your affair moon nodded and turned to ruby youll keep an eye on those bastards behind the bar you never know what theyll get up to he handed her the two thousand look after that love youre going yourself george why not ill keep an eye on harold find a raincoat for me and an umbrella yes george levin took a computer printout from his briefcase with a photo of roper on it and his address moon picked it up and checked it then handed it to harold who looked and shrugged piece of cake moon said to levin you coming or are you just watching from afar ill see you after your successful completion or lets hope i do that will be entirely satisfactory so you trust me not to vanish into the night oh absolutely ive dealt with your people on many occasions why would they let me down theres always a next time im well aware how powerful they are ill see you later then levin turned to ruby and you god but youre a coldblooded bastard its been said before he grinned brushed past her went down the stairs and back to his mercedes got in and drove away he made it to regency square there was plenty of parking at that time of the evening he found one very close to ropers place pulled in switched on the radio and sat there listening to it and waiting roper busy at his computers had had enough and his stomach told him as much there was an italian on the corner of the square by the main road they always did well by him and his wheelchair he pulled on his reefer coat and a cap in the hall and went out into the rain levin saw him at once and so did moon and harold whod just arrived and parked at the side of the square how convenient moon said how do we do it harold asked moon nodded down to the main road i always prefer to keep it simple it looks nice and busy down there we push him along the pavement and simply let go hes bound to run in front of a truck or something they got out of their car moon put up his umbrella and they crossed the road as levin watched he had an insane desire to laugh did those cretins really think it was going to be that easy dear god almighty he murmured harold had a hand on one side of ropers wheelchair now moon on the other be a nice gentleman now moon said and youll come to no harm come to no good you mean roper said he eyed the two of them ive been here before last time it was the mafia whats your religion i wouldnt dream of telling you love ah well then we cant do business im afraid roper said then he took a silenced walther from the righthand pocket of his wheelchair and shot harold through the side of his knee he went down with a curse and moon said oh my god roper grabbed him by the coat whats your name come on quick or ill give it to you too moon was in such a panic he told him moon george moon who sent you i dont know i hadnt seen him before in my life he pulled away turned to run and roper shot him in the right thigh he hit the pavement writhing roper said remember this somebody tried to mug you and it went wrong that would be a good line if you want to stay out of court when the police come yes moon babbled yes roper went down the square taking out his mobile and dialing ambulance needed in regency square two men down looks like a shooting the operator asked for his name but he switched off and called dillon sean ive had a spot of bother he explained what had happened ill wait for you in the italian restaurant at the end of the square ill call billy and well be with you soon and ill notify ferguson i dont like the sound of this first hannah now you i think youd be better off in the holland park safe house ruby was upstairs at the harvest moon when the bell sounded at the alley door she went down opened it and levin smiled at her we need to talk he moved in and followed her upstairs she led the way into moons office and turned what is this moon and harold made a big mistake youll be hearing from them quite soon they are as we speak seeking treatment in the accident and emergency department of some thirdrate national health hospital ive just heard had a phone call from the hospital it said theyd been mugged by a black street gang is it bad gunshot wounds to the legs and so richly deserved just like the ira ive never seen such incompetents the story about being mugged does two things it keeps them out of court and it doesnt involve the people i work for if it did george and harold would be dead in the near future one way or the other so what do you want here two thousand ruby youve got cheek its the principle of the thing ill do you a favor give me a thousand and you can tell moon i came back and took it all a thousand for you she thought about it then went and unlocked a cabinet at the end of a bookcase took out a packet of banknotes and tossed it to him hes my husband you know then im sorry for you its not as bad as you think he swings the other way she smiled id get out of here if i were you ill be getting callers he turned to the door turned again and tossed the thousand pounds on the desk oh what the hell tell him i took the lot and he went downstairs and moved back along the alley to his limousine dillon and billy arrived with a people carrier loaded roper inside and a number of personal effects he needed and took him to the holland park safe house this had happened before in times of stress because of this ferguson had had all the right computers and technical equipment installed to suit ropers special needs so roper was settled in and the military police sergeant on duty doyle said general ferguson will be along soon mr dillon theres a message from special branch it seems george moon and harold parker insist they were mugged by two men at pistol point and they cant identify them because it was dark it was raining and they were black black my arse billy said ive known moon for years hes a slimy toad theres more to this dillon so lets go and find out what it is well be back later he said to roper and went out at st michaels dillon and billy found moon and harold under sedation and awaiting surgery billy flashed his new warrant card from ferguson and forced his way in it was amazing the power it made him feel moon and harold were waiting in a side ward its me george billy salter what in the hell do you want mr dillon here and i are working for the intelligence service fuck off billy they wouldnt employ a thief like you now youre upsetting me george no big blacks shooting you and harold well the police are happy that takes care of it unfortunately the guy who stiffed you george the guy you were trying to do away with is a very good friend of ours so we know what you were up to who put you up to it ill say one thing for old times sake billy they could snuff you out like a match swallow you whole now harold and me was mugged by two big black men they had cockney accents so they must have been born here he raised his voice nurse i feel terrible billy said you deserve to you toad ill pay you back he nodded to dillon lets go of course it was another failure he had to report whichever way you looked at it in the gru files there was quite a list of ira people like moon available for employment it occurred to levin that reliability was not their strongest feature the whole affair had been farcical but it would still look like a failure to ashimov never mind volkov the truth was you could never rely on anybody but yourself so he drove to hangmans wharf and parked close to the dark man but not for any particular reason just thinking about it there was the bentley parked there harry salters pride and joy according to his file and as levin watched joe baxter came out of the pub unlocked the door rummaged around then went back into the dark man the thing was he didnt bother to relock the door it was a wild card crazy but he might get away with it levin opened the glove compartment found the minitool kit opened it and selected a pair of wire cutters he moved fast darting along the pavement and opened the door of the bentley reached inside and released the catch to the bonnet when it sprang open he went round raised it and went to work slicing at cables brake fluid already spurting out the bonnet went down with a thump and he turned and went back to his mercedes there was no point in waiting it could take forever but then as he reached for the key harry salter appeared with joe baxter and got into the bentley baxter was driving and switched on the engine roared he moved away tried to turn the bentley it glided back and bumped against another car there was the sound of the engine revving again as it moved away and he obviously tried to brake the bentley proceeded at speed toward the edge of the wharf ready to go straight into the thames at the last moment it skidded bounced off a bollard and ended up with the front wheels over the edge of the wharf baxter and salter managed to extricate themselves there was much shouting people poured out of the pub and levin drove away laughing salter and baxter should have been choking to death drowning at the bottom of the thames it was unbelievable what had happened life was just a farce after all a comedy a dark one but still a comedy at the harvest moon ruby answered the bell at the side door and found billy salter dillon behind him what do you want you sod and i always thought you liked me ruby just a word me and my friend mr dillon would appreciate that you see weve been to saint michaels and george and harold have told the police they were mugged a racial attack in reverse theyve got nothing else to say so whats the problem well you see we know who shot them a friend of ours who was actually attacked by george and harold in his wheelchair the thing is he was armed ruby hes that kind of man so she still stood there holding the door george is a hit man thats what hes done for a living for years so what wed like to know is who paid him dillon told her i dont have any idea who he was she flinched aware that shed been caught out come on ruby ive got a warrant here we could take you in okay a guy came spoke to george no names no pack drill george said he knew the mans principals and they were frightening people i mean hed obviously worked for them before but he didnt know the man dillon asked no there was one funny thing though what was that when i was told to get him a drink george said that considering the gentlemans antecedents hed probably prefer a vodka so he was russian dillon said no a real gent dropdead goodlooking public school voice he was back here a little while ago told me what had happened but id already had the police on why did he come back his money two grand took the lot she lied they were still standing in the hallway billy glanced up and saw a security camera that appears to be on it is he reached up switched it off and removed the tape upstairs ruby well have a quick look on your tv levin was there of course his one mistake his face quite clear well keep this billy told ruby you stay quiet and well stay quiet okay men she shook her head piss off billy driving away dillon said theres something about our man its as if i know him not me billy said but the russian link is cool dillons mobile rang he answered it then switched off and turned that was ferguson hes at the holland park safe house with roper and now your uncle harry what in christ for somebody cut the brakes on the bentley he and joe baxter ended up hanging over the edge of the wharf its a miracle they survived this is beginning to stink bigtime billy said you dont have to tell me just get us there at the holland park safe house they were all assembled it was a bad business all round theyd just run the tape through and found levin entering the harvest moon they established that he didnt mean a thing to anyone so where are we dillon asked this is a serious situation ferguson said the death of superintendent bernstein followed by what happened to blake in drumore and now the attacks on major roper and harry salter he shook his head billy could have been with you harry it could have been both of you just wait till i get my hands on them salter said just wait there was silence dillon lit a cigarette well id say its more than a coincidence that four members of the prime ministers private army have been targeted charles that only leaves you and me blake was extra exactly so the sooner we discover the identity of the gentleman on the security tape the better dillon said show me a picture of him on your computer happy to oblige there is one thing i wanted to run by you the name bell ive come across one a liam bell once chief of staff to the pira in the maze prison for some years retired some time ago lives in dublin the schoolteacher dillon said thats what they used to call him he was retired years ago i thought he was dead dillon thought about it some more and said to ferguson if roper can give billy the details on bell you could send him over in the plane from farley field tomorrow see if hes around is that okay with you billy sure but what about you things id like to check out here is that all right charles ill make the arrangements miles away in siberia in his suite in a hotel on the station gorky development surrounded by snow max zubin spoke to his mother bella in moscow she was as vivacious as usual slightly loud what are they doing to you not much shaved my beard i bet you look ten years younger what about you they treat me well i have a big black car with a driver he hangs around downstairs i can go anywhere the supermarket the theater the bolshoi well you couldnt exactly run away theyve got me and theyve got me too so you cant run away whats going to happen max i dont know volkov spoke to me yesterday he said i might have to turn up in moscow again and play my part well whatever else you are youre a fine actor my son from you thats the ultimate compliment i love you mama and i love you my son god bless ferguson spoke to blake and brought him up to speed theres something going on here and we dont know what it is blake said the name bell ive got that right no question well were all on the case now im not sure what i can do but ill speak to the president when blake went into the oval office a few minutes later cazalet was by the fire smoking a cigarette murchison his flatcoated retriever at his feet the dog was the most intelligent blake had ever known hed often suspected it of talking to the president on a famous occasion it had hurled itself at a waiting assassin and saved cazalets life clancy as usual hovered well ive said it before blake but youre a remarkable man three members of the provisional ira one dead and two down amazing they were going to give me the deep six off a fishing boat mr president i decided otherwise cazalet said clancy scotch and soda can you believe this absolutely mr president if you can get a navy cross in vietnam at twentyone that means you can handle yourself hell you did the same thing in ninetyone in iraq blake said mind you iraq was pussy excuse me sir but i might just spill your drink oh you wouldnt do that to a superior officer sergeant major stop the war games weve all been there cazalet toasted blake ferguson is right superintendent bernstein murdered you attacked major roper there seems to be a vendetta against fergusons group do you think i should speak to the prime minister theres not much he can do mr president i suspect that as usual its all down to dillon well good luck to him and cazalet toasted blake again levin phoned ashimov at drumore place and got greta first how are you doing she asked bloody awful he told her what had happened not so good wheres ashimov playing snooker with bell he left me the phone said he didnt want to be bothered oh dear lets hope blake johnson doesnt appear on the scene again i wouldnt mention that if i were you ill transfer you ashimov said so whats happening levin went into detail finding he was rather enjoying it ashimov said this isnt good captain you disappoint me well the bloody ira must have disappointed you with their botched job on bernstein and their total incompetence in the blake johnson affair the idiots i used for roper were on your list the salters bentley was just bad luck youre making excuses ashimov roared take it up with volkov i have when ive something to say ill phone goodbye he put the phone down dillon stayed on with billy had a cup of tea in the kitchen while roper worked away at his computer they went to check on him when he called out have i got news for you they found him at his computer bank and on the screen was igor levin so who is he dillon asked a russian oh a strange hybrid roper went on to describe levin in detail when he was finished dillon said so hes appointed as a commercial attaché at the russian embassy we all know what that means what billy asked in the old days kgb roper said but our boy is gru russian military intelligence flew in two days ago staying at the dorchester hes what dillon said and gasped christ ive seen him there in the piano bar he was at the mortuary he was even at the dark man but the dorchester billy said the russians must be paying their agents well no billy roper said hes a rich man in his own right his fingers danced on the keys his father was a military attaché at the london embassy his mother english his grandmother irish is there no end to him apparently not dillon said big war hero languages christ he went to westminster school for a few years a man of parts dillon nodded billy would you take me round to my place at stable mews i do believe i have a staff passkey for the dorchester well pay his suite a visit not without me you wont roper said a hotel as outstanding as the dorchester doesnt give out room numbers to anyone i on the other hand can penetrate most systems his fingers danced again sixten he said well see you later dillon said and he and billy left at the hotel they checked the piano bar and had a stroke of real luck levin was at a corner table having some sort of pasta and a glass of champagne listening to a trio playing jazz at the end of the room move it dillon said and they hit the lift fast and went upstairs the corridor was long the carpet luxurious dillon had the key ready in his hand pushed it in the electronic lock when they reached the green light came on the door opened automatically fast dillon said bedroom check if the safe in the wardrobes in use ill do the sitting room he went one way billy the other the sitting room was the height of luxury but having stayed in such rooms at the hotel before dillon knew what to expect it was like staying in a fine english country house there was a large tv screen on the wall a cabinet with video a copier a computer link he knew that but there was more a spectacular piece of luck levins briefcase billy he called got the briefcase open rummaged around and found the envelope containing the putin warrant a russian speaker it made perfect sense to dillon jesus billy vladimir putin and his team sorted it for him the bloody russian president billy said if you nick it hell know no need theres a copier in the cabinet he ran the warrant through folded the copy and put it in his pocket put the other in the envelope and returned it to the briefcase out of it fast which they did running down the stairs at the far end instead of using the lift in the car billy did the driving and dillon phoned ferguson well meet back at holland park dillon said what the hell for the most astonishing thing youll have seen in years trust me in the computer room at the holland park safe house they ranged around roper and his screens so levin is posted to london as a commercial attaché roper said with one hell of a warrant to back him up and signed by putin himself dillon said couldnt you do something about that charles speak to head of station theyd claim diplomatic immunity and in theory what after all does the letter say it refers to the bearer not a specific individual no i dont think it would wash you cant even prove what it refers to i must say i agree roper said and i dont think well get anywhere with moon and his chum sticking to their mugging story keeps them out of court because ive got to keep to my story keeps me out of court too if you take my point right ferguson said at least levin doesnt know were onto him ill leave him in your hands sean while you young salter make for farley field in the morning and head for dublin any questions not really dillon said i just want answers the citation x landed at dublin airport midmorning and taxied to the diplomatic arrivals section billy lacey and parry had been through a lot together in the past on fergusons behalf as they walked to the arrivals section lacey spoke im usually dropping you on some beach at night in deep trouble i sense something different billy produced his warrant card the general needs a replacement for hannah im it for the moment good god yes well what you see is what you get i shouldnt be too long what can i say good luck billy moved on produced his passport at reception there was nobody around except a man in a raincoat maybe forty smoking a cigarette a scar on one cheek which to someone of billys expertise had been made by a broken bottle the girl at the desk handed him back his passport ah mr salter your fame precedes you hows sean dillon these days asked the man up and running billy told him who might you be jack flynn detective chief inspector special branch i go back a long way with dillon you might say im an admirer ive heard the whispers about you and him in past years so when one of fergusons planes comes in with the one passenger and its you i wonder you mean whats a wellknown london gangster doing here in one of fergusons planes is the point billy took out his warrant card flynn said holy mother of god that i should see the day we lost part of fergusons team superintendent bernstein ive heard she was an outstanding officer helped us out in the garda many times what you havent heard is that her death was no accident she was helped on her way if you follow me flynns face was like stone youre saying someone topped that lovely woman who would do a thing like that billy thought about it wondered what dillon would have done and knew it would never be the obvious thing and in this case it would be to talk to flynn but there was something about flynn and if billy knew about anything in this life he knew about coppers im teetotal but i could do with a cup of tea well this is ireland and if you cant get a decent cup of tea here where else would you in the main concourse theres a decent café youve got a hire car i see you can follow me which billy did noticing that flynn had a uniformed driver large and burly they parked close to the main entrance leaving the driver in charge good man yourself donald flynn told the constable dont let them give you a ticket they got the tea sat in a booth at the café and flynn lit a cigarette so what have we got here and billy told him mary killane the link with the ira liam bell everything except the circumstances surrounding belov flynn said twenty years in the job nothing surprises me but its a hell of a story he shook his head but liam bell you wouldnt be ira yourself billy asked i know what you bleeding irish are like flynn grinned no that was my elder brother as youre asking youre all right with me there was a day but its long gone and we should move on im surprised about bell i thought he was long retired well maybe not i assume this is all hushhush we shouldnt even be talking which means you shouldnt be helping billy said ive got his home address and a mention of one or two places he might be pubs you mean thats easy the irish hussar down on the quays by the river thats where all the old hands go and a few hangerson trying to look big so what would you suggest well as ive nothing better to do and it is my patch ill leave first with donald just to show you the way you follow on and well take it from there one thing are you carrying now would i do a thing like that absolutely just make sure it stays in your pants billy smiled this sounds like the beginning of a beautiful friendship the police car led him to oconnor street number a neat bungalow with garden and garage nothing special at all flynn and donald kept on going billy pulled up in his car and tried the front door of the bungalow the bell was only an echo in an empty house he had that feel he went round the back to check returned to find a latemiddleaged lady peering over the fence can i help you strangely enough her accent was english billy said i was hoping for mr bell youre english she said so they tell me so am i my husband was irish but hes been dead for twelve years i should have gone back really billy said like i said i was looking for mr bell an insurance claim i dont think youll find him around hes left his keys with me in case there are any problems did he say when hed be back no i had to phone when there was a water board problem and spoke to him no somebody else drumore place they said i left a message youve been very kind billy told her and left a couple of streets away he pulled up behind flynn and donald and conferred flynn said drumore now thats in county louth on the coast a known fact so youve got your link with kelly you did a good job there taking that bastard out we just need confirmation that bell really has taken over flynn said its a strong ira area and josef belovs been a power in the land everybodys behind him and that includes the ira theyll never let go in ballykelly and drumore fine i just want to confirm that bell is running things now so what do i do go to the irish hussar for your lunch and ask questions theyll suspect you straightaway because you dont drink lets see what happens great lead the way billy said the irish hussar was on a cobbled street fronting the river liffey the police vehicle coursed by and turned into a parking bay they drove round to the side alley and went in the bar was oldfashioned rather victorian everything an oldfashioned pub should be plenty of bottles crammed behind the bar mirrors mahogany a fresco painting of michael collins holding the irish tricolor high on easter the modern changes were the tables crammed in making the pub more a restaurant than anything else billy chose a table by a bow window a young waitress descended on him will you be eating considering that the smells from the kitchen are driving me potty yes i am so what can i get you orange juice three young men at a nearby table appeared to find this funny billy smiled please and ill have the irish stew since im over from london for the day she hesitated you dont have an irish accent well when youre london irish that isnt likely whats your name kathleen well kathleen im an irish cockney who seeks orange juice and irish stew she smiled coming up billy tried dillon on his mobile and found him how are things not too bad ive been mulling over whats happening about killane and hannah frankly i think uniform branch at scotland yard are dragging their feet be fair billy said maybe theres not much coming up you could be right what about you billy went through it dillon said i remember flynn give him my best hes good billy kathleen returned with an orange juice and his stew and crusty bread there you go anything else im here on business billy said supposed to catch up with a liam bell only he seems to be away she stopped smiling and billy attacked the stew this is fantastic so youve no idea where he is i understand he comes here all the time i wouldnt know she turned and fled and the three men at the next table stopped talking and looked at billy in silence the stew was so good he actually finished it and washed it down with the orange juice the looks from the three men said it all and billy checked the colt in his waistband at the rear no point in delaying things these bastards obviously wanted to have him so they might as well get on with it he called kathleen over and gave her a twentypound note jesus thats too much its been a sincere sensation he said and smiled dont worry ill be fine suddenly she smiled my god i dont know who you are but i think you will billy reached over kissed her on the cheek went out of the pub and turned into the alley at the side the three young men from the next table erupted after him and billy turned to meet the rush not afraid he never was years on the street had taken care of that now then lads whats the problem one of them grabbed him by the tie youve been asking after a good friend of ours liam bell you english bastard now thats not nice billy said and me as irish as all of you which was perfectly untrue one of them said you dont even have an irish accent i didnt know you needed one the man pulled his tie the other two moved in billy pulled the colt from the back of his waistband and fired between their legs at the cobbles he kept a hand on the one who clutched his tie and wiped the colt across his mouth the others jumped back ill only say this once otherwise you can have it in the knee wheres bell the youth was quaking he was recruiting for a job in drumore up in county louth last i heard billy released him there you go it wasnt too hard was it he replaced the colt and one of the other two took a swing at him there was a minor melee and flynn and big donald came running round the corner a few pokes from donalds stick were enough they went off dejected one with a handkerchief to a bloody face flynn stuck a cigarette in his mouth you dont take prisoners do you i could never see the point neither could i let me know what the outcome is im fascinated thats a promise billy said you can rely on it regards from dillon he got in his car and drove back to the airport dillon showered and changed wondering how billy would make out in dublin then drove round to holland park he found roper in the computer room with ferguson any word on billy he asked not yet youre expecting a lot dillon but then you always did i just expect people to come up to expectations coming up with the goods is another way of looking at it which scotland yard seems to be rather spectacularly failing to do in hannahs case he turned to roper any news at all from the murder squad its early days sean youre expecting too much its one of their own were talking about dillon said leave it alone ferguson said this is a job for uniform and special branch and certainly not for us you dont interfere sounds definite enough dillon said ill give it my consideration and he went out levin had been on his tail since leaving dillons cottage in stable mews which could have been difficult with someone of dillons experience but there was london traffic to help not that he was exactly inexperienced himself and he stayed well back and followed dillon went to mary killanes place he really was worried that the murder squad didnt appear to be making much progress where she had lived kilburn was the most irish area of london there were pubs there that would make you think you were back in the old country republican protestant take your pick dillon was an expert on all of them had lived there as a boy newly come from belfast with his father so if you were a nice catholic girl who was going out for a drink youd never go to a prod pub only a catholic one mary killane didnt have a car so you were talking about walking unless shed a fella who picked her up at the flat in any case within a reasonable walking distance to here there were a few catholic pubs most were clean enough he showed her photo and got nowhere there were others that had ira connections especially from before the peace process there being little action in london these days one such was the green tinker the landlord one mickey docherty a huge ira supporter in the old days hed been picked up twice although nothing had ever been proven dillon found him just before noon when the bar was empty except for two old men in cloth caps drinking ale at a corner table and playing dominoes docherty was reading the standard at the bar and the look on his face when he saw dillon was comical my god its you sean as ever was get me a large bushmills docherty did as he was told and when he turned dillon had a computer photo of mary on the bar he took his whiskey and drank it dochertys face said it all i can see by your face you know her whats she done got herself killed docherty crossed himself mother of god dont start getting pious with me who did she come in with and how would i be knowing that because theres an ira connection and a possible liam bell connection so tell me what you know if you dont ill be back tonight to haunt you ill cripple you both knees this is important to me all right sean i hear you he turned poured a whiskey hands shaking nice girl a nurse she was a sleeper how do you know i took letters from dublin for her and the fella which fella well he was a sleeper too dermot fitzgerald what did it say in the letters how would i know because you steamed the envelopes open docherty was panicking i only did it a couple of times they were just notes no signature things like phone a certain number at such and such a time fitzgerald was a handsome rogue a real scholar doing an ma at london university a scholar and a gentleman thinking it was romantic to be in the ira there was word about him what kind of word that hed killed three or four times there was silence do you have his address only round the corner but hes gone gone where ibiza he told me a couple of days ago said hed made a bit of money and was going over there for a while likes to dive dillon thought about it then took another computer photo out levins this time anyone you know docherty shook his head definitely not dillon put the photos away i hope i dont have to come back igor levin following dillon to the green tinker had glanced through a window seen him approach the bar to talk to docherty he moved on and discovered a door to a separate saloon bar he moved in there was no one there but there was an access door into the other bar and when he put his earpiece in he could hear what passed between them from the moment docherty recognized mary killane and was told she had been killed there was really little else levin could do he waited by the front door giving dillon time then moved out and went along the street to his mercedes once behind the wheel he phoned luhzkov at the embassy and asked him to do a trace on dermot fitzgerald and flights to ibiza in dublin flynn sat in his favorite bar and had a large whiskey he had a problem a fine officer hannah bernstein had gone down and he felt that on the other hand there was a question of family loyalty and his brother not exira at all but still active so he did the good thing or the bad thing and gave him a ring billy salter had come calling maybe liam bell needed to know afterward he felt even worse and consoled himself with another whiskey levin phoned drumore place and got ashimov he told him what dillon had learned at the green tinker the important thing is weve checked through the gru computer and dermot fitzgerald left london gatwick for ibiza the day before yesterday so what are you saying to me that if i was dillon and fired up like he is id be on the next plane over on fitzgeralds case if he can find him and squeeze him hell know it was liam bell behind the execution of mary killane and thats a direct lead to drumore place and what goes with that do you think i dont know so what do you want me to do get after fitzgerald get rid of him are you going to come ive other things to do can i say something anything you like as long as its relevant getting on fitzgeralds tail is one thing but theres another side to it why waste him if dillon comes after him which he will wed get two for the price of one ashimov said thats good i like that he thought about it i tell you what ill send a company falcon from ballykelly it can bring greta she could be useful to you itll collect you at archbury then onwards to ibiza sounds good to me then lets do it at holland park dillon found roper and gave him the information hed obtained from docherty about fitzgerald he had no known criminal connections but was on the books at london university a ba in english literature his thesis for his masters degree was on the pending list roper trawled through the passenger lists for ibiza and confirmed that fitzgerald had left anything else this diving business check that out if you can i can do anything old lad roper went through the padi list the world association of professional divers and nodded there you are a master diver so what do you want to do i think i should go after him i know ibiza well i used to go there a lot in the old days a good friend of mine ran an outfit flying floatplanes between the islands i flew for him i wonder if hes still at it aldo russo eagle air hes italian has strong mafia connections or did have roper went back to his computer which came up trumps again there you go still up and running but would you be how much flying have you done lately ive kept my hand in mostly weekend stuff these days i can fly anything short of a jumbo but who says im going to fly i think ferguson will say no to you going he wants the hannah investigation to stay in the hands of scotland yard look mary killane eased hannahs going with those pills but the ira contact between her and fitzgerald is more than a coincidence and id take a large bet with you he killed her it makes sense shes the nurse with access afterwards shes got to be got rid of on top of that he clears off to ibiza you could persuade me roper said but at that moment ferguson came in immaculate in black tie whats going on he said dillon told him not that it did any good i told you i dont want you to intervene the yard will handle it all right youve done well sean and so has young salter in dublin its a step forward knowing that liam bell is at drumore place but im not having you running off to ibiza im at saint jamess palace for a luncheon with the prime minister hell want to know how things are so leave it alone whatever you say he went out roper said but youre not going to leave it alone are you not a chance im going to presume on friendship im going to phone lacey at farley field and tell him a priority jobs come up and i need a citation flight to ibiza tonight ill say ferguson has ordered it that clears you roper sat back frowning then said give me a marlboro and well call it quits my pleasure dillon took one himself only one thing roper said i make the call lacey trusts me so where does that leave you with ferguson what can he do roper smiled im handicapped hed end up in front of a tribunal ill tell lacey youll be there in two hours go on get out of here he phoned lacey and stated his requirements the usual schedule the quartermaster for weaponry and then he phoned billy salter somethings come up he said and told him what do you think that hes not been the same since she died not his old self at all whats more to go off on a hunt like this on his own in the state hes in is barmy so what are you going to do pack a suitcase i thought youd say that theyre expecting you at farley too stay in touch ibiza the falcon with greta on board dropped in at archbury and picked up levin youve been busy she said as they took off again whats happening the nets closing in she told him about billy salter in dublin so now they know definitely levin said thanks to a familyminded dublin detective they know liam bell is in charge of drumore theyre aware that max zubin is playing belov at station gorky they dont know about ashimov or me he smiled or me so lets keep it that way youve got fitzgeralds address details of what hes up to he knows were coming oh yes bells been in touch with him that was a mistake levin opened the bar cabinet and got out the vodka why she asked as he poured he could wonder why he could wonder whether the only present were bringing is a bullet in the head not with me along a goodlooking woman to make him feel comfortable why not tell me one thing you really think dillon will turn up absolutely it should be an interesting trip then and they toasted each other heres to mary hall whos that me igor thats what it says on my passport when billy arrived at farley field he was delivered by harry grumbling as usual i mean whats he got you into now im a member of the security services harry they yell i jump its called doing your duty only ferguson doesnt know he will when hes finished dinner roper will see to that they parked outside the terminal building went in and there was lacey in flight overalls talking to dillon the quartermasters left you the usual bag sean said youll find everything you want inside billy and harry looked on there you are you little irish bastard harry said lacey said ill go and get us started dillon frowned does ferguson know about this he soon will ropers in charge billy picked up the quartermasters bag and took his own from harry come on dillon lets get moving and he led the way out and walked to the citation x flying through the night at thirty thousand feet dillon indulged himself on half a bottle of krug champagne so whats the first move asked billy to find fitzgerald ropers going to check diving sites and the kind of hotels divers use if that doesnt work ill try my old friend aldo russo italian not spanish how come you were involved with him way back in the old days when i was the pride of the ira i was sent to sicily to buy arms only the mafia knew british intelligence was onto them so they moved russo his wife and son to ibiza and used that as a base there were spanish elements who didnt like it thought the mafia were encroaching on their territory what happened i did him a favor one night when a bit of business came up at the last minute i offered to drive his wife and son home two men whod been given the contract ambushed us wounded the boy and his mother dont tell me you took them out something like that god it was thirty years ago the son is an attorney in palermo now working for the mafia who knows and the wife cancer ten years ago there was silence for a while billy said when its time its time i suppose russo has never forgotten what you did italians are funny like that honor is everything billy you know that or respect billy said dillons codex four went and ferguson exploded what in the hell do you think you are playing at dont blame roper he was trying to make it official for lacey as for billy hes only here because hes a sentimentalist thinks he owes me put him on thats an order dillon handed the phone to billy yes boss for gods sake watch him the whole things put him on a knife edge i dont want to lose him do you think i do listen ive got a good feeling about this especially with russo on board ill hand you back whos russo ferguson demanded of dillon roper will fill you in i used to deal with him for the ira exmafia theres no such thing its like saying exira once in never out isnt that the truth of it oh for gods sake go to hell in your own way but keep in touch an angry man billy commented no really he cares billy about what we do and what happens to us he finished the last drop of champagne billy said ive never been to ibiza whats it like dillon said great in the old days more tourists now i used to love the old city ibiza town the bars gypsies bullfighters the flamenco dancers he shook his head bestlooking women youve seen in years sounds good you like the bulls then a lot of people wouldnt approve but theres something about a man putting himself straight in front of a charging bull it must be awesome it is dillon pushed his seat back im going to have forty winks he closed his eyes and hannah flooded in why did it have to be her and how much had he been responsible he saw ashimov plow her down in the street experienced again his own shots missing and hannah sliding down the railings and there was blood falling down her face and he was afraid and horrified and then the vision again the playa de toros the bullring in ibiza the toreros in uniform the picadors on horseback the band and then everything focusing on the red door on the other side the gate of fear and the bull roared out and came straight for him he came awake with a kind of convulsion a cry on his lips billy grabbed his arm you okay dillon said bad dream thats all he managed a smile and his phone went it was roper ive tried for fitzgerald through the divemasters association and the general run of hotels they use he was at a place called sanders but booked out earlier today ive managed to come up with one useful item a belov international falcon left ballykelly first thing this morning carrying one passenger a woman named mary hall who in the hell is she god knows the plane streaked across to archbury where guess what it picked up igor levin commercial attaché at the russian embassy destination ibiza so it gets even more interesting keep pushing on fitzgerald see what we can come up with everything is happening quickly lets keep it that way ill try roper switched off levin had phoned luhzkov at the london embassy and the gru computer had come up with the sanders hotel as the place where fitzgerald was staying he said to greta im keeping the plane as a precaution just in case he might have moved on lets go and check his hotel this sanders place ill get a cab the sanders hotel wasnt exactly a dead end the man on reception was a shifty sort of individual who made the point that fitzgerald had left in a hurry it was greta who instinctively knew he was holding back so he was only here for a day you know he always stays longer the man replied instinctively well yes levin took out an english fiftypound note dont try my patience where is he the receptionist of course opened up fitzgerald had decided to move on to algeria two hundred miles away hed taken the ferry to khufra hed often gone there in the past for the diving and this was when yesterday i wouldnt go there senõr its a rough place where would he stay god alone knows there are bad people there perhaps the trocadero dr tomac owns that theyre friends is he a real doctor the only one theyve got he runs the hotel the club the smuggling hes into everything is there an airport there a dump the man fingered through some tourist brochures and passed one across the khufra a terrible place greta took it are we going of course back to the airport the senior pilot was called scott the other smith levin informed them of the destination and scott looked it up and made a face were okay for fuel but not much else well probably have to do our own maintenance if we stay long youll probably need pistols if we stay long but never mind lets get on with it how long an hour not much more later as the falcon rose to thirty thousand greta read the brochure and discussed it with levin the khufra marshes hundreds of square kilometers of salt marsh on the algerian coast near cape djuinet reeds twelve meters high and more marsh arabs villages built on wood pilings theyve lived that way for centuries mainly fishing they also have berber tribesmen called husa who rode horses that over the centuries have been bred to swim in the salt marshes sounds like the last place god made he smiled but well manage i usually do give me a moment i want to speak to volkov he made the connection on the aircraft phone and put it on conference placing a finger on his lips to greta where on earth are you igor levin explained about khufra it sounds disgusting id imagined you would have known of my mission and major novikovas part in it no actually im sure major ashimov will get around to informing me when it suits him the silence was ominous we must return josef belov to the real world soon igor station gorky is well and good but since ferguson and johnson know who he really is lets take the wind out of their sails lets flaunt him in berlin or paris or london levin asked my goodness what a coup its so delicious because ferguson and company wouldnt be able to do a thing about it a neat point so take care and watch over novikova such beauty must not be placed in jeopardy as you say comrade and wear my gift at all times you are too valuable i cant afford to lose you ill take care you may be certain greta said what does he mean wear my gift at all times remember what saved ashimovs life when billy salter shot him a nylonandtitanium bulletproof vest so these things are miraculous the other year two chechnyans made an attempt on volkovs life when we were leaving an office in moscow they shot his driver and a security man and volkov i got between took a bullet in the left shoulder another in my left thigh ruining a perfectly good brioni suit but i shot one between the eyes and the other in the heart christ almighty volkov was delighted to be alive but annoyed i hadnt kept one alive to be squeezed so he did the same as ashimov presented me with a nylonandtitanium vest with an order to wear it at all times when i was in iraq with dillon on my last assignment he was wearing one there you are then its indispensable to all the best assassins so lets have a drink and decide on our next move the flight to khufra was no big deal and the approach to the coast was particularly interesting the khufra marshes extended for miles one creek after another dangerous reefs many arab fishing boats battling with the coast a few villages down there in the reeds there was always the desert of course stretching into the marsh country and then khufra town the airstrip and a few old concrete buildings the kind that looked as if they were surviving the second world war the control tower was basic captains scott and smith handled the controls between them and landed rolling to a halt beside a couple of old hangars they called ahead a police captain called omar greeted them with some enthusiasm the magic name of belov international weaving a spell even here on the edge of nowhere its a pleasure to meet you he said his eyes roving over greta she tried to ignore his sweaty armpits levin said i believe my pilot booked us into the trocadero and dr tomac has sent the land rover for you this was obviously intended as a compliment levin said to scott and smith im not sure how long this will take ill leave you to come to town but make sure the falcons secure dr tomac has already made arrangements this will be taken care of they walked toward the land rover and levins phone rang it was luhzkov from london i thought you should know gru contacts confirm that one of fergusons citations booked out of farley field destination ibiza passengers dillon and his salter friend billy the word is billys gone up in the world hes now officially an operative of the special security services apparently his criminal past has suddenly disappeared from all his records ferguson really is one of a kind levin said the kgb would have been proud of him thanks for the information levin followed greta into the land rover as they drove away he told her what had happened so theyre on their way whats that mean theyll still have to run fitzgerald to earth they wont know hes come over here but greta we want them to know itd be much better if dermot fitzgerald ended up in that great ira heaven in the sky even better if sean dillon and young salter accompanied him there thats asking a lot where dillons concerned perhaps but id say these khufra marshes would be a perfect killing ground he smiled and lit a cigarette yes i know its all terribly unpredictable but i like that its just a game to you always has been my love and he smiled just before landing at ibiza dillon got a call from ferguson youre just about to land i see thats right and the average spanish café does what they call a full english breakfast ive been thinking things over and i still dont approve its the murder squads business let them get on with it well they have and havent got very far okay we know fitzgeralds got here roper has information on that except that we know hes already moved by the time scotland yard and the home office apply to the spanish police and obtain the necessary warrants god knows where hell be at least im confining you to the island ferguson said im recalling the citation well manage im going to get him charles i promise you when they got out of the citation at the airport lacey said whats going on sean ferguson himself is recalling us at once oh ive been a naughty boy again dont worry about it just do as the great man says and well get on they hailed a cab and he told the driver to take them to eagle air at a small village up the coast from where russo ran his operation ill call roper and let him know whats happened he told billy roper said hes not pleased although hes not been the same since hannah on the other hand its inconvenient hes recalled the plane why the latest word is that the falcon has moved on to khufra on the algerian coast which means that fitzgerald is probably one step ahead of him id say so wed better get after them then the overnight ferry moved in to khufra town nosing into the port there were smaller hills draped with white moorish houses narrow alleys in between the port itself was small fishing boats two or three dhows various motor launches and way beyond the marshes the wind blowing in from the sea was warm and somehow perfumed with spices dermot fitzgerald loved it stood there at the rail as they floated in hed been here many times loved the women the food the diving if there was trouble there was tomac to take care of things and beyond the marshes for refuge it was like coming home and he slung his shoulder bag and went down the gangplank pushing his way through a forest of outstretched arms and walked up through the cobbled streets to the trocadero dillon brought billy up to date as they followed a winding road down to tijola a harbor with a small pier no fishing boats because theyd have gone out early a scattering of houses the interesting thing was the two floatplanes down there one of them floating in the harbor the other seated on a concrete slipway below the seawall they were eagle amphibians an old plane but sturdy and robust originally designed for service in the canadian far north one useful extra was that you could drop wheels beneath the floats and taxi out of the water onto dry land dillon found a mechanic working on the engine of the floatplane on the concrete ramp who greeted him warmly senõr dillon he said in spanish how wonderful dillon answered in the same language great to see you he gave him a quick embrace and broke into english so wheres aldo theyre running a few young bulls up at the playa this morning hes gone to watch its just for youngsters you know how it is well catch up with him there well have our bags no trouble amigo the playa de toros in ibiza was typical of most small towns in spain not much more than a concrete circle but the public was interested only in what went on inside the ring anyway and this early in the day was different no band no embroidered capes and suits no blaze of color just a motley crowd of youngsters hoping to try their luck and perhaps look interesting to someone important there were a few older men scattered round the front row including aldo russo seated on what was normally the president of the plazas bench dillon went up behind him and clapped him on the shoulders aldo russo glanced up and his face registered astonishment holy mother he jumped up and embraced dillon why didnt you warn me my visit came up in a hurry this is billy salter he said in italian one close to my heart a younger brother in all but blood it was a mafia saying and meant much russo looked billy over a younger brother he said in english i think hes been around the houses this one i think hes made his bones he shook billys hand maybe your friend has told you im mafia fifteen years ago we had much trouble with maltese gangs in london what kind of trouble billy asked they interfered i went as consiglieri counselor they wouldnt listen attacked my car one night when theyd promised safe conduct what happened my face was slashed i was on my knees when a famous london gangster whod heard of the plot and didnt approve came to my rescue with half a dozen men you see the maltese had offended him too it was my uncle harry billy said i grew up on that story as a kid black friday he smashed what they called the maltese ring he is still well he is still with us ask dillon russo embraced him kissed him on both cheeks what a blessing below the gate of fear opened and a number of young rather scrawny bulls ran out young men postured and started to flutter their capes years ago dillon used to come and see me and being younger and foolish id get up to the kind of nonsense were seeing now a bit of fun billy said most of the time but every so often amongst the young bulls there is a special one and i picked it one day i tried the cape slipped it tossed me over its shoulder and this one he nodded to dillon vaulted over the barrera down into the arena and when the bull turned to charge he dropped on his knees tore open his shirt jesus billy said he called hey toro just for me the bull came to a halt and two peons pushed me away and the bull stood there snorting and dillon walked up to it and patted it on the muzzle what happened the crowd roared overflowed the barrera into the ring carried him round on their shoulders it couldnt have been louder on the playa in madrid in the bars here they used to call him the man who seeks death and what he did that day is known as the pass of death billy turned to dillon who said maybe thats what i was looking for all this time who knows now can we go and get a drink theres something i need to discuss the café close to the playa wasnt too busy at that time in the morning inside the place was light and airy the walls whitewashed the bar top marble bottles crammed against the mirror behind bullfighting posters were all over the walls four fiercelooking gypsies sat at a table drinking grappa and playing cards two young men sat in the corner with guitars and countered each other the bartender was old and ugly the scar from a horn in his left cheek a friendly lot billy said if theyre on your side russo called to the barman whiskey all round barbera not me billy said russo turned to dillon he doesnt drink no he just kills people but only when necessary billy said russo shook his head i must be getting old the whiskey was brought they toasted each other salut russo said whats it all about then dillon told him afterward russo said trust you dillon to take on not only the ira but the russian federation you couldnt make it easy could you but i see where youre coming from the woman the police superintendent that was dirty they shouldnt have done that and to use the young nurse then kill her he shook his head so what do we do billy asked oh i still have considerable influence on this island russo told him my name is enough to start with ill call the receptionist at the sanders hotel he took out his mobile and made the call this is russo what can you tell me about an irishman called fitzgerald moved in then moved out where did he go the call lasted several minutes he finally switched off interesting he left on the overnight ferry for khufra on the algerian coast two hundred miles away apparently hes a friend of dr tomac who owns the trocadero and just about everything else in khufra and is on occasion a business associate of mine go on dillon said russo did not forgetting to mention levin and greta well we know who he is and shes the mysterious mary hall dillon said so whats your connection with this dr tomac cigarette smuggling mainly theres more money in that than hard drugs these days and the court sentences are infinitely smaller i have a diving concession there eagle deep its exceptional diving special clients book me to fly them over in one of my floatplanes would we be special clients dillon asked well lets say i owe you my friend and anyway as were not into the tourist season there isnt much trade and im bored and this sounds interesting then lets do it dillon said i couldnt be happier at tijola russo gave pedro his orders when they loaded the plane then said to dillon youre still flying i keep my hand in then its all yours he sat beside dillon billy behind dillon strapped himself in fired the engine allowed the eagle to slip down the runway into the harbor let the wheels up and called the tower at ibiza airport he indicated his destination there was a pause and then he got the good word he taxied out to sea past the end of the pier turned into the wind and boosted power he pulled back the column at exactly the right moment and the eagle climbed effortlessly over an azure sea and lifted hows it feel russo asked couldnt be better russo opened the map compartment reached in and produced a browning i presume you two are tooled up absolutely good because this is the khufra were going to where anything goes the khufra dr henry tomac was very large sixteen or seventeen stone wore a creased fawn linen suit and a panama hat even though he was sitting at a booth at his pride and joy the trocadero awnings at the front kept it cool and dark the great fans in the ceiling rotating relentlessly the barmen were algerians dressed in white shirts and trousers scarlet bands at the waist the headwaiter wearing a scarlet tarbush you could eat at the trocadero as well as drink and the company was mixed and very rough but tomac had a number of villainouslooking men who kept things in order because tomac demanded order and what tomac said went in khufra town he sat at his private booth waving the odd fly out of the way when dermot fitzgerald entered worked his way through the tables put down his bag and stood there may i join you dear boy of course you may champagne abdul he called to the headwaiter you may not want to oh dear have you been a bad boy again he savored the champagne abdul poured all right tell me so this russian agent levin and the novikova woman you got word that they were coming thats it and youve come over because youre worried they might intend to do away with you something like that well they are the receptionist at sanders hotel gave me a phone call earlier told me about a couple a goodlooking man and woman most interested in your whereabouts it fits in neatly with a call ive had from captain omar at the airstrip about a russian executive jet and a goodlooking man and woman on their way here their pilot brought them in on behalf of belov international im impressed dermot what can i do well im not sure because theres another strange thing ive had a second call from my friend the receptionist at the sanders hotel hes had a query about your whereabouts from a man he couldnt afford to offend a business acquaintance of mine who tomac told him fitzgerald was totally thrown i dont know this person mafia it doesnt make sense yes well he obviously knows you he flies floatplanes here runs a dive center maybe hes acting for certain people in london whod like to lay hands on you you seem to be in demand dermot help me for gods sake it will cost you how much i can pay well get out of sight you can use my apartment if necessary ill send you to the house at zarza in the marshes or one of the diving boats might be better well see fitzgerald cleared off and a few moments later levin and greta appeared followed by a waiter with their bags they paused at the top of the stairs greta causing quite a stir then came down and crossed to the bar tomac stood up miss hall he put her hand to his lips no more delightful visitor has graced my poor establishment dr tomac at your service it was like a game they were playing i dislike subterfuge for good reasons i have been traveling incognita i am in fact major greta novikova this is captain igor levin of the russian gru were here on state business serious business tomac managed to look grave please join me have the bags sent to the rooms abdul have some champagne served this is obviously a matter of the highest importance have you spoken of this to captain omar our chief of police as the champagne arrived greta said in ibiza we were told that in khufra there was only one person worth talking to and that is you doctor you flatter me major he toasted them your very good health now in what way may i assist you we seek a young man named dermot fitzgerald for what reason to save him from those who mean him more than ill will she said his life could be in danger two men we suspect levin said one called dillon irish the other salter good heavens tomac managed to look shocked and at that moment a plane roared quite low overhead what would that be greta asked tomac glanced out oh a floatplane from ibiza eagle air they come in all the time and tie up by the dive center look this is all very disturbing why dont you settle into your rooms and well talk again i look forward to it greta walked toward the bottom of the stairs followed by levin who paused and turned by the way you didnt say whether you know fitzgerald no i didnt did i tomac adjusted his panama picked up his stick and walked out dillon made an excellent landing outside the harbor and russo took over and taxied round to the other side of the pier there were a couple of sizable dive boats tied up to a small jetty a flatroofed white building with a canopy of deep blue and a notice that said eagle deep dive center there was a concrete ramp as on ibiza and russo dropped his wheels to taxi up an arab was tidying up on the deck of one of the boats and two heavily tanned men stripped to the waist and in jeans were drinking beer in the stern of the other they both looked around forty long hair muscular fit not arab dillon said no that one is on the other boat ibrahim the others are mine not only good italians but mafia the one with the scar on his cheek is jack romano the other is tino cameci they like it here its like a holiday i phoned before we left were expected i said you were a master diver looking for action well so is the boy wonder here did you mention fitzgerald yes romano says they know him you see the other dive center a hundred yards along tomac owns that there were three dive boats along with most things here they tell me fitzgerald hangs out there when hes around he took the eagle up on the ramp and switched off romano and cameci came to greet them and ibrahim came also and got their luggage dillon held on to a briefcase we didnt expect you for a while boss romano said in italian something came up dillon here is like a brother to me romanos eyes widened the dillon who saved your son your wife may she rest in peace my friend here doesnt speak italian dillon said but a gangster of the first rank in london his uncle his capo saved my bacon in that great city years ago so we are all friends lets have a drink on it and well discuss why were here sitting under a canopy in the stern of eagle one was very pleasant they split a bottle of chianti ice cold because russo liked it that way romano said we know this guy fitzgerald hes been coming on and off for a couple of years hes a friend of tomac dives from his joint is he any good billy asked he thinks he is you and dillon so you both dive billy smiled its been known dillon opened his briefcase and took a computer sheet out this fitzgerald has been a student at london university i got a friend of mine to access his file this is his photo you confirm its him they both examined it definitely romano said and you tell me hes ira well i was ira and i did many things but to persuade a young nurse to give this woman my sick friend an overdose then shoot the nurse dead when shes done her work i dont think i ever did a thing like that its a thing no man should do jack romano bit his thumb cameci said infamita well lets have another drink to a suitable death for him russo reached for the bottle and tomac came along the boardwalk tomacs come visiting tomac paused ibrahim on eagle two bobbed his head to him and there was a brief exchange dillon murmured fruits of a misspent youth but i speak arabic tomac said i see you ibrahim ibrahim said i see you effendi tomac said remember who your friends are is that so russo said but by that stage tomac was at the gangway ah my good friend russo permission to come aboard all this was delivered with perfect bonhomie why not romano stood up and gave him a hand and tomac eased his great body along the gangway and made it to a chair have a glass of chianti russo told him ice cold just the way you like it the way you like it tomac wiped his sweaty face with a large handkerchief and nodded gentlemen allow me to introduce mr dillon and mr salter russo said ive just flown them from ibiza ah here for the diving gentlemen dillon said i hear its spectacular i was urged to visit by an irish friend one dermot fitzgerald i dont think i know him dillon took the photo from the briefcase again perhaps you recognize him no im afraid not of course i cant be expected to remember all our customers many people come to dive here you will be staying long as long as it takes billy said do you intend to stay at the trocadero no well spend the night here russo told him how agreeable but id be desolated if you failed to visit my poor establishment before you leave he heaved himself up until later he negotiated the gangway and departed well at least we know hes lying dillon said there was a small coffee stall just along toward the pier ibrahim had walked over to it was standing there drinking a cup and tomac paused as he passed only briefly and moved on ibrahim came back to eagle two and russo called him to the rail what did tomac want for me to watch what your guests do and let him know and will you i am your man but if it pleases him to think otherwise ibrahim shrugged good have you anything to say to me my cousin was down from the airport the one who works for the police he says the plane which landed earlier is russian and owned by a company called belov international who was on it a man and a woman theyve moved to the trocadero and the plane still at the airport two pilots they are staying at the crews emergency quarters behind the bar thats interesting go along to the trocadero and ask your cousin ali the porter see whats going on this man fitzgerald you will recognize i understand hes dived here many times i want any information on him and the man and the woman from the airport ibrahim went obediently russo said well see what happens in the meantime lets have a swim at the trocadero fitzgerald listened intently while tomac filled him in so we have these russians from the gru who claim their mission is to protect you from these two men dillon and salter what shall i do ill tell abdul to take you in the land rover to the house at zarza only he wont hell take you to the dive center ill phone hussein and tell him to expect you you can stay in one of the dive boats or the old dhow the sultan keep your head down till we sort something out this is going to cost you ten thousand pounds i trust you realize that no trouble im good for it fitzgerald picked up his bag lets get moving i dont trust either side in this tomacs next move was partly a result of his devious nature he was smiling to himself as he went downstairs and found greta and levin in the bar by the window he eased himself down beside them this man you seek fitzgerald is at a house in zarza six miles up the coast from here in the marsh hes waiting to be picked up in a couple of hours to be taken to algiers something to do with smuggling nothing to do with me but the information is sound how do we get there greta asked ill have abdul take you in the land rover he puffed out his cheeks why i dont know as it cant possibly profit me youll be armed naturally levin told him a wise precaution in these parts he heaved himself up i can only wish you luck he went and spoke to abdul and shuffled away what do you think greta asked levin i dont see a better offer on the table levin shrugged why would he doublecross us what would be the purpose come on lets go and get ready tomac phoned the eagle deep dive center and asked for russo you know the old house at zarza tomac said yes this fitzgerald man i have it on good authority that hell be there in about two hours waiting for a lift to algiers a long drive russo said well maybe he wants to go as far away as possible if the information is useful use it pay me back another time he switched off the phone and started to laugh it was really very funny it would have been nice to have seen it so thats it russo said i dont know what hes playing at but its up to you it was billy who spoke well go for it what else is there to do here come on dillon lets get tooled up and go and take the sod on if hes there billy ill take you myself in the ford russo said even on these roads and a run into the marsh its fortyfive minutes at the most what have you got to lose he turned to romano and cameci you two mind the store the coast road was at least surfaced occasional small farms lots of date palms almond trees thin cows ribs showing sheep even the odd camel its like something out of the bible greta said levin smiled darling theyd probably cut my throat you of course theyd sell in the slave market thanks very much abdul enigmatic as he drove turned the land rover into the beginnings of the harsh and pungent smell of the marsh as they started along the dike roads wild fowl and seabirds stirred under protest the sky had darkened and greta said whats wrong summer storm abdul told her a cold front from the sea soon we get rain the sun had vanished the reeds ten feet high at least seemed to stretch to eternity it was as wild and desolate as anything greta had ever known mile upon mile of the great reeds stretching into the distance an eerie whispering as the wind moved amongst them and a strange mist fell and then it started to rain there are ponchos in the back locker abdul said levin pulled them out they were obviously exmilitary with hoods he passed one to greta and pulled the other one on himself as they progressed there were birds everywhere wild duck geese the one good thing was the flattening of the clouds of mosquitoes in the deluge and then at the end of one of the dike roads they turned onto a kind of island an overgrown garden all sorts of foliage date palms a gloomy weatherbeaten clapboard house with a terrace a large portico entrance french windows id say this was once a plantation levin said to greta abdul nodded there was a french family here for many years a century or more they drained part of the marsh made it prosperous then the war came and general de gaulle took the hard line the french people left local farmers took over and they were no good nature returned he shrugged the door is always open i leave you here ill park under the trees down the track and wait were too early i think they got out hoods up in the pouring rain and went forward both of them with a walther ready greta paused at the bottom of the steps leading to the wide terrace the front door opened and sean dillon stepped out billy on one side russo on the other hold it right there dillon said and then she pulled her hood back why dillon its you baghdad all over again the look on his face was astonishing absolute total shock and he dropped his hand that held the browning with a twentyround magazine up the butt my god greta taking advantage levin pushed her away flung himself to one side and fired but at his angle it was russo he caught chipping his left shoulder he kept on rolling as he hit the ground went into the reeds and disappeared and billy fired after him to no avail russo got up clutching his shoulder its okay could be worse dillon held out his hand mines bigger than yours he told greta she smiled of course and gave him her walther in the reeds levin watched them move in out of the rain a lucky shot might have got one of them but with a handgun at that range not all three and there was always the chance of hitting greta there was only one place to go really he eased his way back through the reeds and found abdul standing by the land rover in the rain holding an umbrella and peering through the trees levin slipped up behind him and tapped the back of his skull lightly with his walther no sign of fitzgerald at all i bet you enjoyed watching its not my fault effendi i was following dr tomacs orders who was the man i shot do i know the other two aldo russo he owns eagle air and the dive center hes a dangerous man mafia whats his connection with tomac cigarette smuggling to europe its big business now we come to fitzgerald hes here so where is he abdul hesitated and levin rammed the muzzle of the walther against his ear ill blow it off abdul came to heel quickly next to the tomac dive center an old dhow is moored the sultan hes there the boss told him to stay out of the way excellent i like cooperation so you can drive me back to town and well see what tomac has to say about this almighty cockup dillon billy and russo had arrived only twenty minutes before abdul and levin and greta there were old stables at the rear and russo had suggested hiding the ford in there and waiting in the house that the absence of fitzgerald and the arrival of levin and greta had been more than a surprise went without saying billy was stunned by greta its like lazarus out of his coffin and walking again only he was a fella my goodness billy you actually read the bible greta said never mind the repartee levin hasnt hung around long has he dillon told her dont be silly billy said he did the smart thing hed taken off russos flying jacket and his white flying scarf and was binding it round the wounded shoulder so what happened to you back there at drumore dillon took out his cigarettes and offered her one she decided to let it all hang out somebody blew up the kathleen i suppose that was you dillon im afraid so i got blown over the stern by the blast belov and murphy werent so lucky she turned to billy not that you did much better a bullet in the shoulder and back for ashimov didnt do much to a bulletproof vest dillon was cold with fury so its been ashimov behind everything revenge dillon you killed belov his greatest friend the man who was like a father to him so max zubin hangs around in station gorky blackmailed by his mothers presence in moscow liam bell runs things for the ira at drumore and you and ashimov set about a murder campaign revenge dillon like i told you this guy levin hes good only he hires bum people harry salters bentley roper in his wheelchair even the business with hannah was a botchup hed nothing to do with that she was surprised how defensive she felt it was hardly igors fault if the material he was supplied with was rubbish ira rubbish as blake found when he took them on at drumore yes he was good but bernstein was ashimov he arranged it with bell it was bell who recruited the young nurse and fitzgerald once shed done her job fitzgerald shot her then left for ibiza with his loot a good payday she felt even more defensive i wasnt involved it was ashimov and bell ive told you sounds good only here you are with your new associate trying to knock off fitzgerald she was almost pleading it was mary killane who murdered bernstein not me mary killane didnt murder anybody she was a tool dillon shook his head im tired of this lets get back to khufra and sort tomac out at least hes got one use he can give you some medical treatment aldo on the way to town levin gave the whole thing serious consideration that greta was in the hands of the opposition was beyond dispute as was the fact that to get her back from dillon slater and russo would hardly be likely in fact the obvious thing would be to cut his losses and run he phoned captain scott at the airstrip somethings come up can you be on standby for a swift departure of course no trouble with air traffic control scott laughed what air traffic control can you refuel here very cheaply where for id say ballykelly direct and major novikova it looks like she may have to make other arrangements get on with it levin sat there thinking about it the entire situation it was droll in a way yet he was beginning to tire of failure particularly when it was hardly his fault he said to abdul im going to the trocadero to say goodbye to dr tomac then im leaving without the lady effendi the other side has got her too bad there is one thing you can do for me though take me to the sultan and introduce me to fitzgerald effendi please abdul was pleading youll do exactly as i say otherwise ill kill you levin said calmly now get on with it they parked outside the tomac dive center and levin said go on lead the way as you say effendi abdul seemed resigned now and headed up the gangway along the deck on the starboard side and entered a corridor with reverse cabin doors go on call him levin said abdul did are you there mr fitzgerald its me abdul im in the saloon a voice called abdul led the way it was large with a high ceiling walls of mahogany oldfashioned cane furniture and a long bar many bottles ranged on the shelves and fitzgerald standing behind pouring irish whiskey into a tall glass and then a splash of soda dr tomac has sent me whats he want fitzgerald came round the bar and levin pulled abdul to one side its not what he wants its what i want dermot fitzgerald fitzgerald seemed to freeze the shock intense igor levin ive a message from mary killane rot in hell you bastard his arm swung up the silenced walther coughed and he shot fitzgerald between the eyes hurling him back to bounce off the bar and fall to the floor excellent levin said now you can take me to the trocadero youll wait for me a few minutes then take me to the airstrip is that understood do as youre told and i wont kill you levin went straight up to his room and collected his luggage hed hardly bothered to unpack so it took only a minute or two and he was downstairs to the bar there was no sign of tomac and levin went out and dumped his bag behind abdul where would tomac be in his apartment at the top of the stairs ill be back he reached for the keys a precaution he went upstairs whistling opened tomacs door and walked straight in the doctor was sitting behind his desk reading glasses on the end of his nose the panama still on his head he looked up frowned slightly no more than that my dear sir you look like a man in a hurry i am bound for the airstrip where ill be flying away out of your life forever and major novikova unfortunately in the hands of the opposition there was no fitzgerald at zarza only dillon slater and russo they got the major i shot russo and did a runner tomac tried to brazen it out no fitzgerald i dont understand oh i caught up with him in the saloon of the sultan thanks to abdul hes on his back there now eyes staring at the ceiling like you usually do when youve been shot in the head this is all most unfortunate he took off his spectacles yes isnt it levin reached for the door handle dammit i was forgetting something he turned the silenced walther coughed again and tomac went over backward in the chair yes that was it levin said and went out abdul was still at the wheel and levin got in the land rover beside him right the airstrip and when you get back id check on dr tomac he didnt look too well to me they were waiting at the airstrip there was an instant takeoff and they climbed up to thirty thousand and headed out to sea levin phoned volkov and reported in volkov listened and said calmly at last a success fitzgerald taken care of is a blessing a pity about novikova what can we do about that very little at the moment i would imagine shell return to london with dillon and salter ferguson will put her in the safe house at holland park which is hardly the lubyanka she poses no threat ferguson knows everything she knows shall i speak to ashimov youd like that wouldnt you i like keeping him in his place then do it volkov switched off levin lit a cigarette smiled then phoned ashimov on board eagle one they sat in the saloon got russos scarf and shirt off and examined the damage romano got the firstaid box but it was greta who examined it let me look i did a field nursing course years ago for afghanistan she shook her head i can do a patchup job but it needs more than stitching the bullets cut across the shoulder hell need treatment at hospital level well that can wait until im back in ibiza russo said just get on with it which she did romano said so this whole thing was a mess you could say that dillon said well we could have told you after you left cameci and i caught sight of that fitzgerald guy on the deck of the sultan down the jetty dillon glanced at billy and stood up watch her greta said where would i go for gods sake they went up the gangway and paused at the top it was very quiet dillon drew his walther and billy fanned out to one side and they finally came to the saloon and discovered fitzgeralds body thats it then billy said they went out on deck and the falcon roared overhead at five or six hundred feet and climbing and there goes levin dillon said you could say he did you a favor billy observed as they went down the gangway dillon called roper on his codex four at holland park weve got novikova believe it or not still in the land of the living fitzgeralds dead levin just left in his falcon so draw your own conclusions try and find out where hes going will do roper laughed its better than the midnight movie on tv they returned to find the others assembled in the stern of eagle one ibrahim was included and looked scared romano said hes been up at the trocadero to see his cousin ali theyve sent for the police it would seem dr tomacs turned up shot dead in his apartment greta said my goodness igor has been busy russo said dont be stupid lady you want us to stay here and explain things to algerian police youd have sex every time you went to the shower whether you liked it or not he turned to romano did you refuel of course good then lets get out of here back to ibiza youll have to fly the whole trip sean they took off ten minutes later dillon and russo in the front billy and greta in the rear as they turned to climb dillon glanced down and saw two land rovers racing along to the jetty police russo said arriving too late as usual i know dillon said just cant help it and he set course for ibiza things going smoothly he went on autopilot and called ferguson its me he said ferguson at his cavendish place apartment was testy i was expecting you ropers spoken to me weve gotten out of khufra by the skin of our teeth my friend aldo russo is slightly damaged greta novikova returned from the grave is in our hands i presume youd like to see her i certainly would especially as she tells me yuri ashimov also survived drumore do we get the citation of course you do you only have to get off the bloody phone everything okay billy asked so it would appear you know ferguson dillon was lighting a cigarette onehanded when the engine suddenly missed a beat and spluttered it was russo who checked oil pressure dillon said life jackets under the seats get them on he pulled on his own and turned to russo what do you think that weve been well and truly done maybe it was levin more likely one of tomacs boys look at the oil gauge it was fluctuating alarmingly id say somebodys put water in the oil over a period of time as the engine heats up the water builds up into a head of steam usually blows the filler cap off thats why the oil gauge is going wild id say the engine will stop any moment now they were coming into the ibizan coast descending nosing toward the bay and tijola and the engine did indeed splutter and die they started to glide with a strong crosswind bouncing them if were lucky i can land but notice the waves if they tip us over well go straight down how deep aldo six or seven fathoms right this is the way it goes dillon said if we land and tip over get out fast and swim were close to the shore if we tip over and go straight down dont do a thing until we settle on the bottom wait while were there and dont try to open the door until enough waters got in to equalize the pressure even billy was alarmed for christs sake get this right dillon dillon dropped the eagle in but the waves were swirling sideways and the plane dipped and went straight down you know what youre doing russo cried believe it or not ive been here before dillon said the water was dark and clear the instrument lights still glowing and the plane lifted a little coasted forward and landed on the bottom of the bay clear sand a rock here and there and the water was over their heads and dillon pushed the door open turned and grabbed greta and pushed her out he floated up holding gretas hand billy to the left of him russo to the right you had to be careful about coming up from depth when diving but they didnt have much choice they broke through to the surface greta gasping you all right dillon demanded well i wouldnt say you know how to please a lady greta said but im sure it beats the showers at khufra prison good lets get going and they turned and swam the few yards to the shore later at the airport in the vip lounge they sat waiting billy dillon and greta for the arrival of the citation x we certainly see a little bit of everything billy said i mean what was that all about the automatic door opened and russo came in his arm in a sling so here you are how did you get on greta asked fifteen stitches i cant feel my arm he leaned down and kissed her thanks for what you did listen cara if youd like an older man im available ive got a great villa in sicily at agrigento its a good offer but ill get by with ferguson in the safe house you dont understand aldo he cant do anything to me cant accuse me of anything its not that im not guilty its because dillon and billy are guilty too and ferguson cant admit that well as long as you know what youre doing he kissed her again and lacey came in through the door ready for takeoff dillon said to russo sorry about the plane no big deal its not too deep and near the shore the crew will have her up easy if you say so they all got up and russo put his good arm around dillon anytime my friend anytime you must be mad dillon said and led the way out london ireland when they landed at farley field the daimler was waiting with ferguson beside the driver there was also a shogun with the military police sergeant major from holland park henderson and a black sergeant called doyle they stood waiting watchful in navy blue blazers and neat ties normal except for the earpieces and that special look common to security men all over the world they disembarked from the citation and walked toward the daimler and ferguson got out major novikova what a pleasure i seldom get the opportunity to greet someone risen from the dead he held out his hand which she took instinctively i hope theyve been looking after you which reduced her to helpless laughter come on general lets get on with it lets see what youre going to do with me and then ill comment one thing is certain ill need a hairdresser prolonged immersion in seawater is not to be recommended im sure we can manage that ill have one brought in to the holland park safe house such a good address excellent quarters totally secure wonderful company major ropers there very special man youll get on famously while you pick my brains now would i do that to you major absolutely and she climbed into the daimler as he held open the door for her at holland park they were joined by roper and sat round the table in the conference center henderson and doyle standing against the wall keeping a watchful eye on things you must think youve been through the wringer major ferguson told her you could say that life with dillon and billy is a bit of a roller coaster now tell me about the putin warrant i can take it as definite that the president himself passed that document across yes i was there with ashimov she shrugged and levin and she smiled ah i see you dont know everything oh but i do know most things volkov for example what can you tell me about him i only met him once he appears to control belov international for the government the president joined us handed over the warrant told us he expected us to do our duty in this matter never mentioned belov just left whats the point of the exercise two actually belov international is so important to the country at the moment they dont want the sort of movement on the world financial market that would take place if there was news of belovs death and whats your second point volkov thinks you and your people are a great nuisance and better put out of the way once and for all thanks very much billy told her would you say the president agrees the president is clever he hands out a warrant but it gives not the slightest indication what its for the bearer of this letter acts with my full authority all personnel civil or military will assist in any way necessary dillon said that can mean everything or nothing but not from volkovs point of view and ashimovs been happy to assist him greta said there was a pause roper said so an unhappy max zubin still sits there in station gorky yes i thought youd know about him well hes shaved the beard off it is an extraordinary resemblance so they tell me he posed as belov once before ashimov was there yes we know that and his mother in moscow ive met her fantastic woman one of our greatest actresses she leads an open life i mean where would she go with him to think of and where would he go dillon said any plans for him to be moved roper asked i believe so an appearance in moscow or paris i suppose a sight of him would dispel any rumors about belov keep things looking normal yes i suppose it would what about levin ferguson asked where do you think hes gone he had the plane so hell have gone to ballykelly ashimov is there really how interesting ferguson stood up i must take that on board enough for now your hairdresser after all hes top priority well meet again later at hangmans wharf there was a magnificent warehouse development it was harrys pride and joy walking distance from the dark man and turned into apartments of total luxury unique in design the ultimate was the penthouse vast spread across a huge top floor reached by two private elevators one in front the other at the back where the original cargo gates opened there were now terraces of hardwood jutting twenty feet out over the river and from the penthouse it was a seventyfoot drop the furnishings were cedar and mahogany a great desk for harry salter in the corner sofas sumptuous carpets everywhere indian chinese and in the openplan design a fabulous kitchen area with graceful hoods taking the fumes away and harrys personal chef selim from the restaurant harrys place he had energetically supervised the meal mainly indonesian for the salters dillon ferguson and roper even henderson and doyle seated at the far end of the bar and keeping a watchful eye on things had been well taken care of and there was greta of course youve been very frank major ferguson told her why well to be practical i suspect you know most of what i told you i might have done a little filling in but thats all anyway what happens now you cant arrest me that would be terribly inconvenient you think so i know so every job you and your people do is a black operation it never happened never existed dillon and billy would never dream of going out there under orders and killing everybody on sight but they do which leaves me in the clear so what happens to me if he sends you back love i think old volkov would either shoot you or send you to the gulag that was billy of course you could claim asylum roper said if i found myself on the pavement the most you could do is ask colonel luhzkov to send me home i have diplomatic immunity how boring ferguson said and what a bleeding waste harry put in what if i made you a proposition ferguson said throw in my lot with you oh no something much more subtle what if i gave you a chance to return to the fold your own people what hand me over to luhzkov tell him to fly me out much much better than that now listen to me theres one thing i suggest you do first though and whats that first let me ask you where you think levin might be she frowned drumore place probably he handed her his codex four im sure you know his number give him a call tell him what you think of him after all he dumped you at khufra she sat looking at him then shook her head what would be the point id like to know if he is there id like to know if ashimov is still there i want them and dont kid yourself i intend to have them dead or alive it makes no odds to me so what does that mean if you wont join in well go and find out for ourselves dillon young billy here come to think of it ill go billy said not another bleeding beach drop any approach from a plane would alert them ferguson said no well do what weve done before a passage by night billy oban to the irish coast it will do me good a little rough weather and sea air does it suit you gentlemen dillon was smiling billy shrugged and harry said only if i can come too ferguson said thats it then he smiled at greta you my love will be left in limbo with major roper at holland park thats actually illegal she said well i could just as easily have you deported via the russian ambassador direct to moscow i dont think it would do your career plans much good do you my god youre just as bad as they are true its the nature of the game we all play and in my own way im sure im just as unforgiving as general volkov you see theres one unfortunate thing about this whole wretched business which wont go away and what would that be detective superintendent hannah bernstein there was a moment of terrible silence as if a chill had touched everyone there dillons face was white skin stretched the eyes dark holes it was as if death had come to meet them strangely it was billy who spoke in a gentle voice she was a special lady she deserved better there was nothing greta could say and ferguson sighed you could have joined the team major you blew it so well leave you in limbo levin sat in the royal george as rain swept in from the sea finished his fish pie and ordered another vodka from patrick ryan who had only half a left ear a row of surgical clips holding it together the whole lot glistening with surgical spray when did you say hed be back he asked ryan referring to ashimov two maybe three he and liam bell went down to dublin i heard them talking it was something to do with the russian embassy there was a roaring overhead levin said that sounds like an approach to ballykelly it could be he went off to the kitchen and a moment later levins phone rang ashimov said im still at the embassy in dublin awaiting orders god knows why but ive news for you and what would that be volkov wants you in london theyre sending a falcon i think its just flown in youre to report to luhzkov and await orders have you any idea why not in the slightest is it safe for gods sake of course it is youre a commercial attaché at the embassy ferguson cant touch you it would cause a diplomatic incident and they wouldnt like that at the moment why dont ask questions just do as youre told he switched off levin sighed went behind the bar found a glass and reached for the vodka the door burst open in a gust of rain and wind and liam bell swept in with one of his men connor there you are how was ibiza hardly noticed algeria was crap give me one of those levin dosed it out and one for connor so youve come back alone ive just had ashimov on the phone from dublin he was closeted with the ambassador all highly bloody secret and not for the ears of a peasant like me told me he wouldnt be back until tomorrow and sent me packing and me thinking you were such good friends dont make fun of me bell grabbed the vodka bottle and poured another i couldnt if i tried he walked round the bar and connor a brawny individual grabbed him by the jacket dont you talk to mr bell like that you russian prick actually my grandmother on my mothers side came from cork levin tossed the vodka in his glass into connors eyes and headbutted him sending him back against the bar liam bell reached under his armpit and levin had his walther out and under his chin in a second i wouldnt i really wouldnt theyve sent a plane for me im needed in london he patted bell on the face try and be good while im away lacey and parry delivered ferguson and his party to the raf air sea rescue base at oban on the west coast of scotland where they were picked up by a couple of raf sergeants who took them by land rover to oban itself one of them said thats the highlander two hundred yards out the inflatable at the jetty is yours i know it doesnt seem much sir but its got twin screws a depth sounder radar automatic steering it just looks bad because its meant to i get the point sergeant ferguson smiled actually were old friends safe journey back i dont care what he says harry shook his head it looks like a bummer to me i agree it doesnt look like its nosing into the marina at monte carlo but i suspect it will suit our purposes adequately ferguson said now lets get our gear on board a great deal of oban seemed to be enveloped in a blanket of mist and rain swept in in the distance clouds swallowed the mountaintops and bay and kerrera and there was heavy weather as waves dashed across the firth of lorn ive said it before billy moaned what a bloody place it rains all the time its cold nonsense ferguson patted his shoulder some of the finest views in the highlands here now lets stow our gear and think about food ferguson everything stowed went up on deck and found dillon in the wheelhouse with harry and billy he was taking weaponry from the quartermasters bag and passing pistols across one for you charles he gave him a walther then dropped a flap beside the instrument panel disclosing some clips screwed into place he put a walther in one a browning with a twentyround clip in the other and pushed the flap back into place just so you all know theyre there now what was it you said about food they crossed to the jetty in the inflatable found a nearby pub that offered a log fire a variety of drinks and a venison pie which they all sampled later back on the highlander they sat under the canvas awning over the stern rain pouring off and except for billy drank whiskey and smoked and dillon turned on the deck lights for that early darkness of the far north was closing in on them so whats the plan ferguson asked what would you like to happen dillon asked id like us to slip in out of the night like young lord nelson on a cullingout expedition and do what get our hands on ashimov and levin or to be honest and it was a perfect world shoot the bastards do you think thats too much to expect not if we leave at six hit the irish coast early in the morning under cover of darkness drape the highlander with nets to look like a fishing boat that way we can close in on shore and land weve one big advantage billy said dillon and me know drumore place know what were getting into there was a pause ferguson said is that supposed to mean something just that you and harry stay on the boat dillon said and no arguments we need somebody on board anyway to handle it if we have to make a quick getaway hes right harry said i mean wed be just lumbering around wouldnt we i know harry i too hate getting old ferguson nodded the balls in your court sean dillon shook his head there you go calling me by my first name again they left at six dillon at the wheel and ferguson joined him it was still dark wind stirring whats the forecast ferguson asked four to five when we hit the open sea dillon took out a cigarette onehanded and flicked his zippo i love this so do i remember i told you how i tried to make up for a lost love by sailing the atlantic run singlehanded portsmouth by long island i remember what lost you your love the woman couldnt marry a man whod take out five ira men in derry whod tried to assassinate him an old story my boy is there any chance you could let me take over be my guest dillon went out and ferguson checked his instruments and took the highlander through the harbor entrance in a long sweeping current to the firth the swell started to move beneath the masthead light began to roll rhythmically from side to side through the gloom he could see the redandgreen navigation lights of a steamer he steadied at twelve knots and plunged forward feeling better than hed done for years in london earlier in the afternoon levin had reported to luhzkov at the embassy so whats all the fuss about ive no idea i had a most secret from volkov saying to hold you here you mean physically of course not hold you available and you dont know why no levin said well boris you have my number im staying at the dorchester so youll have no trouble finding me later sitting in the corner of the piano bar indulging in a pasta salad and champagne levin was approached by guiliano the manager so we could have a little excitement around here guiliano said what do you mean a fellow countryman of yours what on earth are you talking about putin hes going to attend some eu conference in paris but theres a whisper hell look in here on his way back you mean visit london no visit here the dorchester hed be in good company weve had every president in europe stay at this hotel he went to attend another customer levin lit a cigarette and sat there thinking about it maybe that was it maybe his presence was needed in some way it was a crazy world where international intelligence organizations could have their secrets and yet those secrets were readily available on the grand hotel circuit you had to laugh and he waved to the waiter to pour him another glass of champagne and toasted himself to you igor he murmured the only sane man in a world gone mad having said that it occurred to him that under the circumstances it might be sensible to book out of the hotel until hed seen the way things worked out which meant staff quarters at the embassy for a while how dreary but there was no help for it later on the highlander dillon took over and ferguson went and sat in the saloon with harry salter there was no sign of billy harry said hes taken a couple of pills and gone for a liedown in the aft cabin the old seasickness really gets to him join me in a large scotch ferguson said finest remedy i know for seasickness they savored it for a while then harry said what do you think our chances are i mean are we daft or just a couple of old geezers sticking two fingers up at the world never old harry old is a state of mind the present expedition isnt particularly crazy we slip in under cover of darkness dillon and billy visit drumore place lift ashimov and levin bring them down to the highlander at gunpoint and away could go very well and it could go very badly harry shook his head why are we here right now with the sea rising as far as i can tell somewhere off the isle of man ferguson poured him more whiskey maybe it is something to do with getting old maybe were trying to show we can still cut it that makes sense for you and me but what about billy i mean hes rich got everything he wants maybe thats not the way he sees it ferguson said hes got everything and hes got nothing or thats how it seems dillons not too badly off when it comes to cash harry said from his mercenary days ferguson shrugged people paid highly for his services the whispers are true harry he really did arrange the mortar attack on john major and the war cabinet in ninetyone during the first iraq war the ira no an iraqi billionaire paid him bigtime the bastard hes never played favorites our sean in the old days hed be working for the plo one minute and the israelis the next what makes him tick ah the game harry and theres always the danger that in the end instead of you playing the game the game is playing you anyway thats enough of that i think ill have a little shuteye and then ill take over from dillon at the royal george in drumore trade was brisk in the corner booth liam bell sat with walsh kelly magee a walking stick beside him a relic of blake johnsons bullet in the thigh walking wounded kelly nudged magee well this ones no better magee said as ryan appeared from the kitchen are you sure you can still hear patrick ryan put down the tray of ale he was carrying stuff you magee would you like to buy your own well youve got to admit he was a desperate kind of a fella that johnson shut up bell said and drink up i want some of you at the house walsh kelly magee he turned to three young men at the next table they were new recruits connor derry and gibson you stay down here overnight with ryan and mind what he tells you they were young arrogant and had their aks on the bench beside them we will that mr bell and keep your mobiles on at all times now go to the kitchen for your supper then ryan will work a rota for you taking turns checking the harbor after they had gone ryan said are you expecting trouble liam christ knows what to expect in the present situation ashimovs staying over in dublin theres something up but i dont know what levins been called to london jesus but he needs taking down a peg ryan said dont be stupid man it was connor who got taken down in two seconds flat you avoid contact with levin at all times he was a paratrooper in chechnya medals the lot anyway drink up and well move up to the house mrs ryans left us a nice supper in the kitchen there was quite a sea running and cold spray stung fergusons face as he moved along the heaving deck and opened the wheelhouse door sean dillon was standing at the wheel his face disembodied in the compass light itll get worse before it gets better ill take over ferguson brushed past and took over the wheel he increased speed racing the heavy weather that threatened from the east and the waves grew rougher go on get below and find something to eat ill be fine it was dark very dark and yet there was a slight phosphorescence from the sea now and then at one stage there was the gleam from a lighthouse in the distance but as they plowed on except for the occasional red and green lights of a ship they might as well have been alone in a dark world at holland park roper was seated at the computers eating a sandwich when there was a knock at the door and sergeant doyle looked in ive got major novikova sir she asked to speak to you fine show her in sergeant she brushed past doyle dressed in a padded dressing gown what is it roper asked im bored tired of being locked up with two bloodhounds taking shifts seated outside my door how long will this go on for she sat down and doyle leaned against the wall as long as ferguson wants he could hold you indefinitely under the prevention of terrorism act what if i want to be sent home they dont know youre here he smiled she said at last that frozen face of yours has cracked he stopped smiling she threw up her hands i cant believe i said that it was a car bomb wasnt it ira one of many and you can work with dillon sean was never a bomb man he lit a cigarette and offered her one youd be better off going back to bed her mobile was on the desk close to his hand and now for the first time it sounded roper switched it on held it to his ear there was a hint of breathing he offered it to her she shook her head he smiled put it to his ear again and said major novikovas residence the caller disconnected roper moved into the emergence pattern on his computer knowing it would be a waste of time and it was a coded instrument and a good one impossible to trace of course id go back to bed and consider your options major hes a very reasonable man the general with people who are reasonable with him as you english would say what a load of cobblers and she got up and walked out followed by doyle roper thought about calling ferguson and telling him about it but decided against it he couldnt even tell the general area the call had come from so there wasnt much to tell he wondered how they were getting on and went back to work at station gorky max zubin sat in his room and talked to his mother he did that a lot and was allowed unlimited time after all security were listening to the conversations her cheerful tough humor kept him relatively sane but all her conversations ended in the same way when am i going to see you i cant say well josef belov has ultimate power people listen to his orders but im just a poor jewish actor mama and i dont even get actors guild minimum sure there are hints i might be making a move thats all i can say god bless three miles off drumore the highlander drifted under automatic pilot while they gathered in the saloon and sorted out the weaponry dillon and billy wore black special forces overalls and flak jackets balaclava helmets rolled up at the moment but ready for the right sinister effect later a walther each in a shoulder holster an ak in the silenced mode ferguson and harry wore flak jackets and each had an ak to hand there was a chart open on the table showing the general approach to drumore with the nets up well look like any other fishing boat dillon said lay offshore beyond the point well go in the dinghy its got silencers on the outboard tie up on the west side of the jetty and proceed to the house could work like a swiss watch billy said or the kind you buy off a stall at camden market harry grumbled well well see ferguson smiled its good to smell powder again lets get on with it ill tell roper its all systems go at holland park roper listened so approximately thirty minutes id say so excellent ill stand by he lit a cigarette and sat in the shadowed room watching his screens his inputs to the russian embassy in london his scanning of what was happening with belov international ashimov levin the names of all involved parties waiting for what might come up anything a dirty night for it and he waited dillon and billy went over the rail to the dinghy billy pushed the starter button on the engine and it rumbled into life a gentle pulsating sound not much noise to it at all they coasted in on the west side of the jetty beached and moved away fast sinister figures in the darkness there was a light at the bar windows of the royal george dillon put a finger to his lips and he and billy approached cautiously and peered in connor derry gibson and ryan were sitting round a table by the log fire playing cards the curtain was halfdrawn the window two or three inches open and dillon eased it back and heard ryan say ill make some bacon sandwiches and tea derry and gibson take a walk round for a quick check ah jesus mr ryan do we have to thats liam bells orders and thats what youll do now be off with you dillon and billy hurried away following the winding path they remembered so well all the way up to drumore place there was the luxuriant garden summerhouses the huge terrace french windows light glowing dimly here and there somebodys up early billy murmured well lets take a look and dillon raised his night glasses at that moment a french window opened and walsh and kelly stepped out liam bell behind just check the garden he said and turned back come on dillon said to billy and moved forward at holland park roper was still at his computers to a man so badly damaged sleep does not come easily and he frequently worked all night a diet of whiskey and sandwiches keeping him going there was a sudden stirring on his screens as a tracer element analyzed not photos but staff day records at russian embassies around the world and there was major yuri ashimov overnighting at the dublin embassy it was just as interesting to find out that captain igor levin was back on staff at the london embassy and resident there he called ferguson at once on his codex four and ferguson in the wheelhouse with harry was horrified things are in motion theyre on the job now and too late to abort if i ring dillon on his codex it could be exactly at the wrong moment its your call general no ashimov no levin there just the good old ira god i dont have much choice do i and ferguson called dillon who unfortunately was otherwise engaged as dillon and billy had started up to the terrace bell turned the terrace lights on from inside the library revealing dillon and billy moving forward walsh called out intruders mr bell and fired his ak billy ducked behind the balustrade and knocked walsh down kelly turned stumbled and had dillon all over him dillon pulled up his hood kelly said christ its you dillon so it is and ill kill you stone dead if you dont answer my question ashimov and levin where are they ashimovs in dublin due back later today levin flew in to ballykelly from ibiza and out again to london he was terrified i swear to god sean and where would liam bell be getting the hell out of here if hes got any sense as he said that there was the sound of a car starting up and driving away there the bastard goes billy said dillon called up ferguson the whole things gone sour charles were on our way back come and get us he said to kelly i keep my word run for it which kelly did pausing to watch them go then calling through to patrick ryan at the royal george youve got bad trouble coming your way he said but ryan already knew for earlier derry and gibson patrolling the harbor had discovered the dinghy and the outboard still warm on the west side of the jetty well i dont know whose this is but its soon taken care of derry pulled out a pistol putting three holes in it offshore ferguson heard and said to harry were going in im with you harry said and went out on deck his ak ready they went in quickly to the harbor and dillon and billy coming down the hill path came under fire from ryan and connor dillon hit connor with two shots ryan ducked down and caught billy in the middle of his flak jacket with a lucky shot that knocked him over dillon hauled him up and they continued running headlong down the path toward the jetty and the beach derry and gibson started to fire up at them caught on the exposed path and the highlander roared in out of the darkness harry fired in sustained bursts at the two men on the beach by the dinghy as dillon and billy burst onto the jetty as the highlander bounced off the jetty they scrambled over the rail derry was down and ferguson at the wheel dropped the flap and pulled out the browning with the twentyround clip and sprayed the beach as they swerved away knocking down gibson as well before they were swallowed up by darkness later on automatic pilot they sat in the saloon and drank whiskey well that was brisk harry said and a bleeding waste of time billy shook his head we couldnt even get liam bell at the time there was no way of knowing ashimov was overnighting in dublin levin in london it was just bad luck and major novikova wouldnt cooperate the thing that really interests me is levin being sent to london dillon said id like to know why he got up well have to give him some special attention when we get back anyway ill take the wheel the rest of you can get some sleep the sky was streaked with light and way over on his left the isle of man was apparent in spite of the rain it could have been worse dillon told himself at least he and billy had walked away from it thanks to harry and ferguson it was the enemy whod suffered the thing was what happened now he lit a cigarette his codex four went it was roper you and billy are in one piece obviously just about liam bell did a runner at the house his boys gave us a hard time ferguson and harry were wonderful bells short three maybe four men so we did some good you certainly did the thing is what happens now oh thats easy president vladimir putin visits the european unions paris conference tomorrow then he intends to divert to london have a chat with the prime minister stay at the dorchester and fly back to moscow in the morning what for oh a remarkable story of greed corruption and politics which has only unfolded within the past hour on my screens ive tried ferguson but he isnt replying flat on his back below they all are not surprising how far to oban id have said two hours but theres quite a sea running its going to get worse you could do me a favor and alert lacey and parry will do ill leave the juiciest details of the putin visit until i see you except to say hell have an interesting guest with him at the dorchester josef belov dillon was stunned how can that be and then he saw it max zubins going to do belov again in london something like that well talk again dillon thought about it then put the boat on automatic pilot and went below to tell ferguson the extraordinary news in moscow at the kremlin max zubin bundled out of bed at station gorky ordered to be dressed and ready in an hour then flown at what had seemed like express speed stood in front of volkovs desk you have a wonderful opportunity to serve your country your finest hour you will visit paris as part of the presidents entourage travel to london to perform the same service at the dorchester hotel and then return to moscow but what is the service i perform comrade just your role as josef belov there will even be appearances on television im sure youll do very well yes but in the theater were expected to know our lines thats really very good theres a press release here have a quick look zubin scanned it and handed it back i see so now you know what its about if anyone talks to you but well keep conversation to a minimum just remember you are josef belov except to my captors dont be silly those who guard you at station gorky call you belov because thats who they think you are of course your controller listening to your phone calls knows can i see my mother while im here if you introduce yourself as a friend after all you couldnt possibly be her son if you follow me you were bearded thats who mikhail her chauffeur knew zubin shook his head so my driver ivan kurbsky thinks im the real belov of course im just like the king in the prisoner of zenda what on earth are you talking about im sorry i got confused may i go right now zubin got out fast and was escorted to his limousine he gave ivan the driver his mothers address and sat back brooding when they reached the destination zubin put on his sternest voice you will wait here i am visiting a friend one hour and then we go to the hotel it was his mother who answered the door and her face lit up how handsome you look and she drew him in wheres sonia very ill shes gone to stay with her sister come and sit down why didnt you let me know you were coming i didnt know myself things are moving very fast she gave him a vodka and sat beside him holding his hand so tell me about it my performance mama he swallowed the vodka the greatest of my life he handed her his glass give me another sitting in ropers computer room at holland park they were all there ferguson said any trouble with the girl not particularly she thinks shes being held illegally of course tough luck after some of the stunts shes pulled shes lucky not to be in a cell now lets get down to it whats going on before i start can i ask you if the prime minister knows about the playacting over belov yes president cazalet discussed it with him its one of those things where they prefer not to know officially if you follow me but i keep him informed anyway whats it all about putin has a meeting in paris with the eu then he visits london spends a night at the dorchester trade delegation stuff then dinner with the prime minister go on lurking amongst his staff will be one josef belov whats the purpose of his presence to be seen to have him on television close to putin with any luck close to the prime minister he wont have a lot to say if anything theyll keep tight control any interviews no but there will be a press release what about the belov protocol and what in the hell is that well excuse me if it sounds like a lecture but here goes some years ago the old soviet government was going through economic crisis after crisis always short of the almighty dollar so they started selling off government utilities at knockdown prices oil fields gas the wealth of siberia the oligarchs came along men like the robber barons in the old days in the usa men like belov he started with a billion and the word is he got it from saddam in oil alone his wealth can only be measured in billions yes i know that ferguson said then when the rashid empire was up for grabs he took over so where is this getting us dillon asked to the united nations common policy division belov international has become so enormous its tentacles reach every developing country in the world its truly global can you imagine the effect all that could have if it was controlled by a single government the russian federation ferguson asked many russian politicians think it was a mistake to allow the states assets to pass into private ownership in the first place times have changed putin is a hard man the russians like strength things are getting more like the cold war every day now is the time for a truly magnificent gesture from a russian hero josef belov hell sign an item called the belov protocol transferring all of belov international into the hands of the government of the russian federation just a minute harry said if this united nations outfit was worried about belov international putting things out of balance being too powerful they arent going to be too happy about russia taking over neither will the united states nor the uk nor europe ferguson put in harry said when i was young under the labor government after the war we used to nationalize things didnt we well this would be something similar putting things back into government control and an incredible boost in power and prestige for russia ferguson said dillon nodded all performed in front of cameras max zubin standing in for belov i hope hes practiced how to do belovs signature harry said oh that will be taken care of no problem roper said and the beautiful thing from their point of view is that we cant stand up and say that isnt josef belov ferguson said because we blew him up so there it is roper shook his head a wonderful confidence trick i dont know about putin but volkov must be laughing up his sleeve and theres nothing we can do about it billy asked im not so sure dillon turned to ferguson tomorrow night at the dorchester the russian embassyll have a reception putin will be there the prime minister and josef belov what are you suggesting i think we should go billy and i got into igor levins room when he was there i dont see why i couldnt manage the same thing where max zubin is concerned to what purpose i havent the slightest idea but he might have things to say some personal suggestions you know i think you could be right ferguson nodded well go you me and billy excellent dillon turned to roper youve often boasted in the past that if its out there in cyberspace you can find it so what do you want me to do go through the entire story from the beginning access all russian sources check out whos going to be at the dorchester function what kind of security the putin delegation will have something might be there lurking in the woodwork everything in life has a flaw well if theres one to this whole affair ill find it and work at it roper did there wasnt an aspect of the entire affair that wasnt covered all relevant traffic out and in at the russian embassy in london traffic from the kremlin dealings with the ira it was neverending another interminable night then of sandwiches and whiskey and constant smoking and doyle on the duty shift bringing innumerable cups of tea at five oclock doyle pulled up the blinds dirty morning raining away he turned look sir dont you think youre overdoing it a bit you always are when youre looking for the little things sergeant so it pays to take care i learned that lesson with my last bomb in londonderry it was just a mini car with a shopping bag on the rear seat so i didnt treat it seriously bad luck sir sheer carelessness so it pays to take care check everything at that precise moment he was proved right the intercept was one of many relevant to station gorky mainly messages to do with administration work structure now and then commands from volkov himself roper was reviewing them when he stopped then frowned and reversed the screen listings the message that had caught his eye referred to transportation for belovs flight from station gorky but not to moscow airport some little distance from it was the belov complex which specialized in private planes executive jets and the like even courier aircraft from foreign countries making their regular pilgrimages in and out with embassy material the particular message made the point that colonel josef belovs chauffeur one ivan kurbsky would meet the plane and transfer the colonel straight to the kremlin before belov moved on to the excelsior hotel to his usual suite it hadnt struck roper before the reference to belovs old kgb rank and he went back to the beginning of the traffic from moscow to station gorky no reference to max zubin well of course there wouldnt be the whole emphasis was on belov even in the most trivial matters perhaps he was tired or slightly out of his mind by that stage but a wild idea had formed in his head crazy obvious and simple what if everyone dealing with max zubin at station gorky actually believed he was josef belov he turned to doyle see if the majors stirring sergeant and ask her if shed fancy some early breakfast with me and id like you to help me out with her and he explained certainly sir roper poured a whiskey to pull himself together the implications were obvious right old son dont mess up he murmured you look terrible greta told him ive looked terrible for some years now she was genuinely sorry and shook her head but your diet seems to consist solely of irish whiskey thats dillon for you i expect so and too many cigarettes they help calm me down i get neurological symptoms cant sleep and you only eat sandwiches i havent seen you tackle a decent meal well you will now ive ordered a full english breakfast i thought youd like to join me start with the tea sergeant he said to doyle oh and pass the morning papers coming up sir doyle picked up the times and the daily mail from a side table and passed them over both featured putins visit also the press release announcing details of the belov protocol my god she said as she looked at the mail my god indeed roper poured another whiskey this is purely medicinal i assure you but a toast to russian barefaced cheek she read the piece quickly and looked up why do you say that oh come on youll never get away with it thats what you think ashimov passed max zubin off in paris the other year with no trouble not only does zubin really look like belov hes a damn good actor ashimov told me he handled it really well it fooled everybody french intelligence the cia the brits doyle had come in with a trolley and laid a table by the fire she carried on talking if it worked then it will work now he wheeled his chair to the table and started on the bacon and eggs come on eat up itll get cold she took his advice say this is good but you must understand roper we russians are used to the cold well you didnt do too well in the cold war he was pushing her now and she flared we did all right gave you your share of bloody noses you and the americans both and some you dont even know about doyle brought a bottle across and two glasses im sorry major novikova major roper told me a vodka usually starts a russian breakfast i forgot it certainly does hes right there he poured she took it down in one go another sergeant she was on her mettle ive invented a new breakfast for you english vodka and bacon and eggs actually im irish major doyle smiled what they call black irish god i can never understand this why do you irish always fight for the english you should hate them not really major he slipped another vodka in her empty glass i mean theyre a bit like your motherinlaw an inconvenience when she calls she fell about laughing and finished the third vodka your motherinlaw i like that do you like it she asked roper he pushed his plate away if you do but enough of this chat im telling you this belov protocol will never work why not too many people know what happened to the real belov know about zubin i mean everybody who worked with him at station gorky she exploded almost in fury are you stupid or something dont you understand to everyone at station gorky max zubin is josef belov there was a moments stillness and roper said is that really true but of course only a handful of us know the truth ashimov me general volkov and through him the president and we do because dillon pressed a button and killed belov so when you present zubin at station gorky hes got to be belov she shook her head surely you can see that even his chauffeur in moscow thinks hes belov people accept and what can you do she held her glass up to doyle he refilled it obediently is ferguson going to stand up at the dorchester and say excuse me this isnt josef belov we assassinated him with american connivance she took the vodka down i think not an amazing situation roper said when you think of it he could be josef belov for the rest of his life i dont understand she was befuddled with too much vodka now its just an interesting point you know the appearance of things and people believing in it he smiled anyway ive got work to do take major novikova back to her quarters sergeant she got up staggered a little and leaned on the table what was all this about what were you after id go back to bed if i were you greta have another sleep she staggered slightly and doyle caught her steady now miss just come along with me roper lit a cigarette and thought about it then turned back to the computers the last message on his screen was the one about transportation to the belov complex where his chauffeur ivan kurbsky would meet the plane and convey him to the kremlin before the excelsior hotel that would be for volkov to give him a final briefing he sat there brooding thinking of every aspect and it all started to come together make sense he thought about it some more and phoned ferguson and found him still at home at cavendish place i need to see you why how would you like to make the belov protocol into a total ballsup how would you like to leave the russians with nothing but egg on their faces tell me more which roper proceeded to do when he was finished ferguson said totally mad and also quite brilliant it could be absurdly simple the old swiss watch syndrome if it all worked all right what do you want a meeting with you at the soonest with me dillon billy squadron leader lacey and parry is there anything i should know before we meet yes ive got a few requests he went through them there are a number of things i can sort out via my computers ill take care of those aspects can we meet in say two hours absolutely holland park i think so its useful if we need to refer back to computer information of course there is one thing ive got to say and whats that max zubin it would all depend on his willingness to play ball well well see about that roper switched off and went back to his screens at holland park roper was doing the briefing this whole thing hinges on some sort of contact being made at the dorchester with max zubin it seems obvious to me that hell return to moscow still playing his role for the sake of his mother that means the day after tomorrow hell be seen on the world stage signing the belov protocol the only way to prevent that would be to get zubin out of moscow with his mother and how do we do that billy asked roper turned to lacey you know the belov complex in moscow of course weve been there a few times its close to the main airport handles private traffic executive aircraft and courier planes weve done it for the embassy run a few times so if the great josef belov turned up there with his mother and had a walk around how do you think hed be treated with fear and great respect i know russia and if they ended up on your courier plane and you got out of there fast how long would it take you to leave russian airspace if i was given the citation x half an hour at the most since the demise of concorde its arguably the fastest commercial plane in the world so youd be out of it in effect probably before theyd even had a chance to scramble another aircraft to see what you were up to with any kind of luck yes if you volunteer for this youd be in uniform raf rondels on the plane and so on everything to confuse the issue thats good sir and by the way we do volunteer my god billy said it could work its so bleeding simple which only leaves us with the problem of getting max zubin to agree roper said id say youve already worked that out dillon smiled theres plenty of security at the hotel both russian and british you billy have your identification so thats all right the fact that you speak russian sean could be useful you could growl your head off at any unfortunate room service waiter as much as you want and carry your copy of the putin warrant just in case to confuse any russian security people but meeting zubin will be difficult not at all hes been given one of those magnificent park suites on the fifth floor as befits his status as josef belov there is a small bedroom with separate bathroom next to it double doors in between which are kept locked unless its booked to provide a second bedroom for the suite and this one isnt well it was but i canceled and then fiddled the computer to make it look as if its still occupied i recall when you got into levins room you had a house key like staff use still do as regards levin hes with the russian embassy party and boris luhzkov i suppose they know we wont lift levin what would be the point ferguson said and they cant lay a finger on us im going and you two can join me he said to dillon and billy he turned to lacey youd better get on with arranging the courier flight out of farley you have full authority certainly sir they all got up and roper said i was thinking dillon take an extra codex four if this idea works and zubin agrees it will give him a link with you good thinking well lets get on with it the games afoot ferguson said at the russian embassy boris luhzkov was in his office when igor levin went in i got your message whats up nothing just a thousand and one things to do you worry too much levin lit a cigarette and sat on the window seat luhzkov said its all right for you the big war hero used to running around at the kremlin luhzkov what can i do for you volkov insists on your presence tonight so you can make yourself useful im not exactly persona grata to our british friends these days youre sure charles ferguson wont try to have me picked up once im on the street look igor i dont know what youve been mixed up in and i dont want to know you work for volkov carry the putin warrant thats enough for me one thing i do know youve got diplomatic immunity if the brits want you for anything all they can do is send you home now go along to the dorchester and check how our security people are getting on on the instant boss always the clown igor luhzkov shook his head greta novikova is still gainfully employed i trust i wouldnt ask boris i really wouldnt when ferguson was admitted to number ten downing street a waiting aide took him upstairs past the pictures of every past prime minister and along the corridor five minutes only general hes due at northolt to greet putin but he did want a word with you he opened the door ferguson went in and there was the prime minister behind his desk sit down general thank you prime minister i just want to reassure myself about certain shall we say unfortunate aspects of present events things are in order at the dorchester i take it i believe so but im visiting personally after our meeting let me be plain general ferguson i know i find it prudent on many occasions where matters of intelligence are concerned to look the other way but aspects of my meeting today this belov protocol it cant be allowed to happen it wont prime minister everything will be resolved within the next two days to your satisfaction he smiled or you can have my resignation oh i wouldnt want that so ill just have to take your word for it now i must go northolt awaits the door behind was eased open as if by magic and ferguson was eased out when the daimler picked him up dillon and billy were in the back and ferguson climbed in the daimler pulled away and dillon said where to the dorchester i want to check security did the pm have much to say in five minutes hardly of course he did tell me the belov protocol cant be allowed to happen and i told him it would be resolved to his satisfaction over the next two days charles your confidence is breathtaking youve got it wrong dillon its a sign of my total faith in your ability to achieve miracles igor levin made contact with his security colleagues at the hotel the president of course was in the most exclusive suite at the very top of the hotel members of his entourage on lower floors belov on floor five in a park suite everything seemed in order so he went down to the piano bar and ordered a vodka in crushed ice the special way they did it the dorchester way got a couple of newspapers and went and sat by the piano and worked his way through them someone brushed past him to the piano he didnt look up engrossed in what the times was saying about putin and belov the pianist started to play a song popular with soldiers during the war in chechnya levin remembered it well they all did those young soldiers moscow nights he looked up and sean dillon seated at the piano said we just wanted to make you feel at home igor my old son me and billy here billy was standing by the piano arms crossed that was quite a gig you played in khufra captain it was you who knocked off tomac we presume he annoyed me a right bastard screwed up our floatplane we went in nose first for the deep six levin stopped smiling that was nothing to do with me he hesitated and greta was with you in that plane dillon said i held her hand all the way up from the bottom levin smiled again how romantic shes well i trust in excellent accommodation oh here comes the boss ferguson came down the steps from the bar my dear chap we keep missing each other tried to catch up again at drumore place yesterday but you werent at home and neither was ashimov dublin i understand dillon shook his head liam bell did a runner but we depleted the ranks of the ira you must be feeling pleased levin stood up ferguson said dont go join us in a drink levin smiled now that would really be too much im sure ill see enough of you tonight he went out ferguson said pity i rather liked him still we can have something while were here and he waved to guiliano in the ballroom later that night all london was there politicians by the score big business the media anybody who was anybody and lots of men in black suits ever watchful as waiters passed through the crowd with trays loaded with champagne vodka canapés they stand out a mile dont they billy said to dillon as they stood by a temporary bar who do you mean the security men its the black suits ferguson was away gladhanding a few people dillon said just because ferguson made us wear black tie for tonight dont let it go to your head theres igor levin over there keep him in view and let him keep you in view im going up now to try and play ropers trump card he eased out of the crowd by the rear lift pushed open a side door and ran up the stairs to the fifth floor the room adjacent to max zubins suite was just around a bend in the corridor opposite he produced his passkey and entered it was small comfortably furnished the door giving access to the living room of zubins suite locked dillon slipped in an earpiece and listened there was a sound of movement but no voices he took off his coat then removed a small suitcase from the wardrobe and pulled out a white waiters coat which he put on on the sideboard tray champagne stood ready in an ice bucket with two glasses he took a deep breath picked up the tray and went out just a few yards down the corridor was all it took he paused at the door then pressed the bell it opened surprisingly quickly and there stood zubin in shirtsleeves adjusting his black tie champagne sir dillon asked i dont think i ordered that zubin said its on the house sir dorchester champagne okay bring it in but dont open it he turned away into the living room and dillon put the tray on the table id better open it just in case somebody comes he said in fluent and rapid russian strangely zubin didnt look alarmed but there was an instant frown what in the hell is this nobody here is what they seem my name is sean dillon and i work for british intelligence youre max zubin pretending to be josef belov and not liking it very much however they have your mother in moscow so you have to play ball you have to go back to her zubin adjusted his tie and reached for his jacket if any of this were true what could i do about it go back tomorrow youd have to do that then wed bring you out you and your mother you could do that yes ill explain after dinner im not doing dinner from what i know ill be back up here at around nine to ninethirty ive got the room next door well talk later if youre on your own knock on the door hed finished uncorking and pouring a glass youre taking this remarkably well zubin took the glass i was a paratrooper in chechnya you sound like the real thing unless theyre employing raving lunatics here who start off with an irish accent and move into fluent russian the doorbell sounded shower stall dillon whispered i know these suites he moved into the small hall bathroom left the door partly open and stepped into the shower outside zubin opened the door ah levin there you are are they ready for me he was obviously in his belov role voice measured no need to take that tone with me levin said now remember the cameras be nice and forbidding so people will feel it better not to speak to you i could frighten them to death i can do an excellent hamlets father he was a ghost you know come on its showtime the door closed dillon waited then went out and returned next door round the bend at the far end of the corridor levin and zubin waited for the lift youre feeling good levin said of course i always do on an opening night and the lift doors parted and he and levin joined four other people inside himself zubin felt only tremendous excitement could it be true could he really confound all of them bring the whole house of cards tottering down well as far as he was concerned it wouldnt be from want of trying when dillon returned ferguson had joined billy you look excited he said how did it go couldnt have been better he told them what had happened the important thing is he isnt doing the dinner that gives me a great chance of accessing him from the room next door later and really laying it on the line the putin plane is leaving at eleven from northolt the citation x perhaps an hour later the courier flight will be logged in and out again all perfectly legitimate he handed dillon an envelope times and so forth the whole schedule discuss it with him then destroy it of course there was a sudden disturbance at the far end of the room a great deal of clapping as putin moved through the crowd the prime minister taking another section hes there dillon said moving close to the president levin behind him there was zubin pausing while the tv cameras did their work and press cameras flashed turning closer to the president so they were tied together as it were the president nodded to him and moved on and zubin walked into the crowd levin behind him pausing to greet people who spoke to him finally he accepted a glass of champagne and stood by the wall as if holding court a number of guests obviously hanging on to his every word and levin was checking his watch i bet that isnt in the script ferguson said hes an actor dillon said cant resist making the most of his role i was one myself yes we do know about that ferguson said the one person who appears to be missing is volkov not any longer dillon said as volkov moved through the crowd taking two glasses of champagne from a passing waiter and pausing beside putin and handing him one he murmured something to putin and they turned and looked across at ferguson dillon and billy and then putin did a strange thing he raised his glass toward them and ferguson raised his old adversaries from the cold war a long time ago he said a voice echoed over the speaker ladies and gentlemen dinner is served volkov moved across to zubin and levin and spoke to them and levin nodded touched zubin on the arm and they made for the door those going on to the dinner flooded out quite a number who obviously were not stood around finishing their drinks ferguson said ill get off home and leave you to it good luck upstairs and let me know instantly how its gone he walked away and dillon said lets get on with it billy well take the stairs they made it to the room with no trouble went in quietly and dillon tried the earpiece again and put his head to the door there was a murmur of voices levin must still be with him dillon said as he checked his watch just after nine well have to wait for as long as it takes billy lay on the bed head pillowed on his hands dillon sat on the dressing table chair at half past nine he checked and still heard voices not long after there was the sound of laughter and then silence and then there were two distinct knocks on the door zubin stood there undoing his black tie ah mr dillon whos your friend salter billy said i look after him when he cant look after himself sorry im late as it were zubin said my security man was talking over old times we were paratroopers together in chechnya not exactly cheek to cheek i was a captain in those days he was a lieutenant big hero we know him well billy said how well traded shots dillon told him are we coming in of course levins okay in a strange way he cant take things seriously hes an actor where have i heard that before billy said your new friend here went to rada zubin positively glowed my goodness i am impressed well dont be dillon told him i was waylaid by the ira and took to the theater of the street and a bloody awful role it was now lets get serious do you feel like going for it by god i do ive been trapped forced into another mans skin my moves monitored my life im a puppet volkov pulls my strings i jump im fifty years of age do you think i want to spend the rest of my life this way i shouldnt imagine so but ive got no choice in paris the other year i couldnt make a break for it because of my mother i cant try and drop out of things here in london because of my mother they use her i know that but volkov also knows i would never let her down you talked earlier of my return to moscow and you bringing both of us out can this be possible it could be but how would your mother feel about it zubin poured a little champagne for both our sakes and to get us out of this situation she would come excellent read this dillon gave him fergusons letter and poured himself a glass of champagne as well zubin finished and handed him the letter back yes i understand youre sure one of my strengths is my ability to retain lines right ill just go over it again with you you return to moscow on putins plane tomorrow is levin going with you no he stays here im in volkovs hands im put up at my usual hotel the excelsior and the day after tomorrow i sign the belov protocol at the kremlin no you dont thats why our timing is so crucial you leave in putins plane and the royal air force courier plane the citation x follows an hour perhaps two later it lands with legitimate documents for the british embassy receives legitimate documents for the return journey which is logged out of belov complex at seventhirty russian time you know belov complex of course i landed there from station gorky the timing has been chosen because its dark well make a quick getaway and with the extraordinary speed of this plane we should be out of russian airspace in thirty minutes you say we yes two pilots raf naturally billy here will wear the uniform of an raf sergeant as steward i will wear the uniform of a gru captain one igor levin complete with paratrooper wings medals the lot you wont be the only one acting and youd do this youd take this chance my god if it went wrong youd be shot or sent to the gulag true but the simplicity of the whole thing is in its favor ill ask you one more time will your mother do it shell be walking out of her apartment with nothing all the mementos of a remarkable life gone shell do it for me and ill do it for her good theres something not mentioned in fergusons letter whats that once in london theres your future to think of our computer expert has been able to access belov international bank deposits in london using your authority you are after all josef belov how much zubin asked twenty million didnt seem unreasonable i mean property prices have gone up in the city zubin smiled i think you could say that will be perfectly satisfactory billy took two things from his pocket a colt and a codex four the gun is for obvious emergencies and is silenced the mobile was specially manufactured for our purposes it doesnt look like much but it can go anywhere do anything its waterproof and the battery lasts a year its programmed you press the red button and youre through to a guy named roper hell contact us on your behalf there are one or two extras in the briefcase just in case it is simple zubin shook his head if everything works it really would be very simple at all times remember you are josef belov in a way volkovs created a frankensteins monster only a few important people know your real identity to everyone else youre the great man i suppose thats right ferguson was telling me that during the second world war soe had someone very like you who impersonated field marshal erwin rommel on a mission to jersey in the germanoccupied channel islands it was said that what helped him most was discovering that everyone who met him believed he was rommel but more importantly he himself discovered that to be rommel was to be allpowerful people automatically obeyed him you might be surprised how effective that could be ill try to remember it youve been seen on british television already tonight during the next few hours itll be the same for the usa europe and the russian federation when you get off the plane in moscow youll be a star on the level of the president everyone will recognize you zubin took a deep breath and pulled himself together a short run if were lucky and a quick transfer to the west end billy said yes i can see that i can also see that you gentlemen are putting yourselves in harms way by accompanying me on this affair well thats the name of the game billy shook hands zubin said youre not an actor too mr salter no im a gangster billy told him good god zubin said dillon said goodbye mr zubin we will see you in moscow tomorrow night you sound certain i am ill tell your mother why when im on that plane with her leaving moscow come on billy they went out dillon locked the connecting doors the bedclothes he said billy rumpled them and the pillows just in case a maid looks in dillon said and opened the door the corridor was silent come on he whispered and they went down the back stairs beside the lift they stood on the steps in park lane sheltering from hard driving rain for a few moments and tried to flag down a cab there were still a few people around from the function limousines drawing up to collect passengers and of all people igor levin emerged and stood on the steps took out a box of cigarettes and saw them still here you two he selected a cigarette and offered them russian i could see you were a gentleman dillon pinched the cardboard expertly and accepted the light offered he inhaled excellent levin said only the best back to moscow for you old son how could i leave you two on the loose a black mercedes turned in levin opened the main door sat beside the driver and was driven away now theres a happy man billy said and at that moment in response to his raised hand a cab swerved in afterward they sat with ferguson by the fire at his apartment in cavendish place and discussed the evening ferguson was particularly interested in the incident with levin why do you think theyre keeping him on here dillon asked it suits volkov hes smart clever ruthless doesnt fit the mold of your usual agent i reckon its more than that billy said hes getting at you general its like reminding you that theres nothing you can do about levin you could well be right young billy ill outplay him on that one of course how by you two bringing max zubin and his mother out of russia he stood up ill see you off at farley tomorrow youd better move on youll need a good nights sleep outside another taxi as it swerved in billy said well drop you at your place first no you wont dillon said you havent told harry about this caper have you he asked no billy said hed blow his top i mean weve done enough in the past bad things hard things but this one false move in moscow dillon and its curtains theyll swallow us whole they got in the back of the cab dillon said youre right it could go as smoothly as silk or we might end up in deep shit well if youre worried dillon said maybe it doesnt need the two of us oh no you go i go i wont have it any other way it was late but there were still a few people in the saloon bar of the dark man harry was seated in his usual spot in the corner booth baxter and hall hanging around dillon said other end of the bar you two billy needs to talk to harry its family they looked surprised but went okay tell him dillon went to the bar and ordered a large bushmills he drank it down and ordered another then went back to the booth harry looked pale and angry this is bleeding enough its insane no its important harry its of world importance i just thought you should know he patted billy on the shoulder and swallowed his bushmills see you at farley at eleven oclock billy he gave harry a look turned and went out at the door he stood in the porch buttoning his coat against the rain harry came up behind him joe baxter at his shoulder did you want a word well leave at tenthirty tomorrow you said eleven yes well we all make mistakes hes a good kid so youre a sentimentalist at heart harry shook his hand take him home joe and he went back inside moscow in the putin plane things werent organized the way air force one was for the american president on that famous plane there was a certain relaxation a constant coming and going of staff even the members of the press on board could circulate to a degree no conditions on the russian presidents plane were stricter more regimented on the other hand zubin didnt find himself sitting at the back with the rabble as they were known in russian political circles after all he was josef belov which secured him three vacant seats and following whispered instructions he sat in the third one next to a window and blanked off from people rising up out of london he wasnt as excited as hed been the previous evening but calm and serious considering the situation there had been no security check at raf northolt but it had been obvious that there wouldnt be not for vips so the colt theyd given him and the codex four mobile were at the bottom of his briefcase hed also discovered a couple of pairs of plastic handcuffs a street map of central moscow his route from the excelsior to his mothers apartment clearly marked and onward to the belov complex a spray can of cs gas and some night glasses it was mad the whole idea that it could be got away with but the other future was too awful to contemplate he was staring into space thinking about it when someone sat beside him he turned and found it was volkov yes general he said how can i be of service oh you already have volkov was in a jovial mood and took two vodkas from a passing waiter and gave zubin one a fine performance the president is very pleased with you and tomorrow at the kremlin will be your biggest performance ever signing the belov protocol in front of the worlds cameras the president will decorate you hero of the soviet union ah i thought wed done away with that well something similar may i see my mother zubin held his breath and hoped but volkov was in high good humor you may order your chauffeur to take you to your mothers apartment on the way to the excelsior when we get in but fifteen minutes only zubin at least for now he waved for two more vodkas and passed one over everythings worked out perfectly youve been splashed all over russian television in the company of the president and the british prime minister in london its made you quite a star and news of the belov protocol with ordinary people has done even more its made you a hero he smiled jovially and tossed down his vodka a great triumph for us all he got up and walked away and zubin sat there trying to take it all in then leaned back in his seat and wondered what dillon was up to dillon arrived at farley the following morning rain driving in he parked the mini cooper got out a raincoat over his shoulders and ran across to the operations room under the control tower the rain heavy the citation x stood a few yards away its raf rondels proud and as dillon went up the steps squadron leader lacey emerged from behind some bushes wearing a flying jacket standard uniform underneath medals clear his air force cross well on display you look good dillon said you know how it is sean its special this one so it seems fitting we do it right parrys got things moving along well be out of here fast youre pushing it arent you there are headwinds across europe and a front from siberia westwards later today you know how it is billys waiting inside hes what apparently there was some confusion over the time dillon walked into the operations room and found harry and ferguson having coffee youre a little tardy this morning ferguson said dillon shook his head at harry where is he back room changing you really think hed have gone for that go on get on with it i cant wait to see you dressed as a russian billy adjusted his tie and pulled on his sergeants tunic hey ive got campaign medals ireland the first gulf war how would you know dillons uniform hung by a locker quite spectacular levin must be quite a guy billy said hes got more medals than me and his uniform is prettier if you say so dillon started to change and pulled on his jackboots billy said oh i do and another thing dont try to pull a stunt like that again its a good thing harry has an oldfashioned sense of family honor your choice dillon tightened his tie pulled on the tunic and buttoned it he fastened his belt with the holstered pistol then adjusted his cap when he checked in the mirror a rather sinisterlooking man stared out at him a figure of grim authority dillon thats you billy said that is very definitely you now lets move it they went out and found lacey back with harry and ferguson very smart he said the russians do like their uniforms dont they what about me billy asked good turnout sergeant a credit to the squadron the quartermasters bag is on board the embassy boxes could we go please there was a slight pause then harry said just get on with it ferguson said keep the faith billy led the way up the airstairs door dillon followed lacey after him turning to close the door then moving to the cockpit to join parry as the engines throbbed billy and dillon belted in on either side of the aisle dillon said are you all right then what in the hell do you think billy leaned back closed his eyes and the plane surged forward at moscow in late afternoon verging into early evening the putin plane landed at the airport with the usual pomp and ceremony associated with the homecoming of the president after his appearance on the world stage he went down the steps met the usual functionaries and generals rather more of those these days or so it appeared and moved to his limousine lesser mortals had disembarked and stood waiting amongst them max zubin he was conscious of a strange air of fatalism he was here this was it what would be would be always the actor always playing a part and then it struck him a sudden thought and he smiled and murmured to himself hey in chechnya they cast you as a paratrooper max no standins that was a charnel house and you were a hell of a good paratrooper they gave you a medal you max zubin yiddish boy actor pianist comedian if you could do that you can do this he began to walk the briefcase billy salter had given him in his hand he followed the crowd through and a strange thing started to happen when he entered the terminal various officials scanning the crowd jumped to attention when they saw him and started clapping its belov someone cried and as he went forward people turned and smiled and there was shouting and applause and then moving into the vip tunnel he reached the end and there was his chauffeur ivan kurbsky ive got your suitcase max he said and led the way max in one shocking moment everything was different zubin tried a recovery putting on his best belov voice what on earth are you talking about kurbsky oh come off it zubin im exkgb general volkov always felt you needed a proper minder he appointed me himself mikhail my mothers driver does he know too that prick no way youre all mine max but why are you telling me now because frankly seeing you there on television with the president the prime minister all those toffs it just doesnt feel right you getting all that attention and me getting nothing at all i figured it was time to remind you who you are as if i could zubin said and as soon as youve signed that protocol of theirs tomorrow you know whats going to happen to you its back to station gorky for you thats what you and your mother both of us youre sure about that i wouldnt bet against me zubin they reached the limousine he put the suitcase in the boot and opened the rear door so in you get big man enjoy your brief moment of fame but volkov had promised him fifteen minutes with his mother and there was nothing kurbsky could do about that when zubin rang the doorbell his mother answered quickly her face lit up and she pulled him inside i saw you on television with the president and the british prime minister what a performance she embraced him he pushed her away gently and said urgently shut up mama i only have a few minutes ive just discovered that kurbsky is exkgb working for the government ive also discovered that after signing this wretched protocol tomorrow im being shunted back to siberia and you with me she was shocked siberia for gods sake no how would you like to leave with me tonight and fly to london to a new life what are you talking about he told her quickly so he said the raf plane is booked out at seventhirty ill be back at seven you must be ready you can take nothing only the clothes youre wearing if you wont do this then neither will i well go to siberia together like hell we will she flung her arms around his neck london god it would be the most marvelous thing in the world to spend my final years there and know you were safe ill see you at seven then he kissed her and there was a knock on the door he opened it found kurbsky there turned and kissed her hand good night mama god bless you and good luck tomorrow she closed the door and zubin turned to kurbsky who was smiling cynically right on time only doing my job lets get you to the excelsior and tuck you in for the night and dont forget ill be in a room down the hall at the excelsior it was a reprise of the airport kurbsky parked in a layby at the front and carried zubins suitcase in the two doormen applauded inside the two porters on reception clapped the duty manager appeared to shake zubins hand vigorously mr belov wonderful unbelievable let me get you your key may i show you to your suite that wont be necessary zubin took the key kurbsky can see to the suitcase and he walked to the lift as they went up kurbsky said its all gone to your head hasnt it if you say so theyll knock that out of you when you get back to siberia what he didnt add was that after a proper interval a convenient accident would be arranged for both of them max and mama kurbsky opened the door in you go you be a good boy if im not it wouldnt look good for you would it zubin said imagine everyone there at the kremlin putin and volkov waiting for the signing but no belov he smiled theyd hang you up by your balls kurbskys face contorted with rage get in there you bastard he pushed zubin inside and threw his bag through he slammed the door and locked it then went down the hall to his room and found a bottle of vodka at the belov complex the citation x landed at fivethirty and taxied to its designated parking spot formalities were minimal no security involved diplomatic immunity absolute they rolled to a halt and lacey came back this is how it works there will be an embassy limousine in the small vip lot round the corner theyll be called shortly drive out and pick up stuff weve brought from the uk and hand over stuff were taking back theyre our people so therell be no problems what about refueling dillon asked theyll have a tanker out here in the next half hour we still havent heard from zubin ill go and sign in leave parry with you he looked out at the runway snow banked to each side good its starting to snow again not too bad just enough to confuse things he handed dillon a raincoat id wear this if you want to venture out and then dump it if you want to play your friend levin he turned and opened the airstairs door and dillons codex four rang zubin in his suite had a couple of stiff vodkas to pep him up then opened the briefcase selected the colt which he put in his pocket and then the other items the handcuffs he laid on his coffee table with the canister of cs gas there was also a roll of some sort of sticky tape he took out the codex four and pressed the red button at holland park roper jumped to attention for hed just had a call from dillon saying no contact had been made and that was worrying he hadnt needed to call ferguson for he and harry were in the canteen and staying the night is that roper yes whats wrong max my cover has been broken my chauffeur kurbsky turns out to be exkgb and a federal agent is there nothing you can do oh yes im not going to let that bastard spoil my greatest performance im calling him to my room and then im going to tackle him i just wanted you to know if im successful ill call you back in fifteen minutes if im not its good night vienna he switched off and roper told doyle get the general at once tell him theres been contact in his room the vodka flowing while he watched a porn movie kurbsky was furious at being disturbed by the room phone who is it me you pig zubin was doing a very good drunk i just wanted to let you know what a piece of shit you are ivan i mean theres shit and shit but you really are something special you bastard kurbsky cried ill show you you need a lesson you piece of jewish he was cut off slammed down his phone rushed down the hall got zubins key out and opened the door but a hand grabbed him by the shirtfront pulling him in zubin gave him the cs spray full in the face kicked him expertly under the kneecap yanked him forward and headbutted him like a pro kurbsky went down moaning zubin turned him over affixed one pair of plastic handcuffs to his wrists the other to his ankles he turned him on his back i could kill you but i wont do you know why because when volkov finds im gone its you who hell send to siberia for the rest of your life if youre lucky he tore off a piece of sticky tape and applied it to kurbskys mouth then phoned roper and got an instant reply are you okay roper demanded yes ive taken care of him im leaving now for my mother ill let you know when ive got her im out of here he went through kurbskys pockets found the car keys put the colt in one jacket pocket the codex four in the other grabbed his raincoat and left roper whod put everything on conference call so ferguson and harry could hear said there he goes god help him ferguson said at the front entrance cabs were delivering people constantly the doorman busy zubin dodging around reached the limousine unlocked the door and climbed in snow was falling now rather pretty in the light of the streetlamps and traffic not too busy he reached his mothers apartment block in fifteen minutes left the car close to the main entrance and went upstairs she answered the door at once dressed in boots a fur hat and coat and embraced him thank god ive been waiting no mikhail im never bothered at night he goes home i mean where would i have to go well you have someplace now lets go she indicated a suitcase could you carry it for me mama i said bring nothing theyre photos from the top of the piano ive spent the time taking them out of their frames my whole life is in those photos max i even have one with stalin god rot him all right we can get you new frames in london he picked up the suitcase pulled her out and slammed the door lets get out of here as they went down the stairs he called roper i have my mother were on our way at holland park roper immediately relayed the call to dillon who called to lacey theyre coming the snow was falling quite heavily now lacey pulled the raincoat over his shoulders concealing his uniform put his cap underneath went down the steps and crossed toward the reception area behind him a small tanker drove up to start the process of refueling the citation x dillon dodged in a doorway took out the cap adjusted it then opened the raincoat so it simply dropped from his shoulders revealing his gru uniform he went to the glass doors at the entrance to reception lacey was at the desk doing paperwork with a young man in a dark green uniform and fur hat dillon stood watching looking quite striking in his uniform lit a cigarette and turned to see what was obviously the embassy limousine come round the corner and park by the airstairs door a chauffeur got out bringing what looked like mail sacks with him and billy appeared in the door with similar sacks and an exchange took place the limousine drove away in zubins suite at the excelsior kurbsky had managed to wriggle across to the door with great difficulty the cs gas hadnt done him any good and the tape on his mouth was halfchoking him but lying on his back he started kicking his bound feet at the door and after a while it had an effect a room service waiter appeared and found him zubin drove up to the gate entrance of the vip lot at the belov complex and turned in the guard on duty came out of the hut papers on the windshield man cant you see this is a belov international limousine and im josef belov i still need to see your papers even if you are mr big zubin took out the silenced colt and shot the guard between the eyes he jumped out dragged the man into the hut out of sight got back into the limousine and drove around to the side of reception the citation x with its raf rondels was plain to see come on mama take your last walk on russian soil they started forward her hand on his arm while he carried the suitcase but as they passed reception a voice called where are you going he turned and found a young man in a green uniform and fur hat standing on the steps im josef belov he bellowed surely you recognize me the young man peered at him good god yes i saw you on television but where are you going dillon moved out of the shadows resplendent in that chilling gru uniform young man this is an official matter come with me and ill explain im captain levin the youth was totally intimidated of course sir from the plane billy called come on dil uh igor dillon nodded to zubin carry on mr belov and he turned and took the youth inside guiding him into an office at the back of the reception area where he promptly took out his pistol and stunned him with a violent blow the engines had fired up in the citation x zubin and his mother inside billy standing in the entrance dillon ran for the steps and scrambled up and the door closed there was chatter from the cockpit and they moved forward through the falling snow the runway lights gleaming just like bleeding christmas billy said and turned to zubin and bella belt up were on our way dillon looked at his watch seventhirty dead on time thats the raf for you they climbed quickly to forty thousand feet kurbskys frantic phone message to volkov made no impact for quite some time for after all no one knew exactly what was going on the youth at reception was unconscious for twenty minutes and it was only with his report on belovs presence and the discovery of the body of the gate guard that volkov made any sense of it at all by then of course it was far too late as lacey had predicted the extreme speed of the citation x had taken them out of russian airspace in thirty minutes and they were well on their way at holland park roper had listened to dillon and now turned to ferguson and harry theyve actually done it ferguson said youre certain theyre out of harms way theyre just over german airspace now and winging into french you going to call the prime minister harry asked no i think ill leave the champagne until they land at farley field ferguson shook his head who in the hell would have believed it i tell you what harry said vladimir putin isnt going to be pleased where does this leave his bleeding belov protocol and to that of course there was no answer in the plane they all sat back and billy opened the icebox and found a bottle of champagne somebody had faith he said and got it open drinking bella zubin said its like an impossible dream thanks to dillon here and mr salter her son said so what do you think theyll do dillon asked about the protocol i dont know but i can tell you one thing putins about to give a royal reaming to that bastard volkov and volkov will get straight on the phone to drumore place and put the boot into yuri ashimov and that billy id like to see dillon turned to bella when i was seventeen i was a student at the royal academy of dramatic art you were appearing at the old vic in the three sisters with olivier you came to rada and lectured you said chekhov should always be played on a london stage ive never forgotten you my god an actor bella said all my life and dillon kissed her on the cheek london at the white house blake johnson listened to ferguson almost in disbelief my god i cant believe youve managed to pull it off charles no not me blake credit roper dillon and billy and two superb raf pilots willing to put themselves on the line ill get back to you as things develop blake almost burst into the oval office and found jake cazalet up to his eyes in documents as ever what the hell is this blake cazalet sat back his reading glasses perched on the end of his nose blake told him and cazalet couldnt stop laughing god i can only imagine the look on putins face go on blake this is a special occasion theres scotch in the cabinet ill toast you at farley field the citation x coasted in as early light filtered through the dawn sky ferguson and harry stood watching as it landed and taxied up and stopped the airstairs door opened parry got out and turned and gave his hand to bella zubin she came down the steps billy followed with her suitcase then came max and dillon and the pilots ferguson went to meet them mrs zubin i cant tell you what this means im general ferguson i cant tell you what it means to me to be here after all these years and my son with me i still cant believe its true all thanks to these wonderful men heroes all of them yes id agree there i have a safe house at holland park well take you there to settle in then well decide where youd like to go theres a limousine here for you his driver came forward and picked up her suitcase she said thats all i brought out of russia general the images of a full life other than that just the clothes im standing up in well well soon put that right she got into the limousine and max zubin followed her well see you later dillon said they moved away and harry hugged billy jesus you got away with it it was like a dream really billy said lots of snow and dillon poncing around dressed in the russian equivalent of an ss uniform that bleeding plane its so fast youre there and then youre here its weird ferguson turned to lacey and parry since the russians can never admit this happened im sure courier service planes will continue to operate as normal on the other hand id suggest you gentlemen avoid the duty in the future in view of the extreme hazard you engaged in however the consequences if youd been apprehended i intend to have you both awarded a bar to your air force cross i dont know what to say sir lacey said hes right dillon smiled it would have been the gulag for you two and what about you billy lacey demanded personally all i want is to get down to the dark man and get the chef on to a great english breakfast if youd phone him harry id be obliged and if the rest of you have any bleeding sense youll join me including the pride of the raf come on dillon and he led the way to harrys range rover while the plane had still been in the air volkov had been at the belov complex viewing the guard before they put his corpse in a body bag no burial instant cremation he ordered the gru captain in charge snow drifting he went up to the reception area of the belov complex and found the receptionist in his green uniform being treated by paramedics he took the avuncular approach youve done well this must have been a terrible shock for you i cant understand it it was mr belov himself with some old lady he said im josef belov surely you recognize me and then what happened someone called out in english it was from the plane he said come on igor no wait he started to say something else dil something volkovs heart chilled and what happened next a gru captain appeared he said it was a matter of state and that his name was captain levin he told mr belov to get on the plane and then he took me into the office and knocked me out dear god dillon volkov patted him reassuringly on the shoulder youve done well he repeated turned walked away and beckoned to the gru captain make sure hes on the penal battalion plane for station gorky tomorrow destroy his records he ceases to exist at your orders general volkov went back through the snow to his limousine dillon he murmured you cunning bastard and yet he felt a certain admiration to follow us so closely to do it so quickly who in the hell would have thought of it there was an almost reluctant smile on his face im captain levin he murmured you dog dillon he lit a russian cigarette leaned back and said to his driver the kremlin there was nothing certain in this life except that the president would not be pleased he sat in his office for quite some time until the secret door opened and the president stalked in were going to look like fools mr president we can always say hes ill so the ceremony has to be postponed maybe hes had cancer all along that would explain his generosity to the state and then after an appropriate period of time maybe hell die willing it all to the state of course we can still do this putin stood lost in thought maybe for your sake i hope so volkov he glowered at the general then stalked back out the secret door closing behind him volkov sat there still feeling uneasy perhaps more could be done here there were loose ends he lifted his coded phone checked on his list of numbers and called ashimov at drumore place ashimov was seated by the fire with liam bell enjoying a drink and he jumped to attention ive bad news for you ashimov he told him all abut it and emphasized youre in deep shit as well weve been outfoxed by ferguson and dillon over and over again the business in algiers the loss of major novikova all those botched attempts in london in drumore and now this debacle in moscow and the final insolence dillon masquerading as levin the president is mad as hell ashimov was choking what can i say general i think youd better come home major well discuss your future when i see you he switched off smiling but ashimov wasnt smiling at his end a return home and a discussion of his future could mean anything from a bullet in the head to a oneway trip to some gulag on the other hand if he could recover the situation dispose of max zubin and his mother for example perhaps even dillon the rage boiled up in him always dillon he poured a large vodka and slopped it down liam bell said whats your problem and ashimov poured it all out at the same time volkov phoned levin who had moved back to the dorchester and the delights of the piano bar he was at a corner table indulging in iced vodka and beluga caviar like a true russian but as volkov spoke levin was all attention afterward he said youve got to give it to him it was a stroke of genius the whole caper you dont need to exaggerate i wish he worked for me ive spoken to ashimov pointed out his blame in the matter and suggested he return home he knows what that means so i suspect hell try to come up with some scheme to eradicate the zubins in london something to make him look good to me hell probably try to recruit the irishman liam bell hell certainly try to recruit me levin said exactly im not sure i can rely on you but do what you can when ashimov was finished liam bell shook his head youre in more than a tight corner my friend go back home and god knows what volkov will have done to you where else can i go ashimov said but if i can go back with some sort of victory knock off zubin his mother even dillon there was a madness about him now liam bell saw that he shrugged how in the hell could you achieve that igor levin is still in place at the london embassy if hell join me hell have all the gru intelligence sources we need to find out what fergusons done with zubin and his mother i suppose thats possible you could help youve still got london contacts oh no bell said ive had enough on this one ive got a fortune in the contingency fund in the safe in my study ill call in a company falcon we land at archbury a couple of days should do it ill give you twentyfive thousand pounds in advance another twentyfive when we get back and as usual greed won the day two days bell said and i want the fifty in advance all right ashimov didnt even argue well phone igor levin set it up and lets see the color of your money after volkovs call levin had been waiting to hear from drumore place had been wondering how to handle ashimov when he was contacted which he was in his suite at the dorchester ashimov said weve had problems in moscow levin had decided on the direct approach i know all about the whole bloody mess god if i could get my hands on dillon ashimov said well you cant old stick so volkovs told you to come home is that it yes we all know what that means im coming over ashimov said and his desperation was plain if we could find where they have zubin and his mother i could deal with them get them back to russia you mean i think its too late for that they can end up in the thames as far as im concerned ashimov exploded just find out where they are dammit youve got all the resources of the gru find out ill be flying into archbury alone no bell has agreed to accompany me out of loyalty or for money money of course always the best way ill see what i can do he sat there thinking about it there had been a disturbing edge of madness about ashimov but maybe there always had been still he had a certain duty in this matter so he found his coat called for his mercedes and drove to the russian embassy in kensington in his office luhzkov sat and listened as levin made certain demands but this is really asking too much igor you ask for full cooperation from us at every level how can i agree to it when i dont even know what is so urgent that you request this levin produced his mobile made a call and said its good to speak to you general im having problems with colonel luhzkov at the london embassy he questions the importance of my mission he listened then passed the phone across general volkov would appreciate a word volkov said youve got a good record luhzkov youre a fine officer im amazed at your attitude in this matter im sure levin misheard ask him to speak to me again luhzkov did already trembling levin listened then said of course general he took the putin warrant from his pocket and laid it before the colonel luhzkov read it remembering when levin had first shown it to him in the pub and volkov said would you dispute an order from your president colonel of course not general anything i can do anything this is a matter of the highest state security colonel captain levin acts not only with my total authority as head of the gru but under direct order from the president himself i understand general luhzkov was in deep water and he realized it in this matter captain levin has total control ive already spoken to the ambassador until the present emergency is solved captain levin is in charge and will be offered every assistance anything i can do you may rely on me general he handed the phone to levin his face very pale levin said look general i dont know what you expect all this to achieve but ill do what ashimov wants you do realize hes a madman dont you yes and im not actually thats what im relying on volkov switched off and levin put the mobile in his pocket the first thing you do luhzkov is speak to ferguson and ask for any news he has of the whereabouts of major greta novikova you will tell him you have information that shes being held at holland park as a diplomatic attaché at our embassy she is entitled to diplomatic immunity and the right to be returned to russia can this be true for gods sake boris get real the days of shepherds pie and beer at the pub are long gone do it as you say i do say you also make it clear to all gru personnel in the embassy that im in charge anything i want i get men equipment whatever of course as long as we know where we are levin smiled id better go and get on with it he arranged a command center at the embassy with a sergeant chomsky in charge of communications a team of six men followed with full use of anything needed in the vehicle pool suzuki motorcycles figured largely there was a telecom van in the garage and another rather artistic van emblazoned with signs claiming to belong to a courier service levin assembled chomsky and the men line up they did and he allowed each man to read the putin warrant any questions he asked no one said a word this is a matter of extreme importance so nobody questions nobody argues if you do ill have you sent to a very unpleasant place chomsky at your orders captain sergeant chomsky and i survived afghanistan and chechnya london is far preferable so weve no intention of fucking up here have we sergeant absolutely not sir good ill issue a list of my requirements anything you want you get he smiled except women women are your responsibility he walked away from the motor pool the men laughed nervously one of them said whered he get an accent like that and that suit what is he some kind of ponce chomsky gave him a long look i wouldnt advise you letting him hear you say that hed kill you and smile while hes doing it now lets get to work the safe house at holland park was an obvious target a few yards up the road chomsky had a telecom van parked a manhole cover up a man in a yellow jacket and helmet working he was backed up by a motorcyclist in a side street in cavendish place outside fergusons apartment a gardener was working in the central area of the square levin debated about dillons cottage in stable mews but decided against it more and more he felt an affinity with dillon he said to chomsky not dillon anything in the slightest way out of the ordinary near his place and hed smell it like a hound dog i would chomsky a law student whod only joined the army as a conscript had fed on afghanistan and chechnya and found he liked it he had immersed himself in the files of the whole affair i dont think theyd put them up in a hotel sir so holland park makes sense probably as a temporary measure and what comes after god knows some sort of house elsewhere if the captain will allow me he opened a file i took the liberty of accessing these gangsters the salters they make the moscow mafia look like rubbish millionaires many times over youre too smart for your own good chomsky id forgotten you spent two years training for the law before the army they own houses and developments all over london sir i dont mean rubbish firstclass stuff in some of the most exclusive squares so what are you saying everything stems from hangmans wharf sir the dark man ive been and looked boats of every kind tie up at the wharf some people live in them others work on them i found one for rent almost opposite the pub ill put popov in it his english is excellent he can spend his time painting the damn boat or whatever hell have a suzuki who knows what might come out of the dark man excellent levin told him they all seem enthusiastic its a little different from that sir chomsky was almost apologetic they like it here they like life in london they dont want to screw up and get sent home dear god whats the world coming to okay straight to work i need to know where the zubins are being held as soon as possible at holland park max zubin and his mother were handed over to sergeant doyle temporary accommodation i promise you said ferguson after theyd gone upstairs he went in to roper god i feel knocked out i cant believe it worked thanks to dillon and billy salter roper lit a cigarette dillons had a death wish for years i worry that young billys inherited it where are they dark man for breakfast and why arent we damn you youre right and ferguson called to doyle get the people carrier out sergeant hangmans wharf for breakfast ashimov in the kitchen having breakfast with bell answered levins call ive got a phony motorcycle cop parked at holland park a big van emerged carrying ferguson and roper my man followed and guess what the dark man at wapping id say its certain zubin and his mother were taken to holland park so what now levin went through the arrangements he had made i think weve covered most options i think so too ive ordered the plane bell and i will come over later this morning were staying in some hotel he knows near the embassy in kensington the tangier small and unpretentious levin could have said that large and ostentatious was the best way to conceal anything but he let it go ill expect to hear from you i cant wait sitting over coffee after breakfast ferguson said the question is what do we do with them whats wrong with holland park billy said too constrained id like them established somewhere more established what you want is quiet obscurity for a few weeks until zubin grows a beard again dillon said something like that the moneys there ferguson said plenty to buy a nice place yes but finding what you want takes time billy said i like old bella shes a great lady she deserves the best he frowned just a minute ive got an idea harry weve got a list of properties a yard long in mayfair the west end billy sometimes you get it right harry said well come up with something suitable im sure at eleven oclock on russian television with an atmosphere of some solemnity and gloom it was announced that josef belov had collapsed and been rushed to hospital there was a suspicion of a recurrence of stomach cancer there had been concern about his health for some time there was a definite hint that he had made some sort of personal sacrifice as regards the future of belov international there was a significant absence of political figures to comment but footage of max zubin at the dorchester in london with putin and the british prime minister was run and rerun the announcement was picked up by the bbc where at holland park zubin and his mother saw it so did greta novikova who immediately demanded roper she found him in the computer room what the hell happened she asked well as usual dillon happened and a few friends afterward she sat there shaking her head ashimov will be in serious trouble roper you must understand hell be called home and i wouldnt like to think of the price hell have to pay hell be blamed for everything thats the problem so the zubins are here on the floor above you he glanced at his watch theyll be down for lunch soon do you want to join in after all you met them in moscow she got up why not she walked to the door doyle following and hesitated i love my country roper does that make sense if you go back youll disappear from sight forever stalin may have died a long time ago but nothing changes greta she went out slowly doyle following ashimov flew over from ballykelly rising up through heavy rain he found the vodka and sat there drinking bloody country it rains nearly every day ill be glad to get out of it to russia lousy weather i should have thought at this time of the year dont you ever get tired of it bell said of what oh our line of work years of putting yourself on the line dodgy passports like today lies ashimov swallowed more vodka i loved it worked my way up from being a private soldier theyd have made me a colonel for sure this year i was still officially gru though i was responsible for all belovs security you know the good work i did with the kgb in the old days working for the irish cause i cant deny that and then ferguson and dillon came on the scene always dillon this business with zubin has ruined my life and you think knocking off zubin and his mother will put you back on volkovs good books id be even better if it could be ferguson and dillon id like to see them both rot in hell in spite of being obviously drunk he had another and bell on the other side of the aisle picked up a newspaper and pretended to read it already regretting his involvement but times were hard it wasnt the old days any longer with a pistol in your pocket and a song in your heart for the glorious cause fifty thousand pounds hed just have to put up with this madman after all it was only two days chomsky hadnt told levin the exact truth about popov his man in the boat at hangmans wharf for like levin himself popovs mother had been english she had died of cancer while popov served in chechnya the truth was shed had a younger sister living in islington so popovs posting to the london embassy had presented him with an aunt and a readymade extended family his english was not only excellent as chomsky had said it was perfect which proved more than useful on his assignment at hangmans wharf for nobody doubted he was english he ventured into the pub had meatandpotato pie beer even recognized harry salter and billy from the photos hed been shown outside working on the boat at the wharf hed noticed them walking down to the warehouse development and going in hed taken a walk that way read the notice board outside extolling the virtues of salter developments there was a small exhibition in the foyer plans on display leaflets declaring how special the apartments were and most special of all the penthouse at that end of the wharf the development continued rising straight up from the thames a row of balconies sixty feet high and what had originally been some sort of cargo gates a man in a security uniform wandered out of the entrance he smiled impressive isnt it you can say that again do you live round here only on a temporary basis im doing one of the boats up along the wharf there just a paint job really charley black he held out his hand the man shook it tony small ive not been here long myself might see you in the pub later could be levins boys followed various vehicles out of holland park sometimes crossmatching ferguson from cavendish place or the other way round dillon in his mini cooper the salters particularly billy visiting a number of times and occasionally the trail leading to the ministry of defence there was a breakthrough when billy in his uncles aston left holland park with the zubins the man in the telecom manhole alerted his colleague on a security firm suzuki who followed them all over mayfair and the west end visiting twelve properties eventually returning to holland park househunting captain the false security man told him sometimes there was a for rent or a for sale board and sometimes not yes sir the real estate agents boards what was the name salter enterprises and afterwards they returned to holland park no sir they stopped at hangmans wharf theres a salter warehouse development there they went in and had a look came out an hour later its close to the dark man did they go in the pub no billy salter took them straight back to holland park interesting levin said to chomsky contact popov and tell him to find out what he can about this development on the wharf popov worked away at painting his boat by the wharf and in the later part of the afternoon saw the security man tony small emerge from the development and walk along to the dark man popov left his work and went across to the pub it had just started to rain small was seated in a corner booth eating a cornish pasty a beer at his elbow and reading the london evening standard popov got a beer and turned and smiled hello again small looked up oh its you hows it going just started to rain wont help the painting can i join you why not popov sat on the other side of the table i was really impressed with that place where you work somebody told me that this salter company owns this pub they own more than that mate harry salter and his nephew billy own just about everything you can see from here along the riverbank is that so millions in development restaurants gambling you name it theyre into it its strictly legal but it wasnt always like that king of the river harry i should know i spent five years with the river police nobody messed with harry salter i cant believe it i cant believe youre working here in wapping and dont realize who he is no im from west sussex popov said had a real estate agency in chichester i got a nice offer to take me over from a national company good money so i took it sticking with the truth he went on my old aunt lives in islington im staying with her and im doing the boat up for a friend of hers while i consider my options oh i see small finished his beer and waved to the bar two more he then went on to fill in popov with details of the wicked past of the salters my god popov said when hed finished and now hes finished a place like your development must be making a fortune he will be when hes sold them its all being talked up in the trade hes going to do that for a month then kind of explode on the market theyre all nice the apartments but i tell you what you should see the penthouse its fantastic great views of the thames all the way down god id love to see that popov said i mean having been in the business he finished his beer fancy a scotch well thats very nice of you how can i refuse by the time hed accepted two large ones mellowed by alcohol he said i should be getting back tell you what come and have a look which popov did and saw everything the two private elevators at the front two more at the rear the glorious penthouse spread across the top of the building beautifully furnished the old cargo gates jutting out over the river like terraces it was all very impressive this is wonderful he said its going to cost somebody a packet i thought i saw someone going in earlier popov said yes you did billy salter was showing a couple round a middleaged guy and an old lady she was ecstatic about it hes invited them round for drinks at sixthirty itll be dark then popov said not too dark for champagne and caviar hes having it brought round from the pub god the rich know how to live popov shook his head thanks tony id better get back and see if the weather allows me to continue working he hurried back to the boat eager to get his mobile out and tell chomsky everything levin sitting with chomsky said so the salters have invited the zubins round to this penthouse why to discuss moving them in for a while exactly so who else would be invited put your lawyers mind to that ferguson and dillon thats probably it they might have their minders i dont think so its only a hundred yards from the pub and harry the gangster might like to play the gracious host id say hell have the goodies delivered beforehand everything laid out nicely low lights soft music he could also have a couple of hoods prowling around armed to the teeth so i could be wrong levins mobile went it was ashimov were at the tangier youve told the falcon to wait at archbury yes but why my dear yuri if theres one thing ive learned in this life its never to leave anything to chance you never know when youre going to need to get out of somewhere in a hurry never mind that whats happening ill call you back igor levin lit a russian cigarette and offered one to chomsky who said youre having second thoughts it was a statement not a question levin said hes an oaf that one hes also a murderous bastard and max zubin was a paratrooper in chechnya and so were you true im also an officer of the gru whos supposed to obey orders and serve his country as a lawyer i could argue that what youre obeying are general volkovs orders which might not be what actually is right for your country yes i take your point we could argue this one until the crack of doom book a mercedes draw me two aks from the gun room and put them in the trunk ill deal with ashimov he was angry felt pushed but there it was so he phoned ashimov and said there you are i know where theyll be at sixthirty ill take you there look for me and he switched off and said to chomsky there are some wonderful english passports in gru files if i were you id fill one in at holland park ferguson was talking to roper when dillon walked in good im glad you could make it ferguson said harrys putting himself out caviar champagne i cant persuade this one to join us ive hardly had a wink of sleep in three days roper said im winding down if you want an extra guest take greta novikova she actually met them in moscow had breakfast with them this morning they like her an interesting idea ferguson said and turned to doyle tell the major were taking her out sergeant for some champagne and caviar doyle said i would say she wont be able to resist sir and he went out roper poured a scotch i hope youre carrying sean always do why because i still have the feeling this is not over yet to be frank ive been thinking that too dillon slipped a hand under the back of his jacket and touched the butt of the walther in the back of his waistband greta appeared fifteen minutes later in a black suit and a duster coat whats this she asked ferguson are you trying to soften me up not at all its a social occasion my dear to take you out of yourself we wont be needing you sergeant so lets be off and he took her out through the door his hand under her elbow at the hotel tangier levin called ashimovs suite told him he was in the bar got himself a vodka and sat in the corner it was early evening so no one was in the bar itself two or three people in the lounge area after a while ashimov and bell arrived ashimov was tanked up eyes glittering whats going on keep your voice down levin said unless you want half the hotel to know our business how dare you speak to me like that im your commanding officer i act under direct orders from general volkov thats the only reason im assisting in this matter at all ill take you where you want to go but before we do ill explain as far as i know the situation well find there what the hell is this ashimov demanded loudly levin got up and said to bell im going out to my mercedes and im going to drive away if you move fast you can join me but not unless this idiot here keeps his mouth shut he walked out got behind the wheel of the mercedes and bell and ashimov scrambled in behind there are two aks in the back of the car levin said well be where were going in half an hour now keep quiet while i explain what i know of the situation im letting you know now i cant guarantee wholl be there other than the zubins ashimov was burning ill have you courtmartialed for this levin pulled in at the curb leaned back and drove his elbow into ashimovs mouth any more and ill kick you out now make up your mind ashimov put a handkerchief to his bloodied mouth bell leaned over and patted levin on the shoulder just take us there and lets get this thing over with then persuade your friend at hangmans wharf levin parked by the development got out and opened the rear compartment bell and ashimov joined him there are your weapons he turned and waved and popov on the deck of the boat ran forward through the gathering darkness yes captain theyre upstairs are they levin looked up at the lights in the penthouse there was food and booze delivered earlier when the salters arrived no minders none a short while ago a daimler appeared the zubins ferguson and dillon and major novikova greta really how interesting well youve done a good job now get out of here tell chomsky ive said he can do the same for you hell know what i mean popov cleared off rapidly bell said now what well ill go and sort the security guard out once thats done ill call you he walked in the foyer lighting a cigarette and found tony small watering potted plants beside a huge fish tank he turned and smiled can i help you sir not really old chap levin pulled a silenced walther from his raincoat pocket and struck him across the side of the head small went down like a stone levin grasped him by the collar dragged him behind the reception desk opened the office door and deposited him inside then he locked the door he turned and whistled and ashimov and bell hastened to join him over here he led the way to the lifts and pressed the right button all the way to the sixth floor and theres your party major the openplan kitchen of the penthouse was ideal for the kind of entertaining harry had in mind there was caviar prawns salads dom pérignon champagne greta having been warmly received by bella busied herself offering caviar on toast while billy saw to the champagne its perfect he said to ferguson theyll be way up over the world here i mean look at the views he pulled one shutter after another to the side and stepped out on the hardwood terrace and leaned on the rail its fantastic lights sparkled on a passing boat in the gathering darkness below it certainly is ferguson said and went back inside bella max do you think you could put up with staying here for a while my dear general who couldnt bella said firstrate security harry said as billy went round topping up the champagne or it will be when were up and running properly youll have no worries here drink up folks to a job well done to friendship they all joined in the toast glasses raised crystal lights illuminating the magnificent vista of the huge penthouse the shutters opening to the terraces outside lights from the river below and at the far end of the entrance corridor the lift came smoothly to a halt and igor levin led the way out followed by ashimov and bell ashimov his ak held at the ready brushed levin to the side roughly where are they let me get at them he halfran along the corridor levin went after him a walther in his hand and pursued by bell there was immediate shock in the party group but ashimov fired into the ceiling hold it everybody just do as youre told hands on heads levin moved to one side and stood with his back to one of the entrances to the terrace outside the men hesitated then did as they were told greta glanced at levin igor what a surprise not as much as you being here you traitoress bitch i should shoot you myself ashimov said he held the ak on his hip covering them bell did the same levins right hand hung at his side holding the walther ferguson said youve got it wrong major novikova is my prisoner she is not here of her own free will ashimov stepped forward at once and smacked the butt of his ak into the side of fergusons neck the general went down with a groan falling against harry who tried to catch him leaning over and ashimov gave him the same as ferguson in the back of the neck max zubin held his mother close billy and dillon stood there hands behind the neck greta between them trembling a little ashimov said so shaking with fear are you she shook her head you should youre a disgrace to your uniform you disgrace my country by your very existence you animal he struck her backhanded across the face sending her staggering into dillon who caught her ashimov said a traitor to her country captain levin there was a strange formality to the way he spoke you may have the honor of executing her there was a stunned silence bella said you take me back to the gulag many people like you in charge there no better than nazis shut up old woman your turn will come he looked at levin i gave you an order shoot major novikova there was a pause while everyone waited levin had raised the walther slightly but now he said sorry i cant oblige but i dont think i want to do that his hand came up fast but not fast enough as ashimov fired two rounds slamming into levins chest sending him out on the terrace to go backward over the hardwood rail and down into the river below dillon pushed greta to one side his hand went under his jacket at the rear the walther came up smoothly and he shot ashimov in the forehead twice billy on one knee had reached for the colt in his ankle holster and caught bell with a heart shot the irishman went backward involuntarily firing at the ceiling for a moment greta ran out to the terrace rail and peered down into the dark my god igor dillon put an arm around her its a tidal river the thames what goes in goes out one way or the other at the end he just couldnt do it we all have choices behind them they heard ferguson on the phone ferguson here ive got two disposals for you most immediate he gave the address greta said what does he mean disposal we have access to a private crematorium in north london the corpse goes in for thirty minutes whats left is six pounds of gray ash and ferguson can do that ferguson can do anything harry said i feel wellused the bastard could certainly dish it out he poured champagne down and swallowed it come on everybody another drink then well see you home ferguson said to bella and zubin i think youll find this is the end of the affair a short run bella said and thank god for it the lift returned and billy got out i found the security guard tony small in the back of reception no serious damage just a sore head i told him it was a mob thing five hundred quid will keep him happy well get you good people back home ferguson said ill leave you and billy to handle the disposal people harry well be in touch general sometime earlier levin had drifted out of the thames close to a ladder that took him up to the wharf rounds blocked by a bulletproof vest often knock the recipient unconscious but not in levins case the icecold waters of the thames had taken care of that he reached in his shirt pulled out ashimovs two rounds then hurried to where he had left the mercedes got in and drove away half an hour later at the dorchester where he had arrived soaked to the skin he showered changed clothes and packed he had various phone numbers from gru records and one of them was the holland park safe house he phoned and a man answered who is this would that be major roper and who would you be igor levin are you aware of what happened at the penthouse of course i was told ashimov blew you away over a railing and a rather steep fall into the thames tell dillon theres nothing like a titanium vest i survived got back to the dorchester where my condition probably surprised the doorman but being the best hotel in london they were able to cope just tell me what happened after ashimov shot me roper told him in a few short sentences its all taken care of ashimov and the exchief of staff of the ira are as we speak being turned into six pounds each of gray ash the zubins have survived so have ferguson and harry though a little damaged i was surprised to see greta there only as a guest give dillon and billy my respects what are you going to do ive got diplomatic immunity you cant touch me and you would be advised to stay out of russia yes but i have an english passport through my mother and an irish one through one of my grandmothers not to mention lots of money roper i think ill lay low in dublin for a while what the hell you sound like a nice guy so ill give you my mobile number if dillon wants me ill make it easy cheeky bastard but roper took it take care though for a man in a wheelchair you do well tell greta not to be stupid the line went dead roper sat there smiling then reached for the whiskey bottle and found it empty he pushed his chair to the drinks cabinet found a bottle of scotch and opened it he poured a glass and held it high well heres to you good luck a moment later ferguson came in with greta dillon and the zubins you look pleased with yourself ferguson said so i should roper poured another scotch ive just been talking to a ghost you know someone whos returned from the dead and it was dillon with that extraordinary sixth sense who said igor levin he was wearing a bulletproof vest just like you favor sean headfirst into the thames thank god bella zubin said he was always a lovely boy wasnt he max well thats one way of describing him her son told her greta was unable to stop smiling hes himself alone that one and he said to tell greta not to be stupid she stopped smiling and shrugged ferguson said hes right except that diplomatic immunity would send him home he is half english volkov would crucify him im not so sure hell go from archbury theres a falcon there ive checked are you going to stop him irish citizen what would be the point he turned to dillon what do you think well we not only know where he is hes left his mobile number exactly ferguson smiled damn his eyes i like the bastard who knows what the future holds igor levin waited on the high street beside kensington palace gardens it was raining heavily the russian embassy up there the end of something in a way the phone rang and volkov said god what a bloody mess i dont blame you ashimovs insane i should have realized that years ago ive heard youve decided to flee to dublin thats the smart move but theres part of you thats still a sentimentalist taking chomsky and popov with you i understand yes theyre very good but then so were fergusons people dillon i wish he was available brutal resourceful and that language thing he has very useful and the zubins forget them ferguson will always have them guarded putinll just have to get ahold of belov international another way hes angrier than ive ever seen him so were all just laying low heads are going to roll so im going to make damn sure one of them isnt mine he sighed take care igor and he switched off a moment or so later chomsky and popov said goodbye to the embassy of the russian federation came down kensington palace gardens each with a couple of suitcases they loaded up the mercedes and levin got out to help they were as excited as schoolboys levin said you drive chomsky and you sit with him popov ill spread myself in the back your passports are all in order i trust ah yes captain chomsky said i thought we might as well go the whole hog and take two each from the files english and irish theyre excellent sir popov said stamps on all the pages weve been to places i havent been if you follow me oh i do levin said put archbury into the roadfinder chomsky and follow the instructions will there be the chance of trouble sir i doubt it but lets not take any chances lets move he took out his russian cigarettes selected one pinched the tube and lit it then he produced a couple of miniature bottles of vodka from his pocket which hed taken from the bar in his room at the dorchester there was a shelf in the mercedes water in plastic bottles and plastic tumblers he filled one of them with the contents of the two vodka miniatures it had been a long day a hard day but here he was against all the odds he drank some of the vodka volkov had been extraordinarily well informed about his plans and levin looking at the two young men in front wondered which one it was chomsky or popov it had to be one of them the information had been too fresh not that it mattered that was for another time he examined the rest of his vodka and considered toasting greta novikova but what would have been the point he swallowed it down and sat back the following morning it was march weather rain driving in across the thames at hangmans wharf dillon sat at the corner booth in the dark man with harry and billy and they all ate breakfast harry went through the food with gusto in spite of the brace around his neck god he said that was good how are you feeling dillon asked well that ashimov bastard is finally dead so im feeling good i like the zubins so im feeling good about that too what about you you know what they say just another day at the office you think ferguson was right to let levin off the hook why not he can pull him in when it suits him what do you think billy harry asked that he could just as easily be pulled in by his own people billy shrugged its like the cold wars starting all over again dillons mobile rang he answered and found roper at the other end listen sean ive had ferguson on hes got a job for you what kind of a job involving novikova fire away roper did afterward dillon said harry can i borrow the bentley no you cant its still being repaired you can have the aston martin though whats the gig fergusons releasing novikova he wants her delivered to the russian embassy well thats a turnup harry said dillon turned to billy you can drive suits me dillon looked out as rain pelted the windows never rains but it pours see you later harry and he made for the door driving down wapping high street billy said whats the old man up to being ferguson dillon lit a cigarette the game billy the game dont you ever get tired of it not really i was a twobit gangster okay i worked for my uncle and had plenty of money to throw away but then there was that first time we got involved with you you that old bastard ferguson hannah he swerved slightly braking a little sorry dillon i cant believe i said that and dillon said said what you mentioned an old and loving friend always in our hearts billy they turned into the holland park safe house im with you dillon you know that whatever it takes whatever turns up oh to be young said dillon gloomily come on lets go and get greta at his screens roper seemed cheerful enough ive had our sources in dublin confirm the arrival of the belov falcon chomsky and popov are englishmen with funny names according to their passports well thats been going on a few hundred years dillon told him and levin is jewish enough to have been around since oliver cromwell said roper what are they up to god knows well hear soon enough you think so ive been at this game for years i know so said dillon smiling what about madam at that moment doyle walked in carrying her suitcase and greta followed wearing the black trouser suit and duster coat so whats all this ferguson wants us to drop you at the russian embassy dillon told her i see he seems to think you dont see things his way i dont well there you are then id remind you roper put in that the last time igor levin spoke to me he said to tell greta not to be stupid id say hes an expert at not being stupid an expert on what suits igor levin dillon said all right were wasting time here take her suitcase to the aston martin doyle well join you roper said last chance greta or are you really going to be stupid to hell with it to hell with all of you she walked out like a ship under sail driving through the london streets dillon sitting beside billy greta leaned back looking from side to side her face serious dillon didnt say a word and billy seemed to take his cue from him the rain hammered down on lots of traffic london traffic and she appeared restless ill at ease they were hemmed in by cars for a while she said christ look at it do people have to live like this billy said it was snowing in moscow when i was there the other night it was a bloody sight colder than this but not as cold as it would be in siberia dillon said the aston moved down the high street and turned into kensington palace gardens and was moving toward the embassy when she suddenly slammed a hand down on billys left shoulder no she said he braked no what i dont want to go in there take me to ferguson cavendish place billy dillon said wearily youll find shes expected at cavendish place billy pulled in at the curb and turned off the engine he opened the door for her and retrieved her suitcase dillon got out reached for an umbrella and put it up against the rain goodbye major he said you bastard dillon she turned and walked through the rain and mounted the steps to ferguson s place and pressed the bell dillon caught a glimpse of kim ferguson s ghurka manservant who stood to one side to let her pass and accepted the suitcase handed to him by billy as the rain suddenly increased dillon closed the umbrella got back in the aston and billy slid behind the wheel what do you think he asked about her having a change of heart not much how about you not for a minute not for a bleeding minute billy turned on the engine but then neither will ferguson he smiled and drove away
