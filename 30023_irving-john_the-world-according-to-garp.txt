the world according to garp a novel by john irving for colin and brendan boston mercy garps mother jenny fields was arrested in boston in for wounding a man in a movie theater this was shortly after the japanese had bombed pearl harbor and people were being tolerant of soldiers because suddenly everyone was a soldier but jenny fields was quite firm in her intolerance of the behavior of men in general and soldiers in particular in the movie theater she had to move three times but each time the soldier moved closer to her until she was sitting against the musty wall her view of the newsreel almost blocked by some silly colonnade and she resolved she would not get up and move again the soldier moved once more and sat beside her jenny was twentytwo she had dropped out of college almost as soon as shed begun but she had finished her nursingschool program at the head of her class and she enjoyed being a nurse she was an athleticlooking young woman who always had high color in her cheeks she had dark glossy hair and what her mother called a mannish way of walking she swung her arms and her rump and hips were so slender and hard that from behind she resembled a young boy in jennys opinion her breasts were too large she thought the ostentation of her bust made her look cheap and easy she was nothing of the kind in fact she had dropped out of college when she suspected that the chief purpose of her parents sending her to wellesley had been to have her dated by and eventually mated to some wellbred man the recommendation of wellesley had come from her older brothers who had assured her parents that wellesley women were not thought of loosely and were considered high in marriage potential jenny felt that her education was merely a polite was to bide time as if she were really a cow being prepared only for the insertion of the device for artificial insemination her declared major had been english literature but when it seemed to her that her classmates were chiefly concerned with acquiring the sophistication andpoise to deal with men she had no trouble leaving literature for nursing she saw nursing as something that could be put into immediate practice and its study had no ulterior motive that jenny could see later she wrote in her famous autobiography that too many nurses put themselves on display for too many doctors but then her nursing days were over she liked the simple nononsense uniform the blouse of the dress made less of her breasts the shoes were comfortable and suited to her fast pace of walking when she was at the night desk she could still read she did not miss the young college men who were sulky and disappointed if you wouldnt compromise yourself and superior and aloof it you would at the hospital she saw more soldiers and working boys than college men and they were franker and less pretentious in their expectations if you compromised yourself a little they seemed at least grateful to see you again then suddenly everyone was a soldierand full of the selfimportance of college boysand jenny fields stopped having anything to do with men my mother garp wrote was a lone wolf the fields family fortune was in shoes though mrs fields a former boston weeks had brought some money of her own to the marriage the fields family had managed well enough with footwear to have removed themselves from the shoe factories years ago they lived in a large shingled house on the new hampshire shore at dogs head harbor jenny went home for her days and nights offmainly to please her mother and to convince the grande dame that although jenny was slumming her life away as a nurse as her mother remarked she was not developing slovenly habits in her speech or in her moral person jenny frequently met her brothers at the north station and rode home on the train with them as all members of the fields family were bidden to do they rode on the righthand side of the boston and maine when the train left boston and sat on the left when they returned this complied with the wishes of the senior mr fields who admitted that the ugliest scenery lay out that side of the train but he felt that all fieldses should be forced to face the grimy source of their independence and higher life on the righthand side of the train leaving boston and on the left as you returned you passed the fields factory outlet in haverhill and the vast billboard with the huge work shoe taking a firm step toward you the billboard towered above the railroad yard and was reflected in countless miniatures in the windows of the shoe plant beneath this menacing advancing foot were the words fields for your feet in the factory or in the fields there was a fields line of nursing shoe and mr fields gave his daughter a free pair whenever she came home jenny must have had a dozen pairs mrs fields who insisted on equating her daughters leaving wellesley with a sordid future also gave jenny a present every time she came home mrs fields gave her daughter a hotwater bottle or so she saidand so jenny assumed she never opened the packages her mother would say dear do you still have that hotwater bottle i gave you and jenny would think a minute believing she had left it on the train or thrown it away and shed say i may have lost it mother but im sure i dont need another one and mrs fields bringing the package out from hiding would press it on her daughter it was still concealed in the drugstore paper mrs fields would say please jennifer be more careful and use it please as a nurse jenny saw little use for the hotwater bottle she assumed it to be a touching odd device of oldfashioned and largely psychological comfort but some of the packages made it back to her small room near boston mercy hospital she kept them in a closet which was nearly full of boxes of nursing shoesalso unopened she felt detached from her family and thought it strange how they had lavished so much attention on her as a child and then at some appointed prearranged time they seemed to stop the flow of affection and begin the expectationsas if for a brief phase you were expected to absorb love and get enough and then for a much longer and more serious phase you were expected to fulfill certain obligations when jenny had broken the chain had left wellesley for something as common as nursing she had dropped her familyand they as if they couldnt help themselves were in the process of dropping her in the fields family for example it would have been more appropriate if jenny had become a doctor or if shed stayed in college until she married one each time she saw her brothers her mother and her father they were more uncomfortable in one anothers presence they were involved in that awkward procedure of getting to unknow each other that must be how families are thought jenny fields she felt if she ever had children she would love them no less when they were twenty than when they were two they might need you more at twenty she thought what do you really need when youre two in the hospital the babies were the easiest patients the older they got the more they needed and the less anyone wanted or loved them jenny felt she had grown up on a large ship without having seen much less understood the engine room she liked how the hospital reduced everything to what one ate if it helped one to have eaten it and where it went as a child she had never seen the dirty dishes in fact when the maids cleared the table jenny was sure they were throwing the dishes away it was some time before she was even allowed in the kitchen and when the milk truck brought the bottles every morning for a while jenny thought that the truck brought the days dishes toothe sound that glassy clatter and bang being so like the sound of the maids in the closed kitchen doing whatever they did to the dishes jenny fields was five before she saw her fathers bathroom she tracked it down one morning by following the scent of her fathers cologne she found a steamy shower stallquite modern for a private toilet a row of bottles so unlike her mothers bottles that jenny thought she had discovered the lair of a secret man living undetected in their house for years in fact she had in the hospital jenny knew where everything went and she was learning the unmagical answers to where almost everything came from at dogs head harbor when jenny had been a girl the family members had their own baths their own rooms their own doors with their own mirrors on the backs in the hospital privacy was not sacred nothing was a secret if you wanted a mirror you had to ask a nurse the most mysterious thing she had been allowed to investigate on her own when jenny was a child had been the cellar and the great pottery crock which every monday was filled with clams jennys mother sprinkled cornmeal on the clams at night and every morning they were rinsed in fresh sea water from a long pipe that ran into the basement from the sea itself by the weekend the clams were fat and free of sand they were growing too big for their shells and their great obscene necks lolled on the salt water jenny would help the cook sort through them on fridays the dead ones did not retract their necks when touched jenny asked for a book about clams she read all about them how they ate how they bred how they grew it was the first live thing she understood completelyits life its sex its death at dogs head harbor human beings were not that accessible in the hospital jenny fields felt she was making up for lost time she was discovering that people werent much more mysterious or much more attractive than clams my mother garp wrote was not one for making fine distinctions one striking difference she might have seen between clams and people was that most people had some sense of humor but jenny was not inclined toward humor there was a popular joke among the nurses in boston at that time but it was not funny to jenny fields the joke involved the other hospitals in boston the hospital jenny worked in was boston mercy hospital which was called boston mercy there was also massachusetts general hospital which was called mass general and another hospital was the peter bent brigham which was called the peter bent one day the joke goes a boston cab driver had his taxi hailed by a man who staggered off the curb toward him almost dropping to his knees in the street the man was purple in the face with pain he was either strangling or holding his breath so that talking was difficult for him and the cabby opened the door and helped him inside where the man lay face down on the floor alongside the back seat tucking his knees up to his chest hospital hospital he cried the peter bent the cabby asked that was the closest hospital its worse than bent the man moaned i think molly bit it off few jokes were funny to jenny fields and certainly not this one no peter jokes for jenny who was staying clear of the issue she had seen the trouble peters could get into babies were not the worst of it of course she saw people who didnt want to have babies and they were sad that they were pregnant they shouldnt have to have babies jenny thoughtthough she mainly felt sorry for the babies who were born she saw people who wanted to have babies too and they made her want to have one one day jenny fields though she would like to have a babyjust one but the trouble was that she wanted as little to do with a peter as possible and nothing whatsoever to do with a man most peter treatment jenny saw was done to soldiers the us army would not begin to benefit from the discovery of penicillin until and there were many soldiers who didnt get penicillin until at boston mercy in the early days of peters were usually treated with sulfa and arsenic sulfathiazole was for the clapwith lots of water recommended for syphilis in the days before penicillin they used neoarsphenamine jenny fields thought that this was the epitome of all that sex could lead toto introduce arsenic into the human chemistry to try to clean the chemistry up the other peter treatment was local and also required a lot of fluid jenny frequently assisted with this method of disinfecting because the patient required lots of attention at the time sometimes in fact he needed to be held it was a simple procedure that could force as much as one hundred ccs of fluid up the penis and through the surprised urethra before it all came back but the procedure left everyone feeling a bit raw the man who invented a device for this method of treatment was named valentine and his device was called the valentine irrigator long after dr valentines irrigator was improved or replaced with another irrigation device the nurses at boston mercy still referred to the procedure as the valentine treatmentan appropriate punishment for a lover thought jenny fields my mother garp wrote was not romantically inclined when the soldier in the movie theater first started changing seatswhen he made his first move on herjenny fields felt that the valentine treatment would be just the thing for him but she didnt have an irrigator with her it was much too large for her purse it also required the considerable cooperation of the patient what she did have with her was a scalpel she carried it with her all the time she had not stolen it from surgery either it was a castaway scalpel with a deep nick taken out of the point it had probably been dropped on the floor or in a sinkit was no good for fine work but it was not for fine work that jenny wanted it at first it had slashed up the little silk pockets of her purse then she found part of an old thermometer container that slipped over the head of the scalpel capping it like a fountain pen it was this cap she removed when the soldier moved into the seat beside her and stretched his arm along the armrest they were absurdly meant to share his long hand dangled off the end of the armrest it twitched like the flank of a horse shuddering flies away jenny kept her hand on the scalpel inside her purse with her other hand she held the purse tightly in her white lap she was imagining that her nurses uniform shone like a holy shield and for some perverse reason this vermin beside her had been attracted by her light my mother garp wrote went through her life on the lookout for pursesnatchers and snatchsnatchers in the theater it was not her purse that the soldier wanted he touched her knee jenny spoke up fairly clearly get your stinking hand off me she said several people turned around oh come on the soldier moaned and his hand shot quickly under her uniform he found her thighs locked tightly togetherhe found his whole arm from his shoulder to his wrist suddenly sliced open like a soft melon jenny had cut cleanly through his insignia and his shirt cleanly through his skin and muscles baring his bones at the joint of his elbow if id wanted to kill him she told the police later id have slit his wrist im a nurse i know how people bleed the soldier screamed on his feet and falling back he swiped at jennys head with his uncut arm boxing her ear so sharply that her head sang she pawed at him with the scalpel removing a piece of his upper lip the approximate shape and thinness of a thumbnail i was not trying to slash his throat she told the police later i was trying to cut his nose off but i missed crying on all fours the soldier groped his way to the theater aisle and headed toward the safety of the light in the lobby someone else in the theater was whimpering in fright jenny wiped her scalpel on the movie seat returned it to her purse and covered the blade with the thermometer cap then she went to the lobby where keen wailings could be heard and the manager was calling through the lobby doors over the dark audience is there a doctor here please is someone a doctor someone was a nurse and she went to lend what assistance she could when the soldier saw her he fainted it was not really from loss of blood jenny knew how facial wounds bled they were deceptive the deeper gash on his arm was of course in need of immediate attention but the soldier was not bleeding to death no one but jenny seemed to know thatthere was so much blood and so much of it was on her white nurses uniform they quickly realized she had done it the theater lackeys would not let her touch the fainted soldier and someone took her purse from her the mad nurse the crazed slasher jenny fields was calm she thought it was only a matter of waiting for the true authorities to comprehend the situation but the police were not very nice to her either you been dating this guy long the first one asked her en route to the precinct station and another one asked her later but how did you know he was going to attack you he says he was just trying to introduce himself thats a real mean little weapon honey a third told her you shouldnt carry something like that around with you thats asking for trouble so jenny waited for her brothers to clear things up they were lawschool men from cambridge across the river one was a law student the other one taught in the law school both garp wrote were of the opinion that the practice of law was vulgar but the study of it was sublime they were not so comforting when they came break your mothers heart said one if youd only stayed at wellesley said the other a girl alone has to protect herself jenny said what could be more proper but one of her brothers asked her if she could prove that she had not had previous relations with the man confidentially whispered the other one have you been dating this guy long finally things were cleared up when the police discovered that the soldier was from new york where he had a wife and child he had taken a leave in boston and more than anything else he feared the story would get back to his wife everyone seemed to agree that would be awfulfor everyoneso jenny was released without charges when she made a fuss that the police had not given her back her scalpel one of her brothers said for gods sake jennifer you can steal another one cant you i didnt steal it jenny said you should have some friends a brother told her at wellesley they repeated thank you for coming when i called you jenny said whats a family for one said blood runs thick said the other then he paled embarrassed at the associationher uniform was so besmirched im a good girl jenny told them jennifer said the older one and her lifes earliest modelfor wisdom for all that was right he was rather solemn he said its best not to get involved with married men we wont tell mother the other one said and certainly not father said the first in an awkward attempt at some natural warmth he winked at hera gesture that contorted his face and for a moment convinced jenny that her lifes earliest model had developed a facial tic beside the brothers was a mailbox with a poster of uncle sam a tiny soldier all in brown was climbing down from uncle sams big hands the soldier was going to land on a map of europe the words under the poster said support our boys jennys oldest brother looked at jenny looking at the poster and dont get involved with soldiers he added though in a very few months he would be a soldier himself he would be one of the soldiers who wouldnt come home from the war he would break his mothers heart an act he once spoke of with distaste jennys only other brother would be killed in a sailboat accident long after the war was over he would be drowned several miles offshore from the fields family estate at dogs head harbor of his grieving wife jennys mother would say shes still young and attractive and the children arent obnoxious at least not yet after a decent time im sure shell be able to find someone else it was to jenny that her brothers widow eventually spoke almost a year after the drowning she asked jenny if she thought a decent time had passed and she could begin whatever had to be begun to find someone else she was anxious about offending jennys mother she wondered if jenny thought it would be all right to emerge from mourning if you dont feel like mourning what are you mourning for jenny asked her in her autobiography jenny wrote that poor woman needed to be told what to feel that was the stupidest woman my mother said she ever met garp wrote and she had gone to wellesley but jenny fields when she said goodnight to her brothers at her small rooming house near boston mercy was too confused to be properly outraged she was also soreher ear where the soldier had cuffed her hurt her and there was a deep muscle cramp between her shoulder blades which made it hard for her to sleep she thought she must have wrenched something in there when the theater lackeys had grabbed her in the lobby and pulled her arms behind her back she remembered that hotwater bottles were supposed to be good for sore muscles and she got out of bed and went to her closet and opened one of her mothers gift packages it was not a hotwater bottle that had been her mothers euphemism for something her mother couldnt bring herself to discuss in the package was a douche bag jennys mother knew what they were for and so did jenny she had helped many patients at the hospital use them though at the hospital they were not much used to prevent pregnancies after lovemaking they were used for general feminine hygiene and in venereal cases to jenny fields a douche bag was a gentler more commodious version of the valentine irrigator jenny opened all her mothers packages in each one was a douche bag please use it dear her mother had begged her jenny knew that her mother though she meant well assumed that jennys sexual activity was considerable and irresponsible no doubt as her mother would put it since wellesley since wellesley jennys mother thought that jenny was fornicating as she would also put it to beat the band jenny fields crawled back to bed with the douche bag filled with hot water and snuggled between her shoulder blades she hoped the clamps that kept the water from running down the hose would not allow a leak but to be sure she held the hose in her hands a little like a rubber rosary and she dropped the nozzle with the tiny holes into her empty water glass all night long jenny lay listening to the douche bag leak in this dirtyminded world she thought you are either somebodys wife or somebodys whoreor fast on your way to becoming one or the other if you dont fit either category then everyone tries to make you think there is something wrong with you but she thought there is nothing wrong with me that was the beginning of course of the book that many years later would make jenny fields famous however crudely put her autobiography was said to bridge the usual gap between literary merit and popularity although garp claimed that his mothers work had the same literary merit as the sears roebuck catalog but what made jenny fields vulgar not her legal brothers not the man in the movie theater who stained her uniform not her mothers douche bags though these were responsible for jennys eventual eviction her landlady a fretful woman who for obscure reasons of her own suspected that every woman was on the verge of an explosion of lasciviousness discovered that there were nine douche bags in jennys tiny room and bath a matter of guilt by association in the mind of the troubled landlady such a sign indicated a fear of contamination beyond even the landladys fear or worse this profusion of douche bags represented an actual and awesome need for douching the conceivable reasons for which penetrated the worst of the landladys dreams whatever she made of the twelve pairs of nursing shoes cannot even be hinted jenny thought the matter so absurdand found her own feelings toward her parents provisions so ambiguousthat she hardly protested she moved but this did not make her vulgar since her brothers her parents and her landlady assumed a life of lewdness for herregardless of her own private example jenny decided that all manifestations of her innocence were futile and appeared defensive she took a small apartment which prompted a new assault of packaged douche bags from her mother and a stack of nursing shoes from her father it struck her that they were thinking if she is to be a whore let her at least be clean and well shod in part the war kept jenny from dwelling on how badly her family misread herand kept her from any bitterness and selfpity too jenny was not a dweller she was a good nurse and she was increasingly busy many nurses were joining up but jenny had no desire for a change of uniform or for travel she was a solitary girl and she didnt want to have to meet a lot of new people also she found the system of rank irritating enough at boston mercy in an army field hospital she assumed it could only be worse first of all she would have missed the babies that was really why she stayed when so many were leaving she was at her best as a nurse she felt to mothers and their babiesand there were suddenly so many babies whose fathers were away or dead or missing jenny wanted most of all to encourage these mothers in fact she envied them it was to her the ideal situation a mother alone with a new baby the husband blown out of the sky over france a young woman with her own child with a life ahead of themjust the two of them a baby with no strings attached thought jenny fields an almost virgin birth at least no future peter treatment would be necessary these women of course were not always as happy with their lot as jenny thought she would have been they were grieving many of them or abandoned many others they resented their children some of them they wanted a husband and a father for their babies many others but jenny fields was their encouragershe spoke up for solitude she told them how lucky they were dont you believe youre a good woman shed ask them most of them thought they were and isnt your baby beautiful most of them thought their babies were and the father what was he like a bum many thought a swine a lout a liara nogood runout fuckaround of a man but hes dead sobbed a few then youre better off arent you jenny asked some of them came around to seeing it her way but jennys reputation at the hospital suffered for her crusade the hospital policy toward unwed mothers was not generally so encouraging old virgin mary jenny the other nurses said doesnt want a baby the easy way why not ask god for one in her autobiography jenny wrote i wanted a job and i wanted to live alone that made me a sexual suspect then i wanted a baby but i didnt want to have to share my body or my life to have one that made me a sexual suspect too and that was what made her vulgar too and that was where she got her famous title a sexual suspect the autobiography of jenny fields jenny fields discovered that you got more respect from shocking other people than you got from trying to live your own life with a little privacy jenny told the other nurses that she would one day find a man to make her pregnantjust that and nothing more she did not entertain the possibility that the man would need to try more than once she told them they of course couldnt wait to tell everyone they knew it was not long before jenny had several proposals she had to make a sudden decision she could retreat ashamed that her secret was out or she could be brazen a young medical student told her he would volunteer on the condition that he could have at least six chances over a threeday weekend jenny told him that he obviously lacked confidence she wanted a child who would be more secure than that an anesthesiologist told her he would even pay for the babys educationthrough collegebut jenny told him that his eyes were too close together and his teeth were poorly formed she would not saddle her wouldbe child with such handicaps one of the other nurses boyfriends treated her most cruelly he frightened her in the hospital cafeteria by handing her a milk glass nearly full of a cloudy viscous substance sperm he said nodding at the glass all thats one shoti dont mess around if one chance is all anyone gets im your man jenny held up the horrid glass and inspected it coolly god knows what was actually in the glass the nurses boyfriend said thats just an indication of what kind of stuff ive got lots of seeds he added grinning jenny dumped the contents of the glass into a potted plant i want a baby she said i dont want to start a sperm farm jenny knew this was going to be hard she learned to take a ribbing and she learned to respond in kind so they decided jenny fields was crude that she was going too far a joke was a joke but jenny seemed too determined about it either she was sticking to her guns just to be stubbornor worse she really meant it her hospital colleagues couldnt make her laugh and they couldnt get her to bed as garp wrote of his mothers dilemma her colleagues detected that she felt herself to be superior to them nobodys colleagues appreciate this so they initiated a gettough policy with jenny fields it was a staff decisionfor her own good of course they decided to get jenny away from the babies and the mothers shes got babies on her brain they said no more obstetrics for jenny fields keep her away from the incubatorsshes got too soft a heart or a head thus they separated jenny fields from the mothers and their babies shes a good nurse they all said let her try some intensive care it was their experience that a nurse in boston mercys intensive care quickly lost interest in her own problems of course jenny knew why they had sent her away from the babies she only resented that they thought so little of her selfcontrol because what she wanted was strange to them they assumed that she also had slim restraint there is no logic to people jenny thought there was lots of time to get pregnant she knew she was in no hurry it was just part of an eventual plan now there was a war in intensive care she saw a little more of it the service hospitals sent them their special patients and there were always the terminal cases there were the usual elderly patients hanging by the usual threads there were the usual industrial accidents and automobile accidents and the terrible accidents to children but mainly there were soldiers what happened to them was no accident jenny made her own divisions among the nonaccidents that happened to the soldiers she came up with her own categories for them there were the men whod been burned for the most part theyd been burned on board ship the most complicated cases came from chelsea naval hospital but theyd also been burned in airplanes and on the ground jenny called them the externals there were the men whod been shot or damaged in bad places internally they were in trouble and jenny called them the vital organs there were the men whose injuries seemed almost mystical to jenny they were men who werent there anymore whose heads or spines had been tampered with sometimes they were paralyzed sometimes they were merely vague jenny called them the absentees occasionally one of the absentees had external or vital organ damage as well all the hospital had a name for them they were goners my father garp wrote was a goner from my mothers point of view that must have made him very attractive no strings attached garps father was a ball turret gunner who had a nonaccident in the air over france the ball turret gunner garp wrote was a member of the bombers crew who was among the most vulnerable to antiaircraft fire from the ground that was called flak flak often looked to the gunner like fastmoving ink flung upward and spread on the sky as if the sky were a blotter the little man for in order to fit in the ball turret a man was better off if he was small crouched with his machine guns in his cramped nesta cocoon in which he resembled one of those insects trapped in glass this ball turret was a metal sphere with a glass porthole it was set into the fuselage of a b like a distended navellike a nipple on the bombers belly in this tiny dome were two fiftycaliber machine guns and a short small man whose chore was to track in his gunsights a fighter plane attacking his bomber when the turret moved the gunner revolved with it there were wooden handles with buttons on the tops to fire the guns gripping these trigger sticks the ball turret gunner looked like some dangerous fetus suspended in the bombers absurdly exposed amniotic sac intent on protecting his mother these handles also steered the turret to a cutoff point so that the ball turret gunner would not shoot off the props forward with the sky under him the gunner must have felt especially cold appended to the plane like an afterthought upon landing the ball turret was retracted usually upon landing an unretracted ball turret would send up sparksas long and violent as automobiles off the old tarmac technical sergeant garp the late gunner whose familiarity with violent death cannot be exaggerated served with the eighth air forcethe air force that bombed the continent from england sergeant garp had experience as a nose gunner in the bc and a waist gunner in the be before they made him a ball turret gunner garp did not like the waist gun arrangements on the be there were two waist gunners tucked into the rib cage of the plane their gunports opposite each other and garp was always getting clouted in the ears when his mate swiveled his gun at the same time garp was moving with his in later models precisely because of this interference between the waist gunners the gunports would be staggered but this innovation would happen too late for sergeant garp his first combat mission was a daylight sortie by bes against rouen france on august which was accomplished without losses technical sergeant garp at his waist gun position was clouted once on the left ear by his gunner mate and twice on the right a part of the problem was that the other gunner compared to garp was so large the mans elbows were level with garps ears in the ball turret the first day over rouen was a man named fowler who was even smaller than garp fowler had been a jockey before the war he was a better shot than garp but the ball turret was where garp wished he could be he was an orphan but he must have liked being alone and he sought some escape from the crowding and elbowing of his fellow waist gunner of course like a great many gunners garp dreamed of his fiftieth mission or so whereat he hoped to be transferred to the second air forcethe bomber training commandwhere he could retire safely as a gunnery instructor but until fowler was killed garp envied fowler his private place his jockeys sense of isolation its a foul spot to be in if you fart a lot fowler maintained he was a cynical man with a dry irritating tickle of a cough and a vile reputation among the nurses at the field hospital fowler was killed during a crash landing on an unpaved road the landing struts were shorn off in a pothole and the whole landing gear collapsed dropping the bomber into a hard belly slide that burst the ball turret with all the disproportionate force of a falling tree hitting a grape fowler whod always said he had more faith in machines than he had in horses or in human beings was crouched in the unretracted ball turret when the plane landed on him the waist gunners including sergeant garp saw the debris skid away from under the belly of the bomber the squadron adjutant who was the closest ground observer of the landing threw up in a jeep the squadron commander did not have to wait for fowlers death to become official in order to replace him with the squadrons nextsmallest gunner tiny technical sergeant garp had always wanted to be a ball turret gunner in september of he became one my mother was a stickler for detail garp wrote when they would bring in a new casualty jenny fields was the first to ask the doctor how it happened and jenny classified them silently the externals the vital organs the absentees and the goners and she found little gimmicks to help her remember their names and their disasters thus private jones fell off his bones ensign potter stopped a whopper corporal estes lost his testes captain flynn has no skin major longfellow is short on answers sergeant garp was a mystery on his thirtyfifth flight over france the little ball turret gunner stopped shooting the pilot noticed the absence of machinegun fire from the ball turret and thought that garp had taken a hit if garp had the pilot had not felt it in the belly of his plane he hoped garp hadnt felt it much either after the plane landed the pilot hurried to have garp transferred to the sidecar of a medics motorcycle all the ambulances were in use once seated in the sidecar the tiny technical sergeant began to play with himself there was a canvas canopy that covered the sidecar in foul weather the pilot snapped this coveting in place the canopy had a porthole through which the medic the pilot and the gathering men could observe sergeant garp for such a small man he seemed to have an especially large erection but he fumbled with it only a little more expertly than a childnot nearly so expertly as a monkey in the zoo like the monkey however garp looked out of his cage and stared frankly into the faces of the human beings who were watching him garp the pilot said garps forehead was freckled with blood which was mostly dry but his flight hat was plastered to the top of his head and dripping there didnt seem to be a mark on him garp the pilot shouted at him there had been a gash in the metal sphere where the fiftycaliber machine gun had been it appeared that some flak had hit the barrels of the guns cracking the gun housing and even loosening the trigger handles though there was nothing wrong with garps handsthey just seemed to be clumsy at masturbation garp cried the pilot garp said garp he was mimicking the pilot like a smart parrot or a crow garp said garp as if he had just learned the word the pilot nodded to garp encouraging him to remember his name garp smiled garp he said he seemed to think this was how people greeted each other not hello hellobut garp garp jesus garp the pilot said some holes and glass cracks had been visible in the porthole of the ball turret the medic now unzipped the porthole of the side cars canopy and peered into garps eyes something was wrong with garps eyes because they rolled around independently of each other the medic thought that the world for garp was probably looming up then going by then looming up againif garp could see at all what the pilot and the medic couldnt know at the time was that some sharp and slender shards from the flak blast had damaged one of the oculomotor nerves in garps brainand other parts of his brain as well the oculomotor nerve consists chiefly of motor fibers that innervate most of the muscles of the eyeball as for the rest of garps brain he had received some cuts and slashes a lot like a prefrontal lobotomythough it was rather careless surgery the medic had a great fear of how carelessly a lobotomy had been performed on sergeant garp and for that reason he thought against taking off the blood sodden flight hat which was stuck to garp and yanked down to where it touched a taut shiny knob that appeared now to be growing on his forehead everyone looked around for the medics motorcyclist but he was off vomiting somewhere and the medic supposed he would have to find someone to sit in the sidecar with garp while he drove the motorcycle himself garp garp said to the medic trying his new word garp the medic confirmed garp seemed pleased he had both his small hands on his impressive erection when he successfully masturbated garp he barked there was joy in his voice but also surprise he rolled his eyes at his audience begging the world to loom up and hold still he was unsure of what hed done garp he asked doubtfully the pilot patted his arm and nodded to the others of the flight and landing crew as if to say lets give a bit of support to the sergeant men please lets make him feel at home and the men respectfully dumbstruck by garps ejaculation all said garp garp garp to hima reassuring seallike chorus intent on putting garp at ease garp nodded his head happily but the medic held his arm and whispered anxiously to him no dont move your head okay garp please dont move your head garps eyes roamed past the pilot and the medic who waited for them to come around again easy does it garp the pilot whispered just sit tight okay garps face radiated pure peace with both hands holding his dying erection the little sergeant looked as if he had done just the thing that the situation called for they could do nothing for sergeant garp in england he was lucky to have been brought home to boston long before the end of the war some senator was actually responsible an editorial in a boston newspaper had accused the us navy of transporting wounded servicemen back home only if the wounded came from wealthy and important american families in an effort to quell such a vile rumor a us senator claimed that if any of the severely wounded were lucky enough to get back to america even an orphan would get to make the tripjust like anyone else there was then some scurrying around to come up with a wounded orphan to prove the senators point but they came up with a perfect person not only was technical sergeant garp an orphan he was an idiot with a oneword vocabulary so he was not complaining to the press and in all the photographs they took gunner garp was smiling when the drooling sergeant was brought to boston mercy jenny fields had trouble categorizing him he was clearly an absentee more docile than a child but she wasnt sure how much else was wrong with him hello how are you she asked him when they wheeled himgrinninginto the ward garp he barked the oculomotor nerve had been partially restored and his eyes now leapt rather than rolled but his hands were wrapped in gauze mittens the result of garps playing in an accidental fire that broke out in the hospital compound aboard his transport ship hed seen the flames and had reached out his hands to them spreading some of the flames up to his face hed singed off his eyebrows he looked a lot like a shaved owl to jenny with the burns garp was an external and an absentee all at once also with his hands so heavily bandaged he had lost the ability to masturbate an activity that his papers said he pursued frequently and successfullyand without any selfconsciousness those whod observed him closely since his accident with the ships fire feared that the childish gunner was becoming depressedhis one adult pleasure taken from him at least until his hands healed it was possible of course that garp had vital organ damage as well many fragments had entered his head many of them were too delicately located to be removed sergeant garps brain damage might not stop with his crude lobotomy his internal destruction could be progressing our general deterioration is complicated enough garp wrote without the introduction of flak to our systems thered been a patient before sergeant garp whose head had been similarly penetrated hed been fine for months just talking to himself and occasionally peeing in his bed then he started to lose his hair he had trouble completing his sentences just before he died he began to develop breasts given the evidence the shadows and the white needles in the x rays gunner garp was probably a goner but to jenny fields he looked very nice a small neat man the former ball turret gunner was as innocent and straightforward in his demands as a twoyearold he cried garp when he was hungry and garp when he was glad he asked garp when something puzzled him or when addressing strangers and he said garp without the question mark when he recognized you he usually did what he was told but be couldnt be trusted he forgot easily and if one time he was as obedient as a sixyearold another time he was as mindlessly curious as if he were one and a half his depressions which were well documented in his transport papers seemed to occur simultaneously with his erections at these moments he would clamp his poor grownup peter between his gauzy mittened hands and weep he wept because the gauze didnt feel as good as his short memory of his hands and also because it hurt his hands to touch anything it was then that jenny fields would come sit with him she would rub his back between his shoulder blades until he tipped back his head like a cat and shed talk to him all the while her voice friendly and full of exciting shifts of accent most nurses droned to their patientsa steady changeless voice intent on producing sleep but jenny knew that it wasnt sleep garp needed she knew he was only a baby and he was boredhe needed some distraction so jenny entertained him she played the radio for him but some of the programs upset garp no one knew why other programs gave him terrific erections which led to his depressions and so forth one program just once gave garp a wet dream which so surprised and pleased him that he was always eager to see the radio but jenny couldnt find that program again she couldnt repeat the performance she knew that if she could plug poor garp into the wetdream program her job and his life would be much happier but it wasnt that easy she gave up trying to teach him a new word when she fed him and she saw that he liked what he was eating shed say good thats good garp hed agree and when he spat out food on his bib and made a terrible face shed say bad that stuffs bad right garp hed gag the first sign jenny had of his deterioration was when he seemed to lose the g one morning he greeted her with an arp garp she said firmly to him garp arp he said she knew she was losing him daily he seemed to grow younger when he slept he kneaded the air with his wriggling fists his lips puckering his cheeks sucking his eyelids trembling jenny had spent a lot of time around babies she knew that the ball turret gunner was nursing in his dreams for a while she contemplated stealing a pacifier from maternity but she stayed away from that place now the jokes irritated her heres virgin mary jenny swiping a phony nipple for her child whos the lucky father jenny she watched sergeant garp suckle in his sleep and tried to imagine that his ultimate regression would be peaceful that he would turn into his fetus phase and no longer breathe through his lungs that his personality would blissfully separate half of him turning to dreams of an egg half of him to dreams of sperm finally he simply wouldnt be anymore it was almost like that garps nursing phase became so severe that he seemed to wake up like a child on a fourhour feeding schedule he even cried like a baby his face scarlet his eyes springing tears in an instant and in an instant being pacifiedby the radio by jennys voice once when she rubbed his back he burped jenny burst into tears she sat at his bedside wishing him a swift painless journey back into the womb and beyond if only his hands would heal she thought then he could suck his thumb when he woke from his suckling dreams hungry to nurse or so he imagined jenny would put her own finger to his mouth and let his lips tug at her though he had real grownup teeth in his mind he was toothless and he never bit her it was this observation that led jenny one night to offer him her breast where he sucked inexhaustibly and didnt seem to mind that there was nothing to be had there jenny thought that if he kept nursing at her she would have milk she felt such a firm tug in her womb both maternal and sexual her feelings were so vividshe believed for a while that she could possibly conceive a child simply by suckling the baby ball turret gunner it was almost like that but gunner garp was not all baby one night when he nursed at her jenny noticed he had an erection that lifted the sheet with his clumsy bandaged hands he fanned himself yelping frustration while he wolfed at her breast and so one night she helped him with her cool powdered hand she took hold of him at her breast he stopped nursing he just nuzzled her ar he moaned he had lost the p once a garp then an arp now only an ar she knew he was dying he had just one vowel and one consonant left when he came she felt his shot wet and hot in her hand under the sheet it smelled like a greenhouse in summer absurdly fertile growth gotten out of hand you could plant anything there and it would blossom garps sperm struck jenny fields that way if you spilled a little in a greenhouse babies would sprout out of the dirt jenny gave the matter twentyfour hours of thought garp jenny whispered she unbuttoned the blouse of her dress and brought forth the breasts she had always considered too large garp she whispered in his ear his eyelids fluttered his lips reached around them was a white shroud a curtain on runners which enclosed them in the ward on one side of garp was an externala flamethrower victim slippery with salve swaddled in gauze he had no eyelids so it appeared he was always watching but he was blind jenny took off her sturdy nurses shoes unfastened her white stockings stepped out of her dress she touched her finger to garps lips on the other side of garps whiteshrouded bed was a vital organ patient on his way to becoming an absentee he had lost most of his lower intestine and his rectum now a kidney was giving him trouble and his liver was driving him crazy he had terrible nightmares that he was being forced to urinate and defecate though this was ancient history for him he was actually quite unaware when he did those things and he did them through tubes into rubber bags he groaned frequently and unlike garp he groaned in whole words shit he groaned garp jenny whispered she stepped out of her slip and her panties she took off her bra and pulled back the sheet christ said the external softly his lips were blistered with burns goddamn shit cried the vital organ man garp said jenny fields she took hold of his erection and straddled him aaa said garp even the r was gone he was reduced to a vowel sound to express his joy or his sadness aaa he said as jenny drew him inside her and sat on him with all her weight garp she asked okay is that good garp good he agreed distinctly but it was only a word from his wrecked memory thrown clear for a moment when he came inside her it was the first and last true word that jenny fields heard him speak good as he shrank and his vital stuff seeped from her he was once again reduced to aaas he closed his eyes and slept when jenny offered him her breast he wasnt hungry god called the external being very gentle with the d his tongue had been burned too piss snarled the vital organ man jenny fields washed garp and herself with warm water and soap in a white enamel hospital bowl she wasnt going to douche of course and she had no doubt that the magic had worked she felt more receptive than prepared soilthe nourished earthand she had felt garp shoot up inside her as generously as a hose in summer as if he could water a lawn she never did it with him again there was no reason she didnt enjoy it from time to time she helped him with her hand and when he cried for it she gave him her breast but in a few weeks he had no more erections when they took the bandages off his hands they noticed that even the healing process seemed to be working in reverse they wrapped him back up again he lost all interest in nursing his dreams struck jenny as the dreams a fish might have he was back in the womb jenny knew he resumed a fetal position tucked up small in the center of the bed he made no sound at all one morning jenny watched him kick with his small weak feet she imagined she felt a kick inside though it was too soon for the real thing she knew the real thing was on its way soon garp stopped kicking he still got his oxygen by breathing air with his lungs but jenny knew this was simply an example of human adaptability he wouldnt eat they had to feed him intravenously so once again he was attached to a kind of umbilical cord jenny anticipated his last phase with some anxiousness would there be a struggle at the end like the sperms frantic struggle would the sperm shield be lifted and the naked egg wait expectantly for death in little garps return trip how would his soul at last divide but the phase passed without jennys observation one day when she was off duty technical sergeant garp died when else could he have died garp has written with my mother off duty was the only way he could escape of course i felt something when he died jenny fields wrote in her famous autobiography but the best of him was inside me that was the best thing for both of us the only way he could go on living the only way i wanted to have a child that the rest of the world finds this an immoral act only shows me that the rest of the world doesnt respect the rights of an individual it was when jennys pregnancy was apparent she lost her job of course it was all that her parents and brothers had expected they werent surprised jenny had long ago stopped trying to convince them of her purity she moved through the big corridors in the parental estate at dogs head harbor like a satisfied ghost her composure alarmed her family and they left her alone secretly jenny was quite happy but with all the musing she must have done about this expected child its a wonder she never gave a thought to names because when jenny fields gave birth to a ninepound baby boy she had no name in mind jennys mother asked her what she wanted to name him but jenny had just delivered and had just received her sedative she was not cooperative garp she said her father the footwear king thought she had burped but her mother whispered to him the name is garp garp he said they knew they might find out who this babys father was this way jenny of course had not admitted a thing find out if thats the son of a bitchs first name or last name jennys father whispered to jennys mother is that a first name or a last name dear jennys mother asked her jenny was very sleepy its garp she said just garp thats the whole thing i think its a last name jennys mother told jennys father whats his first name jennys father asked crossly i never knew jenny mumbled this is true she never did she never knew his first name her father roared please dear her mother said he must have a first name technical sergeant garp said jenny fields a goddamn soldier i knew it her father said technical sergeant jennys mother asked her t s jenny fields said t s garp thats my babys name she fell asleep her father was furious t s garp he hollered what kind of a name for a baby is that all his own jenny told him later its his own goddamn name all his own it was great fun going to school with a name like that garp has written the teachers would ask you what the initials stood for first i used to say that they were just initials but they never believed me so id have to say call my mom shell tell you and they would and old jenny would give them a piece of her mind thus was the world given t s garp born from a good nurse with a will of her own and the seed of a ball turret gunnerhis last shot blood and blue t s garp always suspected he would die young like my father garp wrote i believe i have a knack for brevity im a oneshot man garp narrowly escaped growing up on the grounds of an allgirls school where his mother was offered the position of school nurse but jenny fields saw the possibly harrowing future that would have been involved in this decision her little garp surrounded by women jenny and garp were offered an apartment in one of the dorms she imagined her sons first sexual experience a fantasy inspired by the sight and feel of the allgirls laundry room where as a game the girls would bury the child in soft mountains of young womens underwear jenny would have liked the job but it was for garps sake that she turned down the offer she was hired instead by the vast and famous steering school where she would be simply one more school nurse among many and where the apartment offered her and garp was in the cold prisonwindowed wing of the schools infirmary annex never mind her father told her he was irritated with her that she chose to work at all there was money enough and hed have been happier if shed gone into hiding at the family estate in dogs head harbor until her bastard son had grown up and moved away if the child has any native intelligence jennys father told her he should eventually attend steering but in the meantime i suppose theres no better atmosphere for a boy to be raised in native intelligence was one of the ways her father had of referring to garps dubious genetic background the steering school where jennys father and brothers had gone was at that time an allboys school jenny believed that if she could endure her confinement therethrough young garps prep school yearsshe would be doing her best for her son to make up for denying him a father as her father put it to her its odd garp wrote that my mother who perceived herself well enough to know that she wanted nothing to do with living with a man ended up living with eight hundred boys so young garp grew up with his mother in the infirmary annex of the steering school he was not exactly treated as a faculty bratthe students term for all the underage children of the faculty and staff a school nurse was not considered in quite the same class or category as a faculty member moreover jenny made no attempt to invent a mythology for garps fatherto make up a marriage story for herself to legitimize her son she was a fields she made a point of telling you her name her son was a garp she made a point of telling you his name its his own name she said everyone got the picture not only were certain kinds of arrogance tolerated by the society of the steering school certain kinds were encouraged but acceptable arrogance was a matter of taste and style what you were arrogant about had to appear worthyof higher purposeand the manner in which you were arrogant was supposed to be charming wit did not come naturally to jenny fields garp wrote that his mother never chose to be arrogant but was only arrogant under duress pride was well loved in the community of the steering school but jenny fields appeared to be proud of an illegitimate child nothing to hang her head about perhaps however she might show a little humility but jenny was not only proud of garp she was especially pleased with the manner in which she had gotten him the world did not know that manner yet jenny had not brought out her autobiographyshe hadnt begun to write it in fact she was waiting for garp to be old enough to appreciate the story the story garp knew was all that jenny would tell anyone who was bold enough to ask jennys story was a sober three sentences long the father of garp was a soldier the war killed him who took the time for weddings when there was a war both the precision and mystery of this story might have been interpreted romantically after all given the mere facts the father might have been a war hero a doomed love affair could be imagined nurse fields might have been a field nurse she might have fallen in love at the front and the father of garp might have felt he owed one last mission to the men but jenny fields did not inspire the imagination of such a melodrama for one thing she seemed too pleased with her aloneness she didnt appear in the least misty about the past she was never distracted she was simply all for little garpand for being a good nurse of course the fields name was known at the steering school the famous footwear king of new england was a generous alumnus and whether or not it was suspected at the time he would even become a trustee his was not the oldest but not the newest of new england money and his wife jennys mothera former boston weekswas perhaps still better known at steering among the older faculty there were those who could remember years and years without interruption when there had always been a graduating weeks yet to the steering school jenny fields didnt seem to have inherited all the credentials she was handsome they would admit but she was plain she wore her nurses uniform when she could have dressed in something smarter in fact this whole business of being a nurseof which she also appeared too proudwas curious considering her family nursing was not enough of a profession for a fields or a weeks socially jenny had that kind of graceless seriousness which makes more frivolous people uncomfortable she read a lot and was a great ransacker of the steering library the book someone wanted was always discovered to be checked out to nurse fields phone calls were politely answered jenny frequently offered to deliver the book directly to the party who wanted it as soon as she finished it she finished such books promptly but she had nothing to say about them in a school community someone who reads a book for some secretive purpose other than discussing it is strange what was she reading for that she attended classes in her offduty hours was stranger still it was written in the constitution of the steering school that faculty and staff andor their spouses could attend free of charge any course offered at steering simply by securing the permission of the instructor who would turn away a nursefrom the elizabethans from the victorian novel from the history of russia until from an introduction to genetics from western civilization i and ii over the years jenny fields would march from caesar to eisenhowerpast luther and lenin erasmus and mitosis osmosis and freud rembrandt and chromosomes and van goghfrom the styx to the names from homer to virginia woolf from athens to auschwitz she never said a word she was the only woman in the classes in her white uniform she listened so quietly that the boys and finally the teacher forgot her and relaxed they went on with the learning process while she sat keenly white and still among them a witness to everythingmaybe determining nothing possibly judging it all jenny fields was getting the education she had waited for now the time seemed ripe but her motives were not wholly selfish she was screening the steering school for her son when garp was old enough to attend shed be able to give him lots of adviceshed know the deadweights in every department those courses that meandered and those that sang her books spilled out of the tiny wing apartment in the infirmary annex she spent ten years at the steering school before discovering that the bookstore offered a percent discount to the faculty and staff which the bookstore had never offered her this made her angry she was generous with her books tooeventually shelving them in every room of the bleak infirmary annex but they outgrew the shelf space and slid into the main infirmary into the waiting room and into xray first covering and then replacing the newspapers and the magazines slowly the sick of the steering school learned what a serious place steering wasnot your ordinary hospital crammed with light reading and the media trash while you waited to see the doctor you could browse through the waning of the middle ages waiting for your lab results you could ask the nurse to bring you that invaluable genetics manual the fruit fly handbook if you were seriously ill or might be visiting the infirmary for a long time there was sure to be a copy of the magic mountain for the boy with the broken leg and all the athletically wounded there were the good heroes and their meaty adventuresthere were conrad and melville instead of sports illustrated instead of time and newsweek there were dickens and hemingway and twain what a wet dream for the lovers of literature to lie sick at steering at last a hospital with something good to read when jenny fields had spent twelve years at steering it was a habit among the school librarians upon recognizing that they didnt have a book which someone sought to say perhaps the infirmary has it and at the bookstore when something was out of stock or out of print they might recommend that you find nurse fields over at the infirmary she might have it and jenny would frown upon hearing the request and say i believe thats in twentysix at the annex but mccarty is reading it he has the flu perhaps when hes through hell be glad to let you have it or she might respond i last saw that one down at the whirlpool bath it might be a little wet in the beginning it is impossible to judge jennys influence on the quality of education at steering but she never got over her anger at being cheated out of the percent discount for ten years my mother supported that bookstore garp wrote by comparison nobody else at steering ever read anything when garp was two the steering school offered jenny a threeyear contract she was a good nurse everyone agreed and the slight distaste that everyone felt toward her had not increased in those first two years the baby after all was like any baby perhaps a little darkerskinned in summer than most and a little sallowskinned in winterand a little fat there was something rounded about him like a bundled eskimo even when he wasnt actually bundled and those younger faculty who had just gotten over the last war remarked that the shape of the child was as blunt as a bomb but illegitimate children are still children after all the irritation at jennys oddness was acceptably mild she accepted the threeyear contract she was learning improving herself but also preparing the way through steering for her garp a superior education is what the steering school could offer her father had said jenny thought shed better make sure when garp was five jenny fields was made head nurse it was hard to find young active nurses who could tolerate the freshness and wild behavior of the boys it was hard to find anyone willing to live in and jenny seemed quite content to stay in her wing of the infirmary annex in this sense she became a mother to many up in the night when one of the boys threw up or buzzed her or smashed his water glass or when the occasionally bad boys fooled around in the dark aisles raced their hospital beds engaged in gladiatorial combat in wheelchairs stole conversations with girls from the town through the irongrate windows attempted to climb down or up the thick rungs of ivy that laced the old brick buildings of the infirmary and its annex the infirmary was connected to the annex by an underground tunnel wide enough for a bedonwheels with a slim nurse on either side of it the bad boys occasionally bowled in the tunnel the sound reaching jenny and garp in their faraway wingas if the test rats and rabbits in the basement laboratory had overnight grown terribly large and were rolling the rubbish barrels deeper underground with their powerful snouts but when garp was fivewhen his mother was made head nursethe steering school community noticed something strange about him what could be exactly different about a fiveyearold boy is not clear but there was a certain sleek dark wet look to his head like the head of a seal and the exaggerated compactness of his body brought back the old speculations about his genes temperamentally the child appeared to resemble his mother determined possibly dull aloof but eternally watchful although he was small for his age he seemed unnaturally mature in other ways he had a discomforting calmness close to the ground like a wellbalanced animal he seemed unusually well coordinated other mothers noted with occasional alarm that the child could climb anything look at jungle gyms swing sets high slides bleacher seats the most dangerous trees garp would be at the top of them one night after supper jenny could not find him garp was free to wander through the infirmary and the annex talking to the boys and jenny normally paged him on the intercom when she wanted him back in the apartment garp home shed say he had his instructions which rooms he was not to visit the contagious cases the boys who felt really rotten and would prefer to be left alone garp liked the athletic injuries best he liked looking at casts and slings and big bandages and he liked listening to the cause of the injury over and over again like his mother perhaps a nurse at heart he was happy to run errands for the patients deliver messages sneak food but one night when he was five garp did not respond to the garp home call the intercom was broadcast through every room of the infirmary and the annex even those rooms garp was under strict orders not to be inthe lab surgery and xray if garp couldnt hear the garp home message jenny knew that he was either in trouble or not in the buildings she quickly organized a search party among the healthier and more mobile patients it was a foggy night in the early spring some boys went outside and called through the damp forsythia and the parking lot others poked through the dark empty nooks and the forbidden equipment rooms jenny indulged her first fears first she checked the laundry chute a slick cylinder that for four floors dropped straight down to the basement garp was not allowed even to put laundry down the chute but beneath where the chute shot through the ceiling and spewed its contents on the basement floor there was only laundry on the cold cement she checked the boiler room and the scalding huge hotwater furnace but garp had not been cooked there she checked the stairwells but garp was instructed not to play on the stairs and he wasnt lying broken at the bottom of any of the four story wells then she started in on her unexpressed fears that little garp would fall victim to a secret sex violator among the steering school boys but in the early spring there were too many boys in the infirmary for jenny to keep track of them allmuch less know them well enough to suspect their sexual tastes there were the fools who went swimming on that first sunny day even before the snow was off the ground there were the last victims of dragon winter colds their various resistances worn down there were the culminating wintersports injuries and the first to be injured in springsports practice one such person was hathaway who jenny heard was buzzing her now from his room on the fourth floor of the annex hathaway was a lacrosse player who had done ligament damage to his knee two days after they put him in a cast and turned him loose on crutches hathaway had gone out in the rain and his crutch tips had slipped at the top of the long marble stairs of hyle hall in the fall he had broken his other leg now hathaway with both his long legs in casts sprawled in his bed on the fourth floor of the infirmary annex a lacrosse stick held fondly in his largeknuckled hands he had been put out of the way almost all by himself on the fourth floor of the annex because of his irritating habit of flinging a lacrosse ball across his room and letting it carom off the wall then he snared the hard bouncy ball in the looping basket on the end of his lacrosse stick and flicked it back against the wall jenny could have put a stop to this but she had a son of her own after all and she recognized the need in boys to devote themselves mindlessly to a repetitious physical act it seemed to relax them jenny had noticedwhether they were five like garp or seventeen like hathaway but it made her furious that hathaway was so clumsy with his lacrosse stick that he was always losing his ball she had gone out of her way to put him where other patients would not complain about the thumping but whenever hathaway lost his ball he buzzed for someone to fetch it for him although there was an elevator the fourth floor of the annex was out of everyones way when jenny saw the elevator was in use she went up the four flights of stairs too quickly and was out of breath as well as angry when she got to hathaways room i know how much your game means to you hathaway jenny said but right now garp is lost and i dont really have time to retrieve your ball hathaway was an everpleasant slowthinking boy with a slack hairless face and a forwardfalling flop of reddishblond hair which partially hid one of his pale eyes he had a habit of tipping his head back perhaps so that he could see out from under his hair and for this reason and the fact that he was tall everyone who looked at hathaway looked up his wide nostrils miss fields he said jenny noticed he was not holding his lacrosse stick what is it hathaway jenny asked im sorry im in a rush but garp is lost im looking for garp oh hathaway said he looked around his room perhaps for garpas if someone had just asked him for an ashtray im sorry hathaway said i wish i could help you look for him he stared helplessly at both his casts jenny rapped lightly on one of his plastered knees as if she were knocking on a door behind which someone might be asleep dont worry please she said she waited for him to tell her what he wanted but hathaway seemed to have forgotten that hed buzzed her hathaway she asked again knocking on his leg to see if anyone was home what did you want did you lose your ball no hathaway said ive lost my stick mechanically they both took a moment to look around hathaways room for the missing lacrosse stick i was asleep he explained and when i woke up it was gone jenny first thought of meckler the menace of the secondfloor annex meckler was a sarcastically brilliant boy who was in the infirmary at least four days out of every month he was a chain smoker at sixteen he edited most of the schools student publications and he had twice won the annual classics cup meckler scorned dininghall food and lived on coffee and friedegg sandwiches from busters snack and grill where he actually wrote most of his long and longoverdue but brilliant term papers collapsing in the infirmary each month to recover from his physical selfabuse and his brilliance mecklers mind turned to hideous pranks that jenny could never quite prove him guilty of once there were boiled polliwogs in the teapot sent down to the lab technicians who complained of the fishiness of the tea once jenny was sure meckler had filled a prophylactic with egg whites and slipped its snug neck over the doorknob to her apartment she knew the filling had been egg whites only because she later found the shells in her purse and it had been meckler jenny was sure who had organized the third floor of the infirmary during the chicken pox epidemic of a few years ago the boys were beating off in turn and rushing with their hot spunk in their hands to the microscopes in the infirmary labto see if they were sterile but mecklers style jenny thought would have been to cut a hole in the netting of the lacrosse stickand to have left the useless stick in the sleeping hathaways hands ill bet garp has it jenny told hathaway when we find garp well find your stick she resisted for the hundredth time the impulse to take her hand and brush back the flop of hair that nearly hid one of hathaways eyes instead she gently squeezed hathaways big toes where they thrust out of his casts if garp was going to play lacrosse jenny thought where would he go not out because its dark hed lose the ball and the only place he might not have heard the intercom was in the underground tunnel between the annex and the infirmarya perfect place for flinging that ball jenny knew it had been done before once jenny had broken up an aftermidnight scrimmage she took the elevator directly to the basement hathaway is a sweet boy she was thinking garp could do worse than grow up to be like that but he could do better too however slowly hathaway was thinking he hoped little garp was all right he sincerely wished he could get up to help find the child garp was a frequent visitor to hathaways room a crippled athlete with two casts was better than average hathaway had allowed garp to draw all over his plastered legs over and through the signatures of friends were the looping crayoned faces and monsters of garps imagination hathaway now looked at the childs drawings on his casts and worried about garp that was why he saw the lacrosse ball between his thighs he had not felt it through the plaster it lay there as if it were hathaways own egg keeping warm how could garp play lacrosse without a ball when he heard the pigeons hathaway knew garp wasnt playing lacrosse the pigeons he remembered he had complained about them to the boy the pigeons kept hathaway awake at night with their damn cooing their cluckish fussing under the eaves and in the rain gutter beneath the steep slate roof that was a problem with the sleeping conditions on the fourth and topmost floor that was a problem for every topfloor sleeper at the steering schoolpigeons seemed to rule the campus the maintenance men had caged off most of the eaves and perches with chicken wire but the pigeons roosted in the rain gutters in dry weather and found niches under the roofs and perches on the old gnarled ivy there was no way to keep them off the buildings and how they could coo hathaway hated them hed told garp that if he had even one good leg he would get them how garp asked they dont like to fly at night hathaway told the boy it was in bio ii that hathaway had learned about the habits of pigeons jenny fields had taken the same course i could get up on the roof hathaway told garp at nightwhen it wasnt rainingand trap them in the rain gutter thats all they do just sit in the rain gutter and coo and crap all night but how would you trap them garp asked and hathaway twirled his lacrosse stick cradling the ball he rolled the ball between his legs he dropped the net of the stick gently over garps little head like that he said with this id get them easywith my lacrosse stick one by one until i got them all hathaway remembered how garp had smiled at himthis big friendly boy with his two heroic casts hathaway looked out the window saw that it was indeed dark and not raining hathaway rang his buzzer garp he cried out oh god he held his thumb on the buzzer button and did not let up when jenny fields saw it was the fourthfloor light that was flashing she could only think that garp had brought hathaways lacrosse equipment back to him what a good boy she thought and rode the elevator up again to the fourth floor she ran squeakily on her good nurses shoes to hathaways room she saw the lacrosse ball in hathaways hand his one eye which was clearly in view looked frightened hes on the roof hathaway told her on the roof jenny said hes trying to capture pigeons with my lacrosse stick hathaway said a fullgrown man if he stood on the fourthfloor fire escape landing could reach over the rim of the rain gutter with his hands when the steering school cleaned its rain gutters only after all the leaves were fallen and before the heavy spring rains only tall men were sent to do the job because the shorter men complained of reaching into the rain gutters and touching things they couldnt seedead pigeons and wellrotted squirrels and unidentifiable glop only the tall men could stand on the fireescape landings and peek into the rain gutters before they reached the gutters were as wide and nearly as deep as pig troughs but they were not as strong and they were old in those days everything at the steering school was old when jenny fields went out the fourthfloor fire door and stood on the fire escape she could barely reach the rain gutter with her fingertips she could not see over the rain gutter to the steep slate roofand in the darkness and fog she could not even see the underside of the rain gutter as far down as either corner of the building she could not see garp at all garp she whispered four stories below among the shrubbery and the occasional glint from the hood or roof of a parked car she could hear some of the boys calling him too garp she whispered a little louder mom he asked startling heralthough his whisper was softer than hers his voice came from somewhere close almost within her reach she thought but she couldnt see him then she saw the netted basket end of the lacrosse stick silhouetted against the foggy moon like the strange webbed paw of some unknown nocturnal animal it jutted out from the rain gutter almost directly above her now when she reached up she was frightened to feel garps leg broken through the corroded gutter which had torn his pants and cut him wedging him there one leg through the gutter up to his hip the other leg sprawled out in the gutter behind him along the edge of the steep slate roof garp lay on his belly in the creaky rain gutter when he had broken through the gutter hed been too scared to cry out he could feel that the whole flimsy trough was rotted through and ready to tear apart his voice he thought could make the roof fall down he lay with his cheek in the gutter and through a tiny rusted hole be watched the boys in the parking lot and bushes four stories below him looking for him the lacrosse stick which had indeed held a surprised pigeon had swung out over the edge of the gutter releasing the bird the pigeon despite being captured and freed had not moved it squatted in the gutter making its small stupid sounds jenny realized that garp could never have reached the rain gutter from the fire escape and she shuddered to think of him climbing up the ivy to the roof with the lacrosse stick in one hand she held his leg very tightly his bare warm calf was slightly sticky with blood but he had not cut himself badly on the rusty gutter a tetanus shot she was thinking the blood was almost dry and jenny did not think he would need stitchesthough in the darkness she could not clearly make out the wound she was trying to think how she could get him down below her the forsythia bushes winked in the light from the downstairs windows from so far away the yellow flowers looked to her like the tips of small gas flames mom garp asked yes she whispered ive got you dont let go he said okay she told him as if triggered by her voice a little more of the gutter gave way mom garp said its okay jenny said she wondered if the best way would be to yank him down hard and hope that she could pull him right through the rotten gutter but then the whole gutter could possibly rip free of the roofand then what she thought she saw them both swept off the fire escape and falling but she knew no one could actually go up on the rain gutter and pull the child out of the hole and then lower him to her over the edge the gutter could barely support a fiveyearold it certainly couldnt support a grownup and jenny knew that she would not let go of garps leg long enough to let someone try it was the new nurse miss creen who saw them from the ground and ran inside to call dean bodger nurse creen was thinking of dean bodgers spotlight fastened to the deans dark car which cruised the campus each night in search of boys out after curfew despite the complaints of the grounds crew bodger drove down the footpaths and over the soft lawns flashing his spotlight into the deep shrubs alongside the buildings making the campus an unsafe place for lurkersor for lovers with no indoor place to go nurse creen also called dr pell because her mind in a crisis always ran to people who were supposed to take charge she did not think of the fire department a thought that was crossing jennys mind but jenny feared they would take too long and the gutter would collapse before they arrived worse she imagined they would insist she let them handle everything and make her let go of garps leg surprised jenny looked up at garps small soggy sneaker which now dangled in the sudden and ghastly glare of dean bodgers spotlight the light was disturbing and confusing the pigeons whose perception of dawn was probably not the best and who appeared almost ready to come to some decision in the rain gutter their cooing and the scrabbling sounds of their claws grew more frantic down on the lawn running around dean bodgers car the boys in their white hospital smocks appeared to have been bedlamized by the experienceor by dean bodgers sharp orders to run here or run there fetch this or fetch that bodger called all the boys men as in lets have a line of mattresses under the fire escape men doublequick he barked bodger had taught german for twenty years at steering before being appointed dean his commands sounded like the rapidfire conjugating of german verbs the men piled mattresses and oogled through the skeletal fire escape at jennys marvelous white uniform in the spotlight one of the boys stood flush to the building well under the fire escape and his view up jennys skirt and her spotlit legs must have dazzled him because be appeared to forget the crisis and he just stood there schwarz dean bodger yelled at him but his name was warner and he did not respond dean bodger had to shove him to make him stop staring more mattresses schmidt bodger told him a piece of the gutter or a particle of leaf stuck in jennys eye and she had to spread her legs wider apart for balance when the gutter gave way the pigeon garp had caught was launched out of the broken end of the trough and forced into brief and frenzied flight jenny gagged at her first thought that the pigeon blurring past her vision was the falling body of her son but she reassured herself with her grip on garps leg she was first knocked into a deep squat and then thrown to one hip on the fireescape landing by the weight of a substantial chunk of the rain gutter that still contained garp only when she realized that they were both safe on the landing and sitting down did jenny let go of garps leg an elaborate bruise in the nearperfect form of her fingerprints would be on his calf for a week from the ground the scene was confusing dean bodger saw a sudden movement of bodies above him he heard the sound of the rain gutter ripping he saw nurse fields fall he saw a threefoot hunk of the rain gutter drop into the darkness but he never saw the child he saw what looked like a pigeon dart into and through the beam of his spotlight but he did not follow the flight of the birdblinded by the light then lost in the night the pigeon struck the iron edge of the fire escape and broke its neck the pigeon wrapped its wings around itself and spiraled straight down like a slightly soft football falling well out of the line of mattresses bodger had ordered for the ultimate emergency bodger saw the bird falling and mistook its small fastmoving body for the child dean bodger was a basically brave and tenacious man the father of four rigorously raised children his devotion to campus police work was not so much motivated by his desire to prevent people from having fun as stemming from his conviction that almost every accident was unnecessary and could with cunning and industry be avoided thus bodger believed he could catch the falling child because in his everanxious heart he was prepared for just such a situation as plucking a plummeting body out of the dark sky the dean was as shorthaired and muscular and curiously proportioned as a pit bull and shared with that breed of dog a similar smallness of the eyes which were always inflamed as redlidded and squinty as a pigs like a pit bull too bodger was good at digging in and lunging forward which he now did his fierce arms outstretched his piggy eyes never leaving the descending pigeon ive got you son bodger cried which terrified the boys in their hospital smocks they were unprepared for anything like this dean bodger on the run dove for the bird which struck his chest with an impact even bodger was not wholly prepared for the pigeon sent the dean reeling rolled him over on his back where he felt the wind socked out of him and he lay gasping the battered bird was hugged in his arms its beak poked bodgers bristly chin one of the frightened boys cranked the spotlight down from the fourth floor and shone the beam directly on the dean when bodger saw that he clutched a pigeon to his breast he threw the dead bird over the heads of the gaping boys and into the parking lot there was much fussing in the admittance room of the infirmary dr pell had arrived and he treated little garps legit was a ragged but superficial wound that needed a lot of trimming and cleaning but no stitches nurse creen gave the boy a tetanus shot while dr pell removed a small rusty particle from jennys eye jenny had strained her back supporting the weight of garp and the rain gutter but was otherwise fine the aura of the admittance room was hearty and jocular except when jenny was able to catch her sons eye in public garp was a kind of heroic survivor but he must have been anxious about how jenny would deal with him back in their apartment dean bodger became one of the few people at the steering school to endear himself to jenny he beckoned her aside and confided to her that if she thought it useful he would be glad to reprimand the boyif jenny thought that coming from bodger it would make a more lasting impression than any reprimand she could deliver jenny was grateful for the offer and she and bodger agreed upon a threat that would impress the boy bodger then brushed the feathers off his chest and tucked in his shirt which was escaping like a cream filling from under his tight vest he announced rather suddenly to the chattering admittance room that he would appreciate a moment alone with young garp there was a hush garp tried to leave with jenny who said no the dean would like to speak to you then they were alone garp didnt know what a dean was your mother runs a tight ship over here doesnt she boy bodger asked garp didnt understand but he nodded she runs things very well if you ask me dean bodger said she should have a son whom she can trust do you know what trust means boy no garp said it means can she believe youll be where you say youll be can she believe youll never do what youre not supposed to do thats trust boy bodger said do you believe your mother can trust you yes garp said do you like living here bodger asked him he knew perfectly well that the boy loved it jenny had suggested that this be the point bodger touch yes garp said what do you hear the boys call me the dean asked mad dog asked garp he had heard the boys in the infirmary call someone mad dog and dean bodger looked like a mad dog to garp but the dean was surprised he had many nicknames but he had never heard that one i meant that the boys call me sir bodger said and was grateful that garp was a sensitive childhe caught the injured tone in the deans voice yes sir garp said and you do like living here the dean repeated yes sir garp said well if you ever go out on that fire escape or anywhere near that roof again bodger said you wont be allowed to live here anymore do you understand yes sir garp said then be a good boy for your mother bodger told him or youll have to move to some place strange and far away garp felt a darkness surround him akin to the darkness and sense of being far away that he must have felt while lying in the rain gutter four stories above where the world was safe he started to cry but bodger took his chin between one stumpish deanly thumb and forefinger he waggled the boys head dont ever disappoint your mother boy bodger told him if you do youll feel as bad as this all your life poor bodger meant well garp wrote i have felt bad most of my life and i did disappoint my mother but bodgers sense of what really happens in the world is as suspect as anyones sense of that garp was referring to the illusion poor bodger embraced in his later life that it had been little garp he caught falling from the annex roof and not a pigeon no doubt in his advancing years the moment of catching the bird had meant as much to the goodhearted bodger as if he had caught garp dean bodgers grasp of reality was often warped upon leaving the infirmary the dean discovered that someone had removed the spotlight from his car he went raging through every patients roomeven the contagious cases that light will one day shine on him who took it bodger claimed but no one came forward jenny was sure it had been meckler but she couldnt prove it dean bodger drove home without his light two days later he came down with someones flu and was treated as an outpatient at the infirmary jenny was especially sympathetic it was another four days before bodger had reason to look in his glove compartment the sneezing dean was out cruising the nighttime campus with a new spotlight mounted on his car when he was halted by a freshly recruited patrolman from campus security for gods sake im the dean bodger told the trembling youth i dont know that for sure sir the patrolman said they told me not to let anyone drive on the footpaths they should have told you not to tangle with dean bodger bodger said they told me that too sir the patrolman said but i dont know that youre dean bodger well said bodger who was secretly very pleased with the young patrolmans humorless devotion to his duty i can certainly prove who i am dean bodger then remembered that his drivers license had expired and he decided to show the patrolman his automobile registration instead when bodger opened the glove compartment there was the deceased pigeon meckler had struck again and again there was no proof the pigeon was not excessively ripe not writhing with maggots yet but dean bodgers glove compartment was infested with lice the pigeon was so dead that the lice were looking for a new home the dean found his automobile registration as quickly as possible but the young patrolman could not take his eyes off the pigeon they told me they were a real problem around here the patrolman said they told me how they got into everything the boys get into everything bodger crooned the pigeons are relatively harmless but the boys bear watching for what seemed to garp like a long and unfair time jenny kept a very close watch on him she really had always watched him closely but she had learned to trust him too now she made garp prove to her that he could be trusted again in a community as small as steering news spread more easily than ringworm the story of how little garp climbed to the roof of the infirmary annex and how his mother didnt know he was there cast suspicion on them bothon garp as a child who could ill influence other children on jenny as a mother who did not look after her son of course garp sensed no discrimination for a while but jenny who was quick to recognize discrimination and quick to anticipate it too felt once again that people were making unfair assumptions her fiveyearold had gotten loose on the roof therefore she never looked after him properly and therefore he was clearly an odd child a boy without a father some said has dangerous mischief forever on his mind its odd garp wrote that the family who would convince me of my own uniqueness was never close to my mothers heart mother was practical she believed in evidence and in results she believed in bodger for example for what a dean did was at least clear she believed in specific jobs teachers of history coaches of wrestlingnurses of course but the family who convinced me of my own uniqueness was never a family my mother respected mother believed that the percy family did nothing jenny fields was not entirely alone in her belief stewart percy although he did have a title did not have a real job he was called the secretary of steering school but no one ever saw him typing in fact he had his own secretary and no one was very sure what she could have to type for a while stewart percy appeared to have some connection with the steering alumni association a body of steering graduates so powerful with wealth and sentimental with nostalgia that they were highly esteemed by the administration of the school but the director of alumni affairs claimed that stewart percy was too unpopular with the young alumni to be of use the young alumni remembered percy from the days when they had been students stewart percy was not popular with students who themselves suspected percy of doing nothing he was a large florid man with the kind of false barrel chest that at any moment can reveal itself to be merely a stomachthe kind of bravely upheld chest that can drop suddenly and forcefully burst open the tweed jacket containing it lifting the regimental striped tie with the steering school colors blood and blue garp always called them stewart percy whom his wife called stewiealthough a generation of steering schoolboys called him paunchhad a flattop head of hair the color of distinguished silver the boys said that stewarts flattop was meant to resemble an aircraft carrier because stewart had been in the navy in world war ii his contribution to the curriculum at steering was a single course he taught for fifteen yearswhich was as long as it took the history department to develop the nerve and necessary disrespect to forbid him to teach it for fifteen years it was an embarrassment to them all only the most unsuspecting freshmen at steering were ever suckered into taking it the course was called my part of the pacific and it concerned only those naval battles of world war ii which stewart percy had personally fought in there had been two there were no texts for the course there were only stewarts lectures and stewarts personal slide collection the slides had been created from old black and white photographsan interestingly blurred process at least one memorable class week of slides concerned stewarts shore leave in hawaii where he met and married his wife midge mind you boys she was not a native he would faithfully tell his class although in the gray slide it was hard to tell what she was she was just visiting there she didnt come from there stewart would say and there would follow an endless number of slides of midges grayblond hair all the percy children were blond too and one suspected they would one day become distinguished silver like stewie whom the steering students of garps day named after a dish served them in the school dininghalls at least once every week fat stew fat stew was made from another of the weekly steering dininghall dishes mystery meat but jenny fields used to say that stewart percy was made entirely of distinguished silver hair and whether they called him paunch or fat stew the boys who took stewart percys my part of the pacific course were supposed to know already that midge was not a hawaiian native though some of them really did have to be told what the smarter boys knew and what every member of the steering community was nearly born knowingand committed thereafter to silent scornwas that stewart percy had married midge steering she was the last steering the unclaimed princess of the steering schoolno headmaster had yet come her way stewart percy married into so much money that he didnt have to be able to do anything except stay married jenny fields father the footwear king used to think of midge steerings money and shake in his shoes midge was such a dingbat jenny fields wrote in her autobiography that she went to hawaii for a vacation during world war ii and she was such a total dingbat jenny wrote that she actually fell in love with stewart percy and she began to have his empty distinguished silver children almost immediatelyeven before the war was over and when the war was over she brought him and her growing family back to the steering school and she told the school to give her stewie a job when i was a boy garp wrote there were already three or four little percys and moreseemingly always moreon the way of midge percys many pregnancies jenny fields made up a nasty rhyme what lies in midge percys belly so round and exceedingly fair in fact it is really nothing but a ball of distinguished silver hair my mother was a bad writer garp wrote referring to jennys autobiography but she was an even worse poet when garp was five however he was too young to be told such poems and what made jenny fields so unkind concerning stewart and midge jenny knew that fat stew looked down on her but jenny said nothing she was just wary of the situation garp was a playmate of the percy children who were not allowed to visit garp in the infirmary annex our house is really better for children midge told jenny once on the phone i meanshe laughedi dont think theres anything they can catch except a little stupidity jenny thought but all she said was i know whos contagious and who isnt and nobody plays on the roof to be fair jenny knew that the percy house which had been the steering family house was a comforting house to children it was carpeted and spacious and full of generations of tasteful toys it was rich and because it was cared for by servants it was also casual jenny resented the casualness that the percy family could afford jenny thought that neither midge nor stewie had the brains to worry about their children as much as they should they also had so many children maybe when you have a lot of children jenny pondered you arent so anxious about each of them jenny was actually worried for her garp when he was off playing with the percy children jenny had grown up in an upperclass home too and she knew perfectly well that upperclass children were not magically protected from danger just because they were somehow born safer with hardier metabolisms and charmed genes around the steering school however there were many who seemed to believe thisbecause superficially it often looked true there was something special about the aristocratic children of those families their hair seemed to stay in place their skin did not break out perhaps they did not appear to be under any stress because there was nothing they wanted jenny thought but then she wondered how shed escaped being like them her concern for garp was truly based on her specific observations of the percys the children ran free as if their own mother believed them to be charmed almost albinolike almost translucentskinned the percy kids really did seem more magical if not actually healthier than other children and despite the feeling most faculty families had toward fat stew they felt that the percy children and even midge had obvious class strong protective genes were at work they thought my mother garp wrote was at war with people who took genes this seriously and one day jenny watched her small dark garp go running across the infirmary lawn off toward the more elegant faculty houses white and greenshuttered where the percy house sat like the oldest church in a town full of churches jenny watched this tribe of children running across the safe charted footpaths of the schoolgarp the fleetest a string of clumsy flopping percys was in pursuit of himand the other children who ran with this mob there was clarence dugard whose father taught french and smelled as if he never washed he never opened a window all winter there was talbot mayer jones whose father knew more about all of americas history than stewart percy knew about his small part of the pacific there was emily hamilton who had eight brothers and would graduate from an inferior allgirls school just a year before steering would vote to admit women her mother would commit suicide not necessarily as a result of this vote but simultaneously with its announcement causing stewart percy to remark that this was what would come of admitting girls to steering more suicide and there were the grove brothers ira and buddy from the town their father was with the maintenance department of the school and it was a delicate casewhether the boys should even be encouraged to attend steering and how well it could be expected they would do down through the quadrangles of bright green grass and fresh tar paths boxed in by buildings of a brick so worn and soft it resembled pink marble jenny watched the children run with them she was sorry to note ran the percy family dogto jennys mind a mindless oaf of an animal who for years would defy the town leash law the way the percys would flaunt their casualness the dog a giant newfoundland had grown from a puppy who spilled garbage cans and the witless thief of baseballs to being mean one day when the kids had been playing the dog had mangled a volleyballnot an act of viciousness usually a mere bumble but when the boy who owned the deflated ball had tried to remove it from the great dogs mouth the dog bit himdeep puncture wounds in the forearm not the type of bite a nurse knew that was only an accident a case of bonkers getting a little excited because he loves playing with the children so much or so said midge percy who had named the dog bonkers she told jenny that shed gotten the dog shortly after the birth of her fourth child the word bonkers meant a little crazy she told jenny and thats how midge said she still felt about stewie after their first four children together i was just bonkers about him midge said to jenny so i named the poor dog bonkers to prove my feelings for stew midge percy was bonkers all right wrote jenny fields that dog was a killer protected by one of the many thin and senseless bits of logic that the upper classes in america are famous for namely that the children and pets of the aristocracy couldnt possibly be too free or hurt anybody that other people should not overpopulate the world or be allowed to release their dogs but that the dogs and children of rich people have a right to run free the curs of the upper class garp would call them alwaysboth the dogs and the children he would have agreed with his mother that the percys dog bonkers the newfoundland retriever was dangerous a newfoundland is a breed of oilycoated dog resembling an allblack saint bernard with webbed feet they are generally slothful and friendly but on the percys lawn bonkers broke up a touch football game by hurling his one hundred and seventy pounds on fiveyearold garps back and biting off the childs left earlobeand part of the rest of garps ear as well bonkers would probably have taken all the ear but he was a dog notably lacking concentration the other children fled in all directions bonkie bit someone said a younger percy pulling midge away from the phone it was a percy family habit to put a y or an ie at the end of almost every family members name thus the childrenstewart jr randolph william cushman a girl and bainbridge another girlwere called within the family stewie two dopey shrill willy cushie and pooh poor bainbridge whose name did not convert easily to a y or an ie ending was also the last in the family to be in diapers thus in a cute attempt to be both descriptive and literary she was pooh it was cushie at midges arm telling her mother that bonkie bit someone whod he get this time said fat stew he seized a squash racket as if he were going to take charge of the matter but he was completely undressed it was midge who drew her dressing gown together and prepared to be the first grownup to run outside to inspect the damage stewart percy was frequently undressed at home no one knows why perhaps it was to relieve himself of the strain of how very dressed he was when he strolled the steering campus with nothing to do distinguished silver on display and perhaps it was out of necessity for all the procreation he was responsible for he must have been frequently undressed at home bonkie bit garp said little cushie percy neither stewart nor midge noticed that garp was there in the doorway the whole side of his head bloody and chewed mrs percy garp whispered not loud enough to be heard so it was garp fat stew said bending to return the squash racket to the closet he farted midge looked at him so bonkie bit garp stewart mused well at least the dogs got good taste doesnt he oh stewie midge said a laughter light as spit escaped her garps still just a little boy and there he was in fact neartofainting and bleeding on the costly hall carpet which actually spread without a tuck or a ripple through four of the monstrous firstfloor rooms cushie percy whose young life would terminate in childbirth while she tried to deliver what would have been only her first child saw garp bleeding on the steering family heirloom the remarkable rug oh gross she cried running out the door oh ill have to call your mother midge told garp who felt dizzy with the great dogs growl and slobber still singing in his partial ear for years garp would mistakenly interpret cushie percys outcry of oh gross he thought she was not referring to his gnawed and messy ear but to her fathers great gray nakedness which filled the hall that was what was gross to garp the silver barrelbellied navy man approaching him in the nude from the well of the percys towering spiral staircase stewart percy knelt down in front of garp and peered curiously into the boys bloody face fat stew did not appear to be directing his attention to the mauled ear and garp wondered if he should advise the enormous naked man concerning the whereabouts of his injury but stewart percy was not looking for where garp was hurt he was looking at garps shining brown eyes at their color and at their shape and he seemed to convince himself of something because he nodded austerely and said to his foolish blond midge jap it would be years before garp would fully comprehend this too but stewie percy said to midge i spent enough time in the pacific to recognize jap eyes when i see them i told you it was a jap the it stewart percy referred to was whoever he had decided was garps father that was a frequent speculative game around the steering community guessing who garps father was and stewart percy from his experience in his part of the pacific had decided that garps father was japanese at that moment garp wrote i thought jap was a word that meant my ear was all gone no sense in calling his mother stewie said to midge just take him over to the infirmary shes a nurse isnt she shell know what to do jenny knew all right why not bring the dog over here she asked midge while she gingerly washed around what was left of garps little ear bonkers midge asked bring him here jenny said and ill give him a shot an injection midge asked she laughed do you mean theres actually a shot to make him so he wont bite any more people no jenny said i mean you could save your moneyinstead of taking him to a vet i mean theres a shot to make him dead that kind of an injection then he wont bite any more people thus garp wrote was the percy war begun for my mother i think it was a class war which she later said all wars were for me i just knew to watch out for bonkers and for the rest of the percys stewart percy sent jenny fields a memo on the stationery of the secretary of the steering school i cannot believe you actually want us to have bonkers put to sleep stewart wrote you bet your fat ass i do jenny said to him on the phone or at least tie him up forever theres no point in having a dog if the dog cant run free stewart said then kill him jenny said bonkers has had all his shots thank you just the same stewart said hes a gentle dog really only if hes provoked obviously garp wrote fat stew felt that bonkers had been provoked by my japness whats good taste mean little garp asked jenny at the infirmary dr pell sewed up his ear jenny reminded the doctor that garp had recently had a tetanus shot good taste jenny asked the oddlooking amputation of the ear forced garp always to wear his hair long a style he often complained about fat stew said that bonkers has got good taste garp said to bite you jenny asked i guess so garp said whats it mean jenny knew all right but she said it means that bonkers must have known you were the besttasting kid in the whole pile of kids am i garp asked sure jenny said how did bonkers know garp asked i dont know jenny said whats jap mean garp asked did fat stew say that to you jenny asked him no garp said i think he said it about my ear oh yes your ear jenny said it means you have special ears but she was wondering whether to tell him what she felt about the percys now or whether he was enough like her to profit at some later more important time from the experience of anger perhaps she thought i should save this morsel for him for a time when he could use it in her mind jenny fields saw always more and larger battles ahead my mother seemed to need an enemy garp wrote real or imagined my mothers enemy helped her see the way she should behave and how she should instruct me she was no natural at motherhood in fact i think my mother doubted that anything happened naturally she was selfconscious and deliberate to the end it was the world according to fat stew that became jennys enemy in those early years for garp that phase might be called getting garp ready for steering she watched his hair grow and cover the missing parts of his ear she was surprised at his handsomeness because handsomeness had not been a factor in her relationship with technical sergeant garp if the sergeant had been handsome jenny fields hadnt really noticed but young garp was handsome she could see though he remained smallas if he were born to fit in the ball turret installation the band of children who coursed the steering footpaths and grassy quadrangles and playing fields grew more awkward and selfconscious as jenny watched them grow clarence dugard soon needed glasses which he was always smashing over the years jenny would treat him many times for ear infections and once for a broken nose talbot mayerjones developed a lisp he had a bottleshaped body though a lovely disposition and lowgrade chronic sinusitis emily hamilton grew so tall that her knees and elbows were forever raw and bleeding from all her stumbling falls and the way her small breasts asserted themselves made jenny winceoccasionally wishing she had a daughter ira and buddy grove from the town were thick in the ankles and wrists and necks their fingers smudged and mashed from messing around in their fathers maintenance department and up grew the percy children blond and metallically clean their eyes the color of the dull ice on the brackish steering river that seeped through the salt marshes to the nearby sea stewart jr who was called stewie two graduated from steering before garp was even of age to enter the school jenny treated stewie two twice for a sprained ankle and once for gonorrhea he later went through harvard business school a staph infection and a divorce randolph percy was called dopey until his dying day of a heart attack when he was only thirtyfive he was a procreator after his fat fathers heart himself the father of five dopey never managed to graduate from steering but successfully transferred to some other prep school and graduated after a while once midge cried out in the sunday dining room our dopeys dead his nickname sounded so awful in that context that the family after his death finally spoke of him as randolph william percy shrill willy was embarrassed by his stupid nickname to his credit and although he was three years older than garp he befriended garp in a very decent fashion while he was an upperclassman at steering and garp was just starting out jenny always liked william whom she called william she treated him many times for bronchitis and was moved enough by the news of his death in a war immediately following his graduation from yale that she even wrote a long letter of commiseration to midge and fat stew as for the percy girls cushie would get hers and garp would even get to play a small part they were near the same age and poor bainbridge the youngest percy who was cursed to be called pooh would be spared her encounter with garp until garp was in his prime all these children and her garp jenny watched grow while jenny waited for garp to get ready for steering the black beast bonkers grew very old and slowerbut not toothless jenny noticed and always garp watched out for him even after bonkers stopped running with the crowd when he lurked hulking by the percys white front pillarsas matted and tangled and nasty as a thorn bush in the darkgarp still kept his eye on him an occasional younger child or someone new in the neighborhood would get too close and be chomped jenny kept track of the stitches and missing bits of flesh for which the great slathering dog was accountable but fat stew endured all jennys criticisms and bonkers lived i believe my mother grew fond of that animals presence although she would never have admitted it garp wrote bonkers was the percy enemy come alivemade into muscle and fur and halitosis it must have pleased my mother to watch the old dog slowing down while i was growing up by the time garp was ready for steering black bonkers was fourteen years old by the time garp entered the steering school jenny fields had a few distinguished silver hairs of her own by the time garp started steering jenny had taken all the courses that were worth taking and had listed them in order of universal value and entertainment by the time garp was a steering student jenny fields had been awarded the traditional gift for faculty and staff enduring fifteen years of service the famous steering dinner plates the stern brick buildings of the school including the infirmary annex were baked into the bigeating surfaces of the plates vividly rendered in the steering school colors good old blood and blue what he wanted to be when he grew up in the widow and children of everett steering founded steering academy as it was first called because everett steering had announced to his family while carving his last christmas goose that his only disappointment with his town was that he had not provided his boys with an academy capable of preparing them for a higher education he did not mention his girls he was a shipbuilder in a village whose lifelink to the sea was a doomed river everett knew the river was doomed he was a smart man and not usually playful but after christmas dinner he indulged in a snowball fight with both his boys and his girls he died of apoplexy before nightfall everett steering was seventytwo even his boys and his girls were too old for snowball fights but he had a right to call the town of steering his town it had been named after him in a glut of enthusiasm for the towns independence following the revolutionary war everett steering had organized the installation of mounted cannons at strategic points along the river shore these cannons were meant to discourage an attack that never camefrom the british who were expected to sail up the river from the sea at great bay the river was called great river then but after the war it was called the steering river and the town which had no proper namebut had always been called the meadows because it lay in the salt and freshwater marshes only a few miles inland from great baywas also called steering many families in steering were dependent on shipbuilding or on other business that came up the river from the sea since it was first called the meadows the village had been a backup port to great bay but along with his wishes to found a boys academy everett steering told his family that steering would not be a port for very long the river he noticed was choking with silt in all his life everett steering was known to tell only one joke and only to his family the joke was that the only river to have been named after him was full of mud and it was getting fuller by the minute the land was all marsh and meadow from steering to the sea and unless people decided that steering was worth maintaining as a port and gouged a deeper channel for the river everett knew that even a rowboat would eventually have trouble making it from steering to great bay unless there was a very high tide everett knew that the tide would one day fill in the riverbed from his home town to the atlantic in the next century the steering family was wise to stake its lifesupport system on the textile mills they constructed to span the waterfall on the freshwater part of the steering river by the time of the civil war the only business in the town of steering on the steering river was the steering mills the family got out of boats and into textiles when the time was ripe another shipbuilding family in steering was not so lucky this familys last ship made it only half the way from steering to the sea in a oncenotorious part of the river called the gut the last ship made in steering settled into the mud forever and for years it could be seen from the road half out of the water at high tide and completely dry at low tide kids played in it until it listed to its side and crushed someones dog a pig farmer named gilmore salvaged the ships masts to raise his barn and by the time young garp attended steering the varsity crew could row their shells on the river only at high tide at low tide the steering river is one wet mudflat from steering to the sea it was therefore due to everett steerings instincts about water that a boys academy was founded in after a century or so it flourished over all those years garp wrote the shrewd steering genes must have suffered some dilution the family instincts regarding water went from good to very bad garp enjoyed referring to midge steering percy in this way a steering whose water instincts had run their course he said garp thought it wonderfully ironic that the steering genes for water sense ran out of chromosomes when they got to midge her sense of water was so perverse garp wrote that it attracted her first to hawaii and then to the united states navyin the form of fat stew midge steering percy was the end of the bloodline the steering school itself would become the last steering after her and perhaps old everett foresaw that too many families have left less or worse behind in garps day at least the steering school was still relentless and definite in its purpose the preparing of young men for a higher education and in garps case he had a mother who also took that purpose seriously garp himself took the school so seriously that even everett steering with his one joke in a lifetime would have been pleased garp knew what to take for courses and whom to have for teachers that is often the difference between doing well or poorly in a school he was not really a gifted student but he had direction many of his courses were still fresh in jennys mind and she was a good drillmaster garp was probably no more of a natural at intellectual pursuits than his mother but he had jennys powerful discipline a nurse is a natural at establishing a routine and garp believed in his mother if jenny was remiss in her advice it was in only one area she had never paid any attention to the sports at steering she could offer garp no suggestions as to what games he might like to play she could tell him that he would like east asian civilization with mr merrill more than he would like tudor england with mr langdell but for example jenny did not know the differences in pleasure and pain between football and soccer she had observed only that her son was small strong well balanced quick and solitary she assumed he already knew what games he liked to play he did not crew he thought was stupid rowing a boat in unison a galley slave dipping your oar in foul water and the steering river was indeed foul the river was afloat with factory scum and human turdsand always the aftertide saltwater slime was on the mudflats a muck the texture of refrigerated bacon fat everett steerings river was full of more than mud but even if it had been sparkling clean garp was no oarsman and no tennis player either in one of his earliest essayshis freshman year at steeringgarp wrote i do not care for balls the ball stands between the athlete and his exercise so do hockey pucks and badminton birdiesand skates like skis intrude between the body and the ground and when one further removes ones body from the contest by an extension devicesuch as a racket a bat or a stickall purity of movement strength and focus is lost even at fifteen one could sense his instinct for a personal aesthetic since he was too small for football and soccer certainly involved a ball he ran long distance which was called crosscountry but he stepped in too many puddles and suffered all fall from a perpetual cold when the winter sports season opened jenny was distressed at how much restlessness her son exhibited she criticized him for making too much of a mere athletic decisionwhy didnt he know what form of exercise he might prefer but sports did not feel like recreation to garp nothing felt like recreation to garp from the beginning he appeared to believe there was something strenuous to achieve writers do not read for fun garp would write later speaking for himself even before young garp knew he was going to be a writer or knew what he wanted to be it appears he did nothing for fun garp was confined to the infirmary on the day he was supposed to sign up for a winter sport jenny would not let him get out of bed you dont know what you want to sign up for anyway she told him all garp could do was cough this is silly beyond mortal belief jenny told him fifteen years in this snotty rude community and you fall to pieces trying to decide what game youre going to play to occupy your afternoons i havent found my sport mom garp croaked ive got to have a sport why jenny asked i dont know he moaned he coughed and coughed god listen to you jenny complained ill find you a sport she said ill go over to the gym and sign you up for something no garp begged and jenny pronounced what was for garp in his four years at steering her litany i know more than you do dont i she said garp fell back on his sweaty pillow not about this mom he said you took all the courses but you never played on any of the teams if jenny fields recognized this as a rare oversight she did not admit it it was a typical steering december day the ground glassy with frozen slush and the snow gray and muddy from the boots of eight hundred boys jenny fields bundled up and trudged across the wintergrim campus like the convinced and determined mother she was she looked like a nurse resigned to bring what slim hope she could to the bitter russian front in such a manner jenny fields approached the steering gym in her fifteen years at steering jenny had never been there she had not known it was important at the far end of the steering campus ringed by the acres of playing fields the hockey rinks the tennis courts like the cross section of a huge human hive jenny saw the giant gymnasium loom out of the dirty snow like a battle she had not anticipated and her heart filled with worry and with gloom the seabrook gymnasium and field houseand the seabrook stadium and the seabrook ice hockey rinkswere named after the superb athlete and world war i flying ace miles seabrook whose face and massive torso greeted jenny in a triptych of photographs enshrined in the display case in the gyms vast entranceway miles seabrook his head in a leather football helmet his shoulder pads probably unnecessary beneath the photo of old no was the neardemolished jersey itself faded and frequently under the attack of moths the jersey lay in a heap in the locked trophy case under the first third of miles seabrooks triptych photograph a sign said his actual shirt the center shot in the triptych showed miles seabrook as a hockey goaliein those old days the goalies wore pads but the brave face was naked the eyes clear and challenging the scar tissue everywhere miles seabrooks bulk filled the dwarfed net how could anyone have scored on miles seabrook his catquick and bearsized leather paws his clublike stick and swollen chest protector his skates like the long claws of a giant anteater beneath the football and the hockey pictures were the scores of the annual big games in every steering sport the season ended in the traditional contest with bath academy nearly as old and famous as steering and every steering schoolboys hated rival the vile bath boys in their gold and green in garps day these colors were called puke and babyshit steering bath steering bath nobody scored on miles captain miles seabrook as he was called in the third photo in the triptych stared back at jenny fields in a uniform all too familiar to her it was a flyboys suit she saw in an instant although the costumes changed between world wars they did not change so much that jenny failed to recognize the reecelined collar of the flight jacket turned up at a cocky angle and the confident untied chin strap of the flight cap the tipped up earmuffs miles seabrooks ears could never get cold and the goggles pushed carelessly up off the forehead at his throat the pure white scarf no score was cited beneath this portrait but if anyone in the steering athletic department had possessed a sense of humor jenny might have read united states germany sixteen was the number of planes miles seabrook shot down before the germans scored on him ribbons and medals lay dusty in the locked trophy case like offerings at an altar to miles seabrook there was a battered wooden thing which jenny mistook for part of miles seabrooks shotdown plane she was prepared for any tastelessness but the wood was only all that remained of his last hockey stick why not his jock thought jenny fields or like a keepsake of a dead baby a lock of his hair which was in all three photos covered by a helmet or a cap or a big striped sock perhaps jenny thoughtwith characteristic scornmiles seabrook was hairless jenny resented the implications lying honored in that dusty case the warriorathlete merely undergoing an other change of uniform each time the body was offered only a pretense of protection as a steering school nurse jenny had seen fifteen years of football and hockey injuries in spite of helmets masks straps buckles hinges and pads and sergeant garp and the others had shown jenny that men at war had the most illusory protection of all wearily jenny moved on when she passed the display cases she felt she was moving toward the engine of a dangerous machine she avoided the arenasized spaces in the gymnasium where she could hear the shouts and grunts of contest she sought the dark corridors where she supposed the offices were have i spent fifteen years she thought to lose my child to this she recognized a part of the smell disinfectant years of strenuous scrubbing no doubt that a gym was a place where germs of monstrous potential lay waiting for a chance to breed that part of the smell reminded her of hospitals and of the steering infirmarybottled postoperative air but here in the huge house built to the memory of miles seabrook there was another smell as distasteful to jenny fields as the smell of sex the complex of gym and field house had been erected in less than a year before she was born what jenny smelled was almost forty years of the forced farts and the sweat of boys under stress and strain what jenny smelled was competition fierce and full of disappointment she was such an outsider it had never been part of her growing up in a corridor that seemed separated from the central areas of the gyms various energies jenny stood still and listened somewhere near her was a weightlifting room she heard the iron bashing and the terrible heaves of hernias in progressa nurses view of such exertion in fact it seemed to jenny that the whole building groaned and pushed as if every schoolboy at steering suffered constipation and sought relievement in the horrid gym jenny fields felt undone the way only a person who has been careful can feel when confronted by a mistake the bleeding wrestler was at that instant upon her jenny was not sure how the groggy dripping boy had surprised her but a door opened off this corridor of small innocuousappearing rooms and the matted face of the wrestler was smack in front of her with his ear guards pulled so askew on his head that the chin strap had slipped to his mouth where it tugged his upper lip into a fishlike sneer the little bowl of the strap which had once cupped his chin now brimmed with blood from his streaming nose as a nurse jenny was not over impressed with blood but she cringed at her anticipated collision with the thick wet hardlooking boy who somehow dodged her lunging sideways with admirable trajectory and volume he vomited on his fellow wrestler who was struggling to support him excuse me he burbled for most of the boys at steering were well brought up his fellow wrestler did him the favor of pulling his head gear off so that the hapless puker would not choke or strangle quite unmindful of his own bespattering he called loudly back into the open door of the wrestling room carlisle didnt make it from the door of that room whose heat beckoned jenny in the way a tropical greenhouse might be alluring in midwinter a mans clear tenor voice responded carlisle you had two helpings of that dininghall slop for lunch carlisle one helping and you deserve to lose it no sympathy carlisle carlisle for whom there was no sympathy continued his lurching progress down the corridor he bled and barfed his way to a door through which he made his smeared escape his fellow wrestler who in jennys opinion had also withheld his sympathy dropped carlisles headgear in the corridor with the rest of carlisles muck then he followed carlisle to the lockers jenny hoped that he was going somewhere to change his clothes she looked at the wrestling rooms open door she breathed deeply and stepped inside immediately she felt offbalance underfoot was a soft fleshy feel and the wall sank under her touch when she leaned against it she was inside a padded cell the floor and the wall mats warm and yielding the air so stifling hot and stenchfull of sweat that she hardly dared to breathe shut the door said the mans tenor voicebecause wrestlers jenny would later know love the heat and their own sweat especially when theyre cutting weight and they thrive when the walls and floors are as hot and giving as the buttocks of sleeping girls jenny shut the door even the door had a mat on it and she slumped against it imagining someone might open the door from the outside and mercifully release her the man with the tenor voice was the coach and jenny through the shimmering heat watched him pace against the long rooms wall unable to stand still while he squinted at his struggling wrestlers thirty seconds he screamed to them the couples on the mat bucked as if they were electrically stimulated the batches of twosomes around the wrestling room were each locked in some violent tangle the intent of each wrestler in jennys eye as deliberate and as desperate as rape fifteen seconds the coach screamed push it the twisted pair nearest jenny suddenly came apart their limbs unknotting the veins on their arms and necks popping a breathless cry and a string of saliva broke from one boys mouth as his opponent broke free of him and they uncoupled bashing into the padded wall times up the coach screamed he did not use a whistle the wrestlers went suddenly limp untying each other from each other with great slowness a half dozen of them now lumbered toward jenny at the door they had the water fountain and fresh air on their minds though jenny assumed they were all heading for the hall in order to throw up or bleed in peaceor both jenny and the coach were the only standing bodies left in the wrestling room jenny observed that the coach was a neat small man as compact as a spring she also observed he was nearly blind because the coach now squinted in her direction recognizing that her whiteness and her shape were foreign to the wrestling room he began to grope for his glasses which he usually stashed above the wall mats at about head levelwhere they would not be so easily crushed by a wrestler who was flung upon them jenny observed that the coach was about her age and that she had never seen him on or about the steering campus beforewith or without his glasses the coach was new at steering his name was ernie holm and so far he had found the steering community to be just as snotty as jenny had found it ernie holm had been a twotime big ten wrestling champion at the university of iowa but he had never won a national title and he had coached in high schools all over iowa for fifteen years while trying to raise his only child a daughter all by himself he was bonetired of the midwest as he would have said it himself and he had come east to assure his daughter of a classy educationas he would also have said it she was the brains of the family he was fond of sayingand she had her mothers fine looks which he never mentioned helen holm at fifteen had spent a lifetime of threehour afternoons sitting in wrestling rooms from iowa to steering watching boys of many sizes sweat and throw each other around helen would remark years later that spending her childhood as the only girl in a wrestling room had made her a reader i was brought up to be a spectator helen said i was raised to be a voyeur she was such a good and nonstop reader in fact that ernie holm had moved east just for her he took the job at steering for helens sake because he had read in his contract that the children of the faculty and staff could attend the steering school for freeor they could receive a comparable sum of money toward their tuition at another private school ernie holm was a bad reader himself he had somehow overlooked the fact that steering admitted only boys he found himself moving into the chilly steering community in the fall with his brainy daughter once more enrolled in a small bad public school in fact the public school in the town of steering was probably worse than most public schools because the smart boys in the town went to steering and the smart girls went away ernie holm hadnt figured hed have to send his daughter away from himthat had been why hed moved to stay with her so while ernie holm was getting used to his new duties at steering helen holm wandered the fringes of the great school devouring its bookstore and its library hearing stories no doubt of the communitys other great reader jenny fields and helen continued to be bored as she had been bored in iowa by her boring classmates in her boring public school ernie holm was sensitive to people who were bored he had married a nurse sixteen years earlier when helen had been born the nurse gave up her nursing to be a fulltime mother after six months she wanted to be a nurse again but there were no daycare centers in iowa in those years and ernie holms new wife grew gradually more distant under the strain of being a fulltime mother and an exnurse one day she left him she left him with a fulltime daughter and no explanation so helen holm grew up in wrestling rooms which are very safe for childrenbeing padded everywhere and always warm books had kept helen from being bored although ernie holm worried how long his daughters studiousness could continue to be nourished in a vacuum ernie was sure that the genes for being bored were in his daughter thus he came to steering thus helen who also wore glassesas needfully as her fatherwas with him that day jenny fields walked into the wrestling room jenny didnt notice helen few people noticed helen when helen was fifteen helen however noticed jenny right away helen was unlike her father in that she didnt wrestle with the boys or demonstrate moves and holds and so she kept her glasses on helen holm was forever on the lookout for nurses because she was forever on the lookout for her disappeared mother whom ernie had made no attempt to find with women ernie holm had some experience at taking no for an answer but when helen had been small ernie had indulged her with a speculative fable he no doubt liked to imagine himselfit was a story that had always intrigued helen too one day went the story you might see a pretty nurse sort of looking like she doesnt know where she is anymore and she might look at you like she doesnt know who you are eitherbut she might look curious to find out and that will be my mom helen used to ask her father and that will be your mom ernie used to say so when helen holm looked up from her book in the steering wrestling room she thought she saw her mother jenny fields in her white uniform was forever appearing out of place there on the crimson mats of the steering school she looked dark and healthy strongboned and handsome if not exactly pretty and helen hohn must have thought that no other woman would have ventured into this softfloored inferno where her father worked helens glasses fogged she closed her book in her anonymous gray sweat suit which hid her gawky fifteenyearold frameher hard hips and her small breastsshe stood up awkwardly against the wrestlingroom wall and waited for her fathers sign of recognition but ernie holm was still groping for his glasses in a blur he saw the white figurevaguely womanly perhaps a nurseand his heart paused at the possibility he had never really believed in his wifes return her saying oh how ive missed you and our daughter what other nurse would enter his place of employment helen saw her fathers fumbling she took this to be the necessary sign she stepped toward jenny across the bloodwarm mats and jenny thought my god thats a girl a pretty girl with glasses whats a pretty girl doing in a place like this mom the girl said to jenny its me mom its helen she said bursting into tears she flung her slim arms around jennys shoulders and pressed her wet face to jennys throat jesus christ said jenny fields who was never a woman who liked to be touched still she was a nurse and she must have felt helens need she did not shove the girl away from her though she knew very well she was not helens mother jenny fields thought that having been a mother once was enough she coolly patted the weeping girls back and looked imploringly at the wrestling coach who had just found his glasses im not your mother either jenny said politely to him because he was looking at her with the same brief relief in his face that jenny had seen in the face of the pretty girl what ernie holm thought was that the resemblance went deeper than the uniform and the coincidence of a wrestling room in two nurses lives but jenny stopped short of being as pretty as ernies runaway wife and ernie was reflecting that even fifteen years would not have made his wife as plain and merely handsome as jenny still jenny looked all right to ernie holm who smiled an unclear apologetic smile that his wrestlers were familiar with when they lost my daughter thought you were her mother ernie holm said to jenny she hasnt seen her mother in quite a while obviously thought jenny fields she felt the girl tense and spring out of her arms thats not your mom darlin ernie holm said to helen who retreated to the wrestlingroom wall she was a toughminded girl not at all in the habit of emotionally displaying herselfnot even to her father and did you think i was your wife jenny asked ernie because it had looked to her for a moment that ernie had mistaken her too she wondered how long a while mrs holm had been missing you fooled me for a minute ernie said politely he had a shy grin which be used sparingly helen crouched in a corner of the wrestling room fiercely eyeing jenny as if jenny were deliberately responsible for her embarrassment jenny felt moved by the girl it had been years since garp had hugged her like that and it was a feeling that even a very selective mother like jenny remembered missing whats your name she asked helen my name is jenny fields it was a name helen holm knew of course she was the other mystery reader around the steering school also helen had not previously given to anyone the feelings she reserved for a mother even though it had been an accident that shed flung those feelings around jenny helen found it hard to call them back entirely she had her fathers shy smile and she looked thankfully at jenny oddly helen felt she would like to hug jenny again but she restrained herself there were wrestlers shuffling back into the room gasping from the drinking fountain where those who were cutting weight had only rinsed their mouths no more practice ernie holm told them waving them out of the room thats it for today go run your laps obediently even relieved they bobbed in the doorway of the crimson room they picked up their headgear their rubber sweat suits their spools of tape ernie holm waited for the room to clear while his daughter and jenny fields waited for him to explain at the very least an explanation was in order he felt and there was nowhere ernie felt as comfortable as he felt in a wrestling room for him it was the natural place to tell someone a story even a difficult story with no endingand even to a stranger so when his wrestlers had left to run their laps ernie very patiently began his fatheranddaughter tale the brief history of the nurse who left them and of the midwest they only recently had left it was a story jenny could appreciate of course because jenny did not know an other single parent with a single child and although she may have felt tempted to tell them her storythere being interesting similarities and differencesjenny merely repeated her standard version the father of garp was a soldier and so forth and who takes the time for weddings when there is a war though it was not the whole story it clearly appealed to helen and ernie who had met no one else in the steering community as receptive and frank as jenny there in the warm red wrestling room on the soft mats surrounded by those padded wallsin such an environment sudden and inexplicable closeness is possible of course helen would remember that first hug her whole life however her feelings for jenny might change and change back from that moment in the wrestling room jenny fields was more of a mother to helen than helen had ever had jenny would also remember how it felt to be hugged like a mother and would even note in her autobiography how a daughters hug was different from a sons it is at least ironic that her one experience for making such a pronouncement occurred that december day in the giant gymnasium erected to the memory of miles seabrook it is unfortunate if ernie holm felt any desire toward jenny fields and if he imagined even briefly that here might be another woman with whom he might live his life because jenny fields was given to no such feelings she thought only that ernie was a nice good manperhaps she hoped he would be her friend if he would be he would be her first and it must have perplexed ernie and helen when jenny asked if she could stay a moment in the wrestling room just by herself what for they must have wondered ernie then remembered to ask her why she had come to sign my son up for wrestling jenny said quickly she hoped garp would approve well sure ernie said and youll turn out the lights and the heaters when you leave the door locks itself thus alone jenny turned off the lights and heard the great blow heaters hum down to stillness there in the dark room the door ajar she took off her shoes and she paced the mat despite the apparent violence of this sport she was thinking why do i feel so safe here is it him she wondered but ernie passed quickly through her mindsimply a small neat muscular man with glasses if jenny thought of men at all and she never really did she thought they were more tolerable when they were small and neat and she preferred men and women to have musclesto be strong she enjoyed people with glasses the way only someone who doesnt need to wear glasses can enjoy glasses on other peoplecan find them nice but mostly it is this room she thoughtthe red wrestling room huge but contained padded against pain she imagined she dropped thud to her knees just to hear the way the mats received her she did a somersault and split her dress then she sat on the mat and looked at the heavy boy who loomed in the doorway of the blackened room it was carlisle the wrestler whod lost his lunch he had changed his equipment and come back for more punishment and he peered across the dark crimson mats at the glowing white nurse who crouched like a shebear in her cave excuse me maam he said i was just looking for someone to work out with well dont look at me jenny said go run your laps yes maam carlisle said and he trotted off when she closed the door and it locked behind her she realized shed left her shoes inside a janitor did not seem able to find the right key but he lent her a large boys basketball shoes that had turned up in lost and found jenny trudged across the frozen slush to the infirmary feeling that her first trip to the world of sports had left her more than a little changed in the annex in his bed garp still coughed and coughed wrestling he croaked good god mother are you trying to get me killed i think youll like the coach jenny said i met him and hes a nice man i met his daughter too oh jesus garp groaned his daughter wrestles no she reads a lot jenny said approvingly sounds exciting mom garp said you realize that setting me up with the wrestling coachs daughter may cost me my neck do you want that but jenny was innocent of such a scheme she really had only been thinking about the wrestling room and ernie holm her feelings for helen were entirely motherly and when her crude young son suggested the possibility of matchmakingof his taking an interest in young helen holmjenny was rather alarmed she had not previously thought of the possibility of her sons being interested in anyone in that wayat least shed thought he wouldnt be interested for a long time it was very disquieting to her and she could only say to him youre only fifteenyears old remember that well how old is the daughter garp asked and whats her name helen jenny answered shes only fifteen too and she wears glasses she added hypocritically after all she knew what she thought of glasses maybe garp liked them too theyre from iowa she added and felt she was being a more terrible snob than those hated dandies who thrived in the steering school community god wrestling garp groaned again and jenny felt relieved that he had passed on from the subject of helen jenny was embarrassed at herself for how much she clearly objected to the possibility the girl is pretty she thoughtthough not in an obvious way and dont young boys like only obvious girls and would i prefer it if garp were interested in one of those as for those kind of girls jenny had her eye on cushie percya little too saucy with her mouth a little too slack about her appearance and should a fifteenyearold of cushman percys breeding be so developed already then jenny hated herself for even thinking of the word breeding it had been a confusing day for her she fell asleep for once untroubled by her sons coughing because it seemed that more serious troubles might lie ahead for him just when i was thinking we were home free jenny thought she must discuss boys with someoneernie holm maybe she hoped shed been right about him she was right about the wrestling room it turned outand what intense comfort it gave to her garp the boy liked ernie too in that first wrestling season at steering garp worked hard and happily at learning his moves and his holds though he was soundly trounced by the varsity boys in his weight class he never complained he knew he had found his sport and his pastime it would take the best of his energy until the writing came along he loved the singleness of the combat and the frightening confines of that circle inscribed on the mat the terrific conditioning the mental constancy of keeping his weight down and in that first season at steering jenny was relieved to note garp hardly mentioned helen holm who sat in her glasses in her gray sweat suit reading she occasionally looked up when there was an unusually loud slam on the mat or a cry of pain it had been helen who returned jennys shoes to the infirmary annex and jenny embarrassed herself by not even asking the girl to come in for a moment they had seemed so close but garp had been in jenny did not want to introduce them and besidesgarp had a cold one day in the wrestling room garp sat beside helen he was conscious of a pimple on his neck and how much he was sweating her glasses looked so fogged garp doubted she could see what she was reading you sure read a lot he said to her not as much as your mother helen said not looking at him two months later garp said to helen maybe youll wreck your eyes reading in a hot place like this shelooked at him her glasses very clear this time and magnifying her eyes in a way that startled him ive already got wrecked eyes she said i was born with ruined eyes but to garp they looked like very nice eyes so nice in fact that he could think of nothing further to say to her then the wrestling season was over garp got a junior varsity letter and signed up for track and field events his listless choice for a spring sport his condition from the wrestling season was good enough so that he ran the mile he was the thirdbest miler on the steering team but he would never get any better at the end of a mile garp felt he was just getting started a novelist even thenthough i didnt know it garp would write years later he also threw the javelin but not far the javelin throwers at steering practiced behind the football stadium where they spent much of their time spearing frogs the upper freshwater reaches of the steering river ran behind seabrook stadium many javelins were lost there and many frogs were slain spring is no good thought garp who was restless who missed wrestling if he couldnt have wrestling at least let the summer come he thought and he would run longdistance on the road to the beach at dogs head harbor one day in the top row of empty seabrook stadium he saw helen holm alone with a book he climbed up the stadium stairs to her clicking his javelin against the cement so that she wouldnt be startled by seeing him so suddenly beside her she wasnt startled she had been watching him and the other javelin throwers for weeks killed enough little animals for today helen asked him hunting something else from the very beginning garp wrote helen knew how to get the words in with all the reading you do i think youre going to be a writer garp told helen he was trying to be casual but he guiltily hid the point of his javelin with his foot no chance helen said she had no doubt about it well maybe youll marry a writer garp said to her she looked up at him her face very serious her new prescription sunglasses better suited to her wide cheekbones than her last pair that always slid down her nose if i marry anybody ill marry a writer helen said but i doubt ill marry anybody garp had been trying to joke helens seriousness made him nervous he said well im sure you wont marry a wrestler you can be very sure helen said perhaps young garp could not conceal his pain because helen added unless its a wrestler whos also a writer but a writer first and foremost garp guessed yes a real writer helen said mysteriouslybut ready to define what she meant by that garp didnt dare ask her he let her go back to her book it was a long walk down the stadium stairs dragging his javelin behind him will she ever wear anything but that gray sweat suit he wondered garp wrote later that he first discovered he had an imagination while trying to imagine helen holms body with her always in that damn sweat suit he wrote i had to imagine her body there was no other way to see it garp imagined that helen had a very good bodyand nowhere in his writing does he say he was disappointed when he finally saw the real thing it was that afternoon in the empty stadium with frog gore on the point of his javelin when helen holm provoked his imagination and t s garp decided he was going to be a writer a real writer as helen had said graduation t s garp wrote a short story every month he was at steering from the end of his freshman year until his graduation but it wasnt until his junior year that he showed anything he wrote to helen after her first year as a spectator at steering helen was sent to talbot academy for girls and garp saw her only on occasional weekends she would sometimes attend the home wrestling meets it was after one such match that garp saw her and asked her to wait for him until hed showered he had something in his locker he wanted to give her oh boy helen said your old elbow pads she didnt come to the wrestling room anymore even if she was home from talbot on a long vacation she wore dark green knee socks and a gray flannel skirt with pleats often her sweater always a dark and solid color matched her knee socks and always her long dark hair was up twirled in a braid on top of her head or complexly pinned she had a wide mouth with very thin lips and she never wore lipstick garp knew that she always smelled nice but he never touched her he did not imagine that anyone did she was as slender and nearly as tall as a young treeshe was taller than garp by two inches or moreand she had sharp almost painfullooking bones in her face although her eyes behind her glasses were always soft and large and a rich honeybrown your old wrestling shoes helen asked him inquiring of the largesized lumpy envelope that was sealed its something to read garp said ive got plenty to read helen said its something i wrote garp told her oh boy helen said you dont have to read it now garp told her you can take it back to school and write me a letter ive got plenty to write helen said ive got papers due all the time then we can talk about it later garp said are you going to be here for easter yes but i have a date helen said oh boy said garp but when be reached to take back his story the knuckles of her long hand were very white and she would not let go of the package in the pound class his junior year garp finished the season with a wonlost record of losing only in the finals of the new england championships in his senior year he would win everythingcaptain the team be voted most valuable wrestler and take the new england title his team would represent the beginning of an almost twentyyear dominance of new england wrestling by ernie holms steering teams in this part of the country ernie had what he called an iowa advantage when ernie was gone steering wrestling would go downhill and perhaps because garp was the first of many steering stars he was always special to ernie holm helen couldnt have cared less she was glad when her fathers wrestlers won because that made her father happy but in garps senior year when he captained the steering team helen never attended a single match she did return his story thoughin the mail from talbot with this letter dear garp this story shows promise although i do think at this point you are more of a wrestler than a writer there is a care taken with the language and a feeling for people but the situation seems rather contrived and the ending of this story is pretty juvenile i do appreciate you showing it to me though yours helen there would be other rejection letters in garps writing career of course but none would mean as much to him as this one helen had actually been kind the story garp gave her was about two young lovers who are murdered in a cemetery by the girls father who thinks they are grave robbers after this unfortunate error the lovers are buried side by side for some completely unknown reason their graves are promptly robbed it is not certain what becomes of the fathernot to mention the grave robber jenny told garp that his first efforts at writing were rather unreal but garp was encouraged by his english teacherthe closest thing steering had to a writerinresidence a frail man with a stutter whose name was tinch he had very bad breath remindful to garp of the dog breath of bonkersa closed room of dead geraniums but what tinch said though odorous was kind he applauded garps imagination and he taught garp once and for all good old grammar and a love of exact language tinch was called stench by the steering boys of garps day and messages were constantly left for him about his halitosis mouthwash deposited on his desk toothbrushes in the campus mail it was after one such messagea package of spearmint breath fresheners taped to the map of literary englandthat tinch asked his composition class if they thought he had bad breath the class sat as still as moss but tinch singled out young garp his favorite his most trusted and he asked him directly would you say garp that my bbbreath was bad truth moved in and out of the open windows on this spring day of garps senior year garp was known for his humorless honesty his wrestling his english composition his other grades were indifferent to poor from an early age garp later claimed he sought perfection and did not spread himself thin his test scores for general aptitude showed that he wasnt very apt at anything he was no natural this came as no surprise to garp who shared with his mother a belief that nothing came naturally but when a reviewer after garps second novel called garp a born writer garp had a fit of mischief he sent a copy of the review to the testing people in princeton new jersey with a note suggesting that they doublecheck their previous ratings then he sent a copy of his test scores to the reviewer with a note that said thank you very much but i wasnt born anything in garps opinion he was no more a born writer than he was a born nurse or a born ball turret gunner gggarp stuttered mr tinch bending close to the boywho smelled the terrible truth in senior honors english composition garp knew he would win the annual creative writing prize the sole judge was always tinch and if he could just pass thirdyear math which he was taking for the second time he would respectably graduate and make his mother very happy do i have bbbad breath garp tinch asked good and bad are matters of opinion sir garp said in your opinion gggarp tinch said in my opinion garp said without batting an eye youve got the best breath of any teacher at this school and he looked hard across the classroom at benny potter from new yorka born wiseass even garp would agreeand he stared bennys grin off bennys face because garps eyes said to benny that garp would break bennys neck if he made a peep and tinch said thank you garp who won the writing prize despite the note submitted with his last paper mr tinch i lied in class because i didnt want those other assholes to laugh at you you should know however that your breath is really pretty bad sorry t s garp you know wwwhat tinch asked garp when they were alone together talking about garps last story what garp said theres nothing i can dddo about my breath tinch said i think its because im dddying he said with a twinkle im rrrotting from the inside out but garp was not amused and he watched for news of tinch for years after his graduation relieved that the old gentleman did not appear to have anything terminal tinch would die in the steering quadrangle one winter night of causes wholly unrelated to his bad breath he was coming home from a faculty party where it was admitted that hed possibly had too much to drink and he slipped on the ice and knocked himself unconscious on the frozen footpath the night watchman did not find the body until almost dawn by which time tinch had frozen to death it is unfortunate that wiseass benny potter was the first to tell garp the news garp ran into potter in new york where potter worked for a magazine garps low opinion of potter was enhanced by garps low opinion of magazines and by garps belief that potter always envied garp for garps more significant output as a writer potter is one of those wretches who has a dozen novels hidden in his drawers garp wrote but he wouldnt dare show them to anybody in garps steering years however garp was also not outgoing at showing his work around only jenny and tinch got to see his progressand there was the one story he gave helen holm garp decided he wouldnt give helen another story until he wrote one that was so good she wouldnt be able to say anything bad about it did you hear benny potter asked garp in new york what garp said old stench kicked off benny said he fffroze to death what did you say garp said old stench potter said garp had never liked that nickname he got drunk and went wobbling home through the quadfell down and cracked his noggin and never woke up in the morning you asshole garp said its the truth garp benny said it was fucking fifteenbelow although he added dangerously id have thought that old furnace of a mouth of his would have kept him wwwarm they were in the bar of a nice hotel somewhere in the fifties somewhere between park avenue and third garp never knew where he was when he was in new york he was meeting someone else for lunch and had run into potter who had brought him here garp picked potter up by his armpits and sat him on the bar you little gnat potter garp said you never liked me benny said garp tipped benny potter backward on the bar so that the pockets of potters open suit jacket were dipped into the bar sink leave me alone benny said you were always old stenchs favorite asswipe garp shoved benny so that bennys rump slouched into the bar sink the sink was full of soaking glasses and the water sloshed up on the bar please dont sit on the bar sir the bartender said to benny jesus christ im being assaulted you moron benny said garp was already leaving and the bartender had to pull benny potter out of the sink and set him down off the bar that son of a bitch my ass is all wet benny cried would you please watch your language here sir the bartender said my fucking wallet is soaked benny said wringing out the seat of his pants and holding up his sodden wallet to the bartender garp benny hollered but garp was gone you always had a lousy sense of humor garp it is fair to say especially in garps steering days that he was at least rather humorless about his wrestling and his writinghis favorite pastime and his wouldbe career how do you know youre going to be a writer cushie percy asked him once it was garps senior year and they were walking out of town along the steering river to a place cushie said she knew she was home for the weekend from dibbs the dibbs school was the fifth prep school for girls that cushie percy had attended shed started out at talbot in helens class but cushie had disciplinary problems and shed been asked to leave the disciplinary problems had repeated themselves at three other schools among the boys at steering the dibbs school was famousand popularfor its girls with disciplinary problems it was high tide on the steering river and garp watched an eightoared shell glide out on the water a sea gull followed it cushie percy took garps hand cushie had many complicated ways of testing a boys affection for her many of the steering boys were willing to handle cushie when they were alone with her but most of them did not like to be seen demonstrating any affection for her garp cushie noticed didnt care he held her hand firmly of course they had grown up together but she did not think they were very good or close friends at least cushie thought if garp wanted what the others wanted he was not embarrassed to be seen pursuing it cushie liked him for this i thought you were going to be a wrestler cushie said to garp i am a wrestler garp said im going to be a writer and youre going to marry helen holm cushie teased him maybe garp said his hand went a little limp in hers cushie knew this was another humorless topic with himhelen holmand she should be careful a group of steering boys came up the river path toward them they passed and one of them called back what are you getting into garp cushie squeezed his hand dont let them bother you she said they dont bother me garp said what are you going to write about cushie asked him i dont know garp said he didnt even know if he was going to college some schools in the midwest had been interested in his wrestling and ernie holm had written some letters two places had asked to see him and garp had visited them in their wrestling rooms he had not felt so much outclassed as he had felt outwanted the college wrestlers seemed to want to beat him more than he wanted to beat them but one school had made him a cautious offera little money and no promises beyond the first year fair enough considering he was from new england but ernie had told him this already its a different sport out there kid i mean youve got the abilityand if i do say so myself youve had the coaching what you havent had is the competition and youve got to be hungry for it garp youve got to really be interested you know and when he asked tinch about where he should go to school for his writing tinch had appeared at a typical loss some gggood school i guess he said but if youre going to wwwrite tinch said wont you dddo it anywhere you have a nice body cushie percy whispered to garp and he squeezed her hand back so do you he told her honestly she had in fact an absurd body small but wholly bloomed a compact blossom her name garp thought should not have been cushman but cushionand since their childhood together he had sometimes called her that hey cushion want to take a walk she said she knew a place where are you taking me garp asked her ha she said youre taking me im just showing you the way and the place she said they went off the path by the part of the steering river that long ago was called the gut a ship had been mired there once but there was no visible evidence only the shore betrayed a history it was at this narrow bend that everett steering had imagined obliterating the britishand here were everetts cannons three huge iron tubes rusting into the concrete mountings once they had swiveled of course but the laterday town fathers had fixed them forever in place beside them was a permanent cluster of cannon balls grown together in cement the balls were greenish and red with rust as if they belonged to a vessel long undersea and the concrete platform where the cannons were mounted was now littered with youthful trashbeer cans and broken glass the grassy slope leading down to the still and almost empty river was trampled as if nibbled by sheepbut garp knew it was merely pounded by countless steering schoolboys and their dates cushies choice of a place to go was not very original though it was like her garp thought garp liked cushie and william percy had always treated garp well garp had been too young to know stewie two and dopey was dopey young pooh was a strange scary child garp thought but cushies touching brainlessness was straight from her mother midge steering percy garp felt dishonest with cushie for not mentioning what he took to be the utter assholery of her father fat stew havent you ever been here before cushie asked garp maybe with my mother garp said but its been a while of course he knew what the cannons were the pet phrase at steering was getting banged at the cannonsas in i got banged at the cannons last weekend or you should have seen old fenley blasting away at the cannons even the cannons themselves bore these informal inscriptions paul banged betty and m overton shot his wad here across the languid river garp watched the golfers from the steering country club even far away their ridiculous clothing looked unnatural against the green fairway and beyond the marsh grass that grew down to the mudflats their madras prints and plaids among the greenbrown graybrown shoreline made them look like cautious and outofplace land animals following their hopping white dots across a lake jesus golf is silly garp said his thesis of games with balls and clubs again cushie had heard it before and wasnt interested she settled down in a soft placethe river below them bushes around them and over their shoulders the yawning mouths of the great cannons garp looked up into the mouth of the nearest cannon and was startled to see the head of a smashed doll one glassy eye on him cushie unbuttoned his shirt and lightly bit his nipples i like you she said i like you cushion he said does it spoil it cushie asked him us being old friends oh no he said he hoped they would hurry ahead to it because it had never happened to garp before and he was counting on cushie for her experience they kissed wetly in the wellpounded grass cushie was an openmouthed kisser artfully jamming her hard little teeth into his honest even at this age garp tried to mumble to her that he thought her father was an idiot of course he is cushie agreed your mothers a little strange too dont you think well yes garp supposed she was but i like her anyway he said most faithful of sons even then oh i like her too cushie said thus having said what was necessary cushie undressed garp undressed but she asked him suddenly come on where is it garp panicked where was what hed thought she was holding it wheres your thing cushie demanded tugging what garp thought was his thing what garp said oh wow didnt you bring any cushie asked him garp wondered what he was supposed to have brought what he said oh garp cushie said dont you have any rubbers he looked apologetically at her he was only a boy whod lived his whole life with his mother and the only rubber hed seen had been slipped over the doorknob of their apartment in the infirmary annex probably by a fiendish boy named mecklerlong since graduated and gone on to destroy himself still he should have known garp had heard much conversation of rubbers of course come here cushie said she led him to the cannons youve never done this have you she asked him he shook his head honest to his sheepish core oh garp she said if you werent such an old friend she smiled at him but he knew she wouldnt let him do it now she pointed into the mouth of the middle cannon look she said he looked a jewellike sparkle of ground glass like pebbles he imagined might make up a tropical beach and something else not so pleasant rubbers cushle told him the cannon was crammed with old condoms hundreds of prophylactics a display of arrested reproduction like dogs urinating around the borders of their territory the boys of the steering school had left their messes in the mouth of the mammoth cannon guarding the steering river the modern world had left its stain upon another historical landmark cushie was getting dressed you dont know anything she teased him so what are you going to write about he had suspected this would pose a problem for a few yearsa kink in his career plans he was about to get dressed but she made him lie down so that she could look at him you are beautiful she said and its all right she kissed him i can go get some rubbers he said it wouldnt take long would it and we could come back my train leaves at five cushie said but she smiled sympathetically i didnt think you had to be back at any special time garp said well even dibbs has some rules you know cushie said she sounded hurt by her schools lax reputation and besides she said you see helen i know you do dont you not like this he admitted garp you shouldnt tell anybody everything cushie said it was a problem with his writing too mr tinch had told him youre too serious all the time cushie said because for once she was in a position where she could lecture him on the river below them an eightoared shell sleeked through the narrow channel of water remaining in the gut and rowed toward the steering boathouse before the tide went out and left them without enough water to get home on then garp and cushie saw the golfer he had come down through the marsh grass on the other side of the river with his violet madras slacks rolled up above his knees he waded into the mud flats where the tide had already receded ahead of him on the wetter mud flats lay his golf ball perhaps six feet from the edge of the remaining water gingerly the golfer stepped forward but the mud now rose above his calf using his golf club for balance he dipped the shiny head into the muck and swore harry come back someone called to him it was his golfing partner a man dressed with equal vividness kneelength shorts of a green that no grass ever was and yellow knee socks the golfer called harry grimly stepped closer to his ball he looked like a rare aquatic bird pursuing its egg in an oil slick harry youre going to sink in that shit his friend warned him it was then that garp recognized harrys partner the man in green and yellow was cushies father fat stew its a new ball harry yelled then his left leg disappeared up to the hip trying to turn back harry lost his balance and sat down quickly he was mired to his waist his frantic face very red above his powderblue shirtbluer than any sky he waved his club but it slipped out of his hand and sailed into the mud inches from his ball impossibly white and forever out of harrys reach help harry screamed but on all fours he was able to move a few feet toward fat stew and the safety of shore it feels like eels he cried he moved forward on the trunk of his body using his arms the way a seal on land will use its flippers an awful slorping noise pursued him through the mud flats as if beneath the mud some mouth was gasping to suck him in garp and cushie stifled their laughter in the bushes harry made his last lunge for shore stewart percy trying to help stepped on the mud flats with just one foot and promptly lost a golf shoe and a yellow sock to the suction ssshhh and lie still cushie demanded they both noticed garp was erect oh thats too bad cushie whispered looking sadly at his erection but when he tried to tug her down in the grass with him she said i dont want babies garp not even yours and yours might be a jap baby you know cushie said and i surely dont want one of those what garp said it was one thing not to know about rubbers but whats this about jap babies he wondered ssshhh cushie whispered im going to give you something to write about the furious golfers were already slashing their way through the marsh grass back to the immaculate fairway when cushies mouth nipped the edge of garps tight belly button garp was never sure if his actual memory was jolted by that word jap and if at that moment he truly recalled bleeding in the percys houselittle cushie telling her parents that bonkie bit garp and the scrutiny the child garp had undergone in front of the naked fat stew it may have been then that garp remembered fat stew saying he had jap eyes and a view of his personal history clicked into perspective regardless at this moment garp resolved to ask his mother for more details than she had offered him up to now he felt the need to know more than that his father had been a soldier and so forth but he also felt cushie percys soft lips on his belly and when she took him suddenly into her warm mouth he was very surprised and his sense of resolve was as quickly blown as the rest of him there under the triple barrels of the steering family cannons t s garp was first treated to sex in this relatively safe and nonreproductive manner of course from cushies point of view it was nonreciprocal too they walked back along the steering river holding hands i want to see you next weekend garp told her he resolved he would not forget the rubbers i know you really love helen cushie said she probably hated helen holm if she really knew her at all helen was such a snob about her brains i still want to see you garp said youre nice cushie told him squeezing his hand and youre my oldest friend but they both must have known that you can know someone all your life and never quite be friends who told you my father was japanese garp asked her i dont know cushie said i dont know if he really is either i dont either garp admitted i dont know why you dont ask your mother cushie said but of course he had asked and jenny was absolutely unwavering from her first and only version when garp phoned cushie at dibbs she said wow its you my father just called and told me i was not to see you or write to you or talk to you or even read your lettersas if you wrote any i think some golfer saw us leaving the cannons she thought it was very funny but garp only saw that his future at the cannons had slipped from him ill be home that weekend you graduate cushie told him but garp wondered if he bought the condoms now would they still be usable for graduation could rubbers go bad in how many weeks and should you keep them in the refrigerator there was no one to ask garp thought of asking ernie holm but he was already fearful that helen would hear of his being with cushie percy and although he had no real relationship with helen that he could be unfaithful to garp did have his imagination and his plans he wrote helen a long confessional letter about his lust as he called itand how it did not compare to his higher feelings for her as he referred to them helen replied promptly that she didnt know why he was telling her all this but that in her opinion he wrote about it very well it was better writing than the story hed shown her for example and she hoped he would continue to show her his writing she added that her opinion of cushie percy from what little she knew of the girl was that she was rather stupid but pleasant helen wrote and if garp was given to this lust as he called it wasnt he fortunate to have someone like cushie around garp wrote back that he would not show her another story until he wrote one that was good enough for her he also discussed his feelings for not going to college first he thought the only reason to go to college was to wrestle and he wasnt sure he cared enough about it to wrestle at that level he saw no point in simply continuing to wrestle at some small college where the sport wasnt emphasized its only worth doing garp wrote to helen if im going to try to be the best he thought that trying to be the best at wrestling was not what he wanted also he knew it was not likely he could be the best and whoever heard of going to college to be the best at writing and where did he get this idea of wanting to be the best helen wrote him that he should go to europe and garp discussed this idea with jenny to his surprise jenny had never thought he would go to college she did not accept that this was what prep schools were for if the steering school is supposed to give everyone such a firstrate education jenny said what on earth do you need more education for i mean if youve been paying attention now youre educated right garp didnt feel educated but he said he supposed he was he thought he had been paying attention as for europe jenny was interested well id certainly like to try that she said it beats staying here it was then that garp realized his mother meant to stay with him ill find out the best place for a writer to go in europe jenny said to him i was thinking of writing something myself garp felt so awful he went to bed when he got up he wrote helen that he was doomed to be followed by his mother the rest of his life how can i write he wrote to helen with my mom looking over my sboulder helen had no answers for that one she said she would mention the problem to her father and maybe ernie would give jenny some advice ernie holm liked jenny he occasionally took her to a movie jenny had even become something of a wrestling fan and although there couldnt have been anything more than friendship between them ernie was very sensitive to the unwed mother storyhe had heard and accepted jennys version as all he needed to know and he defended jenny rather fiercely to those in the steering community who suggested they were curious to know more but jenny took her advice on cultural matters from tinch she asked him where a boy and his mother could go in europewhich was the most artistic climate the best place to write mr tinch had last been to europe in he had stayed only for the summer he had gone to england first where there were several living tinches his british ancestry but his old family frightened him by asking him for moneythey asked for so much and so rudely that tinch quickly fled to the continent but people were rude to him in france and loud to him in germany he had a nervous stomach and was afraid of italian cooking so tinch had gone to austria in vienna tinch told jenny i found the real europe it was cccontemplative and artistic tinch said you could sense the sadness and the gggrandness a year later world war i began in the spanish grippe would kill many of the viennese who had survived the war the flu would kill old klimt and it would kill young schiele and schieles young wife forty percent of the remaining male population would not survive world war ii the vienna that tinch would send jenny and garp to was a city whose life was over its tiredness could still be mistaken for a cccontemplative nature but vienna was hardput to show much gggrandness anymore among the halftruths of tinch jenny and garp would still sense the sadness and any place can be artistic garp later wrote if theres an artist working there vienna garp said to jenny he said it in the way he had said wrestling to her over three years ago lying on his sickbed and doubtful of her ability to pick out a sport for him but he remembered she had been right then and he knew nothing about europe and very little about any place else garp had taken three years of german at steering so there was some help and jenny who was not good with languages had read a book about the strange bedfellows of austrian history maria theresa and fascism from empire to anschluss was the name of the book garp had seen it in the bathroom for years but now no one could find it perhaps it was lost to the whirlpool bath the last person i saw with it was ulfelder jenny told garp ulfelder graduated three years ago mom garp reminded her when jenny told dean bodger that she would be leaving bodger said that steering would miss her and would always be glad to have her back jenny did not want to be impolite but she mumbled that one could be a nurse almost anywhere she supposed she did not know of course that she would never be a nurse again bodger was puzzled by garps not going to college in the deans opinion garp had not been a disciplinary problem at steering since he had survived the roof of the infirmary annex at the age of five and bodgers fondness for the role he played in that rescue had always given him a fondness for garp also dean bodger was a wrestling fan and one of jennys few admirers but bodger accepted that the boy seemed convinced by the writing business as bodger called it jenny did not tell bodger of course that she planned to do some writing of her own this part of the plan made garp the most uncomfortable but be did not even say a word of it to helen everything was happening very fast and garp could express his apprehension only to his wrestling coach ernie holm your mom knows what shes doing im sure ernie told him you just be sure about you even old tinch was full of optimism for the plan its a little ecececcentric tinch told garp but many good ideas are years later garp would recall that tinchs endearing stutter was like a message to tinch from tinchs body garp wrote that tinchs body was trying to tell tinch that he was going to fffreeze to death one day jenny was saying that they would leave shortly after graduation but garp had hoped to stay around steering for the summer what on earth for jenny asked him for helen he wanted to tell her but he had no stories good enough for helen he had already said so there was nothing to do but go away and write them and he could never expect jenny to stay another summer in steering so that he could keep his appointment at the cannons with cushie percy perhaps that was not meant to be still he was hopeful that he could connect with cushie on graduation weekend for garps graduation it rained the rain washed over the soggy steering campus in sheets the storm sewers bogged and the outofstate cars plowed through the streets like yachts in a squall the women looked helpless in their summer dresses the loading of station wagons was hurried and miserable a great crimson tent was erected in front of the miles seabrook gymnasium and field house and the diplomas were handed out in this stale circus air the speeches were lost in the rain beating the crimson canvas overhead nobody stayed around the big boats left town helen had not come because talbot had its graduation the following weekend and she was still taking exams cushie percy had been in attendance at the disappointing ceremony garp was sure but he had not seen her he knew she would be with her ridiculous family and garp was wise to keep a safe distance from fat stewan outraged father was still a father after all even if cushman percys honor had long ago been lost when the lateaftemoon sun came out it hardly mattered steering was steamy and the groundfrom seabrook stadium to the cannonswould be sodden for days garp imagined the deep ruts of water that he knew would be coursing through the soft grass at the cannons even the steering river would be swollen the cannons themselves would be overflowing the barrels were tilted up and they filled with water every time it rained in such weather the cannons dribbled streams of broken glass and left slick puddles of old condoms on the stained concrete there would be no enticing cushie to the cannons this weekend garp knew but the threepack of prophylactics crackled in his pocket like a tiny dry fire of hope look said jenny i bought some beer go ahead and get drunk if you want to jesus mom garp said but he drank a few with her they sat by themselves on his graduation night the infirmary empty beside them and every bed in the annex was empty and stripped of linen tooexcept for the beds they would sleep in garp drank the beer and wondered if everything was an anticlimax he reassured himself by thinking of the few good stories he had read but though he had a steering education he was no readerno match for helen or jenny for example garps way with a story was to find one he liked and read it again and again it would spoil him for reading any other story for a long while when he was at steering he read joseph conrads the secret sharer thirtyfour times he also read d h lawrences the man who loved islands twentyone times he felt ready to read it again now outside the windows of the tiny apartment in the infirmary annex the steering campus lay dark and wet and deserted well look at it this way jenny said she could see he was feeling let down it took you only four years to graduate from steering but ive been going to this damn school for eighteen she was not much of a drinker jenny half the way through her second beer she fell asleep garp carried her into her bedroom she had already taken off her shoes and garp removed only her nurses pinso that she wouldnt roll over and stick herself with it it was a warm night so he didnt cover her he drank another beer and then took a walk of course he knew where he was going the percy family houseoriginally the steering family housesat on its damp lawn not far from the infirmary annex only one light was on in stewart percys house and garp knew whose light it was little pooh percy now fourteen could not sleep with her light out cushie had also told garp that bainbridge was still inclined to wear a diaperperhaps garp thought because her family still insisted on calling her pooh well cushie said i dont see whats wrong with it she doesnt use the diapers you know i mean shes housebroken and all that pooh just likes to wear diapersoccasionally garp stood on the misty grass beneath pooh percys window and tried to remember which room was cushies since he couldnt remember he decided to wake up pooh she was sure to recognize him and she was sure to tell cushie but pooh came to her window like a ghost she did not immediately appear to recognize garp who clung tenaciously to the ivy outside her window bainbridge percy had eyes like a deer paralyzed in a cars headlights about to be hit for christs sake pooh its me garp whispered to her you want cushie dont you pooh asked him sullenly yes garp grunted then the ivy tore and he fell into the hedges below cushie who slept in her bathing suit helped extricate him wow youre going to wake up the whole house she said have you been drinking ive been falling garp said irritably your sister is really weird its wet outside all over cushie said to him where can we go garp had thought of that in the infirmary he knew were sixty empty beds but garp and cushie were not even past the percy porch when bonkers confronted them the black beast was already out of breath from descending the porch stairs and his irongray muzzle was flecked with froth his breath reached garp like old sod flung in his face bonkers was growling but even his growl had slowed down tell him to beat it garp whispered to cushie hes deaf cushie said hes very old i know how old he is garp said bonkers barked a creaky and sharp sound like the hinge of an unused door being forced open he was thinner but he easily weighed one hundred and forty pounds a victim of ear mites and mange old dog bite and barbed wire bonkers sniffed his enemy and held garp cornered against the porch go away bonkie cushie hissed garp tried to sidestep the dog and noticed how slowly bonkers reacted hes halfblind garp whispered and his nose doesnt smell much anymore cushie said he ought to be dead garp whispered to himself but he tried to step around the dog dimly bonkers followed his mouth still reminded garp of a steam shovels power and the loose flap of muscle on his black and shaggy chest indicated to garp how hard the dog could lungebut long ago just ignore him cushie suggested just as bonkers lunged the dog was slow enough so that garp could spin behind him he pulled the dogs forepaws from under him and dropped his own weight from his chest on the dogs back bonkers buckled forward he slid into the ground nose firsthis hind legs still clawing garp now controlled the crumpled forepaws but the great dogs head was held down only by the weight of garps chest a terrifying snarling developed as garp bore down on the animals spine and drove his chin into the dogs dense neck in the scuffle an ear appearedin garps mouthand garp bit it he bit as hard as he could and bonkers howled he bit bonkers ear in memory of his own missing flesh he bit him for the four years hed spent at steeringand for his mothers eighteen years it was only when lights came on in the percy house that garp let old bonkers go run cushie suggested garp grabbed her hand and she came with him a vile taste was in his mouth wow did you have to bite him cushie asked he bit me garp reminded her i remember cushie said she squeezed his hand and he led her where he wanted to go what the hell is going on here they heard stewart percy yelling its bonkie its bonkie pooh percy called into the night bonkers called fat stew here bonkers here bonkers and they all heard the deaf dogs resounding caterwaul it was a commotion capable of carrying across an empty campus it woke jenny fields who peered out her window in the infirmary annex fortunately for garp he saw her turn on a light he made cushie hide behind him in a corridor of the unoccupied annex while he sought jennys medical advice what happened to you jenny asked him garp wanted to know if the blood running down his chin was his own or entirely bonkers at the kitchen table jenny washed away a black scablike thing that was stuck to garp it fell off garps throat and landed on the tableit was the size of a silver dollar they both stared at it what is it jenny asked an ear garp said or part of one on the white enamel table lay the black leathery remnant of an ear curling slightly at the edges and cracked like an old dry glove i ran into bonkers garp said an ear for an ear said jenny fields there was not a mark on garp the blood belonged solely to bonkers when jenny went back to her bedroom garp snuck cushie into the tunnel that led to the main infirmary for eighteen years he had learned the way he took her to the wing farthest from his mothers apartment in the annex it was over the main admittance room near the rooms for surgery and anesthesia thus sex for garp would forever be associated with certain smells and sensations the experience would remain secretive but relaxed a final reward in harrowing times the odor would stay in his mind as deeply personal and yet vaguely hospital the surroundings would forever seem to be deserted sex for garp would remain in his mind as a solitary act committed in an abandoned universesometime after it had rained it was always an act of terrific optimism cushie of course evoked for garp many images of cannons when the third condom of the threepack was exhausted she asked if that was all he hadif hed bought only one package a wrestler loves nothing so much as hardearned exhaustion garp fell asleep to cushie complaining the first time you dont have any she was saying and now you ran out it is lucky were such old friends it was still dark and far from dawn when stewart percy woke them fat stews voice violated the old infirmary like an unnamable disease open up they heard him hollering and they crept to the window to see on the green green lawn in his bathrobe and slippersand with bonkers leashed beside himcushies father bleated at the windows of the infirmary annex it was not long before jenny appeared in the light are you ill she asked stewart i want my daughter stewart yelled are you drunk jenny asked you let me in stewart screamed the doctor is out said jenny fields and i doubt there is anything i can treat you for bitch stewart bellowed your bastard son has seduced my daughter i know theyre in there in that fucking infirmary it is a fucking infirmary now garp thought delighting in the touch and scent of cushie trembling beside him in the cool air through the dark window they shivered in silence you should see my dog stewart screeched to jenny blood everywhere the dog hiding under the hammock blood on the porch stewart croaked what the hell did that bastard do to bonkers garp felt cushie flinch beside him when his mother spoke what jenny said must have made cushie percy remember her remark thirteen years earlier what jenny fields said was garp bit bonkie then her light went out and in the darkness cast over the infirmary and its annex only fat stews breathing was audible with the runoff from the rainwashing over the steering school rinsing everything clean in the city where marcus aurelius died when jenny took garp to europe garp was better prepared for the solitary confinement of a writers life than most eighteenyearolds he was already thriving in a world of his own imagination after all he had been brought up by a woman who thought that solitary confinement was a perfectly natural way to live it would be years before garp noticed that he didnt have any friends and this oddity never struck jenny fields as odd in his distant and polite fashion ernie holm was the first friend jenny fields ever had before jenny and garp found an apartment they lived in more than a dozen pensions all over vienna it was mr tinchs idea that this would be the ideal way for them to choose the part of the city they liked best they would live in all the districts and decide for themselves but shortterm life in a pension must have been more pleasant for tinch in the summer of when jenny and garp came to vienna it was they quickly tired of lugging their typewriters from pension to pension it was this experience however that gave garp the material for his first major short story the pension grillparzer garp hadnt even known what a pension was before he came to vienna but he quickly discovered that a pension had somewhat less to offer than a hotel it was always smaller and never elegant it sometimes offered breakfast and sometimes not a pension was sometimes a bargain and sometimes a mistake jenny and garp found pensions that were clean and comfortable and friendly but they were often seedy jenny and garp wasted little time deciding that they wanted to live within or near the ringstrasse the great round street that circles the heart of the old city it was the part of the city where almost everything was and where jenny could manage a little better without speaking any germanit was the more sophisticated cosmopolitan part of vienna if there really is such a part of vienna it was fun for garp to be in charge of his mother three years of steering german made garp their leader and he clearly enjoyed being jennys boss have the schnitzel mom he would tell her i thought this kalbsnieren sounded interesting jenny said veal kidney mom garp said do you like kidney i dont know jenny admitted probably not when they finally moved into a place of their own garp took over the shopping jenny had spent eighteen years eating in the steering dining halls she had never learned how to cook and now she couldnt read the directions it was in vienna that garp learned how he loved to cook but the first thing he claimed to like about europe was the wcthe water closet in his time spent in pensions garp discovered that a water closet was a tiny room with nothing but a toilet in it it was the first thing about europe that made sense to garp he wrote helen that is the wisest systemto urinate and move your bowels in one place and to brush your teeth in another the wc of course would also feature prominently in garps story the pension grillparzer but garp would not write that story or anything else for a while although he was unusually selfdisciplined for an eighteenyearold there were simply too many things to see together with those things he was suddenly responsible for garp was very busv and for months the only satisfying writing he did was to helen he was too excited with his new territory to develop the necessary routine for writing although he tried he tried to write a story about a family all he knew when he began was that the farmily had an interesting life and the members were all close to each other that was not enough to know jenny and garp moved into a creamcolored highceilinged apartment on the second floor of an old building on the schwindgasse a little street in the fourth district they were right around the corner from the prinzeugenstrasse the schwarzenbergplatz and the upper and lower belvedere garp eventually went to all the art museums in the city but jenny never went to any except the upper belvedere garp explained to her that the upper belvedere contained only the nineteenth and twentiethcentury paintings but jenny said that the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were enough for her garp explained that she could at least walk through the gardens to the lower belvedere and see the baroque collection but jenny shook her head she had taken several art history courses at steeringshed had enough education she said and the brueghels mom garp said you just take the strassenbahn up the ring and get off at mariahilferstrasse the big museum across from the streetcar stop is the kunsthistorisches but i can walk to the belvedere jenny said why take a streetcar she could also walk to the karlskirche and there were some interestinglooking embassy buildings a short distance up argentinierstrasse the bulgarian embassy was right across the street from their apartment on the schwindgasse jenny said she liked staying in her own neighborhood there was a coffeehouse a block away and she sometimes went there and read the newspapers in english she never went out to eat anywhere unless garp took her and unless he cooked for her in their apartment she didnt eat anything at home she was completely taken with the idea of writing somethingmore taken at this phase than garp i dont have time to be a tourist at this point in my life she told her son but you go ahead soak up the culture thats what you should be doing absorb abababsorb tinch had told them that seemed to jenny to be just what garp should do for herself she found shed already absorbed enough to have plenty to say jenny fields was fortyone she imagined that the interesting part of her life was behind her all she wanted to do was write about it garp gave her a piece of paper to carry with her it had her address written on it in case she got lost schwindgasse wien iv garp had to teach her how to pronounce her addressa tedious lesson schwindgassefьnfzehnzwei jenny spat again garp said do you want to stay lost when you get lost garp investigated the city by day and found places to take jenny to at night and in the late afternoons when she was through her writing they would have a beer or a glass of wine and garp would describe his whole day to her jenny listened politely wine or beer made her sleepy usually they ate a nice dinner somewhere and garp escorted jenny home on the strassenbahn he took special pride in never using taxis because he had learned the streetcar system so thoroughly sometimes he went to the open markets in the morning and came home early and cooked all afternoon jenny never complained it didnt matter to her whether they ate in or out this is a gumpoldskirchner garp would say explaining the wine it goes very well with the schweinebraten what funny words jenny remarked in a typical evaluation of jennys prose style garp later wrote my mother had such a struggle with her english its no wonder she never bothered to learn german although jenny fields sat every day at her typewriter she did not know how to write although she wasphysicallywriting she did not enjoy reading over what shed written before long she tried to remember the good things shed read and what made them different from her own firstdraft attempt shed simply begun at the beginning i was born and so forth my parents wanted me to stay at wellesley however and of course i decided i wanted a child of my own and eventually got one in the following manner but jenny had read enough good stories to know that hers didnt sound like the good stories in her memory she wondered what could be wrong and she frequently sent garp on errands to the few bookstores that sold books in english she wanted to look more closely at how books began she had quickly produced over three hundred typed pages yet she felt that her book never really started but jenny suffered her writing problems silently she was cheerful with garp even if she was rarely very attentive jenny fields felt all her life that things began and came to an end like garps educationlike her own like sergeant garp she had not lost any affection for her son but she felt that a phase of her mothering him was over she felt she had brought garp along this far and now she should let him find something to do by himself she could not go through their lives signing him up for wrestling or for something else jenny liked living with her son in fact it didnt occur to her that they would ever live apart but jenny expected garp to entertain himself every day in vienna and so garp did he had gotten no further with his story about a close interesting family except that he had found something interesting for them to do the father of the family was some sort of inspector and his family went with him when he did his job the job involved scrutinizing all the restaurants and hotels and pensions in austriaevaluating them and giving them a rating according to a b c it was a job garp imagined that hed like to have in a country like austria so dependent on tourism the classification and reclassification of the places the tourists ate in and slept in should have a kind of desperate importance but garp couldnt imagine what could be important about itor for whom so far all he had was this family they had a funny job they exposed flaws they gave out the grades so what it was easier to write to helen that late summer and early fall garp walked and rode the trolleys all over vienna meeting no one he wrote helen that a part of adolescence is feeling that theres no one else around whos enough like yourself to understand you garp wrote that he believed vienna enhanced that feeling in him because in vienna there really isnt anyone like myself around his perception was at least numerically correct there were very few people in vienna who were even the same age as garp not many viennese were born in for that matter not many viennese were born from the start of the nazi occupation in through the end of the war in and although there were a surprising number of babies born out of rapes not many viennese wanted babies until after the end of the russian occupation vienna was a city occupied by foreigners for seventeen years to most viennese it is understandable those seventeen years did not seem like a good and wise time to have children it was garps experience to live in a city that made him feel peculiar to be eighteen years old this must have made him grow older faster and this must have contributed to his increasing sense that vienna was more of a museum housing a dead cityas he wrote helenthan it was a city that was still alive garps observation was not offered as criticism garp liked wandering around in a museum a more real city might not have suited me so well he later wrote but vienna was in its death phase it lay still and let me look at it and think about it and look again in a living city i could never have noticed so much living cities dont hold still thus t s garp spent the warm months noticing vienna writing letters to helen holm and managing the domestic life of his mother who had added the isolation of writing to her chosen life of solitude my mother the writer garp referred to her facetiously in countless letters to helen but he envied jenny that she was writing at all he felt stuck with his story he realized he could go on giving his madeup family one adventure after another but where were they going to one more b restaurant with such a weakness in their desserts that an a rating was a lifetime out of reach to one more b hotel sliding to c as surely as the mildew smell in the lobby would never go away perhaps someone in the inspectors family could be poisoned in a class a restaurant but what would it mean and there could be crazy people or even criminals hiding out in one of the pensions but what would they have to do with the scheme of things garp knew that he did not have a scheme of things he saw a fourmember circus unload from hungary or yugoslavia at a railroad station he tried to imagine them in his story there had been a bear who rode a motorcycle around and around a parking lot a small crowd gathered and a man who walked on his hands collected money for the bears performance in a pot balanced on the soles of his feet he fell occasionally but so did the bear finally the motorcycle wouldnt start anymore it never became clear what the two other members of this circus did just as they were meant to take over for the bear and the man who walked on his hands the police came and asked them to fill out a lot of forms that had not been interesting to watch and the crowdwhat there was of onehad gone away garp had stayed the longest not because he was interested in further performances by this decrepit circus but because he was interested in getting them into his story he couldnt imagine how as garp was leaving the railroad station he could hear the bear throwing up for weeks garps only progress with his story was a title the austrian tourist bureau he didnt like it he went back to being a tourist instead of a writer but when the weather grew colder garp tired of tourism he took to carping at helen for not writing him back enougha sign he was writing to her too much she was much busier than he was she was in college where shed been accepted with sophomore standing and she was carrying more than double the average load of courses if helen and garp were similar in these early years it was that they both behaved as if they were going somewhere in a hurry leave poor helen alone jenny advised him i thought you were going to write something beside letters but garp did not like to think of competing in the same apartment with his mother her typewriter never paused for thought garp knew that its steady pounding would probably end his career as a writer before he could properly begin my mother never knew about the silence of revision garp once remarked by november jenny had six hundred manuscript pages but still she had the feeling that she had not really begun garp had no subject that could spill out of him in this fashion imagination he realized came harder than memory his breakthrough as he would call it when he wrote helen occurred one cold and snowy day in the museum of the history of the city of vienna it was a museum within easy walking distance of the schwindgasse somehow he had skipped seeing it knowing he could walk there any day jenny told him about it it was one of the two or three places she had actually visited herself only because it was right across the karlsplatz and well within what she called her neighborhood she mentioned there was a writers room in the museum she forgot whose shed thought having a writers room in a museum was an interesting idea a writers room mom garp asked yes its a whole room jenny said they took all the writers furniture and maybe the walls and floor too i dont know how they did it i dont know why they did it garp said the whole room is in the museum yes i think it was a bedroom jenny said but it was also where the writer actually wrote garp rolled his eyes it sounded obscene to him would the writers toothbrush be there and the chamber pot it was a perfectly ordinary room but the bed looked too smalllike a childs bed the writing table looked small too not the bed or the table of an expansive writer garp thought the wood was dark everything looked easily breakable garp thought his mother had a better room to write in the writer whose room was enshrined in the museum of the history of the city of vienna was named franz grillparzer garp had never heard of him franz grillparzer died in he was an austrian poet and dramatist whom very few people outside austria have ever heard of he is one of those nineteenthcentury writers who did not survive the nineteenth century with any enduring popularity and garp would later argue that grillparzer did not deserve to survive the nineteenth century garp was not interested in plays and poems but he went to the library and read what is considered to be grillparzers outstanding prose work the long short story the poor fiddler perhaps garp thought his three years of steering german were not enough to allow him to appreciate the story in german he hated it he then found an english translation of the story in a secondhand bookstore on habsburgergasse he still hated it garp thought that grillparzers famous story was a ludicrous melodrama he also thought it was ineptly told and baldly sentimental it was only vaguely remindful to him of nineteenthcentury russian stories where often the character is an indecisive procrastinator and a failure in every aspect of practical life but dostoevsky in garps opinion could compel you to be interested in such a wretch grillparzer bored you with tearful trivia in the same secondhand bookstore garp bought an english translation of the meditations of marcus aurelius he had been made to read marcus aurelius in a latin class at steering but he had never read him in english before he bought the book because the bookstore owner told garp that marcus aurelius had died in vienna in the life of a man marcus aurelius wrote his time is but a moment his being an incessant flux his sense a dim rushlight his body a prey of worms his soul an unquiet eddy his fortune dark his fame doubtful in short all that is body is as coursing waters all that is of the soul as dreams and vapors garp somehow thought that marcus aurelius must have lived in vienna when he wrote that the subject of marcus aureliuss dreary observations was certainly the subject of most serious writing garp thought between grillparzer and dostoevsky the difference was not subject matter the difference garp concluded was intelligence and grace the difference was art somehow this obvious discovery pleased him years later garp read in a critical introduction to grillparzers work that grillparzer was sensitive tortured fitfully paranoid often depressed cranky and choked with melancholy in short a complex and modern man maybe so garp wrote but he was also an extremely bad writer garps conviction that franz grillparzer was a bad writer seemed to provide the young man with his first real confidence as an artisteven before he had written anything perhaps in every writers life there needs to be that moment when some other writer is attacked as unworthy of the job garps killer instinct in regard to poor grillparzer was almost a wrestling secret it was as if garp had observed an opponent in a match with another wrestler spotting the weaknesses garp knew he could do better he even forced jenny to read the poor fiddler it was one of the few times he would seek her literary judgment trash jenny pronounced it simplistic maudlin cream puff they were both delighted i didnt like his room really jenny told garp it was just not a writers room well i dont think that matters mom garp said but it was a very cramped room jenny complained it was too dark and it looked very fussy garp peered into his mothers room over her bed and dresser and taped to her wall mirrornearly obscuring his mothers own imagewere the scattered pages of her incredibly long and messy manuscript garp didnt think his mothers room looked very much like a writers room either but he didnt say so he wrote helen a long cocky letter quoting marcus aurelius and slamming franz grillparzer in garps opinion franz grillparzer died forever in and like a cheap local wine does not travel very far from vienna without spoiling the letter was a kind of muscleflexing perhaps helen knew that the letter was calisthenics garp made a carbon copy of it and decided he liked it so well that he kept the original and sent helen the carbon i feel a little like a library helen wrote him its as if you intend to use me as your file drawer was helen really complaining garp was not sensitive enough to helens own life to bother to ask her he merely wrote back that he was getting ready to write he was confident she would like the results helen may have felt warned away from him but she didnt indicate any anxiety at college she was gobbling courses at nearly triple the average rate approaching the end of her first semester she was about to become a secondsemester junior the selfabsorption and ego of a young writer did not frighten helen holm she was moving at her own remarkable pace and she appreciated someone who was determined also she liked garps writing to her she had an ego too and his letters she kept telling him were awfully well written in vienna jenny and garp went on a spree of grillparzer jokes they began to uncover little signs of the dead grillparzer all over the city there was a grillparzergasse there was a kaffeehaus des grillparzers and one day in a pastry shop they were amazed to find a sort of layer cake named after him grillparzertorte it was much too sweet thus when garp cooked for his mother he asked her if she wanted her egg softboiled or grillparzered and one day at the schцnbrunn zoo they observed a particularly gangling antelope its flanks spindly and beshitted the antelope stood sadly in its narrow and foul winter quarters garp identified it der gnu des grillparzers of her own writing jenny one day remarked to garp that she was guilty of doing a grillparzer she explained that this meant she had introduced a scene or a character like an alarm going off the scene she had in mind was the scene in the movie house in boston when the soldier had approached her at the movie wrote jenny fields a soldier consumed with lust approached me thats awful mom garp admitted the phrase consumed with lust was what jenny meant by doing a grillparzer but thats what it was jenny said it was lust all right its better to say he was thick with lust garp suggested yuck jenny said another grillparzer it was the lust she didnt care for in general they discussed lust as best they could garp confessed his lust for cushie percy and rendered a suitably tame version of the consummation scene jenny did not like it and helen jenny asked do you feel that for helen garp admitted he did how terrible jenny said she did not understand the feeling and did not see how garp could ever associate it with pleasure much less with affection all that is body is as coursing waters garp said lamely quoting marcus aurelius his mother just shook her head they ate dinner in a very red restaurant in the vicinity of blutgasse blood street garp translated for her happily stop translating everything jenny told him i dont want to know everything she thought the decor of the restaurant was too red and the food was too expensive the service was slow and they started for home too late it was very cold and the gay lights of the kдrntnerstrasse did little to warm them lets get a taxi jenny said but garp insisted that in another five blocks they could take a streetcar just as easily you and your damn strassenbahns jenny said it was clear that the subject of lust had spoiled their evening the first district glittered with christmas gaudiness between the towering spires of saint stephens and the massive bulk of the opera house lay seven blocks of shops and bars and hotels in those seven blocks they could have been anywhere in the world at wintertime some night weve got to go to the opera mom garp suggested they had been in vienna for six months without going to the opera but jenny did not like to stay up late at night go by yourself jenny said she saw ahead of them three women standing in long fur coats one of them had a matching fur muff and she held the muff in front of her face and breathed into it to warm her hands she was quite elegant to look at although there was something of the tinsel of christmas about the other two women with her jenny envied the woman her muff thats what i want jenny announced where can i get one of those she pointed to the women ahead of them but garp didnt know what she meant the women he knew were whores when the whores saw jenny coming up the street with garp they were puzzled at the relationship they saw a handsome boy with a plain but handsome woman who was old enough to be his mother but jenny hooked garps arm rather formally when she walked with him and there was something like tension and confusion in the conversation garp and jenny were havingwhich made the whores think jenny could not have been garps mother then jenny pointed at them and they were angrythey thought jenny was another whore who was working their territory and had snagged a boy who looked welloff and not sinistera pretty boy who might have paid them in vienna prostitution is legal and complexly controlled there is something like a union there are medical certificates periodical checkups identification cards only the bestlooking prostitutes are allowed to work the posh streets in the first district in the outlying districts the prostitutes are uglier or older or both they are also cheaper of course district by district their prices are supposed to be fixed when the whores saw jenny they stepped out on the sidewalk to block jennys and garps way they had quickly decided that jenny was not quite up to the standard of a firstdistrict prostitute and that she was probably working independentlywhich is illegalor had stepped out of her assigned district to try to pull a little more money that would get her in a lot of trouble with the other prostitutes in truth jenny would not have been mistaken for a prostitute by most neople but it is hard to say exactly what she looked like she had dressed as a nurse for so many years that she did not really know how to dress in vienna she tended to overdress when she went out with garp perhaps in compensation for the old bathrobe in which she wrote she had no experience in buying clothes for herself and in a foreign city all the clothes looked slightly different to her with no particular taste in mind she simply bought the more expensive things after all she did have money and she did not have the patience or the interest for any comparative shopping as a consequence she looked new and shiny in her clothes and beside garp she did not look as if she came from the same family garps constant dress at steering had been a jacket and tie and comfortable pantsa kind of sloppy city standard uniform that made him anonymous almost anywhere would you ask that woman where she got that muff jenny said to garp to her surprise the women blocked the sidewalk to meet them theyre whores mom garp whispered to her jenny fields froze the woman with the muff spoke sharply to her jenny didnt understand a word of course she stared at garp for a translation the woman spoke a stream of things to jenny who never took her eyes off her son my mother wanted to ask you where you got your pretty muff garp said in his slow german oh theyre foreigners said one god its his mother said another the woman with the muff stared at jenny who now stared at the womans muff one of the whores was a young girl with her hair piled very high and sprinkled with little gold and silver stars she also had a green star tattoo on one cheek and a scar which pulled her upper lip only slightly out of lineso that for a moment you didnt know what was wrong with her face only that something was wrong there was nothing at all wrong with her body though she was tall and lean and very hard to look at though jenny now found herself staring at her ask her how old she is jenny said to garp ich bin eighteen the girl said i know good english thats how old my son is jenny said nudging garp she did not understand that the they had mistaken her for one of them when garp told her later she was furiousbut only at herself its my clothes she cried i dont know how to dress and from that moment on jenny fields would never dress as anything but a nurse she put her uniform back on and wore it everywhereas if she were forever on duty though she would never be a nurse again may i see your muff jenny asked the woman who had one jenny had assumed that they all spoke english but only the young girl knew the language garp translated and the woman reluctantly removed her muffa scent of perfume emerging from the warm nest where her long hands sparkling with rings had been clutched together the third whore had a pockmark on her forehead like an impression made with a peach pit aside from this flaw and a small fat mouth like the mouth of an overweight child she was standardly ripein her twenties garp guessed she probably had an enormous bosom but under her black fur coat it was hard to be sure the woman with the muff garp thought was beautiful she had a long potentially sad face her body garp imagined was serene her mouth was very calm only her eyes and her bare hands in the cold night let garp see that she was his mothers age at least maybe she was older it was a gift she said to garp about the muff it came with the coat they were a silverblond fur very sleek it is the real thing said the young whore who spoke english she obviously admired everything about the older prostitute of course you can buy something not quite so expensive almost anywhere the pockmarked woman told garp go to stefs she said in a queer slang that garp barely understood and she pointed up the kдrntnerstrasse but jenny didnt look and garp only nodded and continued to gaze at the older womans long bare fingers twinkling with rings my hands are cold she said softly to garp and garp took the muff from jenny and gave it back to the whore jenny seemed in a daze lets talk to her jenny told garp i want to ask her about it about what mom garp said jesus christ what we were talking about jenny said i want to ask her about lust the two older whores looked at the one who knew english but her english was not fast enough to catch any of this its cold mom garp complained and its late lets just go home tell her we want to go to some place warm just to sit and talk jenny said shell let us pay her for that wont she i suppose so garp groaned mom she doesnt know anything about lust they probably dont feel anything very much like that i want to know about male lust jenny said about your lust she must know something about that for gods sake mom garp said was machts the lovely prostitute asked him whats the matter she asked whats going on here does she want to buy the muff no no garp said she wants to buy you the older whore looked stunned the whore with the pockmark laughed no no garp explained just to talk my mother just wants to ask you some questions its cold the whore told him suspiciously some place inside garp suggested any place you like ask her what she charges jenny said wie viel kostet mumbled garp it costs five hundred schillings the whore said usually garp had to explain to jenny that this was about twenty dollars jenny fields would live for more than a year in austria and never learn the numbers in german or the money system twenty dollars just to talk jenny said no no mom garp said thats for the usual jenny thought was twenty dollars a lot for the usual she didnt know tell her well give her ten jenny said but the whore looked doubtfulas if talk for her might be more difficult than the usual her indecision was influenced by more than price however she didnt trust garp and jenny she asked the young whore who spoke english if they were british or american americans she was toldthis seemed to relieve her slightly the british are often perverse she told garp simply americans are usually ordinary we just want to talk with you garp insisted but he could see that the prostitute firmly imagined some motherandson act of monstrous oddity two hundred and fifty schillings the lady with the mink muff finally agreed and you buy my coffee so they went to the place all the whores went to get warm a tiny bar with miniature tables the phone rang all the time but only a few men lurked sullenly by the coat rack looking the women over there was some rule that the women could not be approached when they were in this bar the bar was a kind of home base a timeout zone ask her how old she is jenny said to garp but when he asked her the woman softly shut her eyes and shook her head okay said jenny ask her why she thinks men like her garp rolled his eyes well you do like her jenny asked him garp said he did well what is it about her that you want jenny asked him i dont mean just her sex parts i mean is there something else thats satisfying something to imagine something to think about some kind of aura jenny asked why dont you pay me two hundred and fifty schillings and not ask her any questions mom garp said tiredly dont be fresh jenny said i want to know if it degrades her to feel wanted in that wayand then to be had in that way i supposeor whether she thinks it only degrades the men garp struggled to translate this the woman appeared to think very seriously about it or else she didnt understand the question or garps german i dont know she finally said i have other questions jenny said for an hour it continued when the whore said she had to get back to work jenny seemed neither satisfied nor disappointed by the interviews lack of concrete results she just seemed insatiably curious garp had never wanted anyone as much as he wanted the woman do you want her jenny asked him so suddenly that he couldnt lie i mean after all thisand looking at her and talking with herdo you really want to have sex with her too of course mom garp said miserably jenny looked no closer to understanding lust than she was before dinner she looked puzzled and surprised at her son all right she said she handed him the schillings that they owed the woman and another schillings you do what you want to do she told him or what you have to do i guess but please take me home first the whore had watched the money change hands she had an eye for recognizing the correct amount look she said to garp and touched his hand with her fingers as cold as her rings its all right with me if your mother wants to buy me for you but she cant come along with us i will not have her watch us absolutely not im still a catholic believe it or not she said and if you want anything funny like that youll have to ask tina garp wondered who tina was he gave a shudder at the thought that nothing must be too funny for her im going to take my mother home garp told the beautiful woman and i wont be back to see you but she smiled at him and he thought his erection would burst through his pocket of loose schillings and worthless groschen just one of her perfect teethbut it was a big front upper toothwas all gold in the taxi that garp agreed to take home garp explained to his mother the viennese system of prostitution jenny was not surprised to hear that prostitution was legal she was surprised to learn that it was illegal in so many other places why shouldnt it be legal she asked why cant a woman use her body the way she wants to if someone wants to pay for it its just one more crummy deal is twenty dollars a lot of money for it no thats pretty good garp said at least its a very low price for the goodlooking ones jenny slapped him you know all about it she said then she said she was sorryshe had never struck him before she just didnt understand this fucking lust lust lust at all at the schwindgasse apartment garp made a point of not going out in fact he was in his own bed and asleep before jenny who paced through her manuscript pages in her wild room a sentence boiled in her but she could not yet see it clearly garp dreamed of other prostitutes he had visited two or three of them in viennabut he had never paid the firstdistrict prices the next evening after an early supper at the schwindgasse garp went to see the woman with the mink muff streaked with light her working name was charlotte she was not surprised to see him charlotte was old enough to know when shed successfully hooked someone although she never did tell garp exactly how old she was she had taken very fine care of herself and only when she was completely undressed was her age apparent anywhere except in the veins on her long hands there were stretch marks on her belly and her breasts but she told garp that the child had died a long time ago she did not mind if garp touched the cesarean scar after he had seen charlotte four times at the fixed firstdistrict rate he happened to run into her at the naschmarkt on a saturday morning she was buying fruit her hair was probably a little dirty shed covered it with a scarf and wore it like a young girlswith bangs and two short braids the bangs were slightly greasy against her forehead which seemed paler in the daylight she had no makeup on and wore a pair of american jeans and tennis sneakers and a long coatstyle sweater with a high roll collar garp would not have recognized her if he hadnt seen her hands clutching the fruit she had all her rings on at first she wouldnt answer him when he spoke to her but he had already told her that he did all the shopping and the cooking for himself and his mother and she found this amusing after her irritation at meeting a customer in her offduty hours she seemed goodhumored it did not become clear to garp for a while that he was the same age as charlottes child would have been charlotte took some vicarious interest in the way garp was living with his mother hows your mothers writing coming charlotte would ask him shes still pounding away garp would say i dont think shes solved the lust problem yet but only to a point did charlotte allow garp to joke about his mother garp was insecure enough about himself with charlotte that he never told her he was trying to write too he knew she would think he was too young sometimes he thought so too and his story wasnt ready to tell someone about the most he had done was change the title he now called it the pension grillparzer and that title was the first thing about it that solidly pleased him it helped him to focus now he had a place in mind just one place where almost everything that was important was going to happen this helped him to think in a more focused way about his characters too about the family of classifiers about the other residents of one small sad pension somewhere it would have to be small and sad and in vienna to be named after franz grillparzer those other residents would include a kind of circus not a very good kind either he imagined but a circus with no other place to stay no other place would have them in the world of ratings the whole thing would be a kind of c experience this kind of imagining got garp started slowly in what he thought was a real direction he was right about that but it was too new to write it downor even to write about it anyway the more he wrote to helen the less he wrote in other important ways and he couldnt discuss this with his mother imagination was not her greatest strength of course hed have felt foolish discussing any of this with charlotte garp often met charlotte at the naschmarkt on saturdays they shopped and sometimes they ate lunch together in a serbian place not far from the stadtpark on these occasions charlotte paid for herself at one such lunch garp confessed to her that the firstdistrict rate was hard for him to pay regularly without admitting to his mother where this steady flow of money was going charlotte was angry at him for bringing up business when she wasnt working she would have been angrier if hed admitted that he was seeing less of her professionally because the sixthdistrict prices of someone whom he met at the corner of karl schweighofergasse and mariahilfer were much easier to conceal from jenny charlotte had a low opinion of her colleagues who operated out of the first district shed once told garp she was planning to retire at the first sign that her firstdistrict appeal was slipping she would never do business in the outer districts she had a lot of money saved she told him and she was going to move to munich where nobody knew she was a whore and marry a young doctor who could take care of her in every way until she died it was unnecessary for her to explain to garp that she had always appealed to younger men but garp thoroughly resented her assumption that doctors werein the long rundesirable it may be this early exposure to the desirability of doctors that caused garp in his literary career often to people his novels and stories with such unlikely characters from the medical profession if so it didnt occur to him until later there is no doctor in the pension grillparzer in this beginning there is very little about death either although that is the subject the story would come to in the beginning garp had only a dream of death but it was a whale of a dream and he gave it to the oldest person alive in his story a grandmother garp guessed this meant that she would be the first to die the pension grillparzer my father worked for the austrian tourist bureau it was my mothers idea that our family travel with him when he went on the road as a tourist bureau spy my mother and brother and i would accompany him on his secretive missions to uncover the discourtesy the dust the badly cooked food the shortcuts taken by austrian restaurants and hotels and pensions we were instructed to create difficulties whenever we could never to order exactly what was on the menu to imitate a foreigners odd requeststhe hours we would like to have our baths the need for aspirin and directions to the zoo we were instructed to be civilized but troublesome and when the visit was over we reported to my father in the car my mother would say the hairdresser is always closed in the morning but they make suitable recommendations outside i guess its all right provided they dont claim to have a hairdresser actually in the hotel well they do claim it my father would say hed note this in a giant pad i was always the driver i said the car is parked off the street but someone put fourteen kilometers on the gauge between the time we handed it over to the doorman and picked it up at the hotel garage that is a matter to report directly to the management my father said jotting it down the toilet leaked i said i couldnt open the door to the wc said my brother robo robo mother said you always have trouble with doors was that supposed to be class c i asked im afraid not father said it is still listed as class b we drove for a short while in silence our most serious judgment concerned changing a hotels or a pensions rating we did not suggest reclassification frivolously i think this calls for a letter to the management mother suggested not too nice a letter but not a really rough one just state the facts yes i rather liked him father said he always made a point of getting to meet the managers dont forget the business of them driving our car i said thats really unforgivable and the eggs were bad said robo he was not yet ten and his judgments were not considered seriously we became a far harsher team of evaluators when my grandfather died and we inherited grandmothermy mothers mother who thereafter accompanied us on our travels a regal dame johanna was accustomed to class a travel and my fathers duties more frequently called for investigations of class b and class c lodgings they were the places the b and c hotels and the pensions that most interested the tourists at restaurants we did a little better people who couldnt afford the classy places to sleep were still interested in the best places to eat i shall not have dubious food tested on me johanna told us this strange employment may give you all glee about having free vacations but i can see there is a terrible price paid the anxiety of not knowing what sort of quarters youll have for the night americans may find it charming that we still have rooms without private baths and toilets but i am an old woman and im not charmed by walking down a public corridor in search of cleanliness and my relievement anxiety is only half of it actual diseases are possibleand not only from food if the bed is questionable i promise i shant put my head down and the children are young and impressionable you should think of the clientele in some of these lodgings and seriously ask yourselves about the influences my mother and father nodded they said nothing slow down grandmother said sharply to me youre just a young boy who likes to show off i slowed down vienna grandmother sighed in vienna i always stayed at the ambassador johanna the ambassador is not under investigation father said i should think not johanna said i suppose were not even headed toward a class a place well its a b trip my father admitted for the most part i trust grandmother said that you mean there is one a place en route no father admitted there is one c place its okay robo said there are fights in class c i should imagine so johanna said its a class c pension very small father said as if the size of the place forgave it and theyre applying for a b said mother but there have been some complaints i added im sure there have johanna said and animals i added my mother gave me a look animals said johanna animals i admitted a suspicion of animals my mother corrected me yes be fair father said oh wonderful grandmother said a suspicion of animals their hair on the rugs their terrible waste in the corners did you know that my asthma reacts severely to any room in which there has recently been a cat the complaint was not about cats i said my mother elbowed me sharply dogs johanna said rabid dogs biting you on the way to the bathroom no i said not dogs bears robo cried but my mother said we dont know for sure about the bear robo this isnt serious johanna said of course its not serious father said how could there be bears in a pension there was a letter saying so i said of course the tourist bureau assumed it was a crank complaint but then there was another sightingand a second letter claiming there had been a bear my father used the rearview mirror to scowl at me but i thought that if we were all supposed to be in on the investigation it would be wise to have grandmother on her toes its probably not a real bear robo said with obvious disappointment a man in a bear suit johanna cried what unheardof perversion is that a beast of a man sneaking about in disguise up to what its a man in a bear suit i know it is she said i want to go to that one first if theres going to be a class c experience on this trip lets get it over with as soon as possible but we havent got reservations for tonight mother said yes we might as well give them a chance to be at their best father said although he never revealed to his victims that he worked for the tourist bureau father believed that reservations were simply a decent way of allowing the personnel to be as prepared as they could be im sure we dont need to make a reservation in a place frequented by men who disguise themselves as animals johanna said im sure there is always a vacancy there im sure the guests are regularly dying in their bedsof fright or else of whatever unspeakable injury the madman in the foul bear suit does to them its probably a real bear robo said hopefullyfor in the turn the conversation was taking robo certainly saw that a real bear would be preferable to grandmothers imagined ghoul robo had no fear i think of a real bear i drove us as inconspicuously as possible to the dark dwarfed corner of planken and seilergasse we were looking for the class c pension that wanted to be a b no place to park i said to father who was already making note of that in his pad i doubledparked and we sat in the car and peered up at the pension grillparzer it rose only four slender stories between a pastry shop and a tabak trafik see father said no bears no men i hope said grandmother they come at night robo said looking cautiously up and down the street we went inside to meet the manager a herr theobald who instantly put johanna on her guard three generations traveling together he cried like the old days he added especially to grandmother before all these divorces and the young people wanting apartments by themselves this is a family pension i just wish you had made a reservationso i could put you more closely together were not accustomed to sleeping in the same room grandmother told him of course not theobald cried i just meant that i wished your rooms could be closer together this worried grandmother clearly how far apart must we be put she asked well ive only two rooms left he said and only one of them is large enough for the two boys to share with their parents and my room is how far from theirs johanna asked coolly youre right across from the wc theobald told her as if this were a plus but as we were shown to our rooms grandmother staying with fathercontemptuously to the rear of our processioni heard her mutter this is not how i conceived of my retirement across the hall from a wc listening to all the visitors not one of these rooms is the same theobald told us the furniture is all from my family we could believe it the one large room robo and i were to share with my parents was a hallsized museum of knickknacks every dresser with a different style of knob on the other hand the sink had brass faucets and the headboard of the bed was carved i could see my father balancing things up for future notation in the giant pad you may do that later johanna informed him where do i stay as a family we dutifully followed theobald and my grandmother down the long twining hall my father counting the paces to the wc the hall rug was thin the color of a shadow along the walls were old photographs of speedskating teamson their feet the strange blades curled up at the tips like court jesters shoes or the runners of ancient sleds robo running far ahead announced his discovery of the wc grandmothers room was full of china polished wood and the hint of mold the drapes were damp the bed had an unsettling ridge at its center like fur risen on a dogs spineit was almost as if a very slender body lay stretched beneath the bedspread grandmother said nothing and when theobald reeled out of the room like a wounded man whos been told hell live grandmother asked my father on what basis can the pension grillparzer hope to get a b quite decidedly c father said born c and will die c i said i would say myself grandmother told us that it was e or f in the dim tearoom a man without a tie sang a hungarian song it does not mean hes hungarian father reassured johanna but she was skeptical id say the odds are not in his favor she suggested she would not have tea or coffee robo ate a little cake which he claimed to like my mother and i smoked a cigarette she was trying to quit and i was trying to start therefore we shared a cigarette between usin fact wed promised never to smoke a whole one alone hes a great guest herr theabold whispered to my father he indicated the singer he knows songs from all over from hungary at least grandmother said but she smiled a small man cleanshaven but with that permanent gunblue shadow of a beard on his lean face spoke to my grandmother he wore a clean white shirt but yellow from age and laundering suit pants and an unmatching jacket pardon me said grandmother i said that i tell dreams the man informed her you tell dreams grandmother said meaning you have them have them and tell them he said mysteriously the singer stopped singing any dreams you want to know said the singer he can tell it im quite sure i dont want to know any grandmother said she viewed with displeasure the ascot of dark hair bursting out at the open throat of the singers shirt she would not regard the man who told dreams at all i can see you are a lady the dream man told grandmother you dont respond to just every dream that comes along certainly not said grandmother she shot my father one of her howcouldyouhaveletthishappentome looks but i know one said the dream man he shut his eyes the singer slipped a chair forward and we suddenly realized he was sitting very close to us robo though he was much too old for it sat in fathers lap in a great castle the dream man began a woman lay beside her husband she was wide awake suddenly in the middle of the night she woke up without the slightest idea of what had awakened her and she felt as alert as if shed been up for hours it was also clear to her without a look a word or a touch that her husband was wide awake tooand just as suddenly i hope this is suitable for the child to hear ha ha herr theobald said but no one even looked at him my grandmother folded her hands in her lap and stared at themher knees together her heels tucked under her straightbacked chair my mother held my fathers hand i sat next to the dream man whose jacket smelled like a zoo he said the woman and her husband lay awake listening for sounds in the castle which they were only renting and did not know intimately they listened for sounds in the courtyard which they never bothered to lock the village people always took walks by the castle the village children were allowed to swing on the great courtyard door what had woken them bears said robo but father touched his fingertips to robos mouth they heard horses said the dream man old johanna her eyes shut her head inclined toward her lap seemed to shudder in her stiff chair they heard the breathing and stamping of horses who were trying to keep still the dream man said the husband reached out and touched his wife horses he said the woman got out of bed and went to the courtyard window she would swear to this day that the courtyard was full of soldiers on horsebackbut what soldiers they were they wore armor the visors on their helmets were closed and their murmuring voices were as tinny and difficult to hear as voices on a fading radio station their armor clanked as their horses shifted restlessly under them there was an old dry bowl of a former fountain there in the castles courtyard but the woman saw that the fountain was flowing the water lopped over the worn curb and the horses were drinking it the knights were wary they would not dismount they looked up at the castles dark windows as if they knew they were uninvited at this watering troughthis rest station on their way somewhere in the moonlight the woman saw their big shields glint she crept back to bed and lay rigidly against her husband what is it he asked her horses she told him i thought so he said theyll eat the flowers who built this castle she asked him it was a very old castle they both knew that charlemagne he told her he was going back to sleep but the woman lay awake listening to the water which now seemed to be running all through the castle gurgling in every drain as if the old fountain were drawing water from every available source and there were the distorted voices of the whispering knightscharlemagnes soldiers speaking their dead language to this woman the soldiers voices were as morbid as the eighth century and the people called franks the horses kept drinking the woman lay awake a long time waiting for the soldiers to leave she had no fear of actual attack from themshe was sure they were on a journey and had only stopped to rest at a place they once knew but for as long as the water ran she felt that she mustnt disturb the castles stillness or its darkness when she fell asleep she thought charlemagnes men were still there in the morning her husband asked her did you hear water running too yes she had of course but the fountain was dry of course and out the window they could see that the flowers werent eatenand everyone knows horses eat flowers look said her husband he went into the courtyard with her there are no hoofprints there are no droppings we must have dreamed we heard horses she did not tell him that there were soldiers too or that in her opinion it was unlikely that two people would dream the same dream she did not remind him that he was a heavy smoker who never smelled the soup simmering the aroma of horses in the fresh air was too subtle for him she saw the soldiers or dreamed them twice more while they stayed there but her husband never again woke up with her it was always sudden once she woke with the taste of metal on her tongue as if shed touched some old sour iron to her moutha sword a chest plate chain mail a thigh guard they were out there again in colder weather from the water in the fountain a dense fog shrouded them the horses were snowy with frost and there were not so many of them the next timeas if the winter or their skirmishes were reducing their numbers the last time the horses looked gaunt to her and the men looked more like unoccupied suits of armor balanced delicately in the saddles the horses wore long masks of ice on their muzzles their breathing or the mens breathing was congested her husband said the dream man would die of a respiratory infection but the woman did not know it when she dreamed this dream my grandmother looked up from her lap and slapped the dream mans beardgray face robo stiffened in my fathers lap my mother caught her mothers hand the singer shoved back his chair and jumped to his feet frightened or ready to fight someone but the dream man simply bowed to grandmother and left the gloomy tearoom it was as if hed made a contract with johanna that was final but gave neither of them any joy my father wrote something in the giant pad well wasnt that some story said herr theobald ha ha he rumpled robos hairsomething robo always hated herr theobald my mother said still holding johannas hand my father died of a respirafory infection oh dear shit said herr theobald im sorry meine frau he told grandmother but old johanna would not speak to him we took grandmother out to eat in a class a restaurant but she hardly touched her food that person was a gypsy she told us a satanic being and a hungarian please mother my mother said he couldnt have known about father he knew more than you know grandmother snapped the schnitzel is excellent father said writing in the pad the gumpoldskirchner is just right with it the kalbsnieren are fine i said the eggs are okay said robo grandmother said nothing until we returned to the pension grillparzer where we noticed that the door to the wc was hung a foot or more off the floor so that it resembled the bottom half of an american toiletstall door or a saloon door in the western movies im certainly glad i used the wc at the restaurant grandmother said how revolting i shall try to pass the night without exposing myself where every passerby can peer at my ankles in our family room father said didnt johanna live in a castle once upon a time i thought she and grandpa rented some castle yes it was before i was born mother said they rented schloss katzelsdorf i saw the photographs well thats why the hungarians dream upset her father said someone is riding a bike in the hall robo said i saw a wheel go byunder our door robo go to sleep mother said it went squeak squeak robo said good night boys said father if you can talk we can talk i said then talk to each other father said im talking to your mother i want to go to sleep mother said i wish no one would talk we tried perhaps we slept then robo whispered to me that he had to use the wc you know where it is i said robo went out the door leaving it slightly open i heard him walk down the corridor brushing his hand along the wall he was back very quickly theres someone in the wc he said wait for them to finish i said the light wasnt on robo said but i could see under the door someone is in there in the dark i prefer the dark myself i said but robo insisted on telling me exactly what hed seen he said that under the door was a pair of hands hands i said yes where the feet should have been robo said he claimed that there was a hand on either side of the toiletinstead of a foot get out of here robo i said please come see he begged i went down the hall with him but there was no one in the wc theyve gone he said walked off on their hands no doubt i said go pee ill wait for you he went into the wc and peed sadly in the dark when we were almost back to our room together a small dark man with the same kind of skin and clothes as the dream man who had angered grandmother passed us in the hall he winked at us and smiled i had to notice that he was walking on his hands you see robo whispered to me we went into our room and shut the door what is it mother asked a man walking on his hands i said a man peeing on his hands robo said class c father murmured in his sleep father often dreamed that he was making notes in the giant pad well talk about it in the morning mother said he was probably just an acrobat who was showing off for you because youre a kid i told robo how did he know i was a kid when he was in the wc robo asked me go to sleep mother whispered then we heard grandmother scream down the hall mother put on her pretty green dressing gown father put on his bathrobe and his glasses i pulled on a pair of pants over my pajamas robo was in the hall first we saw the light coming from the wc door grandmother was screaming rhythmically in there here we are i called to her mother what is it my mother asked we gathered in the broad slot of light we could see grandmothers mauve slippers and her porcelainwhite ankles under the door she stopped screaming i heard whispers when i was in my bed she said it was robo and me i told her then when everyone seemed to have gone i came into the wc johanna said i left the light off i was very quiet she told us then i saw and heard the wheel the wheel father asked a wheel went by the door a few times grandmother said it rolled by and came back and rolled by again father made his fingers roll like wheels alongside his head he made a face at mother somebody needs a new set of wheels he whispered but mother looked crossly at him i turned on the light grandmother said and the wheel went away i told you there was a bike in the hall said robo shut up robo father said no it was not a bicycle grandmother said there was only one wheel father was making his hands go crazy beside his head shes got a wheel or two missing he hissed at my mother but she cuffed him and knocked his glasses askew on his face then someone came and looked under the door grandmother said and that is when i screamed someone said father i saw his hands a mans handsthere was hair on his knuckles grandmother said his hands were on the rug right outside the door he must have been looking up at me no grandmother i said i think he was just standing out here on his hands dont be fresh my mother said but we saw a man walking on his hands robo said you did not father said we did i said were going to wake everyone up mother cautioned us the toilet flushed and grandmother shuffled out the door with only a little of her former dignity intact she was wearing a gown over a gown over a gown her neck was very long and her face was creamed white grandmother looked like a troubled goose he was evil and vile she said to us he knew terrible magic the man who looked at you mother asked that man who told my dream grandmother said now a tear made its way through her furrows of face cream that was my dream she said and he told everyone it is unspeakable that he even knew it she hissed to us my dreamof charlemagnes horses and soldiersi am the only one who should know it i had that dream before you were born she told mother and that vile evil magic man told my dream as if it were news i never even told your father all there was to that dream i was never sure that it was a dream and now there are men on their hands and their knuckles are hairy and there are magic wheels i want the boys to sleep with me so that was how robo and i came to share the large family room far away from the wc with grandmother who lay on my mothers and fathers pillows with her creamed face shining like the face of a wet ghost robo lay awake watching her i do not think johanna slept very well i imagine she was dreaming her dream of death again reliving the last winter of charlemagnes cold soldiers with their strange metal clothes covered with frost and their armor frozen shut when it was obvious that i had to go to the wc robos round bright eyes followed me to the door there was someone in the wc there was no light shining from under the door but there was a unicycle parked against the wall outside its rider sat in the dark wc the toilet was flushing over and over againlike a child the unicyclist was not giving the tank time to refill i went closer to the gap under the wc door but the occupant was not standing on his or her hands i saw what were clearly feet in almost the expected position but the feet did not touch the floor their soles tilted up to medark bruisecolored pads they were huge feet attached to short furry shins they were a bears feet only there were no claws a bears claws are not retractable like a cats if a bear had claws you would see them here then was an imposter in a bear suit or a declowed bear a domestic bear perhaps at leastby its presence in the wca housebroken bear for by its smell i could tell it was no man in a bear suit it was all bear it was real bear i backed into the door of grandmothers former room behind which my father lurked waiting for further disturbances he snapped open the door and i fell inside frightening us both mother sat up in bed and pulled the feather quilt over her head got him father cried dropping down on me the floor trembled the bears unicycle slipped against the wall and fell into the door of the wc out of which the bear suddenly shambled stumbling over its unicycle and lunging for its balance worriedly it stared across the hall through the open door at father sitting on my chest it picked up the unicycle in its front paws grauf said the bear father slammed the door down the hall we heard a woman call where are you duna harf the bear said father and i heard the woman come closer she said oh duna practicing again always practicing but its better in the daytime the bear said nothing father opened the door dont let anyone else in mother said still under the featherbed in the hall a pretty aging woman stood beside the bear who now balanced in place on its unicycle one huge paw on the womans shoulder she wore a vivid red turban and a long wraparound dress that resembled a curtain perched on her high bosom was a necklace strung with bear claws her earrings touched the shoulder of her curtaindress and her other bare shoulder where my father and i stared at her fetching mole good evening she said to father im sorry if weve disturbed you duna is forbidden to practice at nightbut he loves his work the bear muttered pedaling away from the woman the bear had very good balance but he was careless he brushed against the walls of the hall and touched the photographs of the speedskating teams with his paws the woman bowing away from father went after the bear calling duna duna and straightening the photographs as she followed him down the hall duna is the hungarian word for the danube father told me that bear is named after our beloved donau sometimes it seemed to surprise my family that the hungarians could love a river too is the bear a real bear mother askedstill under the featherbedbut i left father to explain it all to her i knew that in the morning herr theobald would have much to explain and i would hear everything reviewed at that time i went across the hall to the wc my task there was hurried by the bears lingering odor and by my suspicion of bear hair on everything it was only my suspicion though for the bear had left everything quite tidyor at least neat for a bear i saw the bear i whispered to robo back in our room but robo had crept into grandmothers bed and had fallen asleep beside her old johanna was awake however i saw fewer and fewer soldiers she said the last time they came there were only nine of them everyone looked so hungry they must have eaten the extra horses it was so cold of course i wanted to help them but we werent alive at the same time how could i help them if i wasnt even born of course i knew they would die but it took such a long time the last time they came the fountain was frozen they used their swords and their long pikes to break the ice into chunks they built a fire and melted the ice in a pot they took bones from their saddlebagsbones of all kindsand threw them in the soup it must have been a very thin broth because the bones had long ago been gnawed clean i dont know what bones they were rabbits i suppose and maybe a deer or a wild boar maybe the extra horses i do not choose to think said grandmother that they were the bones of the missing soldiers go to sleep grandmother i said dont worry about the bear she said and then what garp wondered what can happen next he wasnt altogether sure what had happened or why garp was a natural storyteller he could make things up one right after the other and they seemed to fit but what did they mean that dream and those desperate entertainers and what would happen to them alleverything had to connect what sort of explanation would be natural what sort of ending might make them all part of the same world garp knew he did not know enough not yet he trusted his instincts they had brought him this far with the pension grillparzer now he had to trust the instinct that told him not to go any further until he knew much more what made garp older and wiser than his nineteen years had nothing to do with his experience or with what he had learned he had some instincts some determination better than average patience he loved to work hard altogether with the grammar tinch had taught him that was all only two facts impressed garp that his mother actually believed she could write a book and that the most meaningful relationship in his present life was with a whore these facts contributed greatly to the young mans developing sense of humor he put the pension grillparzeras they sayaside it will come garp thought he knew he had to know more all he could do was look at vienna and learn it was holding still for him life seemed to be holding still for him he made a great many observations of charlotte too and he noticed everything his mother did but he was being too young what i need is vision he knew an overall scheme of things a vision all his own it will come he repeated to himself as if he were training for another wrestling seasonjumping rope running laps on a smail track lifting weights something almost that mindless but that necessary even charlotte has a vision he thought he certainly knew that his mother had one garp had no parallel wisdom for the absolute clarity of the world according to jenny fields but he knew it would take only time to imagine a world of his ownwith a little help from the real world the real world would soon cooperate the pension grillparzer when spring came to vienna garp had still not finished the pension grillparzer he had not of course even written to helen about his life with charlotte and her colleagues jenny had kicked her writing habit into yet a hiqher gear she had found the sentence that had been boiling in her since that night she discussed lust with garp and charlotte it was an old sentence actually from her life long ago and it was the sentence with which she truly began the book that would make her famous in this dirtyminded world jenny wrote you are either somebodys wife or somebodys whoreor fast on your way to becoming one or the other the sentence set a tone for the book which the book had been lacking jenny was discovering that when she began with that sentence an aura was cast over her autobiography that bound the disharmonious parts of her lifes story togetherthe way fog shrouds an uneven landscape the way heat reaches through a rambling house into every room that sentence inspired others like it and jenny wove them as she might have woven a bright and binding thread of brilliant color through a sprawling tapestry of no apparent design i wanted a job and i wanted to live alone she wrote that made me a sexual suspect and that gave her a title too a sexual suspect the autobiography of jenny fields it would go through eight hardcover printings and be translated into six languages even before the paperback sale that could keep jenny and a regiment of nurses in new uniform for a century then i wanted a baby but i didnt want to have to share my body or my life to have one jenny wrote that made me a sexual suspect too thus jenny had found the string with which to sew her messy book together but when spring came to vienna garp felt like a trip maybe italy possibly they could rent a car do you know how to drive jenny asked him she knew perfectly well that he hadnt ever learned there had never been a need well i dont know how either she told him and besides im working i cant stop now if you want to take a trip take a trip by yourself it was in the american express office where garp and jenny got their mail that garp met his first traveling young americans two girls who had formerly gone to dibbs and a boy named boo who had gone to bath hey how about us one of the girls said to garp when they had all met were all prep school stuff her name was flossie and it appeared to garp that she had a relationship with boo the other girl was called vivian and under the tiny cafй table on the schwarzenbergplatz vivian squeezed garps knee between her own and drooled while sipping her wine i just went to a denthisht she explained to him got so much novocain in my goddamn mouth i dont know whether its open or shut sort of half and half garp said to her but he thought oh what the hell he missed cushie percy and his relationships with prostitutes were beginning to make him feel like a sexual suspect charlotte it was now clear was interested in mothering himthough he tried to imagine her on another level he knew sadly that this level would never carry beyond the professional flossie and vivian and boo were all going to greece but they let garp show them vienna for three days in that time garp slept twice with vivian whose novocain finally wore off he also slept once with flossie while boo was out cashing travelers checks and changing the oil in the car there was no love lost between steering and bath boys garp knew but boo had the last laugh it is impossible to know whether garp got gonorrhea from vivian or from flossie but garp was convinced that the source of the dose was boo it was in garps opinion bath clap by the time of the first symptoms of course the threesome had left for greece and garp faced the dripping and the burning alone there could be no worse a case of clap to catch in all of europe he thought i caught a dose of boos goo he wrote but much later it was not funny when it happened and he didnt dare seek his mothers professional advice he knew she would refuse to believe that he hadnt caught it from a whore he got up the nerve to ask charlotte to recommend a doctor who was familiar with the matter he thought she would know he thought later that jenny would possibly have been less angry with him youd think americans would know a little simple hygiene charlotte said furiously you should think of your mother id expect you to have better taste people who give it away for free to someone they hardly knowwell they should make you suspicious shouldnt they once again garp had been caught without a condom thus garp winced his way to charlottes personal physician a hearty man named thalhammer who was missing his left thumb and i was once lefthanded herr doktor thalhammer told garp but everything is surmountable if we have energy we can learn anything we can set our minds to he said with firm good cheer he demonstrated for garp how he could write the prescription with an enviable penmanship with his right hand it was a simple and painless cure in jennys day at good old boston mercy they would have given garp the valentine treatment and hed have learned more emphatically how not all rich kids are clean kids he didnt write helen about this either his spirits slumped spring wore on the city opened in many small wayslike buds but garp felt he had walked vienna out he could barely get his mother to stop writing long enough to eat dinner with him when he sought out charlotte her colleague told him she was sick she hadnt worked for weeks for three saturdays garp did not see her at the naschmarkt when he stopped her colleagues one may evening on the kдrntnerstrasse he saw they were reluctant to discuss charlotte the whore whose forehead appeared to have beep pockmarked by a peach pit merely told garp that charlotte was sicker than she first thought the young girl garps age with the misshapen lip and the halfknowledge of english tried to explain to him her sex is sick she said that was a curious way to put it garp thought garp was not surprised to hear that anyones sex was sick but when he smiled at the remark the young whore who spoke english frowned at him and wallied away you dont understand said the overlush prostitute with the pockmark forget charlotte it was midjune and charlote had still not come back when garp called herr doktor thalhammer and asked where he could find her i doubt that she wants to see anybody thalhammer told him but human beings can adjust to almost anything very near grinzing and the vienna woods out in the nineteenth district where the whores dont go vienna looks like a village imitation of itself in these suburbs many of the streets are still cobblestoned and trees grow along the sidewalks unfamiliar with this part of the city garp rode the no strassenbahn too far out the grinzinger allee he had to walk back to the corner of billrothstrasse and rudolfinergasse to the hospital the rudolfinerhaus is a private hospital in a city of socialized medicine its old stone walls are the same maria theresa yellow as the palace at schцnbrunn or the upper and lower belvedere its own gardens are enclosed in its own courtyard and it costs as much as almost any hospital in the united states the rudolfinerhaus does not normally provide pajamas for its patients for example because its patients usually prefer their own nightclothes the welltodo viennese treat themselves to the luxury of being sick thereand most foreigners who are afraid of socialized medicine end up there where they are shocked at the prices in june when garp went there the hospital struck him as full of pretty young mothers whod just delivered babies but it was also full of welloff people whod come there to get seriously well again and it was partially full of welloff people like charlotte whod come there to die charlotte had a private room because she said there was no reason to save her money now garp knew she was dying as soon as he saw her she had lost almost thirty pounds garp saw that she wore what was left of her rings on her index and middle fingers her other fingers were so shrunken that her rings would slide off charlotte was the color of the dull ice on the brackish steering river she did not appear very surprised to see garp but she was so heavily anesthetized that garp imagined charlotte was fairly unsurprised in general garp had brought a basket of fruit since they had shopped together he knew what charlotte liked to eat but she had a tube down her throat for several hours each day and it left her throat too sore to swallow anything but liquid garp ate a few cherries while charlotte enumerated the parts of her body that had been removed her sex parts she thought and much of her digestive tract and something that had to do with the process of elimination oh and my breasts i think she said the whites of her eyes very gray and her hands held above her chest where she flattered herself to imagine her breasts used to be to garp it appeared that they had not touched her breasts under the sheet there was still something there but he later thought that charlotte had been such a lovely woman that she could hold her body in such a way as to inspire the illusion of breasts thank god ive got money charlotte said isnt this a class a place garp nodded the next day he brought a bottle of wine the hospital was very relaxed about liquor and visitors perhaps this was one of the luxuries one paid for even if i got out charlotte said what could i do they cut my purse out she tried to drink some wine then fell asleep garp asked a nurses aide to explain what charlotte meant by her purse though he thought he knew the nurses aide was garps age nineteen or maybe younger and she blushed and looked away from him when she translated the slang a purse was a prostitutes word for her vagina thank you garp said once or twice when he visited charlotte he encountered her two colleagues who were shy and girlish with garp in the daylight of charlottes sunny room the young one who spoke english was named wanga she had cut her lip that way as a child when she tripped while running home from the store with a jar of mayonnaise we were on a picnic going she explained but my whole family had me instead to the hospital to bring the riper sulkish woman with the peach pit pockmark on her forehead and the breasts like two full pails did not offer to explain her scar she was the notorious tina for whom nothing was too funny occasionally garp ran into herr doktor thalhammer there and once he walked with thalhammer to thalhammers car they happened to be leaving the hospital together do you want a lift thalhammer offered him pleasantly in the car was a pretty young schoolgirl whom thalhammer introduced to garp is his daughter they all talked easily about die vereinigten staaten and thalhammer assured garp it was no trouble to drive garp all the way to his doorstep at the schwindgasse thalhammers daughter reminded garp of helen but he could not even imagine asking to see the girl again that her father had recently treated him for clap seemed to garp to be an insurmountable awkwardnessdespite thalhammers optimism that people can adjust to anything garp doubted that thalhammer could have adjusted to that all around garp now the city looked ripe with dying the teeming parks and gardens reeked of decay to him and the subject of the great painters in the great museums was always death there were always cripples and old people riding the no strassenbahn out to grinzinger allee and the heady flowers planted along the pruned paths of the courtyard in the rudolfinerhaus reminded garp only of funeral parlors he recalled the pensions he and jenny had stayed in when they first arrived over a year ago the faded and unmatched wallpaper the dusty bricabrac the chipped china the hinges crying for oil in the life of a man wrote marcus aurelius his time is but a momenthis body a prey of worms the young nurses aide whom garp had embarrassed by asking about charlottes purse was increasingly snotty to him one day when he arrived early before visitors were permitted she asked him a little too aggressively what he was to charlotte anyway a member of the family she had seen charlottes other visitorsher gaudy colleaguesand she assumed garp was just an old hookers customer shes my mother garp said he didnt know why but he appreciated the shock of the young nurses aide and her subsequent respect what did you tell them charlotte whispered to him a few days later they think youre my son he confessed his lie charlotte confessed she had done nothing to correct it thank you she whispered its nice to trick the swine they think theyre so superior and mustering her former and fading lewdness she said id let you have it once for free if i still had the equipment maybe twice for half price she said he was touched and cried in front of her dont be a baby she said what am i to you really when she was asleep he read on her hospital chart that she was fiftyone she died a week later when garp went to her room it was whisked clean the bed stripped back the windows wide open when he asked for her there was a nurse in charge of the floor whom he didnt recognizean irongray maiden who kept shaking her head frдulein charlotte garp said she was herr doktor thalhammers patient he has lots of patients said the irongray maiden she was consulting a list but garp did not know charlottes real name finally he could think of no other way to identify her the whore he said she was a whore the gray woman regarded him coolly if garp could detect no satisfaction in her expression he could detect no sympathy either the prostitute is dead the old nurse said perhaps garp only imagined that he heard a little triumph in her voice one day meine frau he said to her you will be dead too and that he thoughtleaving the rudolfinerhauswas a properly viennese thing to say take that you old gray city you dead bitch he thought he went to his first opera that night to his surprise it was in italian and since he understood none of it he took the whole performance to be a kind of religious service he walked in the night to the fit spires of saint stephens the south tower of the cathedral he read on some plaque was started in the middle of the fourteenth century and completed in vienna garp thought was a cadaver all europe maybe was a dressedup corpse in an open coffin in the life of a man wrote marcus aurelius his time is but a momenthis fortune dark in this mood garp walked home on the kдrntnerstrasse where he met the notorious tina her deep pockmark harboring the neon of the city lights was a greenish blue guten abend herr garp she said guess what tina explained that charlotte had bought garp a favor the favor was that garp could have tina and wanga for free he could have them one at a time or both together tina explained together tina thought was more interestingand quicker but perhaps garp did not like both of them garp admitted that wanga did not appeal to him she was too close to his own age and though he would never say this if she were here and her feelings could be hurt he did not care for the way the mayonnaise jar had pulled her lip askew then you can have me twice tina said cheerfully once now and once she added after youve had a long time to catch your breath forget charlotte tina said death happened to everyone tina explained even so garp politely declined the offer well its here tina said when you want it she reached out and frankly cupped him in her warm palm her big hand was an ample codpiece for him but garp only smiled and bowed to heras the viennese doand walked home to his mother he enjoyed his slight pain he took pleasure in this silly selfdenialand more pleasure in his imagination of tina he suspected than he ever could have derived from her vaguely gross flesh the silvery gouge on her forehead was nearly as big as her mouth her pockmark looked to garp like a small open grave what garp was savoring was the beginning of a writers longsought trance wherein the world falls under one embracing tone of voice all that is body is as coursing waters garp remembered all that is of the soul as dreams and vapors it was july when garp went back to work on the pension grillparzer his mother was finishing up the manuscript that would soon change both their lives it was august when jenny finished her book and announced that she was ready to travel to at last see something of europemaybe greece she suggested lets take the train somewhere she said i always wanted to take the orient express wheres it go from paris to istanbul i think garp said but you take it mom ive got too much work to do tit for tat jenny had to admit she was so sick of a sexual suspect that she couldnt even proofread it one more time she didnt even know what to do with it now did one just go to new york and hand over ones life story to a stranger she wanted garp to read it but she saw that garp was at last engrossed in a task of his own she felt sbe shouldnt bother him besides she was unsure a large part of her life story was his life story tooshe thought the story might upset him garp worked through august on the conclusion of his short story the pension grillparzer helen exasperated wrote to jenny is garp dead she asked kindly send details that helen holm is a bright girl jenny thought helen got more of an answer than she counted on jenny sent her a copy of the manuscript of a sexual suspect with a note explaining that this was what shed been doing all year and now garp was writing something too jenny said she would appreciate helens candid opinion of the manuscript perhaps said jenny some of helens college teachers would know what one did with a finished book garp relaxed when he wasnt writing by going to the zoo it was a part of the great grounds and gardens surrounding the schцnbrunn palace it appeared to garp that many of the buildings in the zoo were war ruins threequarters destroyed they had been partially restored to house the animals this gave garp the eerie impression that the zoo still existed in viennas war period it also interested him in the period to fall asleep at night he took to reading some very specific historical accounts of vienna during the nazi and the russian occupations this was not unrelated to the death themes that haunted his writing of the pension grillparzer garp discovered that when you are writing something everything seems related to everything else vienna was dying the zoo was not as well restored from the war damage as the homes the people lived in the history of a city was like the history of a familythere is closeness and even affection but death eventually separates everyone from each other it is only the vividness of memory that keeps the dead alive forever a writers job is to imagine everything so personally that the fiction is as vivid as our personal memories he felt the holes from the machinegun fire in the stone walls of the lobby of the apartment on the schwindgasse now he knew what the grandmothers dream meant he wrote helen that a young writer needs desperately to live with someone and he had decided that he wanted to live with her even marry her he offered because sex was simply necessary but it took too much of ones time if one had to be constantly planning how one was going to get it therefore garp reasoned it is better to live with it helen revised several letters before she finally sent him one that said he could so to speak go stick it in his ear did he think she was going through college so rigorously so that she could provide him with sex that was not even necessary to plan he did not revise at all his letter back to her he said he was too busy writing to take the time to explain it to her she would have to read what he was working on and judge for herself how serious he was i dont doubt that youre quite serious she told him and right now i have more to read than i need to know she did not tell him that she was referring to jennys book a sexual suspect it was manuscript pages long though helen would later agree with garp that it was no literary jewel she had to admit that it was a very compelling story while garp put the finishing touches on his much shorter story jenny fields plotted her next move in her restlessness she had bought an american news magazine at a large vienna newsstand in it she had read that a courageous new york editor at a wellknown publishing house had just rejected the manuscript submitted by an infamous former member of the government who had been convicted of stealing government money the book was a thinly disguised fiction of the criminals own sordid pitty political dealings it was a lousy novel the editor was quoted as saying the man cant write why should he make any money off his crummy life the book of course would be published elsewhere and it would eventually make its despicable author and its publisher lots of money sometimes i feel it is my responsibility to say no the editor was quoted as saying even if i know people do want to read this slop the slop eventually would be treated to several serious reviews just as if it were a serious book but jenny was greatly impressed with the editor who had said no and she clipped the article out of the news magazine she drew a circle around the editors namea plain name almost like an actors name or the name of an animal in a childrens book john wolf there was a picture of john wolf in the magazine he looked like a man who took care of himself and he was very well dressed he looked like any number of people who work and live in new yorkwhere good business and good sense suggest that youd better take care of yourself and dress as well as you canbut to jenny fields he looked like an angel he was going to be her publisher she was sure she was convinced that her life was not crummy and that john wolf would believe she deserved to make money off it garp had other ambitions for the pension grillparzer it would never make him much money it would first appear in a serious magazine where almost no one would read it years later when he was better known it would be published in a more attentive way and several appreciative things would be written about it but in his lifetime the pension grillparzer wouldnt make garp enough money to buy a good car garp however expected more than money or transportation from the pension grillparzer very simply he expected to get helen holm to live with himeven marry him when he finished the pension grillparzer he announced to his mother that he wanted to go home and see helen he would send her a copy of the story and she could have read it by the time he arrived back in the united states poor helen jenny thought jenny knew that helen had a lot to read jenny also worried how garp referred to steering as home but she had reasons of her own for wanting to see helen and ernie holm would not mind their company for a few days there was always the parental mansion at dogs head harborif garp and jenny needed a place to recover or to make their plans garp and jenny were such singularly obsessed people that they did not pause to wonder why they had seen so little of europe and now they were leaving jenny packed her nursing uniforms there remained in garps mind only the favors that charlotte had left up to tinas devising garps imagination of these favors had sustained him during the writing of the pension grillparzer but as he would learn all his life the demands of writing and of real life are not always similar his imagination sustained him when he was writing now that he wasnt writing he wanted tina he went to look for her on the kдrntnerstrasse but the mayonnaisejar whore who spoke english told him that tina had moved from the first district so goes it wanga said forget tina garp found that he could forget her lust as his mother called it was tricky that way and time he discovered had softened his dislike of wangas mayonnaisejar lip suddenly he liked it and so he had her twice and as he would learn all his life nearly everything seems a letdown after a writer has finished writing something garp and jenny had spent fifteen months in vienna it was september garp and helen were only nineteen and helen would be going back to college very soon the plane flew from vienna to frankfurt the slight tingling that was wanga quietly left garps flesh when garp thought of charlotte he imagined that charlotte had been happy after all she had never had to leave the first district the plane flew from frankfurt to london garp reread the pension grillparzer and hoped that helen would not turn him down from london to new york jenny read her sons story in terms of what shed spent more than a year doing garps story struck jenny as rather unreal but her taste for literature was never keen and she marveled at her sons imagination later she would say that the pension grillparzer was just the sort of story shed expect a boy without a proper family to make up maybe so helen would later say that it is in the conclusion of the pension grillparzer that we can glimpse what the world according to garp would be like the pension grillparzer conclusion in the breakfast room of the pension grillparzer we confronted herr theobald with the menagerie of his other guests who had disrupted our evening i knew that as never before my father was planning to reveal himself as a tourist bureau spy men walking about on their hands said father men looking under the floor of the wc said grandmother that man i said and pointed to the small sulking fellow at the corner table seated for breakfast with his cohortsthe dream man and the hungarian singer he does it for his living herr theobold told us and as if to demonstrate that this was so the man who stood on his hands began to stand on his hands make him stop that father said we know he can do it but did you know that he cant do it any other way the dream man asked suddenly did you know his legs were useless he has no shinbones it is wonderful that he can walk on his hands otherwise he wouldnt walk at all the man although it was clearly hard to do while standing on his hands nodded his head please sit down mother said it is perfectly all right to be crippled grandmother said boldly but you are evil she told the dream man you know things you have no right to know he knew my dream she told herr theobald as if she were reporting a theft from her room he is a little evil i know theobald admitted but not usually and he behaves better and better he cant help what he knows i was just trying to straighten you out the dream man told grandmother i thought it would do you good your husband has been dead quite a while after all and its about time you stopped making so much of that dream youre not the only person whos had such a dream stop it grandmother said well you ought to know said the dream man no be quiet please herr theobald told him i am from the tourist bureau father announced probably because he couldnt think of anything else to say oh my god shit herr theobald said its not theobalds fault said the singer its our fault hes nice to put up with us though it costs him his reputation they married my sister theobald told us they are family you see what can i do they married your sister mother said well she married me first said the dream man and then she heard me sing the singer said shes never been married to the other one theobald said and everyone looked apologetically toward the man who could only walk on his hands theobald said they were once a circus act but politics got them in trouble we were the best in hungary said the singer you ever hear of the circus szolnok no im afraid not father said seriously we played in miskolc in szeged in debrecen said the dream man twice in szeged the singer said we would have made it to budapest if it hadnt been for the russians said the man who walked on his hands yes it was the russians who removed his shinbones said the dream man tell the truth the singer said he was born without shinbones but its true that we couldnt get along with the russians they tried to jail the bear said the dream man tell the truth theobald said we rescued his sister from them said the man who walked on his hands so of course i must put them up said herr theobald and they work as hard as they can but whos interested in their act in this country its a hungarian thing theres no tradition of bears on unicycles here theobald told us and the damn dreams mean nothing to us viennese tell the truth said the dream man it is because i have told the wrong dreams we worked a nightclub on the kдrntnerstrasse but then we got banned you should never have told that dream the singer said gravely well it was your wifes responsibility too the dream man said she was your wife then the singer said please stop it theobald begged we get to do the balls for childrens diseases the dream man said and some of the state hospitalsespecially at christmas if you would only do more with the bear herr theobald advised them speak to your sister about that said the singer its her bearshes trained him shes let him get lazy and sloppy and full of bad habits he is the only one of you who never makes fun of me said the man who could only walk on his hands i would like to leave all this grandmother said this is for me an awful experience please dear lady herr theobold said we only wanted to show you that we meant no offense these are hard times i need the b rating to attract more tourists and i cantin my heartthrow out the circus szolnok in his heart my ass said the dream man hes afraid of his sister he wouldnt dream of throwing us out if he dreamed it you would know it cried the man on his hands i am afraid of the bear herr theobald said it does everything she tells it to do say he not it said the man on his hands he is a fine bear and he never hurt anybody he has no claws you know perfectly welland very few teeth either the poor thing has a terribly hard time eating herr theobald admitted he is quite old and hes messy over my fathers shoulder i saw him write in the giant pad a depressed bear and an unemployed circus this family is centered on the sister at that moment out on the sidewalk we could see her tending to the bear it was early morning and the street was not especially busy by law of course she had the bear on a leash but it was a token control in her startling red turban the woman walked up and down the sidewalk following the lazy movements of the bear on his unicycle the animal pedaled easily from parking meter to parking meter sometimes leaning a paw on the meter as he turned he was very talented on the unicycle you could tell but you could also tell that the unicycle was a dead end for him you could see that the bear felt he could go no further with unicycling she should bring him off the street now herr theobald fretted the people in the pastry shop next door complain to me he told us they say the bear drives their customers away that bear makes the customers come said the man on his hands it makes some people come it turns some away said the dream man he was suddenly somber as if his profundity had depressed him but we had been so taken up with the antics of the circus szolnok that we had neglected old johanna when my mother saw that grandmother was quietly crying she told me to bring the car around its been too much for her my father whispered to theobald the circus szolnok looked ashamed of themselves outside on the sidewalk the bear pedaled up to me and handed me the keys the car was parked at the curb not everyone likes to be given the keys in that fashion herr theobald told his sister oh i thought hed rather like it she said rumpling my hair she was as appealing as a barmaid which is to say that she was more appealing at night in the daylight i could see that she was older than her brother and older than her husbands tooand in time i imagined she would cease being lover and sister to them respectively and become a mother to them all she was already a mother to the bear come over here she said to him he pedaled listlessly in place on his unicycle holding on to a parking meter for support he licked the little glass face of the meter she tugged his leash he stared at her she tugged again insolently the bear began to pedalfirst one way then the next it was as if he took interest seeing that he had an audience he began to show off dont try anything the sister said to him but the bear pedaled faster and faster going forward going backward angling sharply and veering among the parking meters the sister had to let go of the leash duna stop it she cried but the bear was out of control he let the wheel roll too close to the curb and the unicycle pitched him hard into the fender of a parked car he sat on the sidewalk with the unicycle beside him you could tell that he hadnt injured himself but he looked very embarrassed and nobody laughed oh duna the sister said scoldingly but she went over and crouched beside him at the curb duna duna she reproved him gently he shook his big head he would not look at her there was some saliva strung on the fur near his mouth and she wiped this away with her hand he pushed her hand away with his paw come back again cried herr theobald miserably as we got into our car mother sat in the car with her eyes closed and her fingers massaging her temples this way she seemed to hear nothing we said she claimed it was her only defense against traveling with such a contentious family i did not want to report on the usual business concerning the care of the car but i saw that father was trying to maintain order and calm he had the giant pad spread on his lap as if wed just completed a routine investigation what does the gauge tell us he asked someone put thirtyfive kilometers on it i said that terrible bear has been in here grandmother said there are hairs from the beast on the back seat and i can smell him i dont smell anything father said and the perfume of that gypsy in the turban grandmother said it is hovering near the ceiling of the car father and i sniffed mother continued to massage her temples on the floor by the brake and clutch pedals i saw several of the mintgreen toothpicks that the hungarian singer was in the habit of wearing like a scar at the corner of his mouth i didnt mention them it was enough to imagine them allout on the town in our car the singing driver the man on his hands beside himwaving out the window with his feet and in back separating the dream man from his former wifehis great head brushing the upholstered roof his mauling paws relaxed in his large lapthe old bear slouched like a benign drunk those poor people mother said her eyes still closed liars and criminals grandmother said mystics and refugees and brokendown animals they were trying hard father said but they werent coming up with the prizes better off in a zoo said grandmother i had a good time robo said its hard to break out of class c i said they have fallen post z said old johanna they have disappeared from the human alphabet i think this calls for a letter mother said but father raised his handas if he were going to bless usand we were quiet he was writing in the giant pad and wished to be undisturbed his face was stern i knew that grandmother felt confident of his verdict mother knew it was useless to argue robo was already bored i steered us off through the tiny streets i took spiegelgasse to lobkowitzplatz spiegelgasse is so narrow that you can see the reflection of your own car in the windows of the shops you pass and i felt our movement through vienna was superimposedlike thatlike a trick with a movie camera as if we made a fairytale journey through a toy city when grandmother was asleep in the car mother said i dont suppose that in this case a change in the classification will matter very much one way or another no father said not much at all he was right about that though it would be years until i saw the pension grillparzer again when grandmother died rather suddenly and in her sleep mother announced that she was tired of traveling the real reason however was that she began to find herself plagued by grandmothers dream the horses are so thin she told me once i mean i always knew they would be thin but not this thin and the soldiersi knew they were miserable she said but not that miserable father resigned from the tourist bureau and found a job with a local detective agency specializing in hotels and department stores it was a satisfactory job for him though he refused to work durinq the christmas seasonwhen he said some people ought to be allowed to steal a little my parents seemed to me to relax as they got older and i really felt they were fairly happy near the end i know that the strength of grandmothers dream was dimmed by the real world and specifically by what happened to robo he went to a private school and was well liked there but he was killed by a homemade bomb in his first year at the university he was not even political in his last letter to my parents he wrote the selfseriousness of the radical factions among the students is much overrated and the food is execrable then robo went to his history class and his classroom was blown apart it was after my parents died that i gave up smoking and took up traveling again i took my second wife back to the pension grillparzer with my first wife i never got as far as vienna the grillparzer had not kept fathers b rating very long and it had fallen from the ratings altogether by the time i returned to it herr theobalds sister was in charge of the place gone was her tort appeal and in its place was the sexless cynicism of some maiden aunts she was shapeless and her hair was dyed a sort of bronze so that her head resembled one of those copper scouring pads that you use on a pot she did not remember me and was suspicious of my questions because i appeared to know so much about her past associates she probably knew i was with the police the hungarian singer had gone awayanother woman thrilled by his voice the dream man had been taken awayto an institution his own dreams had turned to nightmares and hed awakened the pension each night with his horrifying howls his removal from the seedy premises said herr theobalds sister was almost simultaneous with the loss of the grillparzers b rating herr theobald was dead he had dropped down clutching his heart in the hall where he ventured one night to investigate what he thought was a prowler it was only duna the malcontent bear who was dressed in the dream mans pinstriped suit why theobalds sister had dressed the bear in this fashion was not explained to me but the shock of the sullen animal unicycling in the lunatics leftbehind clothes had been enough to scare herr theobald to death the man who could only walk on his hands had also fallen into the gravest trouble his wristwatch snagged on a tine of an escalator and he was suddenly unable to hop off his necktie which he rarely wore because it dragged on the ground when he walked on his hands was drawn under the stepoff grate at the end of the escalatorwhere he was strangled behind him a line of people formedmarching in place by taking one step back and allowing the escalator to carry them forward then taking another step back it was quite a while before anyone got up the nerve to step over him the world has many unintentionally cruel mechanisms that are not designed for people who walk on their hands after that theobalds sister told me the pension grillparzer went from class c to much worse as the burden of management fell more heavily on her she had less time for duna and the bear grew senile and indecent in his habits once he bullied a mailman down a marble staircase at such a ferocious pace that the man fell and broke his hip the attack was reported and an old city ordinance forbidding unrestrained animals in places open to the public was enforced duna was outlawed at the pension grillparzer for a while theobalds sister kept the bear in a cage in the courtyard of the building but he was taunted by dogs and children and food and worse was dropped into his cage from the apartments that faced the courtyard he grew unbearlike and deviousonly pretending to sleepand he ate most of someones cat then he was poisoned twice and became afraid to eat anything in this perilous environment there was no alternative but to donate him to the schцnbrunn zoo but there was even some doubt as to his acceptability he was toothless and ill perhaps contagious and his long history of having been treated as a human being did not prepare him for the gentler routine of zoo life his outdoor sleeping quarters in the courtyard of the grillparzer had inflamed his rheumatism and even his one talent unicycling was irretrievable when he first tried it in the zoo he fell someone laughed once anyone laughed at something duna did theobalds sister explained duna would never do that thing again he became at last a kind of charity case at schцnbrunn where he died a short two months after hed taken up his new lodgings in the opinion of theobalds sister duna died of mortificationthe result of a rash that spread over his great chest which then had to be shaved a shaved bear one zoo official said is embarrassed to death in the cold courtyard of the building i looked in the bears empty cage the birds hadnt left a fruit seed but in a corner of his cage was a looming mound of the bears ossified droppingsvoid of life and even odor as the corpses captured by the holocaust at pompeii i couldnt help thinking of robo of the bear there were more remains in the car i was further depressed to notice that not one kilometer had been added to the gauge not one kilometer had been driven in secret there was no one around to take liberties anymore when were a safe distance away from your precious pension grillparzer my second wife said to me id like you to tell me why you brought me to such a shabby place its a long story i admitted i was thinking i had noticed a curious lack of either enthusiasm or bitterness in the account of the world by theobalds sister there was in her story the flatness one associates with a storyteller who is accepting of unhappy endings as if her life and her companions had never been exotic to heras if they had always been staging a ludicrous and doomed effort at reclassification more lust and so she married him she did what he asked helen thought it was a pretty good story for a start old tinch liked it too it is rich with lululunacy and sorrow tinch told garp tinch recommended that garp send the pension grillparzer to tinchs favorite magazine garp waited three months for this reply the story is only mildly interesting and it does nothing new with language or with form thanks for showing it to us though garp was puzzled and he showed the rejection to tinch tinch was also puzzled i guess theyre interested in nnnewer fiction tinch said whats that garp asked tinch admitted he didnt really know the new fiction is interested in language and in ffform i guess tinch said but i dont understand what its really about sometimes its about itititself i think tinch said about itself garp said its sort of fiction about fififiction tinch told him garp still didnt understand but what mattered to garp was that helen liked the story almost fifteen years later when garp published his third novel that same editor at tinchs favorite magazine would write garp a letter the letter would be very flattering to garp and to his work and it would ask garp to submit anything new he might have written to tinchs favorite magazine but t s garp had a tenacious memory and the indignation of a badger he found the old rejection note that had called his grillparzer story only mildly interesting the note was crusty with coffee stains and had been folded so many times that it was torn at the creases but garp enclosed it with a letter to the editor at tinchs favorite magazine garps letter said i am only mildly interested in your magazine and i am still doing nothing new with language or with form thanks for asking me though garp had a foolish ego that went out of its way to remember insults to and rejections of his work it is fortunate for helen that she had a ferocious ego of her own for if she hadnt highly esteemed herself she would have ended up hating him as it was they were lucky many couples live together and discover theyre not in love some couples never discover it others marry and the news comes to them at awkward moments in their lives in the case of garp and helen they hardly knew each other but they had their hunchesand in their stubborn deliberate ways they fell in love with each other sometime after they had married perhaps because they were so busy pursuing their singular careers they did not overscrutinize their relationship helen would graduate from college two years after she began she would have a phd in english literature when she was only twentythree and her first joban assistant professor at a womens collegewhen she was twentyfour it would take garp five years to finish his first novel but it would be a good novel and it would earn him a respectable reputation for a young writereven if it wouldnt make him any money by then helen would be making money for them all the time that helen went to school and garp was writing jenny took care of the money jennys book was more of a shock to helen when she first read it than it was to garpwho after all had lived with his mother and was unsurprised by her eccentricity it had become commonplace to him garp however was shocked by the books success he had not counted on becoming a public figurea leading character in someone elses book before hed even written a book of his own the editor john wolf would never forget the first morning at his office where he met jenny fields theres a nurse to see you his secretary said rolling her eyesas if this might be a paternity suit that her boss had on his hands john wolf and his secretary could not have known that a manuscript of typed pages was what made jennys suitcase so heavy its about me she told john wolf opening her suitcase and hefting the monster manuscript to the top of his desk when can you read it it looked to john wolf as if the woman intended to stay in his office while he read it he glanced at the first sentence in this dirtyminded world and he thought oh boy how do i get rid of this one later of course he was panicstricken when he could not find a phone number for her when he wanted to tell her that yesthey would certainly publish thishe could not have known that jenny fields was the proper guest of ernie holm at steering where jenny and ernie talked into the night every night the usual parental concern when parents discover that their nineteenyearold children plan to get married where can they go every night jenny asked they dont come back here until two or three and last night it rained it rained all night and they dont even have a car they went to the wrestling room helen of course had a key and a wrestling mat was as comfortable and familiar to them as any bed and much bigger they say they want children ernie complained helen should finish her education garp will never finish a book with children jenny said after all she was thinking that shed had to wait eighteen years to begin her book theyre both hard workers ernie said to reassure himself and jenny theyll have to be jenny said i dont know why they cant just live together ernie said and if it works out then let them get marriedthen let them have a baby i dont know why anyone wants to live with anyone else said jenny fields ernie looked a little hurt well you like garp living with you he reminded her and i like helen living with me i really miss her when shes away at school its lust jenny said ominously the world is sick with lust ernie felt worried about her he didnt know she was about to become rich and famous forever do you want a beer he asked jenny no thank you jenny said theyre good kids ernie reminded her but lust gets them all in the end said jenny fields morosely and ernie holm walked delicately to his kitchen and opened another beer for himself it was the lust chapter of a sexual suspect that especially embarrassed garp it was one thing to be a famous child born out of wedlock quite another to be a famous case history of adolescent needhis private randiness become a popular story helen thought it was very funny though she confessed to not understanding his attraction to whores lust makes the best men behave out of character wrote jenny fieldsa line that particularly infuriated garp what the hell does she know about it he screamed she never felt it not once some authority she is its like listening to a plant describe the motives of a mammal but other reviewers were kinder to jenny though the more serious journals occasionally chided her for her actual writing the media in general felt warmly toward the book the first truly feminist autobiography that is as full of celebrating one kind of life as it is full of putting down another somebody wrote this brave book makes the important assertion that a woman can have a whole life without a sexual attachment of any kind wrote somebody else these days john wolf had forewarned jenny youre either going to be taken as the right voice at the right time or youre going to be put down as all wrong she was taken as the right voice at the right time but jenny fields sitting whitely in her nurses uniformin the restaurant where john wolf took only his favorite writersfelt discomfort at the word feminism she was not sure what it meant but the word reminded her of feminine hygiene and the valentine treatment after all her formal training had been nursing she said shyly that shed only thought she made the right choice about how to live her life and since it had not been a popular choice shed felt goaded into saying something to defend it ironically a rash of young women at florida state university in tallahassee found jennys choice very popular they generated a small controversy by plotting their own pregnancies for a while in new york this syndrome among singularminded women was called doing a jenny fields but garp always called it doing a grillparzer as for jenny she felt only that womenjust like menshould at least be able to make conscious decisions about the course of their lives if that made her a feminist she said then she guessed she was one john wolf liked jenny fields very much and he did what he could to warn her that she might not understand either the attacks or the praise her book would receive but jenny never wholly understood how political a book it wasor how it would be used as such a book i was trained to be a nurse she said later in one of her disarming interviews nursing was the first thing i took to and the first thing i ever wanted to do it simply seemed very practical to me for someone who was healthyand i have always been bealthyto help people who werent healthy or who couldnt help themselves i think it was simply in that spirit that i wanted to write a book too in garps opinion his mother never stopped being a nurse she had nursed him through the steering school she had been a plodding midwife to her own strange life story finally she became a kind of nurse to women with problems she became a figure of famous strength women sought her advice with the sudden success of a sexual suspect jenny fields uncovered a nation of women who faced making choices about how to live these women felt encouraged by jennys own example of making unpopular decisions she could have started an advice column for any newspaper but jenny fields felt through with writing nowjust as shed decided once before that she was through with education just as shed decided she was through with europe in a way she was never through with nursing her father the shocked shoe king died of a heart attack shortly after the publication of a sexual suspect although jennys mother never blamed jennys book for the tragedyand jenny never blamed herselfjenny knew that her mother could not live alone unlike jenny fields jennys mother had developed a habit of living with someone else she was old now and jenny thought of her as rattling about in the great rooms at dogs head harbor purposeless and wholly without her few remaining wits in the absence of her mate jenny went to care for her and it was at the dogs head harbor mansion that jenny first began her role as counselor to the women who sought some comfort from her nononsense ability to make decisions even weird decisions garp wailed but he was happy and taken care of he and helen had their first child almost immediately it was a boy named duncan garp often joked that the reason his first novel was written with so many short chapters was because of duncan garp wrote between feedings and naps and changes of diapers it was a novel of short takes he claimed later and the credit is wholly duncans helen was at school every day she had agreed to have a child only if garp would agree to take care of it garp loved the idea of never having to go out he wrote and took care of duncan he cooked and wrote and took care of duncan some more when helen came home she came home to a reasonably happy homemaker as long as garps novel progressed no routine however mindless could upset him in fact the more mindless the better he left duncan for two hours every day with the woman in the downstairs apartment he went to the gym he later became an oddity at the womens college where helen taughtrunning endless laps around the field hockey field or jumping rope for half an hour in a corner of the gymnasium reserved for gymnastics he missed wrestling and complained to helen that she should have gotten a job somewhere where there was a wrestling team helen complained that the english department was too small and she disliked having no male students in her classes but it was a good job and she would keep it until something better came along everything in new england is at least near everything else they got to visit jenny at the shore and ernie at steering garp would take duncan to the steering wrestling room and roll him around like a ball this is where your daddy wrestled he told him its where your daddy did everything helen told duncan referringof courseto duncans own conception and to her first rainy night with garp in the locked and empty seabrook gymnasium on the warm crimson mats stretching wall to wall well you finally got me helen had whispered to him tearfully but garp had sprawled there on his back on the wrestling mat wondering who had gotten whom when jennys mother died jenny visited helen and garp more frequently though garp objected to what he called his mothers entourage jenny fields traveled with a small core of adorers or with occasional other figures who felt they were part of what would be called the womens movement they often wanted jennys support or her endorsement there was often a case or a cause that needed jennys pure white uniform on the speakers platform although jenny rarely spoke very much or for very long after the other speeches they would introduce the author of a sexual suspect in her nurses uniform she was instantly recognizable into her fifties jenny fields would remain an athletically attractive woman crisp and plain she would rise and say this is right or sometimes this is wrongdepending on the occasion she was the decision maker whod made the hard choices in her own life and therefore she could be counted on to be on the right side of a womans problem the logic behind all this made garp fume and stew for days and once an interviewer from a womens magazine asked if she could come interview him about what it was like to be the son of a famous feminist when the interviewer discovered garps chosen life his housewifes role as she gleefully called it garp blew up at her im doing what i want to do he said dont call it by any other name im just doing what i want to doand thats all my mother ever did too just what she wanted to do the interviewer pressed him she said he sounded bitter of course it must be hard she suggested being an unknown writer with a mother whose book was known around the world garp said it was mainly painful to be misunderstood and that he did not resent his mothers success he only occasionally disliked her new associates those stooges who are living off her he said the article in the womens magazine pointed out that garp was also living off his mother very comfortably and that he had no right to be hostile toward the womens movement that was the first time garp heard of it the womens movement it was not many days after this that jenny came to visit him one of her goons as garp called them was with her a large silent sullen woman who lurked in the doorway of garps apartment and declined to take her coat off she looked warily at little duncan as if she awaited with extreme displeasure the moment when the child might touch her helens at the library garp told jenny i was going to take duncan for a walk you want to come jenny looked questioningly at the big woman with her the woman shrugged garp thought that mothers greatest weakness since her success was to be in his words used by all the crippled and infirm women who wished theyd written a sexual suspect or something equally successful garp resented standing cowed in his own apartment by his mothers speechless companion a woman large enough to be his mothers bodyguard perhaps thats what she is he thought and an unpleasant image of his mother with a tough dyke escort crossed his minda vicious killer who would keep the mens hands off jennys white uniform is there something the matter with that womans tongue mom garp whispered to jenny the superiority of the big womans silence outraged him duncan was trying to talk with her but the woman merely fixed the child with a quieting eye jenny quietly informed garp that the woman wasnt talking because the woman was without a tongue literally it was cut off jenny said jesus garp whispered howd it happen jenny rolled her eyes it was a habit shed picked up from her son you really read nothing dont you jenny asked him you just never have bothered to keep up with whats going on what was going on in garps opinion was never as important as what he was making upwhat he was working on one of the things that upset him about his mother since shed been adopted by womens politics was that she was always discussing the news this is news you mean garp said its such a famous tongue accident that i should have heard about it oh god jenny said wearily not a famous accident very deliberate mother did someone cut her tongue off precisely jenny said jesus garp said you havent heard of ellen james jenny asked no garp admitted well theres a whole society of women now jenny informed him because of what happened to ellen james what happened to her garp asked two men raped her when she was eleven years old jenny said then they cut her tongue off so she couldnt tell anyone who they were or what they looked like they were so stupid that they didnt know an elevenyearold could write ellen james wrote a very careful description of the men and they were caught and they were tried and convicted in jail someone murdered them wow garp said so thats ellen james he whispered indicating the big quiet woman with new respect jenny rolled her eyes again no she said that is someone from the ellen james society ellen james is still a child shes a wispylooking little blond girl you mean this ellen james society goes around not talking garp said as if they didnt have any tongues no i mean they dont have any tongues jenny said people in the ellen james society have their tongues cut off to protest what happened to ellen james oh boy garp said looking at the large woman with renewed dislike they call themselves ellen jamesians jenny said i dont want to hear any more of this shit mom garp said well that woman there is an ellen jamesian jenny said you wanted to know how old is ellen james now garp asked shes twelve jenny said it happened only a year ago and these ellen jamesians garp asked do they have meetings and elect presidents and treasurers and stuff like that why dont you ask her jenny said indicating the lunk by the door i thought you didnt want to hear any more about it how can i ask her if she doesnt have a tongue to answer me garp hissed she writes jenny said all ellen jamesians carry little note pads around with them and they write you what they want to say you know what writing is dont you fortunately helen came home garp would see more of the ellen jamesians although he felt deeply disturbed by what had happened to ellen james he felt only disgust at her grownup sour imitators whose habit was to present you with a card the card said something like hello im martha im an ellen jamesian do you know what an ellen jamesian is and if you didnt know you were handed another card the ellen jamesians represented for garp the kind of women who lionized his mother and sought to use her to help further their crude causes ill tell you something about those women mom he said to jenny once they were probably all lousy at talking anyway they probably never had a worthwhile thing to say in their livesso their tongues were no great sacrifice in fact it probably saves them considerable embarrassment if you see what i mean youre a little short on sympathy jenny told him i have lots of sympathyfor ellen james garp said these women must have suffered in other ways themselves jenny said thats what makes them want to get closer to each other and inflict more suffering on themselves mom rape is every womans problem jenny said garp hated his mothers everyone language most of all a case he thought of carrying democracy to an idiotic extreme its every mans problem too mom the next time theres a rape suppose i cut my prick off and wear it around my neck would you respect that too were talking about sincere gestures jenny said were talking about stupid gestures garp said but he would always remember his first ellen jamesianthe big woman who came to his apartment with his mother when she left she wrote garp out a note and slipped it into his hand as if it were a tip moms got a new bodyguard garp whispered to helen as they waved goodbye then he read the bodyguards note your mother is worth of you the note said but he couldnt really complain about his mother for the first five years garp and helen were married jenny paid their bills garp joked that he called his first novel procrastination because it had taken him so long to write it but he had worked on it steadily and carefully garp was rarely a procrastinator the novel was called historical it is set in the vienna of the war years and through the period of the russian occupation the main character is a young anarchist who has to lie low after the anschluss waiting for just the right blow he can strike against the nazis he waits too long the point being he should better have struck before the nazi takeover but there is nothing he can be sure of then and he is too young to recognize what is happening also his mothera widowcherishes her private life unconcerned with politics she hoards her dead husbands money through the war years the young anarchist works as a zookeeper at schцnbrunn when the population of vienna begins seriously starving and midnight raids on the zoo are a common source of stolen food the anarchist decides to liberate the remaining animalswho are of course innocent of his countrys own procrastination and its acquiescence to nazi germany but by then the animals themselves are starving when the anarchist frees them they eat him that was only natural garp wrote the animals in turn are slaughtered easily by a starving mob now roaming vienna for foodjust ahead of the russian forces that too was only natural the anarchists mother survives the war and lives in the russian zone of occupation garp gave her the same apartment he and his mother shared on the schwindgasse the miserly widows tolerance is finally wearied by the repeated atrocities she now sees committed by the sovietsrape chief among them she watches the city restored to moderation and complacency and she remembers her own inertia during the nazi rise to power with great regret finally the russians leave it is and vienna retreats into itself again but the woman mourns her son and her damaged country she strolls the partially rebuilt and once again healthy zoo at schцnbrunn every weekend recalling her secretive visits to her son there during the war it is the hungarian revolution that prompts the old ladys final action hundreds of thousands of new refugees come into vienna in an effort to awaken the complacent citythat it must not sit back and watch things develop againthe mother tries to do what her son did she releases the animals in the schцnbrunn zoo but the animals are well fed and content now only a few of them can even be goaded into leaving their cages and those who do wander out are easily confined in the schцnbrunn paths and gardens eventually theyre returned to their cages unharmed one elderly bear suffers a bout of violent diarrhea the old womans gesture of liberation is well intended but it is completely meaningless and totally unrealized the old woman is arrested and an examining police doctor discovers that she has cancer she is a terminal case finally and ironically her hoarded money is of some use to her she dies in luxuryin viennas only private hospital the rudolfinerhaus in her death dream she imagines that some animals escape from the zoo a couple of young asiatic black bears she imagines them surviving and multiplying so successfully that they become famous as a new animal species in the valley of the danube but this is only her imagination the novel endsafter the old womans deathwith the death of the diarrhetic bear in the schцnbrunn zoo so much for revolution in modern times wrote one reviewer who called procrastination an antimarxist novel the novel was praised for the accuracy of its historical researcha point of no particular interest to garp it was also cited for originality and for having unusual scope for a first novel by such a young author john wolf had been garps publisher and although he had agreed with garp not to mention on the jacket flap that this was the first novel by the son of the feminist heroine jenny fields there were few reviewers who failed to sound that chime it is amazing that the nowfamous son of jenny fields wrote one has actually grown up to be what he said he wanted to be when be grew up this and other irrelevant cuteness concerning garps relationship to jenny made garp very angry that his book couldnt be read and discussed for its own faults andor merits but john wolf explained to him the hard fact that most readers were probably more interested in who he was than in what hed actually written young mr garp is still writing about bears chided one wit whod been energetic enough to uncover the grillparzer story from its obscure publication perhaps when he grows up hell write something about people but altogether it was a literary debut more astonishing than most and more noticed it was of course never a popular book and it hardly made t s garp into a brand name it would not make him the household productas he called herthat his mother had become but it was not that kind of book he was not that kind of writer and never would be john wolf told him what do you expect john wolf wrote him if you want to be rich and famous get in another line if youre serious about it dont bitch you wrote a serious book it was published seriously if you want to make a living off it youre talking about another world and remember youre twentyfour years old i think youll write a lot more books john wolf was an honorable and intelligent man but garp wasnt sureand he wasnt content he had made a little money and now helen had a salary now that he didnt need jennys money garp felt all right about accepting some when she simply gave it out and he felt hed at least earned another reward to himself he asked helen to have another baby duncan was four he was old enough to appreciate a brother or a sister helen agreed knowing how easy garp had made it for her to have duncan if he wanted to change diapers between the chapters of his next book that was up to him but it was actually more than merely wanting a second child that prompted garp to reproduce again he knew he was an overwatchful worrisome father and he felt he might relieve duncan of some of the pressure of fatherly fears if there was another child to absorb some of garps excess anxiety im very happy helen told him if you want another baby well make one i just wish youd relax i wish youd be happier you wrote a good book now youll write another one isnt it just what you always wanted but he bitched about the reviews of procrastination and he moaned about the sales he carped at his mother and roared about her sycophantic friends finally helen said to him you want too much too much unqualified praise or loveor something thats unqualified anyway you want the world to say i love your writing i love you and thats too much to want thats really sick in fact thats what you said he reminded her i love your writing i love you thats exactly what you said but there can only be one of me helen reminded him indeed there would only be one of her and he loved her very much he would always call her the wisest of my lifes decisions he made some unwise decisions he would admit but in the first five years of his marriage to helen he was unfaithful to her only onceand it was brief it was a babysitter from the college where helen taught a freshman girl from helens freshman english class she was nice with duncan though helen said that the girl was not a very special student her name was cindy she had read garps procrastination and shed been properly awed when he drove her home she would ask him one question after another about his writing how did you think of that and what made you do it this way she was a tiny thing all flutters and twitches and coosas trusting as constant and as stupid as a steering pigeon little squab bones helen called her but garp was attracted he called her nothing the percy family had given him a permanent dislike of nicknames and he liked cindys questions cindy was dropping out of school because she felt a womens college was not right for her she needed to live with grownups and with men she said and although the college allowed her to move offcampusinto her own apartment in the second semester of her freshman yearstill she felt the college was too restricted and she wanted to live in a more real environment she imagined that garps vienna had been a more real environment though garp struggled to assure her that it had not been little squab bones garp thought was puppybrained and as soft and as easily influenced as a banana but he wanted her he realized and he saw her as simply availablelike the whores on the kдrntnerstrasse she would be there when he asked her and she would cost him only lies helen read him a review from a famous news magazine the review called procrastination a complex and moving novel with sharp historic resonancesthe drama encompasses the longings and agonies of youth oh fuck the longings and agonies of youth garp said one of those youthful longings was embarrassing him now as for the drama in the first five years of his marriage to helen t s garp experienced only one reallife drama and it did not have that much to do with him garp had been running in the city park when he found the girl a naked tenyearold running ahead of him on the bridle path when she realized he was gaining on her she fell down and covered her face then covered her crotch then tried to hide her insubstantial breasts it was a cold day late fall and garp saw the blood on the childs thighs and her frightened swollen eyes she screamed and screamed at him what happened to you he asked though he knew very well he looked all around them but there was no one there she hugged her raw knees to her chest and screamed i wont hurt you garp said i want to help you but the child wailed even louder my god of course garp thought the terrible molester had probably said those very words to her not long ago where did he go garp asked her then he changed his tone trying to convince her he was on her side ill kill him for you he told her she stared quietly at him her head shaking and shaking her fingers pinching and pinching the tight skin on her arms please garp said can you tell me where your clothes are he had nothing to give her to wear except his sweaty tshirt he was dressed in his running shorts his running shoes he pulled his tshirt off over his head and felt instantly cold the girl cried out awfully loud and hid her face no dont be frightened its for you to put on garp told her he let the tshirt drop on her but she writhed out from under it and kicked at it then she opened her mouth very wide and bit her own fist she was not old enough to be boy or girl yet garp wrote only in the pudginess around her nipples was there anything faintly girlish there was certainly no visible sex about her hairless pudenda and she had a childs sexless hands perhaps there was something sensual about her mouthher lips were puffybut she had not done that to herself garp began to cry the sky was gray dead leaves were all around them and when garp began to wail aloud the girl picked up his tshirt and covered herself with it they were in this queer position to each otherthe child crouched under garps tshirt cringing at garps feet with garp crying over herwhen the mounted park police a twosome rode up the bridle path and spotted the apparent child molester with his victim garp wrote that one of the policemen split the girl and garp apart by steering his horse between them nearly trampling the girl the other policeman brought his billy down on garps collarbone one side of his body he wrote felt paralyzedbut not the other with the other garp unseated the policeman and tipped him from the saddle its not me you son of a bitch garp howled i just found her just herejust a minute ago the policeman sprawled in the leaves held his drawn gun very still the other policeman mounted and prancing shouted to the girl is it him he yelled the child seemed terrified of the horses she stared back and forth from the horses to garp she probably isnt sure what happened garp thoughtmuch less who but the girl violently shook her head whered he go said the policeman on his horse but the girl still looked at garp she tugged her chin and rubbed her cheeksshe tried to talk to him with her hands apparently her words were gone or her tongue garp thought recalling ellen james its the beard said the cop in the leaves he had gotten to his feet but he had not holstered his gun shes telling us there was a beard garp had a beard then it was someone with a beard said garp like mine he asked the girl stroking his dark round beard glossy with sweat but she shook her head and ran her fingers over her sore upper lip a mustache cried garp and the girl nodded she pointed back the way garp had come but garp remembered seeing no one near the entrance to the park the policeman hunched on his horse and through the thrown leaves he rode away from them the other policeman was calming his horse but he had not remounted cover her or find her clothes garp said to him he started to run down the bridle path after the first policeman he knew there were things you could see from ground level that you couldnt see on a horse also garp was such a fool about his running that he imagined he could outlast if not outrun any horse hey you better wait here the policeman called after him but garp was in stride and clearly not stopping he followed the great rents in the ground that the horse had made he had not gone even half a mile back along the path before he saw the bent figure of a man maybe twentyfive yards off the path and almost hidden by the trees garp yelled at the figure an elderly gentleman with a white mustache who looked over his shoulder at garp with an expression so surprised and ashamed that garp was sure hed found the child molester he thundered through the vines and small whiplike trees to the man who had been peeing and was hastening to fold himself back into his trousers he looked very much like a man caught doing something he shouldnt have done i was just the man began but garp was upon him and thrust his stiff cropped beard into the mans face garp sniffed him over like a hound if its you you bastard i can smell it on you garp said the man flinched away from this halfnaked brute but garp seized both the mans wrists and snapped the mans hands up under his nose he sniffed again and the man cried out as if he feared garp was going to bite him hold still garp said did you do it where are the childs clothes please the man piped i was just going to the bathroom he had not had time to close his fly and garp eyed his crotch suspiciously there is no smell like sex garp wrote you cannot disguise it it is as rich and clear as spilled beer so garp dropped to his knees in the woods and unbuckled the mans belt and tore open the mans pants and yanked the mans undershorts straight down to the mans ankles he stared at the mans frightened equipment help the old gentleman screamed garp took a deep sniff and the man collapsed in the young trees staggering like a puppet strung under the arms he thrashed in a thicket of slender trunks and branches too dense to allow him to fall help god he cried but garp was already running back out to the bridle path his legs digging through the leaves his arms pummeling the air his struck collarbone throbbing at the entrance to the park the mounted policeman clattered about the parking lot peering in parked cars circling the squat brick hut where the rest rooms were a few people watched him sensing his eagerness no mustaches the policeman called to garp if he got back here before you did he could have driven away garp said go look in the mens room the policeman said riding toward a woman with a baby carriage piled high with blankets every mens room made garp remember every wc at the door to this sour place garp passed a young man who was just leaving he was cleanshaven his upper lip so smooth that it almost shone he looked like a college kid garp entered the mens room like a dog with his hair standing up on the back of his neck and his hackles curling he checked for feet under the crapperstall doors he would not have been surprised to see a pair of handsor a bear he looked for backs turned toward him at the long urinalor for anyone at the dirty brown sinks peering into the pitted mirrors but there was no one in the mens room garp sniffed he had worn a full but trimmed beard for a long time and the smell of shaving cream was not instantly recognizable to him he just knew he smelled something foreign to this dank place then he looked in the nearest sink he saw the gobs of lather he saw the whiskers rimming the bowl the young cleanshaven man who looked like a college kid was crossing the parking lot quickly but calmly when garp came out the mens room door its him garp hollered the mounted cop looked at the young molester puzzled he doesnt have a mustache the policeman said he just shaved it off garp cried he ran across the lot straight at the kid who began to run toward the maze of paths lacing the park a litter of things flew out from under his jacket as he ran garp saw the scissors a razor a shaving cream can and then came the little batches of clothesthe girls of course her jeans with a ladybug sewn at the hip a jersey with the beaming face of a frog on the breast of course there was no bra there was no need it was her panties that got to garp they were simply cotton and a simple blue stitched at the waistband was a blue flower sniffed at by a blue bunny the mounted policeman simply rode over the kid who was running away the chest of the horse pounded the kid face forward into the cinder entry path and one rear hoof took a ushaped bite of flesh out of the kids calf he curled fetal on the ground holding his leg garp came up then the girls bluebunny panties in his hand he gave them to the mounted cop other peoplethe woman with the blanketed carriage two boys on bikes a thin man carrying a newspaperapproached them they brought the cop the other things the kid had dropped the razor the rest of the girls clothes nobody spoke garp wrote later that at that moment he saw the short history of the young child molester spread out at the horses hooves the scissors the shaving cream can of course the kid would grow a mustache attack a child shave the mustache which would be all most children would remember have you done this before garp asked the kid youre not supposed to ask him anything the policeman said but the kid grinned stupidly at garp ive never been caught before he told him cockily when he smiled garp saw that the young man had no upper front teeth the horse had kicked them out there was just a bleeding flap of gum garp realized that something had probably happened to this kid so that he didnt feel very muchnot much pain not much of anything else out of the woods at the end of the bridle path the second policeman came walking his horsethe child in the saddle covered by the policemans coat she clutched garps tshirt in her hands she did not seem to recognize anybody the policeman led her right up to where the molester lay on the ground but she didnt really look at him the first policeman dismounted he went to the molester and tilted his bleeding face up toward the child him he asked her she stared at the young man blankly the molester gave a short laugh spat out a mouthful of blood the child made no response then garp gently touched his finger to the molesters mouth with the blood on his finger garp lightly smeared a mustache on the young mans upper lip tbe child began to scream and scream the horses needed quieting the child kept screaming until the second policeman took the molester away then she stopped screaming and gave garp back his tshirt she kept patting the thick ridge of black hair on the back of the horses neck as if she had never been on a horse before garp thought it must have hurt her to sit on horse back but suddenly she asked can i have another ride garp was at least glad to hear that she had a tongue it was then that garp saw the nattily dressed elderly gentleman whose mustache had been innocent he was making his meek way out of the park coming cautiously into the parking lot looking anxiously about for the madman whod so savagely snatched his pants down and sniffed him like some dangerous omnivore when the man saw garp standing beside the policeman he seemed relievedhe assumed garp had been apprehendedand he more boldly walked toward them garp contemplated runningto avoid the confusion the explanationbut just then the policeman said i have to get your name and what it is that you do besides run in the park he laughed im a writer garp told him the policeman was apologetic that he hadnt heard of garp but at the time garp hadnt published anything except the pension grillparzerthere was very little the policeman could have read this seemed to puzzle the policeman an unpublished writer he asked garp was rather glum about it then what do you do for a living the policeman said my wife and my mother support me garp admitted well i have to ask you what they do the policeman said for the record we like to know how everyone makes a living the offended gentleman with the white mustache who had overheard only the last bits of this interrogation said just as i would have thought a vagrant a despicable bum the policeman stared at him in his early unpublished years garp felt angry whenever he was forced to admit how he had enough to live on he felt more like inviting confusion at this moment than he felt moved to clear things up im glad to see youve caught him anyway the old gentleman said this used to be a nice park but the people who get in here these daysyou ought to patrol it more closely he told the policeman who guessed that the old man was referring to the child molester the cop didnt want the business discussed in front of the child so he rolled his eyes up toward hershe sat rigid in the saddleand tried to indicate to the old gentleman why he shouldnt continue oh no he didnt do it to that child the man cried as if hed just noticed her mounted beside him or just noticed she was not dressed under the policemans coather small clothes bugged in her arms how vile he cried glaring at garp how disgusting youll want my name of course he asked the policeman what for the policeman said garp had to smile look at him smirking there the old man cried why as a witness of courseid tell my story to any court in the country if it could condemn such a man as that but what were you a witness to the policeman said why he did thatthingto me too the man said the policeman looked at garp garp rolled his eyes the policeman still clung to the sanity that the old gentleman was referring to the child molester but he didnt understand why garp was being treated with such abuse well sure the policeman said to humor the old fool he took his name and address months later garp was buying a package of three prophylactics when this same old gentleman walked into the drugstore what its you the old man shouted they let you out already did they i thought theyd put you away for years it took garp a moment to recognize the person the druggist assumed that the old codger was a lunatic the gentleman in his trimmed white mustache advanced cautiously on garp whats the law coming to he asked i suppose youre out on good behavior no old men or young girls to sniff in prison i suppose or some lawyer got you off on some slick technicality that poor child traumatized for all her years and youre free to roam the parks youve made a mistake garp told him yes this is mr garp the druggist said he didnt add the writer if hed considered adding anything garp knew it would have been the hero because the druggist had seen the ludicrous newspaper headlines about the crime and capture in the park unsuccessful writer no failure as hero citizen catches park pervert son of famous feminist has knack for helping girls garp was unable to write for months because of it but the article impressed all the locals who knew garp only from the supermarket the gymnasium the drugstore in the meantime procrastination had been publishedbut almost no one seemed to know for weeks clerks and salespeople would introduce him to other customers heres mr garp the one who nabbed that molester in the park what molester that one in city park the mustache kid he went after little girls children well mr garp here is the one who got him well actually garp would say it was the policeman on his horse knocked all his teeth down his throat too they would crow with delightthe druggist and the clerk and the salespeople here and there well that was actually the horse garp admitted modestly and sometimes someone would ask and what is it you do mister garp the following silence would pain garp as he stood thinking that it was probably best to say that he ranfor a living he cruised the parks a molesternabber by profession he hung around phone booths like that man in the capewaiting for disasters any of this would make more sense to them than what he really did i write garp would finally admit disappointmenteven suspicionall over their onceadmiring faces in the drugstoreto make matters worsegarp dropped the package of three prophylactics aha the old man cried look there whats he up to with those garp wondered what options there were for what he could be up to with those a pervert on the loose the old man assured the druggist looking for innocence to violate and defile the old geezers selfrighteousness was irritating to the point that garp had no desire to settle the misunderstanding in fact he rather enjoyed the memory of unpantsing the old bird in the park and he was not in the least sorry for the accident it was some time later when garp realized that the old gentleman had no monopoly on selfrighteousness garp took duncan to a high school basketball game and was appalled that the tickettaker was none other than the mustache kidthe real molester the attacker of that helpless child in the city park youre out garp said amazed the pervert smiled openly at duncan one adult one kiddy he said tearing off tickets howd you ever get free garp asked he felt himself tremble with violence nobody proved nothing the kid said haughtily that dumb girl wouldnt even talk garp thought again of ellen james with her tongue cut off at eleven he felt a sudden sympathy for the madness of the old man he had so unpleasantly unpantsed he felt such a terrible sense of injustice that he could even imagine some very unhappy woman despairing enough to cut off her own tongue he knew that he wanted to hurt the mustache kid on the spotin front of duncan he wished he could arrange a maiming as a kind of moral lesson but there was a crowd wanting basketball tickets garp was holding things up move along hair pie the kid said to garp in the kids expression garp thought he recognized the leer of the world on the kids upper lip was the insipid evidence that he was growing another mustache it was years later when he saw the child a girl grown up it was only because she recognized him that he recognized her he was coming out of a movie theater in another town she was in the line waiting to come in some of her friends were with her hello how are you garp asked he was glad to see she had friends that meant to garp that she was normal is it a good movie the girl asked youve certainly grown garp said the girl blushed and garp realized what a stupid thing hed said well i mean its been a long timeand it was a time well worth forgetting he added heartily her friends were moving inside the movie theater and the girl gave a quick look after them to make sure she was really alone with garp yes im graduating this month she said high school garp wondered aloud could it have been that long ago oh no junior high the girl said laughing nervously wonderful garp said and without knowing why he said ill try to come but the girl looked suddenly stricken no please she said please dont come okay i wont garp agreed quickly he saw her several times after this meeting but she never recognized him again because he shaved off his beard why dont you grow another beard helen occasionally asked him or at least a mustache but whenever garp encountered the molested girl and escaped unrecognized he was convinced he should remain cleanshaven i feel uneasy garp wrote that my life has come in contact with so much rape apparently he was referring to the tenyearold in the city park to the elevenyearold ellen james and her terrible societyhis mothers wounded women with their symbolic selfinflicted speechlessness and later he would write a novel which would make garp more of a household product which would have much to do with rape perhaps rapes offensiveness to garp was that it was an act that disgusted him with himselfwith his own very male instincts which were otherwise so unassailable he never felt like raping anyone but rape garp thought made men feel guilt by association in garps own case he likened his guilt for the seduction of little squab bones to a rapelike situation but it was hardly a rape it was deliberate though he even bought the condoms weeks in advance knowing what he would use them for are not the worst crimes premeditated it would not be a sudden passion for the babysitter that garp would succumb to he would plan and be ready when cindy succumbed to her passion for him it must have given him a twinge then to know what those rubbers were for when he dropped them in front of the gentleman from the city park and heard the old man accuse him looking for innocence to violate and defile how true still he arranged obstacles in the path of his desire for the girl he twice hid the prophylactics but he also remembered where hed hidden them and the day of the last evening that cindy would babysit for them garp made desperate love to helen in the late afternoon when they should have been dressing for dinner or fixing duncans supper garp locked the bedroom and wrestled helen out of her closet are you crazy she asked him were going out terrible lust he pleaded dont deny it she teased him please sir i make a point of never doing it before the hors doeuvres youre the hors doeuvres garp said oh thanks said helen hey the doors locked duncan said knocking duncan garp called go tell us what the weather is doing the weather duncan said trying to force the bedroom door i think its snowing in the backyard garp called go see helen stifled her laughter and her other sounds against his hard shoulder he came so quickly he surprised her duncan trotted back to the bedroom door reporting that it was springtime in the backyard and everywhere else garp let him in the bedroom now that he was finished but he wasnt finished he knew itdriving home with helen from the party he knew exactly where the rubbers were under his typewriter quiet these dull months since the publication of procrastination you look tired helen said want me to take cindy home no thats okay he mumbled ill do it helen smiled at him and nuzzled her cheek against his mouth my wild afternoon lover she whispered you can always take me out to dinner that way if you like he sat a long time with little squab bones in the car outside her dark apartment he had chosen the time wellthe college was letting out cindy was leaving town she was already upset at having to say goodbye to her favorite writer he was at least the only writer shed actually met im sure youll have a good year next year cindy he said and if you come back to see anyone please stop and see us duncan will miss you the girl stared into the cold lights of the dashboard then looked over at garp miserablytears and the whole flushed story on her face ill miss you she whined no no garp said dont miss me i love you she whispered and let her slim head bump awkwardly against his shoulder no dont say that he said not touching her not yet the threepack of condoms nestled patiently in his pocket coiled like snakes in her musty apartment he used only one of them to his surprise all her furniture had been moved out they jammed her lumpy suitcases together and made an uncomfortable bed he was careful not to stay a second more than necessary lest helen think hed spent too long a time for even a literary goodbye a thick swollen stream ran through the womens college grounds and garp discarded the remaining two prophylactics there throwing them furtively out the window of his moving carimagining that an alert campus cop might have seen him and would already be scrambling down the bank to retrieve the evidence the rubbers plucked out of the current the discovered weapon that leads back to the crime for which it was used but no one saw him no one found him out even helen already asleep would not have found the smell of sex peculiar after all only hours before he had legitimately acquired the odor even so garp showered and slipped cleanly into his own safe bed he curled against helen who murmured some affection instinctively she thrust one long thigh over his hip when he failed to respond she forced her buttocks back against him garps throat ached at her trust and at his love for her he felt fondly the slight swell of helens pregnancy duncan was a healthy bright child garps first novel had at least made him what he said he wanted to be lust still troubled garps young life but he was fortunate that his wife still lusted for him and he for her now a second child would join their careful orderly adventure he felt helens belly anxiouslyfor a kick a sign of life although hed agreed with helen that it would be nice to have a girl garp hoped for another boy why he thought he recalled the girl in the park his image of the tongueless ellen james his own mothers difficult decisions he felt fortunate to be with helen she had her own ambitions and he could not manipulate her but he remembered the kдrntnerstrasse whores and cushie percy who would die making a baby and nowher scent still on him or at least on his mind although he had washedthe plundered little squab bones cindy had cried under him her back bent against a suitcase a blue vein had pulsed at her temple which was the translucent temple of a fairskinned child and though cindy still had her tongue shed been unable to speak to him when he left her garp didnt want a daughter because of men because of bad men certainly but even he thought because of men like me second children second novels second love it was a boy their second son duncans brother was called waltit was never walter and never the german valt he was simply a t at the end of a wall walt like a beavers tail smacking water like a wellhit squash ball he dropped into their lives and they had two boys garp tried to write a second novel helen took her second job she became an associate professor of english at the state university in the town nextdoor to the womens college garp and his boys had a boys gym to play in and helen had an occasional bright graduate student to relieve her of the monotony of younger people she also had more and more interesting colleagues one of them was harrison fletcher his field was the victorian novel but helen liked him for other reasonsamong them he was also married to a writer her name was alice she was also working on her second novel although shed never finished her first when the garps met her they thought she could easily be mistaken for an ellen jamesianshe simply didnt talk harrison whom garp called harry had never been called harry beforebut he liked garp and he appeared to enjoy his new name as if it were a present garp had given him helen would continue to call him harrison but to garp he was harry fletcher he was garps first friend though garp and harrison both sensed that harrison preferred helens company neither helen nor garp knew what to make of quiet alice as they called her she must be writing one hell of a book garp often said its taken all her words away the fletchers had one child a daughter whose age put her awkwardly between duncan and walt it was implied that they wanted another but the book alices second novel came first when it was over they would have a second child they said the couples had dinner together occasionally but the fletchers were strictly cookout peoplewhich is to say neither of them cookedand garp was in a period where he baked his own bread he had a stockpot always simmering on the stove mostly helen and harrison discussed books teaching and their colleagues they ate lunch together at the university union they conversedat lengthin the evening on the phone and garp and harry went to the football games the basketball games and the wrestling meets three times a week they played squash which was harrys gamehis only sportbut garp could play even with him simply because garp was a better athlete in better shape from all his running for the pleasure of these games garp suppressed his dislike of balls in the second year of this friendship harry told garp that alice liked to go to movies i dont harry admitted but if you doand helen said that you didwhy not take alice alice fletcher giggled at movies especially serious movies she shook her head in disbelief at almost every thing she saw it took months for garp to realize that alice had something of an impediment or a nervous defect in her speech perhaps it was psychological at first garp thought it was the popcorn you have a speech problem i think alice he said driving her home one night yeth she said nodding her head often it was a simple lisp sometimes it was completely different occasionally it wasnt there excitement seemed to aggravate it hows the book coming he asked her good she said at one movie she had blurted out that shed liked procrastination do you want me to read any of your work garp asked her yeth she said her small head bobbing she sat with her short strong fingers crushing her skirt in her lap the way garp had seen her daughter crinkle her clothesthe child would sometimes roll her skirt like a window shade right up above her panties though alice stopped short of this was it an accident garp asked her your speech problem or were you born with it born with alice said the car stopped at the fletchers house and alice tugged garps arm she opened her mouth and pointed inside as if this would explain everything garp saw the rows of small perfect teeth and a tongue that was fat and freshlooking like the tongue of a child he could see nothing peculiar but it was dark in the car and he wouldnt have known what was peculiar if hed seen it when alice closed her mouth he saw she was cryingand also smiling as if this act of selfexposure had required enormous trust garp nodded his head as if he understood everything i see he mumbled she wiped her tears with the back of one hand squeezed his hand with her other harrithon is having an affair she said garp knew that harry wasnt having an affair with helen but he didnt know what poor alice thought not with helen garp said na na alice said shaking her head thumone elth who garp asked a thtudent alice wailed a thtupid little twat it had been a couple of years since garp had molested little squab bones but in that time he had indulged himself in one other babysitter to his shame he had even forgotten her name he felt honestly that babysitters were an appetite he was forever through with yet he sympathized with harryharry was his friend and he was an important friend to helen he also sympathized with alice alice was alertly lovable a kind of terminal vulnerability was clearly a part of her and she wore it as visibly as a tootight sweater on her compact body im sorry garp said can i do anything tell him to thtop alice said it had never been hard for garp to stop but he had never been a teacherwith thtudents on his mind or on his hands perhaps what harry was involved with was something else the only thing garp could think ofthat would perhaps make alice feel betterwas to confess his own mistakes it happens alice he said not to you alice said twice to me garp said she looked at him shocked tell the truth she insisted the truth he said is that it happened twice a babysitter both times jesuth chritht said alice but they werent important garp said i love helen thith is important alice said he hurth me and i cant white garp knew about writers who couldnt white this made garp love alice on the spot fucking harry is having an affair garp told helen i know helen said ive told him to stop but he keeps going back for more shes not even a very good student what can we do garp asked her fucking lust helen said your mother was right it is a mans problem you talk to him alice told me about your babysitters harry told garp its not the same this is a special girl a student harry garp said jesus christ a special student harry said im not like you ive been honest ive told alice from the first shes just got to accommodate it ive told her shes free to do this too she doesnt know any students garp said she knows you harry told him and shes in love with you what can we do garp asked helen hes trying to set me up with alice so hell feel better about what hes doing at least hes been honest with her helen told garp there was one of those silences wherein a family can identify its separate breathing parts in the night open doors off an upstairs hall duncan breathing lazily an almosteightyearold with lots of time to live walt breathing those tentative twoyearold breaths short and excited helen even and cool garp held his breath he knew she knew about the babysitters harry told you he asked you might have told me before you told alice helen said who was the second one i forget her name garp admitted i think its shabby helen said its really beneath me its beneath you i hope youve outgrown it yes i have garp said he meant he had outgrown babysitters but lust itself ah well jenny fields had fingered a problem at the heart of her sons heart weve got to help the fletchers helen said were too fond of them to do nothing about this helen garp marveled moved through their life together as if it were an essay she was structuringwith an introduction a presentation of basic priorities then the thesis harry thinks the student is special garp pointed out fucking men helen said you look after alice ill show harrison whats special so one night after garp had cooked an elegant paprika chicken and spдtzle helen said to garp harrison and i will do the dishes you take alice home take her home garp said now show him your novel helen said to alice show him everything you want im going to show your husband what an asshole he is hey come on harry said were all friends we all want to stay friends right you simple son of a bitch helen told him you fuck a student and call her specialyou insult your wife you insult me ill show you whats special go easy helen garp said go with alice helen said and let alice drive her own babysitter home hey come on harrison fletcher said shuth up harrithon alice said she grabbed garps hand and stood up from the table fucking men said helen garp as speechless as an ellen jamesian took alice home i can take the babysitter home alice he said jutht get back fatht alice said very fast alice garp said she made him read the first chapter of her novel aloud to her i want to hear it she told him and i cant thay it mythelf so garp said it to her it read he was relieved to hear beautifully alice wrote with such fluency and care that garp could have sung her sentences unselfconsciously and they would have sounded fine you have a lovely voice alice he told her and she cried and they made love of course and despite what everyone knows about such things it was special wasnt it asked alice yes it was garp admitted now he thought here is trouble what can we do helen asked garp she had made harrison fletcher forget his special student harrison now thought that helen was the most special thing in his life you started it garp said to her if its going to stop youve got to stop it i think thats easy to say helen said i like harrison hes my best friend and i dont want to lose that im just not very interested in sleeping with him hes interested garp said god i know helen said he thinks youre the best hes had garp told her oh great helen said that must be lovely for alice alice isnt thinking about it garp said alice was thinking about garp garp knew and garp was afraid the whole thing would stop there were times when garp thought that alice was the best hed ever had and what about you helen asked him nothing is equal garp would write one day im fine garp said i like alice i like you i like harry and alice helen asked alice likes me garp said oh boy helen said so we all like each other except that i dont care that much for sleeping with harrison so its over garp said trying to hide the gloom in his voice alice had cried to him that it could never be over could it could it she had cried i cant jutht thtop well isnt it still better than it was helen asked garp you made your point garp said you got harry off his damn student now youve just got to let him down easy and what about you and alice helen asked if its over for one of us its over for all of us garp said thats only fair i know whats fair helen said i also know whats human the goodbyes that garp imagined conducting with alice were violent scenarios fraught with alices incoherent speech and always ending in desperate lovemakinganother failed resolution wet with sweat and sweet with the lush stickum of sex oh yeth i think alice is a little loony helen said alice is a pretty good writer garp said shes the real thing fucking writers helen mumbled harry doesnt appreciate how talented alice is garp heard himself say oh boy helen murmured this is the last time i try to save anyones marriage except my own it took six months for helen to let harry down easy and in that time garp saw as much of alice as he could while still trying to forewarn her that their foursome was going to be shortlived he also tried to forewarn himself because he dreaded the knowledge that he would have to give alice up its not the same for all four of us he told alice it will have to stop and pretty soon tho what alice said it hasnt thtopped yet has it not yet garp admitted he read all her written words aloud to her and they made love so much he stung in the shower and couldnt stand to wear a jock when he ran weve got to do and do it alice said fervently do it while we can you know this cant last garp tried to warn harry while they were playing squash i know i know harry said but its great while it lasts isnt it isnt it alice demanded did garp love alice oh yeth yes yes garp said shaking his head he thought he did but helen enjoying it the least of them suffered it the most when she finally called an end to it she couldnt help but show her euphoria the other three couldnt help but show their resentment that she should appear so uplifted while they were cast into such gloom without formal imposition there existed a sixmonth moratorium on the couples seeing each other except by chance naturally helen and harry ran into each other at the english department garp encountered alice in the supermarket once she deliberately crashed her shopping cart into his little walt was jarred among the produce and the juice cans and alices daughter looked equally alarmed at the collision i felt the need of thum contact alice said and she called the garps one night very late after garp and helen had gone to bed helen answered the phone is harrithon there she asked helen no alice helen said is something wrong hes not here alice said i havent theen harrithon all night let me come over and sit with you helen suggested garp can go look for harrison cant garp come over and thit with me alice asked you look for harrithon no ill come over and sit with you helen said i think thats better garp can go look for harrison i want garp alice said im sorry that you cant have him helen said im thorry helen alice said she cried into the phone and said a stream of things that helen couldnt understand helen gave the phone to garp garp talked to alice and listened to her for about an hour nobody looked for harrithon helen felt she had done a good job of holding herself together for the six months shed allowed it all to continue she expected them all to at least control themselves adequately now that it was over if harrison is out screwing students im really going to cross him off helen said that asshole and if alice calls herself a writer why isnt she writing if shes got so much to thay why waste saying it on the phone time garp knew would ease everything time would also prove him wrong about alices writing she may have had a pretty voice but she couldnt complete anything she never finished her second novel not in all the years that the garps would know the fletchersor in all the years after she could say everything beautifully butas garp remarked to helen when he was finally exasperated with aliceshe couldnt get to the end of anything she couldnt thtop harry too would not play his cards wisely or well the university would deny him tenurea bitter loss for helen because she truly loved having harrison for a friend but the student harry had thrown over for helen had not been let down so easy she bitched about her seduction to the english departmentalthough of course it was her jilting that really made her bitch this raised eyebrows among harrys colleagues and of course helens support of harrison fletchers case for tenure was quietly not taken seriouslyher relationship with harry having also been made clear by the jilted student even garps mother jenny fieldswith all she stood up for for womenagreed with garp that helens own tenure at the university so easily granted her when she was younger than poor harry had been a token gesture on the part of the english department someone had probably told them that they needed a woman on the department at the associate professor level and helen had come along although helen did not doubt her own qualifications she knew it hadnt been her quality that had gotten her tenure but helen had not slept with any students not yet harrison fletcher had unforgivably allowed his sex life to be more special to him than his job he got another job anyway and perhaps what remained of the friendship between the garps and the fletchers was actually saved by the fletchers having to move away this way the couples saw each other about twice a year distance diffused what might have been hard feelings alice could speak her flawless prose to garp in letters the temptation to touch each other even to bash their shopping carts together was removed from them and they all settled into being the kind of friends many old friends become that is they were friends when they heard from each otheror when occasionally they got together and when they were not in touch they did not think of one another garp threw away his second novel and began a second second novel unlike alice garp was a real writernot because he wrote more beautifully than she wrote but because he knew what every artist should know as garp put it you only grow by coming to the end of something and by beginning something else even if these socalled endings and beginnings are illusions garp did not write faster than anyone else or more he simply always worked with the idea of completion in mind his second book was swollen he knew with the energy he had left over from alice it was a book full of wounding dialogue and sex that left the partners smarting sex in the book also left the partners guilty and usually wanting more sex this paradox was cited by several reviewers who alled the phenomenon alternately brilliant and dumb one reviewer called the novel bitterly truthful but he hastened to point out that the bitterness doomed the novel to the status of only a minor classic if more of the bitterness had been refined away the reviewer theorized a purer truth would have emerged more nonsense was compiled concerning the novels thesis one reviewer struggled with the idea that the novel seemed to be saying that only sexual relationships could profoundly reveal people to themselves yet it was during sexual relationships that people appeared to lose what profundity they had garp said he never had a thesis and he grumpily told an interviewer that he had written a serious comedy about marriage but a sexual farce later he wrote that human sexuality makes farcical our most serious intentions but no matter what garp saidor the reviewers eitherthe book was not a success titled second wind of the cuckold the novel confused nearly everyone even its reviews were confusing it undersold procrastination by a few thousand copies and even though john wolf assured garp that this was what often happened to second novels garpfor the first time in his lifefelt he had failed john wolf who was a good editor protected garp from one particular review until he feared garp would see the review by accident then wolf reluctantly sent the clipping from a west coast newspaper with the attached note that hed heard the reviewer suffered a hormone imbalance the review remarked curtly that it was sordid and pathetic that t s garp the talentless son of the famous feminist jenny fields has written a sexist novel that wallows in sexand not even instructively and so forth growing up with jenny fields had not made garp the sort of person who was easily influenced by other peoples opinions of him but even helen did not like second wind of the cuckold and even alice fletcher in all her loving letters never once mentioned the books existence second wind of the cuckold was about two married couples who have an affair oh boy helen said when she first learned what the book was about its not about us garp said its not about any of that it just uses that and youre always telling me helen said that autobiographical fiction is the worst kind this isnt autobiographical garp said youll see she didnt though the novel was not about helen and garp and harry and alice it was about four people whose finally unequal and sexually striving relationship is a bust each person in the foursome is physically handicapped one of the men is blind the other man has a stutter of such monstrous proportions that his dialogue is infuriatingly difficult to read jenny blasted garp for taking a cheap shot at poor departed mr tinch but writers garp sadly knew were just observersgood and ruthless imitators of human behavior garp had meant no offense to tinch he was just using one of tinchs habits i dont know how you could have done such a thing to alice helen despaired helen meant the handicaps especially the womens handicaps one has muscle spasms in her right armher hand is always lashing out striking wineglasses flowerpots childrens faces once nearly emasculating her husband accidentally with a pruning hook only her lover the other womans husband is able to soothe this terrible uncontrollable spasmso that the woman is for the first time in her life the possessor of a flawless body entirely intentional in its movement truly ruled and contained by herself alone the other woman suffers unpredictable unstoppable flatulence the farter is married to the stutterer the blind man is married to the dangerous right arm nobody in the foursome to garps credit is a writer we should be grateful for small favors helen asked one of the couples is childless and wants to be the other couple is trying to have a child this woman conceives but her elation is tempered by everyones anxiety concerning the identity of the natural father which one was it the couples watch for telltale habits in the newborn child will it stutter fart lash out or be blind garp saw this as his ultimate commenton his mothers behalfon the subject of genes it is to some degree an optimistic novel if only because the friendship between the couples finally convinces them to break off their liaison the childless couple later separates disillusioned with each other but not necessarily as a result of the experiment the couple with the child succeeds as a couple the child develops without a detectable flaw the last scene in the novel is the chance meeting of the two women they pass on an escalator in a department store at christmastime the farter going up the woman with the dangerous right arm going down both are laden with packages at the moment they pass each other the woman stricken with uncontrollable flatulence releases a keen treble fartthe spastic stiffarms an old man on the escalator in front of her bowling him down the moving staircase toppling a sea of people but its christmas the escalators are jampacked and noisy no one is hurt and everything in season is forgivable the two women moving apart on their mechanical conveyors seem to serenely acknowledge each others burdens they grimly smile at each other its a comedy garp cried out over and over again no one got it its supposed to be very funny what a film it would make but no one even bought the paperback rights as could be seen by the fate of the man who could only walk on his hands garp had a thing about escalators helen said that no one in the english department ever spoke to her about second wind of the cuckold in the case of procrastination many of her wellmeaning colleagues had at least attempted a discussion helen said that the book was an invasion of her privacy and she hoped the whole thing had been a kick that garp would soon be off jesus do they think its you garp asked her what the hells the matter with your dumb colleagues anyway do you fart in the halls over there does your shoulder drop out of socket in department meetings was poor harry a stutterer in the classroom garp yelled am i blind yes youre blind helen said you have your own terms for whats fiction and whats fact but do you think other people know your system its all your experiencesomehow however much you make up even if its only an imagined experience people think its me they think its you and sometimes i think so too the blind man in the novel is a geologist do they see me playing with rocks garp hollered the flatulent woman does volunteer work in a hospital she is a nurses aide do you see my mother complaining garp asked does she write me and point out that she never once farted in a hospitalonly at home and always under control but jenny fields did complain to her son about second wind of the cuckold she told him he had chosen a disappointingly narrow subject of little universal importance she means sex garp said this is classic a lecture on whats universal by a woman whos never once felt sexual desire and the pope who takes vows of chastity decides the issue of contraception for millions the world is crazy garp cried jennys newest colleague was a sixfootfour transsexual named roberta muldoon formerly robert muldoon a standout tight end for the philadelphia eagles robertas weight had dropped from to since her successful sexchange operation the doses of estrogen had cut into her oncemassive strength and some of her endurance garp guessed also that robert muldoons former and famous quick hands werent so quick anymore but roberta muldoon was a formidable companion to jenny fields roberta worshiped garps mother it had been jennys book a sexual suspect that had given robert muldoon the courage to have the sexchange operationone winter as he lay recovering from knee surgery in a philadelphia hospital jenny fields was now supporting robertas case with the television networks who roberta claimed had secretly agreed not to hire her as a sports announcer for the football season robertas knowledge of football had not decreased one drop since all the estrogen jenny was arguing waves of support from the college campuses around the country had made the sixfootfour roberta muldoon a figure of striking controversy roberta was intelligent and articulate and of course she knew her football shed have been an improvement on the usual morons who commented on the game garp liked her they talked about football together and they played squash roberta always took the first few games from garpshe was more powerful than he was and a better athletebut her stamina was not quite up to his and being the much bigger person in the court she wore down roberta would also tire of her case against the television networks but she would develop great endurance for other more important things youre certainly an improvement on the ellen james society roberta garp would tell her he enjoyed his mothers visits better when jenny came with roberta and roberta tossed a football for hours with duncan roberta promised to take duncan to an eagles game but garp was anxious about that roberta was a target figure she had made some people very angry garp imagined various assaults and bomb threats on robertaand duncan disappearing in the vast and roaring football stadium in philadelphia where he would be defiled by a child molester it was the fanaticism of some of roberta muldoons hate mail that gave garp such an imagination but when jenny showed him some hate mail of her own garp was anxious about that too it was an aspect of the publicity of his mothers life that he had not considered some people truly hated her they wrote jenny that they wished she had cancer they wrote roberta muldoon that they hoped his or her parents were no longer living one couple wrote jenny fields that they would like to artificially inseminate her with elephant spermand blow her up from the inside that note was signed a legitimate couple one man wrote roberta muldoon that he had been an eagles fan all his life and even his grandparents had been born in philadelphia but now he was going to be a giants or a redskins fan and drive to new york or washingtonor even baltimore if necessarybecause roberta had perverted the entire eagles offensive line with his pansy ways one woman wrote roberta muldoon that she hoped roberta would get gangbanged by the oakland raiders the woman thought that the raiders were the most disgusting team in football maybe they would show roberta how much fun it was to be a woman a high school tight end from wyoming wrote roberta muldoon that she had made him ashamed to be a tight end anymore and he was changing his positionto linebacker so far there were no transsexual linebackers a college offensive guard from michigan wrote roberta that if she were ever in ypsilanti he would like to fuck her with her shoulder pads on this is nothing roberta told garp your mother gets much worse lots more people hate her mom garp said why dont you drop out for a while take a vacation write another book he never thought hed ever hear himself suggesting such a thing to her but he suddenly saw jenny as a potential victim exposing herself through other victims to all the hatred and cruelty and violence in the world when asked by the press always jenny would say that she was writing another book only garp and helen and john wolf knew this was a lie jenny fields wasnt writing a word ive done all i want to do about me already jenny told her son now im interested in other people you just worry about you she said gravely as if in her opinion her sons introversionhis imaginative lifewas the more dangerous way to live helen actually feared this tooespecially when garp wasnt writing and for more than a year after second wind of the cuckold garp didnt write then he wrote for a year and threw it all away he wrote letters to his editor they were the most difficult letters john wolf ever had to read much less answer some of them were ten and twelve pages long most of them accused john wolf of not pushing second wind of the cuckold as hard as he could have everyone hated it john wolf reminded garp how could we have pushed it you never supported the book garp wrote helen wrote john wolf that he must be patient with garp but john wolf knew writers pretty well and he was as patient and as kind as he could be eventually garp wrote letters to other people he answered some of his mothers hate mailthose rare cases with return addresses he wrote long letters trying to talk these people out of their hatred youre becoming a social worker helen told him but garp even offered to answer some of roberta muldoons hate mail roberta had a new lover however and her hate mail was rolling off her like water jesus garp complained to her first a sex reassignment and now youre in love for a tight end with tits youre really boring roberta they were very good friends and they played squash fervently whenever roberta and jenny came to town but this was not frequently enough to occupy all of garps restless time he spent hours playing games with duncanand waiting for walt to get old enough to play games too he cooked up a storm the third novels the big one john wolf told helen because he sensed she was wearying of garps restlessness and she was in need of a pep talk give him time it will come hows he know the third novels the big one garp fumed my third novel doesnt even exist and the way it was published my second novel might as well not exist these editors are full of myths and selffulfilling prophecies if he knows so much about third novels why doesnt he write his own third novel why doesnt he write his first but helen smiled and kissed him and took up going to the movies with him although she hated movies she was happy with her job the kids were happy garp was a good father and a good cook and he made love to her more elaborately when he wasnt writing than he did when he was hard at work let it come helen thought her father good old ernie holm had shown signs of early heart trouble but her father was happy at steering he and garp took a trip together every winter to see one of those big wrestling matches out in iowa helen was sure that garps writing block was a small thing to endure it will come alice fletcher told garp on the phone you cant forth it im not trying to force anything he assured her theres just nothing there but he thought that desirable alice who could never finish anythingnot even her love for himwas a poor one to understand what he meant then garp got some hate mail of his own he was addressed in a lively letter by someone who took offense at second wind of the cuckold it was not a blind stuttering spastic farteras you might imagineeither it was just what garp needed to lift himself out of his slump dear shithead wrote the offended party i have read your novel you seem to find other peoples problems very funny i have seen your picture with your fat head of hair i suppose you can laugh at bald persons and in your cruel book you laugh at people who cant have orgasms and people who arent blessed with happy marriages and people whose wives and husbands are unfaithful to each other you ought to know that persons who have these problems do not think everything is so funny look at the world shitheadit is a bed of pain people suffering and nobody believing in god or bringing their children up right you shithead you dont have any problems so you can make fun of poor people who do yours sincerely mrs i b poole findlay ohio that letter stung garp like a slap rarely had he felt so importantly misunderstood why did people insist that if you were comic you couldnt also be serious garp felt most people confused being profound with being sober being earnest with being deep apparently if you sounded serious you were presumably other animals could not laugh at themselves and garp believed that laughter was related to sympathy which we were always needing more of he had been after all a humorless childand never religiousso perhaps he now took comedy more seriously than others but for garp to see his vision interpreted as making fun of people was painful to him and to realize that his art had made him appear cruel gave garp a keen sense of failure very carefully as if he were speaking to a potential suicide high up in a foreign and unfamiliar hotel garp wrote to his reader in findlay ohio dear mrs poole the world is a bed of pain people suffer terribly few of us believe in god or bring up our children very well youre right about that it is also true that people who have problems do not as a rule think their problems are funny horace walpole once said that the world is comic to those who think and tragic to those who feel i hope youll agree with me that horace walpole somewhat simplifies the world by saying this surely both of us think and feel in regard to whats comic and whats tragic mrs poole the world is all mixed up for this reason i have never understood why serious and funny are thought to be opposites it is simply a truthful contradiction to me that peoples problems are often funny and that the people are often and nonetheless sad i am ashamed however that you think i am laughing at people or making fun of them i take people very seriously people are all i take seriously in fact therefore i have nothing but sympathy for how people behaveand nothing but laughter to console them with laughter is my religion mrs poole in the manner of most religions i admit that my laughter is pretty desperate i want to tell you a little story to illustrate what i mean the story takes place in bombay india where many people starve to death every day but not all the people in bombay are starving among the nonstarving population of bombay india there was a wedding and a party was thrown in honor of the bride and groom some of the wedding guests brought elephants to the party they werent really conscious of showing off they were just using the elephants for transportation although that may strike us as a bigshot way to travel around i dont think these wedding guests saw themselves that way most of them were probably not directly responsible for the vast numbers of their fellow indians who were starving all around them most of them were just calling time out from their own problems and the problems of the world to celebrate the wedding of a friend but if you were a member of the starving indians and you hobbled past that wedding party and saw all those elephants parked outside you probably would have felt some disgruntlement furthermore some of the revelers at the wedding got drunk and began feeding beer to their elephant they emptied an ice bucket and filled it with beer and they went tittering out to the parking lot and fed their hot elephant the whole bucket the elephant liked it so the revelers gave him several more buckets of beer who knows how beer will affect an elephant these people meant no harm they were just having funand chances are fairly good that the rest of their lives werent one hundred percent fun they probably needed this party but the people were also being stupid and irresponsible if one of those many starving indians had dragged himself through the parking lot and seen these drunken wedding guests filling up an elephant with beer ill bet he would have felt resentful but i hope you see i am not making fun of anyone what happens next is that the drunken revelers are asked to leave the party because their behavior with their elephant is obnoxious to the other wedding guests no one can blame the other guests for feeling this way some of them may have actually thought that they were preventing things from getting out of hand although people have never been very successful at preventing this huffy and brave with beer the revelers struggled tip on their elephant and veered away from the parking lota large exhibition of happiness surelybumping into a few other elephants and things because the revelers elephant plowed from side to side in a lumbering wooze bleary and bloated with buckets of beer his trunk lashed back and forth like a badly fastened artificial limb the great beast was so unsteady that he struck an electric utility pole shearing it cleanly and bringing down the live wires on his massive headwhich killed him and the wedding guests who were riding him instantly mrs poole please believe me i dont think thats funny but along comes one of those starving indians he sees all the wedding guests mourning the death of their friends and their friends elephant much wailing rending of fine ctothes spilling of good food and drink the first thing he does is to take the opportunity to slip into the wedding while the guests are distracted and steal a little of the good food and drink for his starving family the second thing he does is start to laugh himself sick about the manner in which the revelers disposed of themselves and their elephant alongside death by starvation this method of enormous dying must seem funny or at least quick to the undernourished indian but the wedding guests dont see it that way it is already a tragedy to them they are already talking about this tragic event and although they could perhaps forgive the presence of a mangy beggar at their partyand even have tolerated his stealing their foodthey cannot forgive him for laughing at their dead friends and their dead friends elephant the wedding guestsoutraged at the beggars behavior at his laughter not his thievery and not his ragsdrown him in one of the beer buckets that the late revelers used to water their elephant they construe this to represent justice we see that the story is about the class struggleand of course serious after all but i like to consider it a comedy about a natural disaster they are just people rather foolishly attempting to take charge of a situation whose complexity is beyond thema situation composed of eternal and trivial parts after all with something as large as an elephant it could have been much worse i hope mrs poole that i have made what i mean clearer to you in any case i thank you for taking the time to write to me because i appreciate hearing from my audienceeven critically yours truly shithead garp was an excessive man he made everything baroque he believed in exaggeration his fiction was also extremist garp never forgot his failure with mrs poole she worried him often and her reply to his pompous letter must have upset him further dear mr garp mrs poole replied i never thought you would take the trouble to write me a letter you must be a sick man i can see by your letter that you believe in yourself and i guess thats good but the things you say are mostly garbage and nonsense to me and i dont want you to try to explain anything to me again because it is boring and an insult to my intelligence yours irene poole garp was like his beliefs selfcontradictory he was very generous with other people but he was horribly impatient he set his own standards for how much of his time and patience everyone deserved he could be painstakingly sweet until he decided hed been sweet enough then he turned and came roaring back the other way dear irene garp wrote to mrs poole you should either stop trying to read books or you should try a lot harder dear shithead wrote irene poole my husband says that if you write to me again hell beat your brains to a pulp very sincerely mrs fitz poole dear fitzy and irene garp shot right back fuck you thus was his sense of humor lost and his sympathy taken from the world in the pension grillparzer garp had somehow struck the chord of comedy on the one hand and compassion on the other the story did not belittle the people in the storyeither with forced cuteness or with any other exaggeration rationalized as necessary for making a point neither did the story sentimentalize the people or otherwise cheapen their sadness but the balance of this power in storytelling felt lost to garp now his first novel procrastinationin his opinionsuffered from the pretentious weight of all that fascist history he had taken no real part in his second novel suffered his failure at imagining enoughthat is he felt he had not imagined far enough beyond his own fairly ordinary experience second wind of the cuckold came off rather coldly to him it seemed just another real but rather common experience in fact it seemed to garp now that he was too full of his own lucky life with helen and their children he felt he was in danger of limiting his ability as a writer in a fairly usual way writing essentially about himself yet when he looked very far outside himself garp saw there only the invitation to pretention his imagination was failing himhis sense a dim rushlight when anyone asked him how his writing was coming he managed only a short cruel imitation of poor alice fletcher ive thtopped garp said the eternal husband in the yellow pages of garps phone directory marriage was listed near lumber after lumber came machine shops mail order houses manholes maple sugar and marine equipment then came marriage and family counselors garp was looking for lumber when be discovered marriage he had some innocent questions to ask about twobyfours when marriage caught his eye and raised more interesting and disturbing questions garp had never realized for example that there were more marriage counselors than lumberyards but this surely depends on where you live he thought in the country wouldnt people have more to do with lumber garp had been married nearly eleven years in that time he had found little use for lumber still less for counsel it was not for personal problems that garp took an interest in the long list of names in the yellow pages it was because garp spent a lot of time trying to imagine what it would be like to have a job there was the christian counseling center and the community pastoral counseling service garp imagined hearty ministers with their dry fleshy hands constantly rubbing together they spoke round moist sentences like soap bubbles saying things like we have no illusions that the church can be of very much assistance to individual problems such as your own individuals must seek individual solutions they must retain their individuality however it is our experience that many people have identified their own special individuality in the church there sat the baffled couple who had hoped to discuss the simultaneous orgasmmyth or reality garp noticed that members of the clergy went in for counseling there was a lutheran social service there was a reverend dwayne kuntz who was certified and a louise nagle who was an all souls minister associated with something called the united states bureau of marriage and family counselors who had certified her garp took a pencil and drew little zeroes beside the names of the marriage counselors with religious affiliations they would all offer fairly optimistic counsel garp believed he was less sure of the point of view of the counselors with more scientific training he was less sure of the training too one was a certified clinical psychologist another simply followed his name with ma clinical garp knew that these things could mean anything and that they could also mean nothing a graduate student in sociology a former business major one said bsperhaps in botany one was a phdin marriage one was a doctorbut a medical doctor or a doctor of philosophy at marriage counseling who would be better one specialized in group therapy someone perhaps less ambitious promised only psychological evaluation garp selected two favorites the first was dr o rothrockselfesteem workshop bank cards accepted the second was m neffby appointment only there was just a phone number after m neffs name no qualifications or supreme arrogance perhaps both if i needed anybody garp thought i would try m neff first dr o rothrock with his bank cards and his selfesteem workshop was clearly a charlatan but m neff was serious m neff had a vision garp could tell garp wandered a bit past marriage in the yellow pages he came to masonry maternity apparel and mat refinishing only one listing an outoftown steering phone number garps fatherinlaw ernie holm refinished wrestling mats as a slightly profitable hobby garp hadnt been thinking about his old coach he passed over mat refinishing to mattresses without recognizing ernies name then came mausoleums and meat cutting equipmentsee saws that was enough the world was too complicated garp wandered back to marriage then duncan came home from school garps older son was now ten years old he was a tall boy with helen garps bony delicate face and her oval yellowbrown eyes helen had skin of a lightoak color and duncan had her wonderful skin too from garp he had gotten his nervousness his stubbornness his moods of black selfpity dad he said can i spend the night at ralphs its very important what garp said no when have you been reading the phone book again duncan asked his father whenever garp read a phone book duncan knew it was like trying to wake him up from a nap he read the phone book often for names garp got the names of his characters out of the phone book when his writing was stuck he read the phone book for more names he revised the names of his characters over and over again when garp traveled the first thing he looked for in the motel room was the phone book he usually stole it dad duncan saidhe assumed his father was in his phone book trance living the lives of his fictional people garp had actually forgotten that he had nonfictional business with the phone book today he had forgotten about the lumber and was thinking only about the audacity of m neff and what it would be like to be a marriage counselor dad duncan said if i dont call ralph back before supper his mother wont let me come over ralph said garp ralph isnt here duncan tipped his fine jaw up and rolled his eyes it was a gesture helen had too and duncan had her same lovely throat ralph is at his house duncan said and i am at my house and i would like to go spend the night at ralphs housewith ralph not on a school night garp said its friday duncan said jesus dont swear duncan garp said when your mother comes home from work you can ask her he was stalling he knew garp was suspicious of ralphworse he was afraid for duncan to spend the night at ralphs house although duncan had done it before ralph was an older boy whom garp distrusted also garp didnt like ralphs mothershe went out in the evening and left the boys alone duncan had admitted that helen had once referred to ralphs mother as slatternly a word that had always intrigued garp and a look in women that had its appeal to him ralphs father didnt live at home so the slatternly look of ralphs mother was enhanced by her status as a woman alone i cant wait for mom to get home duncan said ralphs mother says she has to know before supper or i cant come over supper was garps responsibility and the idea of it distracted him he wondered what time it was duncan seemed to come home from school at no special time why not ask ralph to spend the night here garp said a familiar ploy ralph usually spent the night with duncan thus sparing garp his anxiety about the carelessness of mrs ralph he could never remember ralphs last name ralph always spends the night here duncan said i want to stay there and do what garp wondered drink smoke dope torture the pets spy on the sloppy lovemaking of mrs ralph but garp knew that duncan was ten years old and very sanevery careful the two boys probably enjoyed being alone in a house where garp wasnt smiling over them asking them if there was anything they wanted why not call mrs ralph and ask her if you can wait until your mother comes home before you say whether youll come or not garp asked jesus mrs ralph duncan groaned mom is just going to say its all right with me ask your father thats what she always says smart kid garp thought he was trapped short of blurting out that he was terrified mrs ralph would kill them all by burning them up in the night when her cigarette with which she slept set fire to her hair garp had nothing more he could say okay go ahead he said sulkily he didnt even know if ralphs mother smoked he simply disliked her on sight and he suspected ralphfor no better reason than that the child was older than duncan and therefore garp imagined capable of corrupting duncan in terrible ways garp suspected most people to whom his wife and children were drawn he had an urgent need to protect the few people he loved from what he imagined everyone else was like poor mrs ralph was not the only victim perhaps slandered by his paranoid assumptions i should get out more garp thought if i had a job he thoughta thought he had every day and rethought every day since he wasnt writing there was almost no job in the world that appealed to garp and certainly nothing he was qualified for he was qualified he knew for very little he could write when he was writing he believed he wrote very well but one reason he thought about getting a job was that he felt he needed to know more about other people he wanted to get over his distrust of them a job would at least force him to come into contactand if he werent forced to be with other people garp would stay home it was for his writing in the beginning that he had never taken the idea of a job seriously now it was for his writing that he was thinking he needed a job i am running out of people i can imagine he thought but perhaps it was really that there had never been many people he liked and he hadnt written anything he liked in too many years im going now duncan called to him and garp stopped dreaming the boy was wearing a bright orange rucksack on his back a yellow sleeping bag was rolled and tied under the pack garp had chosen them both for visibility ill give you a ride garp said but duncan rolled his eyes again mom has the car dad he said and shes still at work of course garp grinned foolishly then he saw that duncan was going to take his bicycle and he called out the door to him why dont you walk duncan why duncan said exasperated so your spine wont be severed when a car driven by a crazed teenager or a drunken man suffering a heart attack swipes you off the street garp thoughtand your wonderful warm chest is cracked against the curbstone your special skull split open when you land on the sidewalk and some asshole wraps you in an old rug as if you were somebodys pet discovered in the gutter then the dolts from the suburbs come out and guess who owns it that green and white house on the corner of elm and dodge i think then someone drives you home rings the bell and says to me uh sorry and pointing to the spillage in the bloody back seat asks is it yours but all garp said was oh go ahead duncan take the bike just be careful he watched duncan cross the street pedal up the next block look before he turned good boy note the careful hand signalbut perhaps this is only for my benefit it was a safe suburb of a small safe city comfortable green plots onefamily housesmostly university families with an occasional big house broken into apartments for graduate students ralphs mother for example appeared certain to be a graduate student forever though she had a whole house to herselfand although she was older than garp her former husband taught one of the sciences and presumably paid her tuition garp remembered that helen had been told the man was living with a student mrs ralph is probably a perfectly good person garp thought she has a child and she no doubt loves him she is no doubt serious about wanting to do something with her life if she were just more careful garp thought you must be careful people didnt realize its so easy to blow everything he thought hello someone said or he thought someone said he looked around but whoever had spoken to him was goneor was never there he realized he was barefoot his feet were cold it was an early spring day standing on the sidewalk in front of his house a phone book in his hand he would have liked to go on imagining m neff and the business of marriage counseling but he knew it was latehe had to prepare the evening meal and he hadnt even been shopping a block away he could hear the hum of the engines that powered the big freezers in the supermarket that was why they had moved into this neighborhoodso that garp could walk to the store and shop while helen took the car to work also they were nearer to a park for him to run in there were fans on the back of the supermarket and garp could hear them sucking the still air out of the aisles and blowing faint food smells over the block garp liked it he had a cooks heart he spent his day writing or trying to write running and cooking he got up early and fixed breakfast for himself and the children nobody was home for lunch and garp never ate that meal he fixed dinner for his family every night it was a ritual he loved but the ambition of his cooking was controlled by how good a day hed had writing and how good a run hed had if the writing went poorly he took it out on himself with a long hard run or sometimes a bad day with his writing would exhaust him so much that he could barely run a mile then he tried to save the day with a splendid meal helen could never tell what sort of day garp had experienced by what he cooked for them something special might mean a celebration or it might mean that the food was the only thing that had gone well that the cooking was the only labor keeping garp from despair if you are careful garp wrote if you use good ingredients and you dont take any shortcuts then you can usually cook something very good sometimes it is the only worthwhile product you can salvage from a day what you make to eat with writing i find you can have all the right ingredients give plenty of time and care and still get nothing also true of love cooking therefore can keep a person who tries hard sane he went into the house and looked for a pair of shoes about the only shoes be owned were running shoesmany pairs they were in different phases of being broken in garp and his children wore clean but rumpled clothes helen was a smart dresser and although garp did her laundry he refused to iron anything helen did her own ironing and an occasional shirt for garpironing was the only task of conventional housewifery that garp rejected the cooking the kids the basic laundry the cleaning uphe did them the cooking expertly the kids a little tensely but conscientiously the cleaning up a little compulsively he swore at errant clothes dishes and toys but he left nothing lie he was a maniac for picking things up some mornings before he sat down to write he raced over the house with a vacuum cleaner or he cleaned the oven the house never looked untidy was never dirty but there was always a certain haste to the neatness of it garp threw a lot of things away and the house was always missing things for months at a time he would allow most of the light bulbs to burn out unreplaced until helen would realize that they were living in almost total darkness huddled around the two lamps that worked or when he remembered the lights he forgot the soap and the toothpaste helen brought certain touches to the house too but garp took no responsibilities for these plants for example either helen remembered them or they died when garp saw that one appeared to be drooping or was the slightest bit pale he would whisk it out of the house and into the trash days later helen might ask where is the red arronzo that foul thing garp would remark it had some disease i saw worms on it i caught it dropping its little spines all over the floor thus garp functioned at housekeeping in the house garp found his yellow running shoes and put them on he put the phone book away in a cabinet where he kept the heavy cooking gear he stashed phone books all over the housethen would tear the house down to find the one he wanted he put some olive oil in a castiron skillet he chopped an onion while he waited for the oil to get hot it was late to be starting supper he hadnt even gone shopping a standard tomato sauce a little pasta a fresh green salad a loaf of his good bread that way he could go to the market after he started the sauce and hed only need to shop for greens he hurried the chopping now some fresh basil but it was important not to throw anything into the skillet until the oil was just right very hot but not smoking there are some things about cooking like writing that you dont hurry garp knew and he never hurried them when the phone rang it made him so angry that he threw a handful of onions into the skillet and burned himself with the spattering oil shit he cried he kicked the cabinet beside the stove snapping the little hinge on the cabinet door a phone book slid out and he stared at it he put all the onions and the fresh basil into the oil and lowered the flame he ran his hand under cold water and reaching offbalance wincing at the pain of the burn he picked up the phone in his other hand those fakers garp thought what qualifications could there be for marriage counseling no doubt he thought it is one more thing that those simplistic shrinks claim expertise in you caught me right in the fucking middle of something he snapped to the phone he eyed the onions wilting in the hot oil there was no one who could be calling whom he feared he might offend this was one of several advantages of being unemployed his editor john wolf would only remark that garps manner of answering the phone simply confirmed his notion of garps vulgarity helen was used to how he answered the phone and if the call were for helen her friends and colleagues already pictured garp as rather bearish if it were ernie holm garp would experience a momentary twinge the coach always apologized too much which embarrassed garp if it were his mother garp knew she would holler back at him another lie youre never in the middle of anything you live on the fringes garp hoped it wasnt jenny at the moment there was no other woman who would have called him only if it were the daycare center reporting an accident to little walt only if it were duncan calling to say that the zipper on his sleeping bag was broken or that hed just broken his leg would garp feel guilty for his bullying voice ones children certainly have a right to catch one in the middle of somethingthey usually do right in the middle of what darling helen asked him right in the middle of whom i hope shes nice helens voice on the phone had a quality of sexual teasing in it this always surprised garphow she soundedbecause helen was not like that she was not even flirtatious though he found her privately very arousing there was nothing of the sexy comeon about her dress or her habits in the outer world yet on the telephone she sounded bawdy to him and always had ive burned myself he said dramatically the oil is too hot and the onions are scorching what the fuck is it my poor man she said still teasing him you didnt leave any message with pam pam was the english department secretary garp struggled to think what message he was supposed to have left with her are you burned badly helen asked him no he sulked what message the twobyfours said helen lumber garp remembered he was going to call the lumberyards to price some twobyfours cut to size helen would pick them up on her way home from school he remembered now that the marriage counseling had distracted him from the lumberyards i forgot he said helen he knew would have an alternative plan she had known this much before she even made the phone call call them now helen said and ill call you back when i get to the daycare center then ill go pick up the twobyfours with walt he likes lumberyards walt was now five garps second son was in this daycare or preschool placewhatever it was its aura of general irresponsibility gave garp some of his most exciting nightmares well all right garp said ill start calling now he was worried about his tomato sauce and he hated hanging up on a conversation with helen when he was in a state so clearly preoccupied and dull ive found an interesting job he told her relishing her silence but she wasnt silent long youre a writer darling helen told him you have an interesting job sometimes it panicked garp that helen seemed to want him to stay at home and just writebecause that made the domestic situation the most comfortable for her but it was comfortable for him too it was what he thought he wanted the onions need stirring he said cutting her off and my burn hurts he added ill try to call back when youre in the middle of something helen said brightly teasing him that vampish laughter barely contained in her saucy voice it both aroused him and made him furious he stirred the onions and mashed half a dozen tomatoes into the hot oil then he added pepper salt oregano he called only the lumberyard whose address was closest to walts daycare center helen was too meticulous about some thingscomparing the prices of everything though he admired her for it wood was wood garp reasoned the best place to have the damn twobyfours cut to size was the nearest place a marriage counselor garp thought again dissolving a tablespoon of tomato paste in a cup of warm water and adding this to his sauce why are all the serious jobs done by quacks what could be more serious than marriage counseling yet he imagined a marriage counselor was somewhat lower on a scale of trust than a chiropractor in the way that many doctors scorned chiropractors would psychiatrists sneer at marriage counselors there was no one garp tended to sneer at as much as he sneered at psychiatriststhose dangerous simplifiers those thieves of a persons complexity to garp psychiatrists were the despicable end of all those who couldnt clean up their own messes the psychiatrist approached the mess without proper respect for the mess garp thought the psychiatrists objective was to clear the head it was garps opinion that this was usually accomplished when it was accomplished by throwing away all the messy things that is the simplest way to clean up garp knew the trick is to use the messto make the messy things work for you thats easy for a writer to say helen had told him artists can use a mess most people cant and they just dont want messes i know i dont what a psychiatrist youd be what would you do if a poor man who had no use for his mess came to you and he just wanted his mess to go away i suppose youd advise him to write about it garp remembered this conversation about psychiatry and it made him glum he knew he oversimplified the things that made him angry but he was convinced that psychiatry oversimplified everything when the phone rang he said the lumberyard off springfield avenue thats close to you i know where it is helen said is that the only place you called wood is wood garp said twobyfours are twobyfours go to springfield avenue and theyll have them ready what interesting job have you found helen asked him he knew she would have been thinking about it marriage counseling garp said his tomato sauce bubbledthe kitchen filled with its rich fumes helen maintained a respectful silence on her end of the phone garp knew she would find it difficult to ask this time what qualifications he thought he had for such a thing youre a writer she told him perfect qualifications for the job garp said years spent pondering the morass of human relationships hours spent divining what it is that people have in common the failure of love garp droned on the complexity of compromise the need for compassion so write about it helen said what more do you want she knew perfectly well what was coming next art doesnt help anyone garp said people cant really use it they cant eat it it wont shelter or clothe themand if theyre sick it wont make them well this helen knew was garps thesis on the basic uselessness of art he rejected the idea that art was of any social value whatsoeverthat it could be that it should be the two things mustnt be confused he thought there was art and there was helping people here he was fumbling at bothhis mothers son after all but true to his thesis he saw art and social responsibility as two distinct acts the messes came when certain jerks attempted to combine these fields garp would be irritated all his life by his belief that literature was a luxury item he desired for it to be more basicyet he hated it when it was ill go get the twobyfours now helen said and if the peculiarities of my art werent qualification enough garp said i have as you know been married myself he paused ive had children he paused again ive had a variety of marriagerelated experienceswe both have springfield avenue helen said ill be home soon i have more than enough experience for the job he insisted ive known financial dependency ive experienced infidelity good for you helen said she hung up but garp thought maybe marriage counseling is a charlatan field even if a genuine and qualified person is giving the advice he replaced the phone on the hook he knew he could advertise himself in the yellow pages most successfullyeven without lying marriage philosophy and family advice t s garp author of procrastination and second wind of the cuckold why add that they were novels they sounded garp realized like marriagecounsel manuals but would he see his poor patients at home or in an office garp took a green pepper and propped it in the center of the gas burner he turned up the flame and the pepper began to burn when it was black all over garp would let it cool then scrape off all the charred skin inside would be a roasted pepper very sweet and he would slice it and let it marinate in oil and vinegar and a little marjoram that would be his dressing for the salad but the main reason he liked to make dressing this way was that the roasting pepper made the kitchen smell so good he turned the pepper with a pair of tongs when the pepper was charred garp snatched it up with the tongs and flipped it into the sink the pepper hissed at him talk all you want to garp told it you dont have much time left he was distracted usually he liked to stop thinking about other things while he cookedin fact he forced himself to but he was suffering a crisis of confidence about marriage counseling youre suffering a crisis of confidence about your writing helen told him walking into the kitchen with even more than her usual authoritythe freshly cut twobyfours slung over and under her arm like matching shotguns walt said daddy burned something it was a pepper and daddy meant to garp said every time you cant write you do something stupid helen said though ill confess this is a better idea for a diversion than your last diversion garp had expected her to be ready but he was surprised that she was so ready what helen called his last diversion from his stalled writing had been a babysitter garp drove a wooden spoon deep into his tomato sauce he flinched as some fool took the corner by the house with a roaring downshift and a squeal of tires that cut through garp with the sound of a struck cat he looked instinctively for walt who was right theresafe in the kitchen helen said wheres duncan she moved to the door but garp cut in front of her duncan went to ralphs he said he was not worried this time that the speeding car meant duncan had been hit but it was garps habit to chase down speeding cars he had properly bullied every fast driver in the neighborhood the streets around garps house were cut in squares bordered every block by stop signs garp could usually catch up to a car on foot provided that the car obeyed the stop signs he raced down the street after the sound of the car sometimes if the car was going really fast garp would need three or four stop signs to catch up to it once he sprinted five blocks and was so out of breath when he caught up to the offending car that the driver was sure thered been a murder in the neighborhood and garp was either trying to report it or had done it himself most drivers were impressed with garp and even if they swore about him later they were polite and apologetic to his face assuring him they would not speed in the neighborhood again it was clear to them that garp was in good physical shape most of them were high school kids who were easily embarrassedcaught hotrodding around with their girl friends or leaving little smokingrubber stains in front of their girl friends houses garp was not such a fool as to imagine that he changed their ways all he hoped to do was make them speed somewhere else the present offender turned out to be a woman garp saw her earrings glinting and the bracelets on her arm as he ran up to her from behind she was just ready to pull away from a stop sign when garp rapped the wooden spoon on her window startling her the spoon dribbling tomato sauce looked at a glance as if it had been dipped in blood garp waited for her to roll down her window and was already phrasing his opening remarks im sorry i startled you but i wanted to ask you a personal favor when he recognized that the woman was ralphs motherthe notorious mrs ralph duncan and ralph were not with her she was alone and it was obvious that she had been crying yes what is it she said garp couldnt tell if she recognized him as duncans father or not im sorry i startled you garp began he stopped what else could he say to her smearyfaced fresh from a fight with her exhusband or a lover the poor woman looked to be suffering her approaching middleage like the flu her body looked rumpled with misery her eyes were red and vague im sorry garp mumbled he was sorry for her whole life how could he tell her that all he wanted was for her to slow down what is it she asked him im duncans father garp said i know you are she said im ralphs mother i know he said he smiled duncans father meets ralphs mother she said caustically then she burst into tears her face flopped forward and struck the horn she sat up straight suddenly hitting garps hand resting on her rolleddown window his fingers opened and he dropped the longhandled spoon into her lap they both stared at it the tomato sauce produced a stain on her wrinkled beige dress you must think im a rotten mother mrs ralph said garp everconscious of safety reached across her knees and turned off the ignition he decided to leave the spoon in her lap it was garps curse to be unable to conceal his feelings from people even from strangers if he thought contemptuous thoughts about you somehow you knew i dont know anything about what kind of mother you are garp told her i think ralphs a nice boy he can be a real shit she said perhaps youd rather duncan not stay with you tonight garp askedgarp hoped to garp she didnt appear to know that duncan was spending the night with ralph she looked at the spoon in her lap its tomato sauce garp said to his surprise mrs ralph picked up the spoon and licked it youre a cook she asked yes i like to cook garp said its very good mrs ralph told him handing him his spoon i should have gotten one like yousome muscular little prick who likes to cook garp counted in his head to five then he said id be glad to go pick up the boys they could spend the night with us if youd like to be alone alone she cried im usually alone i like having the boys with me and they like it too she said do you know why mrs ralph looked at him wickedly why garp said they like to watch me take a bath she said theres a crack in the door isnt it sweet that ralph likes to show off his old mother to his friends yes garp said you dont approve do you mr garp she asked him you dont approve of me at all im sorry youre so unhappy garp said on the seat beside her in her messy car was a paperback of dostoevskys the eternal husband garp remembered that mrs ralph was going to school what are you majoring in he asked her stupidly he recalled she was a neverending graduate student her problem was probably a thesis that wouldnt come mrs ralph shook her head you really keep your nose clean dont you she asked garp how long have you been married almost eleven years garp said mrs ralph looked more or less indifferent mrs ralph had been married for twelve your kids safe with me she said as if she were suddenly irritated with him and as if she were reading his mind with utter accuracy dont worry im quite harmlesswith children she added and i dont smoke in bed im sure its good for the boys to watch you take a bath garp told her then felt immediately embarrassed for saying it though it was one of the few things hed told her that he meant i dont know she said it didnt seem to do much good for my husband and he watched me for years she looked up at garp whose mouth hurt from all his forced smiles just touch her cheek or pat her hand he thought at least say something but garp was clumsy at being kind and he didnt flirt well husbands are funny he mumbled garp the marriage counselor full of advice i dont think many of them know what they want mrs ralph laughed bitterly my husband found a nineteenyearold cunt she said he seems to want her im sorry garp told her the marriage counselor is the imsorry man like a doctor with bad luckthe one who gets to diagnose all the terminal cases youre a writer mrs ralph said to him accusingly she waved her copy of the eternal husband at him what do you think of this its a wonderful story garp said it was fortunately a book he rememberedneatly complicated full of perverse and human contradiction i think its a sick story mrs ralph told him id like to know whats so special about dostoevsky well garp said his characters are so complex psychologically and emotionally and the situations are so ambiguous his women are less than objects mrs ralph said they dont even have any shape theyre just ideas that men talk about and play with she threw the book out the window at garp it hit his chest and fell by the curb she clenched her fists in her lap staring at the stain on her dress which marked her crotch with a tomatosauce bullseye boy thats me all over she said staring at the spot im sorry garp said again it may leave a permanent stain everything leaves a stain mrs ralph cried out a laughter so witless escaped her that it frightened garp he didnt say anything and she said to him ill bet you think that all i need is a good lay to be fair garp rarely thought this of people but when mrs ralph mentioned it he did think that in her case this oversimple solution might apply and ill bet you think id let you do it she said glaring at him garp in fact did think so no i dont think you would he said yes you think i would love to mrs ralph said garp hung his head no he said well in your case she said i just might he looked at her and she gave him an evil grin it might make you a little less smug she told him you dont know me well enough to talk to me like this garp said i know that youre smug mrs ralph said you think youre so superior true garp knew he was superior he would make a lousy marriage counselor he now knew please drive carefully garp said he pushed himself away from her car if theres anything i can do please call like if i need a good lover mrs ralph asked him nastily no not that garp said why did you stop me she asked him because i thought you were driving too fast he said i think youre a pompous fart she told him i think youre an irresponsible slob garp told her she cried out as if she were stabbed look im sorry he said again but ill just come pick up duncan no please she said i can look after him i really want to hell be all rightill look after him like he was my own this didnt truly comfort garp im not that much of a slobwith kids she added she managed an alarmingly attractive smile im sorry garp saidhis litany so am i said mrs ralph as if the matter were resolved between them she started her car and drove past the stop sign and through the intersection without looking she drove awayslowly but more or less in the middle of the roadand garp waved his wooden spoon after her then he picked up the eternal husband and walked home the dog in the alley the child in the sky weve got to get duncan out of that mad womans house garp told helen well you do it helen said youre the one whos worried you should have seen how she drove garp said well said helen presumably duncan isnt going to be riding around with her she may take the boys out for a pizza garp said im sure she cant cook helen was looking at the eternal husband she said its a strange book for a woman to give to another womans husband she didnt give it to me helen she threw it at me its a wonderful story helen said she said it was just sick garp said despairingly she thought it was unfair to women helen looked puzzled i wouldnt say that was even an issue she said of course it isnt garp yelled this woman is an idiot my mother would love her oh poor jenny helen said dont start on her finish your pasta walt garp said up your wazoo walt said nice talk garp said walt i dont have a wazoo yes you do walt said he doesnt know what it means helen said im not sure what it means either five years old garp said its not nice to say that to people garp told walt he heard it from duncan im sure helen said well duncan gets it from ralph garp said who no doubt gets it from his goddamn mother watch your own language helen said walt could as easily have gotten his wazoo from you not from me he couldnt have garp declared im not sure what it means either i never use that word you use plenty just like it helen said walt eat your pasta garp said calm down helen said garp eyed walts uneaten pasta as if it were a personal insult why do i bother he said the child eats nothing they finished their meal in silence helen knew garp was thinking up a story to tell walt after dinner she knew garp did this to calm himself whenever he was worried about the childrenas if the act of imagining a good story for children was a way to keep children safe forever with the children garp was instinctively generous loyal as an animal the most affectionate of fathers he understood duncan and walt deeply and separately yet helen felt sure he saw nothing of how his anxiety for the children made the children anxioustense even immature on the one hand he treated them as grown ups but on the other hand he was so protective of them that he was not allowing them to grow up he did not accept that duncan was ten that walt was five sometimes the children seemed fixed as threeyearolds in his mind helen listened to the story garp made up for walt with her usual interest and concern like many of the stories garp told the children it began as a story for the children and ended up as a story garp seemed to have made up for garp you would think that the children of a writer would have more stories read to them than other children but garp preferred that his children listen only to his stories there was a dog garp said what kind of dog said walt a big german shepherd dog said garp what was his name walt asked he didnt have a name garp said he lived in a city in germany after the war what war said walt world war ii garp said oh sure walt said the dog had been in the war garp said he had been a guard dog so he was very fierce and very smart very mean said walt no garp said he wasnt mean and he wasnt nice or sometimes he was both he was whatever his master trained him to be because he was trained to do whatever his master told him to do how did he know who his master was walt asked i dont know garp said after the war he got a new master this master owned a cafй in the city you could get coffee and tea and drinks there and read the newspapers at night the master would leave one light on inside the cafй so that you could look in the windows and see all the wipedoff tables with the chairs upsidedown on the table tops the floor was swept clean and the big dog paced back and forth across the floor every night he was like a lion in his cage at the zoo he was never still sometimes people would see him in there and theyd knock on the window to get his attention the dog would just stare at themhe wouldnt bark or even growl hed just stop pacing and stare until whoever it was went away you had the feeling that if you stayed too long the dog might jump through the window at you but he never did he never did anything in fact because no one ever broke into that cafй at night it was enough just having the dog there the dog didnt have to do anything the dog looked very mean said walt now youve got the picture garp told him every night was the same for that dog and every day he was tied up in an alley beside the cafй he was tied to a long chain which was tied to the front axle of an old army truck which had been backed into the alley and left therefor good this truck didnt have any wheels and you know what cinder blocks are garp said the truck was set on blocks so it wouldnt roll an inch on its axles there was just enough room for the dog to crawl under the truck and lie down out of the rain and the sun the chain was just long enough so that the dog could walk to the end of the alley and watch the people on the sidewalk and the cars in the street if you were coming along the sidewalk you could sometimes see the dogs nose poking out of the alley that was as far as the chain would reach and no farther you could hold out your hand to the dog and he would sniff you but he didnt like to be touched and he never licked your hand the way some dogs do if you tried to pat him he would duck his head and slink back into the alley the way he stared at you made you think it would not be a very good idea to follow him into the alley or to try very hard to pat him he would bite you walt said well you couldnt be sure garp said he never bit anyone actually or i never heard about it if he did you were there walt said yes garp said he knew that the storyteller was always there walt called helen it irritated garp that she eavesdropped on the stories he told the children that is what they mean by a dogs life helen called but neither walt nor his father appreciated her interruption walt said go on with the story what happened to the dog the responsibilities loomed for garp every time what is the instinct in people that makes them expect something to happen if you begin a story about a person or a dog something must be going to happen to them go on walt cried impatiently garp caught up in his art frequently forgot his audience he went on if too many people held out their hands for the dog to sniff the dog would wall back down the alley and crawl under the truck you could often see the tip of his black nose poking out from under the truc he was either under the truck or at the sidewalk end of the alley he never stopped in between he had his habits and nothing disturbed them nothing walt asked disappointedor else worried that nothing was going to happen well almost nothing garp admitted and walt perked up something bothered him there was just one thing it alone could make the dog furious it was the only thing that could even make the dog bark it really drove him crazy oh sure a cat cried walt a terrible cat said garp in a voice that made helen stop rereading the eternal husband and hold her breath poor walt she thought why was the cat terrible walt asked because he teased the dog garp said helen was relieved that this was apparently all that was terrible teasing isnt nice walt said with knowledge walt was duncans victim in the area of teasing duncan should be hearing this story helen thought a lesson about teasing is clearly wasted on walt teasing is terrible garp said but this cat was terrible he was an old cat off the streets dirty and mean what was his name walt asked he didnt have a name garp said nobody owned him he was hungry all the time so he stole food nobody could blame him for that and he had lots of fights with other cats and nobody could blame him for that either i suppose he had only one eye the other eye had been missing for so long that the hole had closed and the fur had grown over where the eye had been he didnt have any ears he must have had to fight all the time the poor thing helen cried nobody could blame that cat for the way he was garp said except that he teased the dog that was wrong he didnt have to do that he was hungry so he had to be sneaky and nobody took care of him so he had to fight but he didnt have to tease the dog teasing isnt nice walt said again very definitely duncans story helen thought every day said garp that cat would walk down the sidewalk and stop to wash himself at the end of the alley the dog would come out from under the truck running so hard that the chain wriggled behind him like a snake thats just been run over in the road you ever seen that oh sure walt said and when the dog got to the end of his chain the chain would snap the dogs neck back and the dog would be tugged off his feet and land on the pavement of the alley sometimes knocking his wind out or hitting his head the cat would never move the cat knew how long the chain was and he would sit there washing himself with his one eye staring at the dog the dog went crazy he barked and snapped and struggled against his chain until the owner of the cafй his master would have to come out and shoo the cat away then the dog would crawl back under the truck sometimes the cat would come right back and the dog would lie under the truck for as long as he could stand it which was not very long hed lie under there while the cat licked himself all over out on the sidewalk and pretty soon you could hear the dog begin to whimper and whine and the cat would just stare down the alley at him and go on washing himself and pretty soon the dog would start to howl under the truck and thrash around there as if he were covered with bees but the cat would just go on washing himself and finally the dog would lunge out from under the truck and charge up the alley again snapping his chain behind himeven though he knew what would happen he knew that the chain would rip him off his feet and choke him and throw him on the pavement and that when he got up the cat would still be sitting there inches away washing himself and hed bark himself hoarse until his master or someone else would shoo the cat away that dog hated that cat garp said so do i walt said and so did i said garp helen felt herself turn against the storyit had such an obvious conclusion she said nothing go on walt said part of telling a story to a child garp knew is telling or pretending to tell a story with an obvious conclusion one day said garp everybody thought the dog had finally lost his mind for one whole day he ran out from under the truck and all the way up the alley until the chain jerked him off his feet then hed do it again even when the cat wasnt there the dog just kept charging up the alley throwing his weight against the chain and heaving himself to the pavement it startled some of the people walking on the sidewalk especially the people who saw the dog coming at them and didnt know that there was a chain and that night the dog was so tired that he didnt pace around the cafй he slept on the floor as if he were sick anyone could have broken into the cafй that night i dont think that dog would have woken up and the next day he did the same thing although you could tell his neck was sore because he cried out every time the chain snapped him off his feet and that night he slept in the cafй as if he were a dead dog whod been murdered there on the floor his master called a vet garp said and the vet gave the dog some shotsi guess to calm him down for two days the dog lay on the floor of the cafй at nighttime and under the truck in the daytime and even when the cat walked by on the sidewalk or sat washing himself at the end of the alley that dog wouldnt move that poor dog garp added he was sad walt said but do you think he was smart garp asked walt was puzzled but he said i think he was he was garp said because all the time hed been running against the chain hed been moving the truck he was tied tojust a little even though that truck had sat there for years and it was rusted solid on those cinder blocks and the buildings could fall down around it before that truck would budgeeven so garp said that dog made the truck move just a little do you think the dog moved the truck enough garp asked walt i think so walt said helen thought so too he needed just a few inches to reach that cat garp said walt nodded helen confident of the gory outcome plunged back into the eternal husband one day garp said slowly the cat came and sat down on the sidewalk at the end of the alley and began to lick his paws he rubbed his wet paws into his old ear holes where his ears had been and he rubbed his paws over his old growntogether eye hole where his other eye used to be and he stared down the alley at the dog under the truck the cat was getting bored now that the dog wouldnt come out anymore and then the dog came out i think the truck moved enough walt said the dog ran up the alley faster than ever before so that the chain behind him was dancing off the ground and the cat never moved although this time the dog could reach him except said garp the chain didnt quite reach helen groaned the dog got his mouth over the cats head but the chain choked him so badly that he couldnt close his mouth the dog gagged and was jerked backlike beforeand the cat realizing that things had changed sprang away god helen cried oh no walt said of course you couldnt fool a cat like that twice garp said the dog had one chance and he blew it that cat would never let him get close enough again what a terrible story helen cried walt silent looked as if he agreed but something else happened garp said walt looked up alert helen exasperated held her breath again the cat was so scared he ran into the street without looking no matter what happens garp said you dont run into the street without looking do you walt no walt said not even if a dog is going to bite you garp said not ever you never run into the street without looking oh sure i know walt said what happened to the cat garp slapped his hands together so sharply that the boy jumped he was killed like that garp cried smack he was dead nobody could fix him hed have had a better chance if the dog had gotten him a car hit him walt asked a truck garp said ran right over his head his brains came out his old ear holes where his ears used to be squashed him walt asked flat said garp and he held up his hand palm level in front of walts serious little face jesus helen thought it was walts story after all dont run into the street without looking the end said garp good night walt said good night garp said to him helen heard them kiss why didnt the dog have a name walt asked i dont know garp said dont run into the street without looking when walt fell asleep helen and garp made love helen had a sudden insight regarding garps story that dog could never move that truck she said not an inch right garp said helen felt sure he had actually been there so howd you move it she asked him i couldnt move it either garp said it wouldnt budge so i cut a link out of the dogs chain at night when he was patrolling the cafй and i matched the link at a hardware store the next night i added some linksabout six inches and the cat never ran into the street helen asked no that was for walt garp admitted of course helen said the chain was plenty long enough garp said the cat didnt get away the dog killed the cat helen asked he bit him in half garp said in a city in germany helen said no austria garp said it was vienna i never lived in germany but how could the dog have been in the war helen asked hed have been twenty years old by the time you got there the dog wasnt in the war garp said he was just a dog his owner had been in the warthe man who owned the cafй thats why he knew how to train the dog he trained him to kill anybody who walked in the cafй when it was dark outside when it was light outside anybody could walk in when it was dark even the master couldnt get in thats nice helen said suppose there was a fire there seems to me to be a number of drawbacks to that method its a war method apparently garp said well helen said it makes a better story than the dogs being in the war you think so really garp asked her it seemed to her that he was alert for the first time during their conversation thats interesting he said because i just this minute made it up about the owners being in the war helen asked well more than that garp admitted what part of the story did you make up helen asked him all of it he said they were in bed together and helen lay quietly there knowing that this was one of his trickier moments well almost all of it he added garp never tired of playing this game though helen certainly tired of it he would wait for her to ask which of it which of it is true which of it is made up then he would say to her that it didnt matter she should just tell him what she didnt believe then he would change that part every part she believed was true every part she didnt believe needed work if she believed the whole thing then the whole thing was true he was very ruthless as a storyteller helen knew if the truth suited the story he would reveal it without embarrassment but if any truth was unsuccessful in a story he would think nothing of changing it when youre through playing around she said id just be curious to know what really happened well really said garp the dog was a beagle a beagle well actually a schnauzer he was tied up in the alley all day but not to an army truck to a volkswagen helen guessed to a garbage sled garp said the sled was used to pull the garbage cans out to the sidewalk in the winter but the schnauzer of course was too small and weak to pull itat any time of the year and the cafй owner helen asked he was not in the war she garp said she was a widow her husband had been killed in the war helen guessed she was a young widow garp said her husband had been killed crossing the street she was very attached to the dog which her husband had given her for their first anniversary but her new landlady would not allow dogs in her apartment so the widow set the dog loose in the cafй each night it was a spooky empty space and the dog was nervous in there in fact he crapped all night long people would stop and peer in the window and laugh at all the messes the dog made this laughter made the dog more nervous so he crapped more in the morning the widow came earlyto air out the place and clean up the messesand she spanked the dog with a newspaper and dragged him cowering out into the alley where he was tied up to the garbage sled all day and there was no cat helen asked oh there were lots of cats garp said they came into the alley because of the garbage cans for the cafй the dog would never touch the garbage because he was afraid of the widow and the dog was terrified of cats whenever there was a cat in the alley raiding the garbage cans the dog crawled under the garbage sled and hid there until the cat was gone my god said helen so there was no teasing either there is always teasing garp said solemnly there was a little girl who would come to the end of the alley and call the dog out to the sidewalk except that the dogs chain wouldnt reach the sidewalk and the dog would yap and yap and yap at the little girl who stood on the sidewalk and called come on come on until someone rolled down a window and yelled at her to leave the poor mutt alone you were there helen said we were there garp said every day my mother wrote in a room the only window of which faced that alley that dogs yapping drove her nuts so jenny moved the garbage sled helen said and the dog ate the little girl whose parents complained to the police who had the dog put to sleep and you of course were a great comfort to the grieving widow who was perhaps in her early forties her late thirties garp said but thats not how it happened what happened helen asked one night in the cafй garp said the dog had a stroke a number of people claimed to have been responsible for scaring the dog so badly that they caused his stroke there was a kind of competition in regard to this in the neighborhood they were always doing things like creeping up to the cafй and hurling themselves against the windows and doors shrieking like huge catscreating a frenzy of bowel movements by the frightened dog the stroke killed the dog i hope helen said not quite garp said the stroke paralyzed the dogs hindquarters so that he could only move his front end and wag his head the widow however clung to the life of this wretched dog as she clung to the memory of her late husband and she had a carpenter with whom she was sleeping build a little cart for the dogs rear end the cart had wheels on it so the dog just walked on his front legs and towed his dead hindquarters around on the little cart my god helen said you wouldnt believe the noise of those little wheels garp said probably not said helen mother claimed she couldnt hear it garp said but the rolling sound was so pathetic it was worse than the dogs yapping at the stupid little girl and the dog couldnt turn a corner very well without skidding hed hop along and then turn and his rear wheels would slide out beside him faster than he could keep hopping and hed go into a roll when he was on his side he couldnt get up again it seemed i was the only one to see him in this predicamentat least i was always the one who went into the alley and tipped him upright again as soon as he was back on his wheels hed try to bite me garp said but he was easy to outrun so one day helen said you untied the schnauzer and he ran into the street without looking no excuse me he rolled into the street without looking and everyones troubles were over the widow and the carpenter were married not so said garp i want the truth helen said sleepily what happened to the damn schnauzer i dont know garp said mother and i came back to this country and you know the rest helen giving in to sleep knew that only her silence might get garp to reveal himself she knew that this story might be as made up as the other versions or that the other versions might be largely trueeven that this one might be largely true any combination was possible with garp helen was already asleep when garp asked her which story do you like better but lovemaking made helen sleepy and she found the sound of garps voice going on and on enhancing to her drowsiness it was her most preferred way to fall asleep after love with garp talking this frustrated garp at bedtime his engines were almost cold lovemaking seemed to rev him up and rouse him to moods of marathon talk eating allnight reading general prowling about in this period he rarely tried to write though he would sometimes write messages to himself about what he would write later but not this night he instead pulled back the covers and watched helen sleep then he covered her again he went to walts room and watched him duncan was sleeping at mrs ralphs when garp shut his eyes he saw a glow on the suburban horizon which he imagined was the dreaded house of ralphin flames garp watched walt and this calmed him garp relished having such close scrutiny of the child he lay beside walt and smelled the boys fresh breath remembering when duncans breath had turned sour in his sleep in that grownups way it had been an unpleasant sensation for garp shortly after duncan turned six to smell that duncans breath was stale and faintly foul in his sleep it was as if the process of decay of slowly dying was already begun in him this was garps first awareness of the mortality of his son there appeared with this odor the first discolorations and stains on duncans perfect teeth perhaps it was just that duncan was garps firstborn child but garp worried more about duncan than he worried about walteven though a fiveyearold seems more prone than a tenyearold to the usual childhood accidents and what are they garp wondered being hit by cars choking to death on peanuts being stolen by strangers cancer for example was a stranger there was so much to worry about when worrying about children and garp worried so much about everything at times especially in these throes of insomnia garp thought himself to be psychologically unfit for parenthood then he worried about that too and felt all the more anxious for his children what if their most dangerous enemy turned out to be him he soon fell asleep beside walt but garp was a fearful dreamer he was not asleep for long soon he was moaning his armpit hurt he woke up suddenly walts little fist was snagged in his armpit hair walt was moaning too garp untangled himself from the whimpering child who seemed to garp to be suffering the same dream garp had sufferedas if garps trembling body had communicated garps dream to walt but walt was having his own nightmare it would not have occurred to garp that his instructional story of the war dog the teasing cat and the inevitable killer truck could have been terrifying to walt but in his dream walt saw the great abandoned army truck more the size and shape of a tank guns and inexplicable tools and evillooking attachments all over itthe windshield was a slit no bigger than a letter slot it was all black of course the dog who was tied to the truck was the size of a pony though leaner and much more cruel he was loping in slow motion toward the end of the alley his weaklooking chain spiraling behind him the chain hardly looked strong enough to hold back the dog at the end of the alley with his legs all buttery and stumbling over himself hopelessly clumsy and unable to flee little walt bumbled in circles but he couldnt seem to get himself goingto get himself away from that terrible dog when the chain snapped the great truck lurched forward as if someone had started it and the dog was on him walt grabbed the dogs fur sweaty and coarse his fathers armpit but somehow he lost his grip the dog was at his throat but walt was running again into the street where trucks like the abandoned army truck rolled heavily past their massive rear wheels in rows stacked together like giant doughnuts on their sides and because of the mere gun slits for windshields the drivers couldnt see of course they couldnt see little walt then his father kissed him and walts dream slipped away for now he was somewhere safe again he could smell his father and feel his fathers hands and he heard his father say its just a dream walt in garps dream he and duncan had been riding on an airplane duncan had to go to the bathroom garp pointed down the aisle there were doors down there a small kitchen the pilots cabin the lavatory duncan wanted to be taken there to be shown which door but garp was cross with him youre ten years old duncan garp said you can read or ask the stewardess duncan crossed his knees and sulked garp shoved the child into the aisle grow up duncan he said its one of those doors down there go on moodily the child walked down the aisle toward the doors a stewardess smiled at him and rumpled his hair as he passed her but duncan typically would ask nothing he got to the end of the aisle and glared back at garp garp waved to him impatiently duncan shrugged his shoulders helplessly which door exasperated garp stood up try one he shouted down the aisle to duncan and people looked at duncan standing there duncan was embarrassed and opened a door immediatelythe one nearest him he gave a quick surprised but uncritical look back to his father before he seemed to be drawn through the door hed opened the door slammed itself after duncan the stewardess screamed the plane gave a little dip in altitude then corrected itself everyone looked out the windows some people fainted some threw up garp ran down the aisle but the pilot and another officiallooking person prevented garp from opening the door it should always be kept locked you stupid bitch the pilot shouted to the sobbing stewardess i thought it was locked she wailed wheres it go garp cried god wheres it go he saw that nothing was written on any of the doors im sorry sir the pilot said it couldnt be helped but garp shoved past him he bent a plainclothesman against the back of a seat he smacked the stewardess out of the aisle when he opened the door garp saw that it went outsideinto the rushing skyand before he could cry aloud for duncan garp was sucked through the open door and into the heavens where he hurtled after his son mrs ralph if garp could have been granted one vast and naпve wish it would have been that he could make the world safe for children and for grownups the world struck garp as unnecessarily perilous for both after garp and helen made love and helen fell asleepafter the dreamsgarp got dressed when he sat on his bed to tie his track shoes he sat on helens leg and woke her up she reached out her hand to touch him then felt his running shorts where are you going she asked him to check on duncan he said helen stretched up on her elbows she looked at her watch it was after one in the morning and she knew duncan was at ralphs house how are you going to check on duncan she asked garp i dont know garp said like a gunman hunting his victim like the child molester the parent dreads garp stalks the sleeping spring suburbs green and dark the people snore and wish and dream their lawn mowers at rest it is too cool for their air conditioners to be running a few windows are open a few refrigerators are humming there is the faint trapped warble from some televisions tuned in to the late show and the bluegray glow from the picture tubes throbs from a few of the houses to garp this glow looks like cancer insidious and numbing putting the world to sleep maybe television causes cancer garp thinks but his real irritation is a writers irritation he knows that wherever the tv glows there sits someone who isnt reading garp moves lightly along the street he wants to meet no one his running shoes are loosely laced his track shorts flap he hasnt worn a jock because he hasnt planned to run though the spring air is cool he wears no shirt in the blackened houses an occasional dog snorfles as garp passes by fresh from lovemaking garp imagines that his scent is as keen as a cut strawberry he knows the dogs can smell him these are wellpoliced suburbs and for a moment garp is apprehensive that he might be caughtin violation of some unwritten dress code at least guilty of carrying no identification he hurries convinced hes coming to duncans aid rescuing his son from the randy mrs ralph a young woman on an unlighted bicycle almost collides with him her hair floating behind her her knees bare and shiny her breath striking garp as a startling mixture of a freshcut lawn and cigarettes garp crouchesshe cries out and wobbles her bike around him she stands up on her pedals and pumps fast away from him not looking back perhaps she thinks he is a wouldbe exhibitionistthere with his torso and legs bare ready to drop his shorts garp thinks she is coming from some place she shouldnt have been she is headed for trouble he imagines but thinking of duncan and mrs ralph garp has trouble on his mind at this hour when garp first sees ralphs house he believes it should be given the light of the block award every window is glaring the front door is open the cancerous television is violently loud garp suspects mrs ralph is having a party but as he creeps closerher lawn festooned with dog messes and mangled sports equipmenthe feels the house is deserted the televisions lethal rays pulsate through the living room clogged with piles of shoes and clothes and crammed against the sagging couch are the casual bodies of duncan and ralph half in their sleeping bags asleep of course but looking as if the television has murdered them in the sickly tv light their faces look drained of blood but where is mrs ralph out for the evening gone to bed with all the lights on and the door open leaving the boys to be bathed by the television garp wonders if shes remembered to shut the oven off the living room is pockmarked with ashtrays garp fears for cigarettes still smoldering he stays behind the hedges and slinks to the kitchen window sniffing for gas there is a litter of dishes in the sink a bottle of gin on the kitchen table the sour smell of slashed limes the cord to the overhead light at one time too short has been substantially lengthened by one sheer leg and hip of a womans pair of panty hosesevered up the middle the whereabouts of the other half unclear the nylon foot spotted with translucent stains of grease dangles in the breeze above the gin there is nothing burning that garp can smell unless theres a slow fire under the cat who lies neatly on top of the stove artfully spread between burners its chin resting on the handle of a heavy skillet its furry belly warmed by the pilot lights garp and the cat stare at each other the cat blinks but garp believes that mrs ralph hasnt the necessaryconcentration to turn herself into a cat her homeher lifein utter disarray the woman appears to have abandoned ship or perhaps passed out upstairs is she in bed or in the bathtub drowned and where is the beast whose dangerous droppings have made a mine field out of the lawn just then there is a thunderous approach down the back staircase of a heavy falling body that bashes open the stairway entrance door to the kitchen startling the cat into flight skidding the greasy iron skillet to the floor mrs ralph sits bareassed and wincing on the linoleum a kimonostyle robe wide open and roughly tugged above her thick waist a miraculously unspilled drink in her hand she looks at the drink surprised and sips it her large downpointing breasts shinethey slouch across her freckled chest as she leans back on her elbows and burps the cat in a corner of the kitchen yowls at her complaining oh shut up titsy mrs ralph says to the cat but when she tries to get up she groans and lies down flat on her back her pubic hair is wet and glistens at garp her belly furrowed with stretch marks looks as white and parboiled as if mrs ralph has been underwater for a long time ill get you out of here if its the last thing i do mrs ralph tells the kitchen ceiling though garp assumes shes speaking to the cat perhaps shes broken an ankle and is too drunk to feel it garp thinks perhaps shes broken her back garp glides alongside the house to the open front door he calls inside anybody home he shouts the cat bolts between his legs and is gone outside garp waits he hears grunts from the kitchenthe strange sounds of flesh slipping well as i live and breathe says mrs ralph veering into the doorway her robe of faded flowers more or less drawn together somewhere shes ditched her drink i saw all the lights on and thought there might be trouble garp mumbles youre too late mrs ralph tells him both boys are dead i should never have let them play with that bomb she probes garps unchanging face for any signs of a sense of humor there but she finds him rather humorless on this subject okay you want to see the bodies she asks she pulls him toward her by the elastic waistband of his running shorts garp aware hes not wearing a jock stumbles quickly after his pants bumping into mrs ralph who lets him go with a snap and wanders into the living room her odor confuses himlike vanilla spilled in the bottom of a deep damp paper bag mrs ralph seizes duncan under his arms and with astonishing strength lifts him in his sleeping bag to the mountainous lumpy couch garp helps her lift ralph whos heavier they arrange the boys foot to foot on the couch tucking their sleeping bags around them and setting pillows under their heads garp turns off the tv and mrs ralph stumbles through the room killing lights gathering ashtrays they are like a married couple cleaning up after a party nighty night mrs ralph whispers to the suddenly dark living room as garp trips over a hassock groping his way toward the kitchen lights you cant go yet mrs ralph hisses to him youve got to help me get someone out of here she takes his arm drops an ashtray her kimono opens wide garp bending to pick up the ashtray brushes one of her breasts with his hair ive got this lummox up in my bedroom she tells garp and he wont go i cant make him leave a lummox garp says hes a real oaf says mrs ralph a fucking wingding a wingding garp says yes please make him go she asks garp she pulls out the elastic waistband of his shorts again and this time she takes an unconcealed look god you dont wear too much do you she asks him arent you cold she lays her hand flat on his bare stomach no youre not she says shrugging garp edges away from her who is he garp asks fearing he might get involved in evicting mrs ralphs former husband from the house come on ill show you she whispers she draws him up the back staircase through a narrow channel that passes between the piled laundry and enormous sacks of pet food no wonder she fell down here he thinks in mrs ralphs bedroom garp looks immediately at the sprawled black labrador retriever on mrs ralphs undulating water bed the dog rolls listlessly on his side and thumps his tail mrs ralph mates with her dog garp thinks and she cant get him out of her bed come on boy garp says get out of here the dog thumps his tail harder and pees a little not him mrs ralph says giving garp a terrific shove he catches his balance on the bed which sloshes the great dog licks his face mrs ralph is pointing to an easy chair at the foot of the bed but garp first sees the young man reflected in mrs ralphs dressingtable mirror sitting naked in the chair he is combing out the blond end of his thin ponytail which he holds over his shoulder and sprays with one of mrs ralphs aerosol cans his belly and thighs have the same slick buttered look that garp saw on the flesh and fur of mrs ralph and his young cock is as lean and arched as the backbone of a whippet hey how you doing the kid says to garp fine thank you garp says get rid of him says mrs ralph ive been trying to get her to just relax you know the kid asks garp im trying to get her to just sort of go with it you know dont let him talk to you mrs ralph says hell bore the shit out of you everyones so tense the kid tells garp he turns in the chair leans back and puts his feet on the water bed the dog licks his long toes mrs ralph kicks his legs off the bed you see what i mean the kid asks garp she wants you to leave garp says you her husband the kid asks thats right says mrs ralph and hell pull your scrawny little prick off if you dont get out of here you better go garp tells him ill help you find your clothes the kid shuts his eyes appears to meditate hes really great at that shit mrs ralph tells garp all this kids good for is shutting his damn eyes where are your clothes garp asks the boy perhaps hes seventeen or eighteen garp thinks maybe hes old enough for college or a war the boy dreams on and garp gently shakes him by the shoulder dont touch me man the boy says eyes still closed there is something foolishly threatening in his voice that makes garp draw back and look at mrs ralph she shrugs thats what he said to me too she says like her smiles garp notices mrs ralphs shrugs are instinctual and sincere garp grabs the boys ponytail and tugs it across his throat and around to the back of his neck he snaps the boys head into the cradle of his arm and holds him tightly there the kids eyes open get your clothes okay garp tells him dont touch me the boy repeats i am touching you garp says okay okay says the boy garp lets him get up the boy is several inches taller than garp but easily ten pounds lighter he looks for his clothes but mrs ralph has already found the long purple caftan absurdly heavy with brocade the boy climbs into it like armor it was nice balling you he tells mrs ralph but you should learn to relax more mrs ralph laughs so harshly that the dog stops wagging his tail you should go back to day one she tells the kid and learn everything all over again from the beginning she stretches out on the water bed beside the labrador who lolls his head across her stomach oh cut it out bill she tells the dog crossly shes very unrelaxed the kid informs garp you dont know shit about how to relax anybody mrs ralph says garp steers the young man out of the room and down the treacherous back staircase through the kitchen to the open front door you know she asked me in the boy explains it was her idea she asked you to leave too garp says you know youre as unrelaxed as she is the boy tells him did the children know what was up garp asks him were they asleep when you two went upstairs dont worry about the kids the boy says kids are beautiful man and they know much more than grownups think they know kids are just perfect people until grownups get their hands on them the kids were just fine kids are always just fine you have kids garp cant help but mutter until now garp has felt great patience toward the young man but garp isnt patient on the subject of children he accepts no other authority there goodbye garp tells the boy and dont come back he shoves him but lightly out the open door dont push me the kid shouts but garp ducks under the punch and comes up with his arms locked around the kids waist to garp it feels that the kid weighs seventyfive maybe eighty pounds though of course hes heavier than that he bearhugs the boy and pins his arms behind his back then he carries him out to the sidewalk when the kid stops struggling garp puts him down you know where to go garp asks him do you need any directions the kid breathes deeply feels his ribs and dont tell your friends where they can come sniffing around after it garp says dont even use the phone i dont even know her name man the kid whines and dont call me man says garp okay man the kid says garp feels a pleasant dryness in his throat which he recognizes as his readiness to touch someone but he lets the feeling pass please walk away from here garp says a block away the boy calls goodbye man garp knows how quickly he could run him down anticipation of such a comedy appeals to him but it would be disappointing if the boy werent scared and garp feels no pressing need to hurt him garp waves goodbye the boy raises his middle finger and walks away his silly robe draggingan early christian lost in the suburbs look out for the lions kid garp thinks sending a blessing of protection after the boy in a few years he knows duncan will be that age garp can only hope that hell find it easier to communicate with duncan back inside mrs ralph is crying garp hears her talking to the dog oh bill she sobs im sorry i abuse you bill youre so nice goodbye garp calls up the stairs your friends gone and im going too chickenshit yells mrs ralph how can you leave me like this her wailing grows louder soon garp thinks the dog will start to bay what can i do garp calls up the stairs you could at least stay and talk to me mrs ralph shouts you goodygoody chickenshit wingding whats a wingding garp wonders navigating the stairs you probably think this happens to me all the time says mrs ralph in utter rumplement upon the water bed she sits with her legs crossed her kimono tight around her bills large head in her lap garp in fact does think so but he shakes his head i dont get my rocks off by humiliating myself you know mrs ralph says for gods sake sit down she pulls garp to the rocking bed theres not enough water in the damn thing mrs ralph explains my husband used to fill it all the time because it leaks im sorry garp says the marriagecounsel man i hope you never walk out on your wife mrs ralph tells garp she takes his hand and holds it in her lap the dog licks his fingers its the shittiest thing a man can do says mrs ralph he just told me hed been faking his interest in me for years he said and then he said that almost any other woman young or old looked better to him than i did thats not very nice is it mrs ralph asks garp no it isnt garp agrees please believe me i never messed around with anyone until he left me mrs ralph tells him i believe you garp says its very hard on a womans confidence mrs ralph says why shouldnt i try to have some fun you should garp says but im so bad at it mrs ralph confesses holding her hands to her eyes rocking on the bed the dog tries to lick her face but garp pushes him away the dog thinks garp is playing with him and lunges across mrs ralphs lap garp whacks the dogs nosetoo hardand the poor beast whines and slinks away dont you hurt bill mrs ralph shouts i was just trying to help you garp says you dont help me by hurting bill mrs ralph says jesus is everyone bananas garp slumps back on the water bed eyes shut tight the bed rolls like a small sea and garp groans i dont know how to help you he confesses im very sorry about your troubles but theres really nothing i can do is there if you want to tell me anything go ahead he says his eyes still shut tight but nobody can help the way you feel thats a cheerful thing to say to someone mrs ralph says bill is breathing in garps hair there is a tentative lick at his ear garp wonders is it bill or mrs ralph then he feels her hand grab him under his track shorts and he thinks coldly if i didnt really want her to do that why did i lie down on my back please dont do that he says she can certainly feel hes not interested and she lets him go she lies down beside him then rolls away putting her back to him the bed sloshes violently as bill tries to wriggle between them but mrs ralph elbows him so hard in his thick rib cage that the dog coughs and abandons the bed for the floor poor bill im sorry mrs ralph says crying softly bills hard tail thumps the floor mrs ralph as if to complete her selfhumiliation farts her sobbing is steady like the kind of rain garp knows can last all day garp the marriage counselor wonders what could give the woman a little confidence mrs ralph garp saysthen tries to bite back what hes said what she says whatd you say she struggles up to her elbows and turns her head to glare at him she heard him he knows did you say mrs ralph she asks him jesus mrs ralph she cries you dont even know my name garp sits up on the edge of the bed he feels like joining bill on the floor i find you very attractive he mumbles to mrs ralph but hes facing bill really prove it mrs ralph says you goddamn liar show me i cant show you garp says but its not because i dont find you attractive i dont even give you an erection mrs ralph shouts here i am halfnaked and when youre beside meon my goddamn bedyou dont even have a respectable hardon i was trying to conceal it from you garp says you succeeded mrs ralph says whats my name garp feels he has never been so aware of one of his terrible weaknesses how he needs to have people like him how he wants to be appreciated with every word he knows he is deeper in trouble and deeper into an obvious lie now he knows what a wingding is your husband must be crazy garp says you look better to me than most women oh please stop it says mrs ralph you must be sick i must be garp agrees but he says you should have confidence in your sexuality believe me and more important you should develop confidence in yourself in other ways there never were any other ways mrs ralph admits i was never so hot at anything but sex and now im not so hot at sex either but youre going to school garp says groping im sure i dont know why mrs ralph says or is that what you mean by developing confidence in other ways garp squints hard wishes for unconsciousness when he hears the water bed sound like surf he senses danger and opens his eyes mrs ralph has undressed has spread herself out on the bed naked the little waves are still lapping under her roughtough body which confronts garp like a sturdy rowboat moored on choppy water show me youve got a hardon and you can go she says show me your hardon and ill believe you like me garp tries to think of an erection in order to do this he shuts his eyes and thinks of someone else you bastard says mrs ralph but garp discovers he is already hard it was not nearly so difficult as he imagined opening his eyes hes forced to recognize that mrs ralph is not without allure he pulls down his track shorts and shows himself to her the gesture itself makes him harder he finds himself liking her damp curly hair but mrs ralph seems neither disappointed nor impressed with the demonstration she is resigned to being let down she shrugs she rolls over and turns her great round rump to garp okay so you can actually get it up she tells him thank you you can go home now garp feels like touching her sickened with embarrassment garp feels he could come by just looking at her he blunders out the door down the wretched staircase is the womans selfabuse all over for this night he wonders is duncan safe he contemplates extending his vigil until the comforting light of dawn stepping on the fallen skillet and clanging it against the stove he hears not even a sigh from mrs ralph and only a moan from bill if the boys were to wake up and need anything he fears mrs ralph wouldnt hear them its am in mrs ralphs finally quiet house when garp decides to clean the kitchen to kill the time until dawn familiar with a housewifes tasks garp fills the sink and starts to wash the dishes when the phone rang garp knew it was helen it suddenly occurred to himall the terrible things she could have on her mind hello garp said would you tell me whats going on please helen asked garp knew she had been awake a long time it was four oclock in the morning nothings going on helen garp said there was a little trouble here and i didnt want to leave duncan where is that woman helen asked in bed garp admitted she passed out from what helen asked shed been drinking garp said there was a young man here with her and she wanted me to get him to leave so then you were alone with her helen asked not for long garp said she fell asleep i dont imagine it would take very long helen said with her garp let there be silence he had not experienced helens jealousy for a while but he had no trouble remembering its surprising sharpness nothings going on helen garp said tell me what youre doing exactly at this moment helen said im washing the dishes garp told her he heard her take a long controlled breath i wonder why youre still there helen said i didnt want to leave duncan garp told her i think you should bring duncan home helen said right now helen garp said ive been good it sounded defensive even to garp also he knew he hadnt been quite good enough nothing has happened he added feeling a little more sure of the truth of that i wont ask you why youre washing her filthy dishes helen said to pass the time garp said but in truth he had not examined what he was doing until now and it seemed pointless to himwaiting for dawn as if accidents only happened when it was dark im waiting for duncan to wake up he said but as soon as he spoke he felt there was no sense to that either why not just wake him up helen asked im good at washing dishes garp said trying to introduce some levity i know all the things youre good at helen told him a little too bitterly to pass as a joke youll make yourself sick thinking like this garp said helen really please stop it i havent done anything wrong but garp had a puritans niggling memory of the hardon mrs ralph had given him ive already made myself sick helen said but her voice softened please come home now she told him and leave duncan for christs sake wake him up she said or carry him ill be right home garp told her please dont worry dont think what youre thinking ill tell you everything that happened youll probably love this story but he knew he would have trouble telling her all this story and that he would have to think very carefully about the parts to leave out i feel better helen said ill see you soon please dont wash another dish then she hung up and garp reviewed the kitchen he thought that his half hour of work hadnt made enough of a difference for mrs ralph to notice that any effort to approach the debris had even been begun garp sought duncans clothes among the many forbidding clots of clothing flung about the living room he knew duncans clothes but he couldnt spot them anywhere then he remembered that duncan like a hamster stored things in the bottom of his sleeping bag and crawled into the nest with them duncan weighed about eighty pounds plus the bag plus his junk but garp believed he could carry the child home duncan could retrieve his bicycle another day at least garp decided he would not wake duncan up inside ralphs house there might be a scene duncan would be fussy about leaving mrs ralph might even wake up then garp thought of mrs ralph furious at himself he knew he wanted one last look his sudden recurring erection reminded him that he wanted to see her thick crude body again he moved quickly to the back staircase he could have found her fetid room with his nose he looked straight at her crotch her strangely twisted navel her rather small nipples for such big breasts he should have looked first at her eyes then he might have realized she was wideawake and staring back at him dishes all done asked mrs ralph come to say goodbye i wanted to see if you were all right he told her bullshit she said you wanted another look yes he confessed he looked away im sorry dont be she said its made my day garp tried to smile youre too sorry all the time mrs ralph said what a sorry man you are except to your wife mrs ralph said you never once said you were sorry to her there was a phone beside the water bed garp felt he had never so badly misread a persons condition as he had misread mrs ralphs she was suddenly no drunker than bill or she had become miraculously undrunk or she was enjoying that half hour of clarity between stupor and hangovera half hour garp had read about but had always believed was a myth another illusion im taking duncan home garp told her she nodded if i were you she said id take him home too garp fought back another im sorry suppressing it after a short but serious struggle do me one favor said mrs ralph garp looked at her she didnt mind dont tell your wife everything about me okay dont make me out to be such a pig maybe you could draw a picture of me with a little sympathy i have pretty good sympathy garp mumbled you have a pretty good rod on too said mrs ralph staring at garps elevated track shorts you better not bring that home garp said nothing garp the puritan felt he deserved to take a few punches your wife really looks after you doesnt she said mrs ralph i guess you havent always been a good boy you know what my husband would have called you she asked my husband would have called you pussywhipped your husband must have been some asshole garp said it felt good to get a punch in even a weak punch but garp felt foolish that he had mistaken this woman for a slob mrs ralph got off the bed and stood in front of garp her tits touched his chest garp was anxious that his hardon might poke her youll be back mrs ralph said want to bet on it garp left her without a word he wasnt farther than two blocks from mrs ralphs houseduncan crammed down in the sleeping bag wriggling over garps shoulderwhen the squad car pulled to the curb and its policeblue light flickered over him where he stood caught a furtive halfnaked kidnapper sneaking away with his bright bundle of stolen goods and stolen looksand a stolen child what you got there fella a policeman asked him there were two of them in the squad car and a third person who was hard to see in the back seat my son garp said both policemen got out of the car where are you going with him one of the cops asked garp is he all right he shined a flashlight in duncans face duncan was still trying to sleep he squinted away from the light he was spending the night at a friends house garp said but it didnt work out im carrying him home the policeman shined his light over garpin his running costume shorts shoes with racing stripes no shirt you got identification the policeman asked garp set duncan and the sleeping bag gently on someones lawn of course not garp said if you give me a ride home ill show you something the policemen looked at each other they had been called into the neighborbood hours ago when a young woman had reported that she was approached by an exhibitionistat least by a streaker possibly it was a matter of attempted rape she had escaped him on a bicycle she said you been out here a long time one of the policemen asked garp the third person in the back seat of the police car looked out the window at what was going on when he saw garp he said hey man how you doing duncan started to wake up ralph duncan said one policeman knelt beside the boy and pointed the flashlight up at garp is this your father the cop asked duncan the boy was rather wildeyed he darted his eyes from his father to the cops to the blue light flashing on the squad car the other policeman went over to the person in the back seat of the car it was the boy in the purple caftan the police had picked him up while they were cruising the neighborhood for the exhibitionist the boy hadnt been able to tell them where he livedbecause he didnt really live anywhere do you know that man with the child there the policeman asked the boy yeah hes a real tough guy the kid said its all right duncan garp said dont be scared im just taking you home son the policeman asked duncan is this your father youre scaring him garp told the cop im not scared duncan said why are you taking me home he asked his father it seemed that everyone wanted to hear this ralphs mother was upset garp said he hoped that would be enough but the rejected lover in the police car started to laugh the policeman with the flashlight shone his light on the lover boy and asked garp if he knew him garp thought there is no end to this in sight my name is garp garp said irritably t s garp i am married i have two children one of themthis one named duncan the olderwas spending the night with a friend i was convinced that this friends mother was unfit to look after my son i went to the house and took my son home or im still trying to get home that boy garp said pointing to the police car was visiting the mother of the friend of my son when i arrived the mother wanted the boy to leavethat boy garp said again pointing at the kid in the police car and he left what is this mothers name a policeman asked he was trying to write everything down in a giant pad after a polite silence the policeman looked up at garp duncan garp asked his son what is ralphs name well its being changed duncan said he used to have his fathers name but his mothers trying to get it changed yes but what is his fathers name garp asked ralph duncan said garp shut his eyes ralph ralph the policeman with the pad said no duncan please think garp said ralphs last name is what well i think thats the name being changed duncan said duncan what is it being changed from garp asked you could ask ralph duncan suggested garp wanted to scream did you say your name was garp one of the policemen asked yes garp admitted and the initials are t s the policeman asked garp knew what would happen next he felt very tired yes t s he said just t s hey tough shit howled the kid in the car falling back in the seat swooning with laughter what does the first initial stand for mr garp the policeman asked nothing garp said nothing the policeman said theyre just initials garp said theyre all my mother gave me your first name is t the policeman asked people call me garp garp said what a story man cried the boy in the caftan but the policeman nearest the squad car rapped on the roof at him you put your dirty feet on that seat again sonny he said and ill have you licking the crud off garp said the policeman interviewing garp i know who you are he cried suddenly garp felt very anxious youre the one who got that molester in that park yes said garp that was me but it wasnt here and it was years ago i remember it as if it were yesterday the policeman said whats this the other policeman asked youre too young the cop told him this is man named garp who grabbed that molester in that parkwhere was it that child molester thats who it was and what was it you did he asked garp curiously i mean there was something funny wasnt there funny said garp for a living the policeman said what did you do for a living im a writer garp said oh yeah the policeman remembered are you still a writer yes garp confessed he knew at least that he wasnt a marriage counselor well ill be the policeman said but something was still bothering him garp could tell something was wrong i had a beard then garp offered thats it the policeman cried and youve shaved it or right said garp the policemen had a conference in the red glow of the taillights of the squad car they decided to give garp and duncan a ride home but they said garp would still have to show them some information regarding his identity i just dont recognize youfrom the pictureswithout the beard the older policeman said well it was years ago garp said sadly and in another town garp felt uneasy that the young man in the caftan would get to see the house the garps lived in garp imagined the young man would show up one day asking for something you remember me the kid asked duncan i dont think so duncan said politely well you were almost asleep the boy admitted to garp he said youre too uptight about children man children make it just fine this your only child no i have another one garp said man you ought to have a dozen other ones the boy said then maybe you wouldnt get so uptight about just one you know this sounded to garp like what his mother called the percy theory of children take your next left garp told the policeman who was driving then a right and its on the corner the other policeman handed duncan a lollipop thank you duncan said what about me the kid in the caftan asked i like lollipops the policeman glared when he turned his back duncan gave the kid his lollipop duncan was no fan of lollipops he never had been thank you the boy whispered you see man he said to garp kids are just beautiful so is helen garp tboughtin the doorway with the light behind her her blue floorlength robe had a high rollup collar helen had the collar turned up as if she were cold she also had her glasses on so that garp knew shed been watching for them man whispered the kid in the caftan elbowing garp as he got out of the car whats that lovely lady like when she gets her glasses off mom we got arrested duncan called to helen the squad car waited at the curb for garp to get his identification we did not get arrested garp said we got a ride duncan everythings fine he said angrily to helen he ran upstairs to find his wallet among his clothes is that how you went out helen called after him dressed like that the police thought he was kidnapping me duncan said did they come to the house helen asked him no dad was carrying me home duncan said boy is dad weird garp thundered down the stairs and ran out the door a case of mistaken identity garp muttered to helen they must have been looking for someone else for gods sake dont get upset im not upset helen said sharply garp showed the police his identification well ill be the older policeman said it is just t s isnt it i suppose its easier that way sometimes it isnt garp said as the police car was leaving the kid called out to garp youre not a bad guy man if youd just learn to relax garps impression of helens body lean and tense and shivering in the blue robe did not relax him duncan was wideawake and jabbering he was hungry too so was garp in the predawn kitchen helen coolly watched them eat duncan told the plot of a long tv movie garp suspected that it was actually two movies and duncan had fallen asleep before one was over and woken up after the other one had begun he tried to imagine where and when mrs ralphs activities fitted into duncans movies helen didnt ask any questions in part garp knew this was because there was nothing she could say in front of duncan but in part like garp she was severely editing what she wanted to say they were both grateful for duncans presence by the time they got to speak freely to each other the long wait might make them kinder and more careful at dawn they couldnt wait any longer and they began to talk to each other through duncan tell mommy what the kitchen looked like garp said and tell her about the dog bill right garp said tell her about old bill what was ralphs mother wearing while you were there helen asked duncan she smiled at garp i hope she wore more clothes than daddy what did you have for supper garp asked duncan are the bedrooms upstairs or downstairs helen asked or both garp tried to give her a look that said please dont get started he could feel her edging the old worn weapons into easy reach she had a babysitter or two she could recall for him and he felt her moving the babysitters into place if she brought up one of the old wounding names garp had no names ready for retaliation helen had no babysitters against her not yet in garps mind harrison fletcher didnt count how many telephones are there helen asked duncan is there a phone in the kitchen and one in the bedroom or is the only phone in the bedroom when duncan finally went to his room helen and garp were left with less than half an hour before walt would wake up but helen had the names of her enemies ready there is plenty of time to do damage when you know where the war wounds are i love you so much and i know you so well helen began it happens to helen latenight phone callsthose burglar alarms in the heartwould frighten garp all his life who is it that i love garps heart would cry at the first ringwhos been blasted by a truck whos drowned in the beer or lies sideswiped by an elephant in the terrible darkness garp feared the receiving of such aftermidnight calls but he once made oneunknowinglyhimself it had been one evening when jenny was visiting them his mother had let it slip how cushie percy had ruptured in childbirth garp had not heard of it and although he occasionally joked with helen about his old passion for cushieand helen teased him about herthe news of cushie dead was nearly crippling to garp cushman percy had been so activethere had been such a hot juiciness about herit seemed impossible news of an accident to alice fletcher could not have upset him more he felt more prepared for something happening to her sadly he knew things would always be happening to quiet alice garp wandered into the kitchen and without really noticing the time or remembering when he opened another beer he discovered that he had dialed the percys number the phone was ringing slowly garp could imagine the long way back from sleep that fat stew had to travel before he could answer the phone god who are you calling helen asked coming into the kitchen its quarter of two before garp could hang up stewart percy answered the phone yes fat stew asked worriedly and garp could imagine frail and brainless midge sitting up in bed beside him as nervous as a cornered hen im sorry i woke you garp said i didnt realize it was so late helen shook her head and walked abruptly out of the kitchen jenny appeared in the kitchen doorway on her face was the kind of critical look only a mother can give a son that is a look with more disappointment in it than the usual anger who the hell is this stewart percy said this is garp sir garp said a little boy again apologizing for his genes holy shit said fat stew what do you want jenny had neglected to tell garp that cushie percy had died months ago garp thought he was offering condolences on a fresh disaster thus he faltered im sorry very sorry garp said you said so you said so stewart said i just heard about it garp said and i wanted to tell you and mrs percy how truly sorry i was i may not have demonstrated it to you sir but i was really very fond of you little swine said stewart percy you mother humper you jap ball of shit he hung up the phone even garp was unprepared for this much loathing but he misunderstood the situation it would be years before he realized the circumstances of his phone call poor pooh percy batty bainbridge would one day explain it to jenny when garp called cushie had been dead for so long that stewart did not realize garp was commiserating with him on cushies loss when garp called it was the midnight of the dark day when the black beast bonkers had finally expired stewart percy thought that garps call was a cruel jokefalse condolences for the dog garp had always hated and now when garps phone rang garp was conscious of helens grip emerging instinctively from her sleep when he picked up the phone helen had his leg clamped fast between her kneesas if she were holding tight to the life and safety that his body was to her garps mind ran through the odds walt was home asleep and so was duncan he was not at ralphs helen thought it is my father its his heart sometimes she thought theyve finally found and identified my mother in a morgue and garp thought they have murdered mom or they are holding her for ransommen who will accept nothing less than the public rape of forty virgins before releasing the famous feminist unharmed and theyll also demand the lives of my children and so forth it was roberta muldoon on the phone and that only convinced garp that the victim was jenny fields but the victim was roberta hes left me roberta said her huge voice swollen with tears hes thrown me over me can you believe it jesus roberta garp said oh i never knew what shits men were until i became a woman roberta said its roberta garp whispered to helen so that she could relax her lovers flown the coop helen sighed released garps leg rolled over you dont even care do you roberta asked garp testily please roberta garp said im sorry roberta said but i thought it was too late to call your mother garp found this logic astonishing since he knew that jenny stayed up later than he did but he also liked roberta very much and she had certainly had a hard time he said i wasnt enough of a woman that i confused him sexuallythat i was confused sexually roberta cried oh god that prick all he wanted was the novelty of it he was just showing off for his friends ill bet you could have taken him roberta garp said why didnt you beat the shit out of him you dont understand roberta said i dont feel like beating the shit out of anyone anymore im a woman dont women ever feel like beating the shit out of someone garp asked helen reached over to him and pulled his cock i dont know what women feel like roberta wailed i dont know what theyre supposed to feel like anyway i just know what i feel like whats that garp asked knowing she wanted to tell him i feel like beating the shit out of him now roberta confessed but when he was dumping all over me i just sat there and took it i even cried ive been crying all day she cried and he even called me up and told me that if i was still crying i was faking myself the hell with him garp said all he wanted was a great big lay roberta said why are men like that well garp said oh i know youre not roberta said im not even attractive to you probably of course youre attractive roberta garp said but not to you roberta said dont lie im not sexually attractive am i not really to me garp confessed but to lots of other men yes of course you are well youre a good friend thats more important roberta said youre not really sexually attractive to me either thats perfectly all right garp said youre too short roberta said i like longerlooking peoplei mean sexually dont be hurt im not hurt garp said dont you be either of course not roberta said why not call me in the morning garp suggested youll feel better i wont roberta said sulkily ill feel worse and ill feel ashamed that i called you why not talk to your doctor garp said the urologist the fellow who did your operationhes your friend isnt he i think he wants to fuck me roberta said seriously i think thats all he ever wanted to do to me i think he recommended this whole operation just because he wanted to seduce me but he wanted to make me a woman first theyre notorious for thata friend was telling me a crazy friend roberta garp said whos notorious for that urologists roberta said oh i dont knowisnt urology a little creepy to you it was but garp didnt want to upset roberta any further call mom he heard himself say shell cheer you up shell think of something oh she is wonderful roberta sobbed she always does think of something but i feel ive used her for so much she loves to help roberta garp said and knew it was at least the truth jenny fields was full of sympathy and patience and garp only wanted to sleep a good game of squash might help roberta garp suggested weakly why not come over for a few days and well really hit the ball around helen rolled into him frowned at him and bit his nipple helen liked roberta but in the early phase of her sex reassignment roberta could talk only about herself i just feel so drained roberta said no energy no nothing i dont even know if i could play well you should try roberta garp said you should make yourself do something helen exasperated with him rolled away from him but helen was affectionate with garp when he answered these latenight calls she said they frightened her and she didnt want to be the one to find out what the calls were about it was strange therefore that when roberta muldoon called a second time a few weeks later helen was the one who answered the phone it surprised garp because the phone was on his side of the bed and helen had to reach over him to pick it up in fact this time she lunged across him and whispered quickly to the phone yes what is it when she heard it was roberta she passed the phone quickly to garp it was not as if shed been trying to let him sleep and when roberta called a third time garp felt an absence when he picked up the phone something was missing oh hello roberta garp said it was helens usual grip on his leg it wasnt there helen wasnt there he noticed he talked reassuringly to roberta felt the cold side of his unshared bed and noted the time was amrobertas favorite hour when roberta finally hung up garp went downstairs to look for helen finding her all alone on the livingroom couch sitting up with a glass of wine and a manuscript in her lap couldnt sleep she said but there was a look on her faceit was a look garp couldnt immediately place although he thought he recognized that look he also thought he had never seen that look on helen reading papers he asked she nodded but there was only one manuscript in front of her garp picked it up its just student work she said reaching for it the students name was michael milton garp read a paragraph of the paper it sounds like a story garp said i didnt know you assigned fiction writing to your students i dont helen said but they sometimes show me what they do anyway garp read another paragraph he thought that the writers style was selfconscious and forced but there were no errors on the page it was at least competent writing hes one of my graduate students helen said hes very bright but she shrugged but her gesture had the sudden mock casualness of an embarrassed child but what garp said he laughedthat helen could look so girlish at this late hour but helen took her glasses off and showed him that other look again that look he had first seen and couldnt place anxiously she said oh i dont know young maybe hes just young you know very bright but young garp flipped a page read half of another paragraph gave the manuscript back to her he shrugged its all shit to me he said no its not shit helen said seriously oh helen the judicious teacher garp thought and announced he was going back to bed ill be up in a little while helen told him then garp saw himself in the mirror in the upstairs bathroom that was where he finally identified that look hed seen strangely out of place on helens face it was a look garp recognized because hed seen it beforeon his own face from time to time but never on helens the look garp recognized was guilty and it puzzled him he lay awake a long time but helen did not come up to bed in the morning garp was surprised that although hed only glanced at the graduate students manuscript the name of michael milton was the first thing to come to his mind he looked cautiously at helen now lying awake beside him michael milton garp said quietly not to her but loud enough for her to hear he watched her unresponding face either she was daydreaming and far away or she simply had not heard him or he thought the name of michael milton was already on her mind so that when garp uttered it it was the name that she was already sayingto herselfand she had not noticed that garp had spoken it michael milton a thirdyear graduate student in comparative literature had been a french major at yale where he graduated with indifferent distinction he had earlier graduated from the steering school though he tended to play down his prep school years once he knew that you knew he had gone to yale he tended to play that down too but he never played down his junior year abroadin france to listen to michael milton you would not guess that hed spent only a year in europe because he managed to give you the impression that hed lived in france all his young life he was twentyfive though hed lived so briefly in europe it appeared that hed bought all the clothes for his lifetime there the tweed jackets had wide lapels and flared cuffs and both the jackets and the slacks were cut to flatter the hips and the waist they were the kind of clothes that even the americans of garps days at steering referred to as continental the collars of michael miltons shirts which he wore open at the throat always with two unbuttoned buttons were floppy and wide with a kind of renaissance flair a manner betraying both carelessness and intense perfection he was as different from garp as an ostrich is different from a seal the body of michael milton was an elegant body when dressed unclothed he resembled no animal so much as he resembled a heron he was thin and tallish with a slouch his tailored tweed jackets concealed he had a body like coat hangersthe perfect body to hang clothes on stripped he had barely a body at all he was garps opposite in almost every way except that michael milton had in common with garp a tremendous selfconfidence he shared with garp the virtue or the vice of arrogance like garp he was aggressive in the way only someone who believes totally in himself can be aggressive it had been these qualities long ago that had first attracted helen to garp now here were the qualities newly attired they manifested themselves in a much different form yet helen recognized them she was not usually attracted to rather dandified young men who dressed and spoke as if they had grown worldweary and wisely sad in europe when in fact they had spent most of their short lives in the back seats of cars in connecticut but in her girlhood helen had not usually been attracted to wrestlers either helen liked confident men provided that their confidence was not absurdly misplaced what attracted michael milton to helen was what attracted many men and few women to her she was in her thirties an alluring woman not simply because she was beautiful but because she was perfectlooking it is an important distinction to note that she looked not only as if she had taken good care of herself but that she had good reason to have done so this frightening but fetching look in helens case was not misleading she was a very successful woman she looked to be in such total possession of her life that only the most confident men could continue to look at her if she looked back at them even in bus stations she was a woman who was stared at only until she looked back in the corridors surrounding the english department helen was not used to being stared at at all everyone looked when they could but the looks were furtive she was therefore unprepared for the long frank look that young michael milton gave her one day he simply stopped in the hall and watched her walking toward him it was actually helen who turned her eyes away from his he turned and watched her walk away from him down the hall he said to someone beside him loud enough for helen to hear does she teach here or go here whats she do here anyway michael milton asked in the second semester of that year helen taught a course in narrative point of view it was a seminar for graduate students and for a few advanced undergraduates helen was interested in the development and sophistication of narrative technique with special attention to point of view in the modern novel in the first class she noticed the olderlooking student with the thin pale mustache and the nice shirt with the two buttons unbuttoned she turned her eyes away from him and distributed a questionnaire it asked among other questions why the students thought they were interested in this particular course in answer to that question a student named michael milton wrote because from the first time i saw you i wanted to be your lover after that class alone in her office helen read that answer to her questionnaire she thought she knew which one of the people in the class michael milton was if shed known it was someone else some boy she hadnt even noticed she would have shown the questionnaire to garp garp might have said show me the fucker or lets introduce him to roberta muldoon and they would both have laughed and garp would have teased her about leading her students on because the intentions of the boy whoever he was would have been aired between them there would have been no possibility of actual connection helen knew that when she didnt show the questionnaire to garp she felt already guiltybut she thought that if michael milton was who she thought he was she would like to see this go a little further at that moment in her office helen honestly did not foresee it going more than a little further what would have been the harm of a little if harrison fletcher had still been her colleague she would have shown him the questionnaire regardlesswhoever michael milton was even if he was that disturbinglooking boyshe would have brought up the matter with harrison harrison and helen in the past had some secrets of this kind which they kept from garp and alice they were permanent but innocent secrets helen knew that sharing michael miltons interest in her with harrison would have been another way to avoid any actual connection but she did not mention michael milton to garp and harrison of course had left to seek his tenure elsewhere the handwriting on the questionnaire was black eighteenthcentury calligraphy the kind that can only be carved with a special pen michael miltons written message looked more permanent than print and helen read it over and over again she noted the other answers to the questionnaire date of birth years in school previous courses in the department of english or in comparative literature she checked his transcript his grades were good she called two colleagues whod had michael milton in courses last semester she derived from them both that michael milton was a good student aggressive and proud to the point of being vain she gathered from both her colleagues though they did not actually say so that michael milton was both gifted and unlikable she thought of the deliberately unbuttoned buttons on his shirt she was sure now that it was he and she imagined buttoning them up she thought of that wispy mustache a thin trace upon his lip garp would later comment on michael miltons mustache saying that it was an insult to the world of hair and to the world of lips garp thought it was so much the merest imitation of a mustache that michael milton would do his face a favor to shave it off but helen liked the strange little mustache on the lip of michael milton you just dont like any mustaches helen said to garp i dont like that mustache he said ive got nothing against mustaches in general garp insisted though in truth helen was right garp hated all mustaches ever since his encounter with the mustache kid the mustache kid had spoiled mustaches for garp forever helen also liked the length of michael miltons sideburns curly and blondish garps sideburns were cropped level to his dark eyes almost at the tops of his earsalthough his hair was thick and shaggy and always just long enough to cover the ear that bonkers ate helen also noticed that her husbands eccentricities were beginning to bother her perhaps she just noticed them more now that he was so fitfully involved in his writing slump when he was writing perhaps he had less time to devote to his eccentricities whatever the reason she found them irksome his driveway trick for example infuriated her it was even contradictory for someone who fussed and worried so much about the safety of the childrenabout reckless drivers about leaking gas and so forthgarp had a way of entering their driveway and garage after dark that terrified helen the driveway turned sharply uphill off a long downhill road when garp knew the children were in bed asleep he would cut the engine and the lights and coast up the black driveway he would gather enough momentum from leaving the downhill road to roll over the lip at the top of the driveway and down into their dark garage he said he did it so that the engine and the headlights would not wake up the children but he had to start the car to turn it around to drive the babysitter home anyway helen said his trick was simply for a thrillit was puerile and dangerous he was always running over toys left in the blackened driveway and crashing into bicycles not moved far enough to the rear of the garage once a babysitter had complained to helen that she hated coasting down the driveway with the engine and the headlights out another trick he would pop the clutch and snap on the lights just before they reached the road am i the one whos restless helen wondered she had not thought of herself as restless until she thought of garps restlessness and for how long had she really been irritated by garps routines and habits she didnt know she only knew that she noticed she was irritated by them almost from the moment she read michael miltons questionnaire helen was driving to her office wondering what she would say to the rude and conceited boy when the gear knob of the volvos stick shift came off in her handthe exposed shaft scratched her wrist she swore as she pulled the car over and examined the damage to herself and to the gearshift the knob had been falling off for weeks the screw threads were stripped and garp had several times attempted to make the knob stay on the stickshift shaft with tape helen had complained about this halfassed method of repair but garp never claimed to be handy and the care of the car was one of helens domestic responsibilities this division of labor though largely agreed upon was sometimes confusing although garp was the home maker among them helen did the ironing because garp said its you who cares about pressed clothes and helen got the car serviced because garp said youre the one who drives it every day you know best when something has to be fixed helen accepted the ironing but she felt that garp should deal with the car she did not like accepting a ride in the service truck from the garage to her officesitting in the greasy cab with some young mechanic who paid less than adequate attention to his driving the garage where the car was fixed was a friendly enough place to helen but she resented having to be there at all and the comedy of who would drive her to work after she dropped off the car had finally worn thin whos free to take mrs garp to the university the boss mechanic would cry into the dank and oily darkness of the vehicle pits and three or four boys eager but begrimed would drop their wrenches and their needlenosed pliers would lug and heave themselves out of the pits would bolt forward and volunteer to sharefor a brief heady momentthat tight cab aclank with auto parts which would take the slender professor garp to work garp pointed out to helen that when he took the car the volunteers were slow to appear he frequently waited in the garage for an hour finally coaxing some laggard to drive him home his mornings work thus shot he decided the volvo was helens chore they had both procrastinated about the gearshift knob if you just call to order a new one helen told him ill drive there and let them screw it on while i wait but i dont want to leave the car for a day while they fart around trying to fix this one she had tossed the knob to him but hed carried it out to the car and had taped it precariously back on the shaft somehow she thought it always fell off when she was driving but of course she drove the car more than he did damn she said and drove to her office with the ugly gearshift uncovered it hurt her hand every time she had to shift the car and her scratched wrist bled a little on the fresh skirt of her suit she parked the car and carried the gear knob with her across the parking lot toward her office building she contemplated throwing it down a storm sewer but it had little numbers printed on it in her office she could call the garage and tell them what the little numbers were then she could throw it away wherever she liked or she thought i can mail it to garp it was in this mood beset with trivia that helen encountered the smug young man slouched in the hall by her office door with the top two buttons of his nice shirt unbuttoned the shoulders of his tweed jacket were she noticed slightly padded his hair was a bit too lank and too long and one end of his mustacheas thin as a knifedrooped too far down at the corner of his mouth she was not sure if she wanted to love this young man or groom him youre up early she told him handing him the gearshift knob so that she could unlock her office door have you hurt yourself he asked youre bleeding helen would think later that it was as if he had a nose for blood because the slight scratch on her wrist had almost stopped bleeding are you going to be a doctor she asked him letting him inside her office i was going to be he said what stopped you she asked still not looking at him but moving about her desk straightening what was straight already and adjusting the venetian blind which had been left exactly as she wanted it she took her glasses off so that when she looked at him he was soft and fuzzy organic chemistry stopped me he said i dropped the course and besides i wanted to live in france oh youve lived in france helen asked him knowing thats what she was supposed to ask him knowing it was one of the things he thought was special about himself and he didnt hesitate to slip it in he had even slipped it in the questionnaire he was very shallow she saw right away she hoped he was the slightest bit intelligent but she felt curiously relieved by his shallownessas if this made him less dangerous to her and left her a little freer they talked about france which was fun for helen because she talked about france as well as michael milton talked about it and she had never been to europe she also told him that she thought he had a poor reason for taking her course a poor reason he pressed her smiling first of all helen said its a totally unrealistic expectation to have for the course oh you already have a lover michael milton asked her still smiling somehow he was so frivolous that he didnt insult her she didnt snap at him that it was enough to have a husband that it was none of his business or that she was out of his league she said instead that for what he wanted he should at least have registered for independent study he said hed be glad to switch courses she said she never took on any new independent study students in the second semester she knew she had not entirely discouraged him but she had not been exactly encouraging either michael milton talked to her seriously for an hourabout the subject of her course in narration he discussed virginia woolfs the waves and jacobs room very impressively though he was not so good on to the lighthouse and helen knew he only pretended to have read mrs dalloway when he left she was forced to agree with her two colleagues whod evaluated michael milton previously he was glib he was smug he was facile and all that was unlikable but he had a certain brittle smartness however shiny and thin it wasand it was also somehow unlikable what her colleagues had overlooked was his audacious smile and his way of wearing clothes as if he were defiantly undressed but helens colleagues were men they could not have been expected to define the precise audacity of michael miltons smile the way helen could define it helen recognized it as a smile that said to her i already know you and i know everything you like it was an infuriating smile but it tempted her she wanted to wipe it off his face one way of wiping it off helen knew would be to show michael milton that he didnt know heror what she really likedat all she also knew that not too many ways of showing him were open to her when she first shifted the volvo driving home the point of the uncovered stickshift shaft dug sharply into the heel of her hand she knew exactly where michael milton had left the gear knobon the window ledge above the wastebasket where the janitor would find it and probably throw it away it looked as if it ought to be thrown away but helen remembered that she had not phoned in the little numbers to the car garage that would mean that she or garp would have to call the car garage and try to order a new knob without the goddamn numbersgiving the year and model of the car and so forth and inevitably ending up with a knob that wasnt right but helen decided she was not going back to her office and she had enough on her mind already without trying to remember to call the janitor and tell him not to throw away the knob besides it might already be too late and anyway helen thought its not just my fault its garps fault too or she thought its really nobodys fault its just one of those things but she did not quite feel guiltless not yet when michael milton gave her his papers to readhis old papers from his other coursesshe accepted them and read them because at least this was an allowable stillinnocent subject for them to discuss his work when he grew bolder and more attached to her and he showed her even his creative work his short stories and pathetic poems about france helen still felt that their long conversations were guided by the critical constructive relationship between a student and a teacher it was all right to have lunch together they had his work to talk about perhaps both of them knew that the work was not so special for michael milton any topic of conversation that justified his being with helen was all right for helen she was still anxious about the obvious conclusionwhen he simply ran out of work when they had consumed all the papers hed had time to write when theyd mentioned every book they had in common then helen knew they would need a new subject she also knew that this was only her problemthat michael milton already knew what the inevitable subject between them was she knew he was smugly and irritatingly waiting for her to make up her mind she occasionally wondered if he would be bold enough to raise his original answer to her questionnaire again but she didnt think so perhaps both of them knew that he wouldnt have tothat the next move was hers he would show her how grownup he was by being patient helen wanted above all to surprise him but among these feelings that were new to her there was one she disliked she was most unused to feeling guiltyfor helen holm always felt right about everything she did and she needed to feel guiltless about this too she felt close to achieving this guiltfree state of mind but she did not quite have it not yet it would be garp who provided her with the necessary feeling perhaps he sensed he had competition garp got started as a writer out of a sense of competition and he finally broke out of his writing slump with a similar competitive surge helen he knew was reading someone else it did not occur to garp that she might be contemplating more than literature but he saw with a typical writers jealousy that someone elses words were keeping her up at night garp had first courted helen with the pension griliparzer some instinct told him to court her again if that had been an acceptable motive to get a young writer started it was a dubious motive for his writing nowespecially after hed been stopped for so long he might have been in a necessary phase rethinking everything letting the well refill preparing a book for the future with a proper period of silence somehow the new story he wrote for helen reflected the forced and unnatural circumstances of its conception the story was written less out of any real reaction to the viscera of life than it was written to relieve the anxieties of the writer it was possibly a necessary exercise for a writer who had not written in too long but helen did not care for the urgency with which garp shoved the story at her i finally finished something he said it was after dinner the children were asleep helen wanted to go to bed with himshe wanted long and reassuring lovemaking because she had come to the end of what michael milton had written there was nothing more for her to read or for them to talk about she knew she should not show the slightest disappointment in the manuscript garp gave her but her tiredness overwhelmed her and she stared at it crouching between dirty dishes ill do the dishes alone garp offered clearing the way to his story for her her heart sank she had read too much sex or at least romance was the subject she had at last come to garp had better provide it or michael milton would i want to be loved helen told garp he was gathering up the dishes like a waiter who was confident of a large tip he laughed at her read the story helen he said then well get laid she resented his priorities there could be no comparison between garps writing and the student work of michael milton though gifted among students michael milton helen knew would only be a student of writing all his life the issue was not writing the issue is me helen thought i want someone paying attention to me garps manner of courtship was suddenly offensive to her the subject being courted was somehow garps writing that is not the subject between us helen thought because of michael milton helen was way ahead of garp at considering the spoken and unspoken subjects between people if people only told each other what was on their minds wrote jenny fieldsa naпve but forgivable lapse both garp and jenny knew how difficult it was for people to do that garp cautiously washed the dishes waiting for helen to read his story instinctivelythe trained teacherhelen took out her red pencil and began that is not how she should read my story garp thought im not one of her students but he went on quietly washing the dishes he saw there was no stopping her vigilance by t s garp running my five miles a day i frequently encounter some smartmouthed motorist who will pull alongside me and ask from the safety of the drivers seat what are you in training for deep and regular breathing is the secret i am rarely out of breath i never pant or gasp when i respond i am staying in shape to chase cars i say at this point the responses of the motorists vary there are degrees of stupidity as there are degrees of everything else of course they never realize that i dont mean themim not staying in shape to chose their cars not out on the open road at least i let them go out there though i sometimes believe that i could catch them and i do not run on the open road as some motorists believe to attract attention in my neighborhood there is no place to run one must leave the suburbs to be even a middledistance runner where i live there are fourway stop signs at every intersection the blocks are short and those tightangle corners are hard on the balls of the feet also the sidewalks are threatened by dogs festooned with the playthings of children intermittently splashed with lawn sprinklers and just when theres some running room theres an elderly person taking up the whole sidewalk precarious on crutches or armed with quacking cones with good conscience one does not yell track to such a person even passing the aged at a safe distance but with my usual speed seems to alarm them and its not my intention to cause heart attacks so its the open road for training but its the suburbs im in training for in my condition i am more than a match for a car caught speeding in my neighborhood provided they make an even halfhearted halt at the stop signs they cannot hit over fifty before they have to brake for the next intersection i always catch up to them i can travel across lawns over porches through swing sets and the childrens wading pools i can burst through hedges or hurdle them and since my engine is quietand steady and always in tunei can hear if other cars are coming i dont have to stop at the stop signs in the end i run them down i wave them over they always stop although i am clearly in impressive carchasing condition that is not what intimidates the speeders no they are almost always intimidated by my parenthood because they are almost always young yes my parenthood is what sobers them almost every time i begin simply did you see my children back there i ask them loudly and anxiously veteran speeders upon being asked such a question are immediately frightened that they have run over my children they are instantly defensive i have two young children i tell them the drama is deliberate in my voicewhich with this sentence i allow to tremble a little it is as if i am holding back tears or unspeakable rage or both perhaps they think i am hunting a kidnapper or that i suspect them of being child molesters what happened they invariably ask you didnt see my children did you i repeat a little boy pulling a little girl in a red wagon this is of course a fiction i have two boys and theyre not so little they have no wagon they may have been watching television at the time or riding their bikes in the parkwhere its safe where there are no cars no the bewildered speeder says i saw children some children but i dont think i saw those children why because you almost killed them i say but i didnt see them the speeder protests you were driving too fast to see them i say this is sprung on them as if it were proof of their guilt i always pronounce this sentence as if it were hard evidence and theyre never sure ive rehearsed this part so well the sweat from my hard sprint by now drips off my mustache and the point of my chin streaking the driversside door they know only a father who genuinely fears for his children would run so hard would stare like such a maniac would wear such a cruel mustache im sorry they usually say this is a neighborhood full of children i always tell them you have other places you can drive fast dont you please for the childrens sake dont speed here anymore my voice now is never nasty it is always beseeching but they see that a restrained fanatic resides behind my honest watering eyes usually its just a young kid those kids have a need to dribble a little oil they want to race the frantic pace of the music on their radios and i dont expect to change their ways i only hope theyll do it somewhere else i concede that the open road is theirs when i train there i keep my place i run in the stuff of the soft shoulder in the hot sand and gravel in the beerbottle glassamong the mangled cats the maimed birds the mashed condoms but in my neighborhood the car is not king not yet usually they learn after my fivemile run i do fiftyfive pushups then five hundredyard dashes followed by fiftyfive situps followed by fiftyfive neck bridges its not that i care so much for the number five its simply that strenuous and mindless exertion is easier if one doesnt have to keep track of too many different numbers after my shower about five oclock through the late afternoon and in the course of the evening i allow myself five beers i do not chase cars at night children should not be playing outside at nightin my neighborhood or in any other neighborhood at night i believe the car is king of the whole modern world even the suburbs at night in fact i rarely leave my house or allow the members of my family to venture out but once i went to investigate an obvious accidentthe darkness suddenly streaked with headlights pointing straight up and exploding the silence pierced with a metal screaming and the shriek of ground glass only half a block away in the dark and perfect middle of my street a land rover lay upsidedown and bleeding its oil and gas in a puddle so deep and still i could see the moon in it the only sound the ping of heat in the hot pipes and the dead engine the land rover looked like a tank tumbled by a land mine great juts and tears in the pavement revealed that the auto had rolled over and over before coming to rest here the driversside door could be opened only slightly but enough to miraculously turn on the door light there in the lit cab still behind the steering wheelstill upsidedown and still alivewas a fat man he looked unharmed the top of his head rested gingerly on the ceiling of the cab which of course was now the floor but the man seemed only dimly sensitive to this change in his perspective he looked puzzled chiefly by the presence of a large brown bowling ball that sat alongside his head like another head he was in fact cheek to cheek with this bowling ball which he perhaps felt touching him as he might have felt the presence of a lovers severed headformerly resting on his shoulder is that you roger the man asked i couldnt tell whether he was addressing me or the bowling ball it is not roger i said answering for us both that roger is a moron the man explained we crossed our balls that the fat man was referring to a bizarre sexual experience seemed unlikely i assumed that the fat man referred to bowling this is rogers ball he explained indicating the brown globe against his cheek i should have known it wasnt my ball because it wouldnt fit in my bag my ball will fit in anyones bag but rogers ball is really strange i was trying to fit it in my bag when the land rover went off the bridge although i knew there was no bridge in my entire neighborhood i tried to visualize the occurrence but i was distracted by the gurgle of spilling gasoline like beer down a thirsty mans throat you should get out i told the upsidedown bowler ill wait for roger he replied roger will be right along and sure enough along come another land rover as if they were a separated twosome from a column of an army on the move rogers land rover come along with its headlights out and did not stop in time it plowed into the fat bowlers land rover and together like coupled boxcars they jarred each other another tough ten yards down the street it appeared that roger was a moron but i merely asked him the expected question is that you roger yup said the man whose throbbing land rover was dark and creaking little fragments of its windshield and headlights and grille dropped to the street like noisy confetti that could only be roger groaned the fat bowler still upsidedownand still alivein his lit cab i saw that his nose bled slightly it appeared that the bowling ball had bashed him you moron roger he called out youve got my ball well someones got my ball then roger replied ive got your ball you moron the fat bowler declared well thats not the answer to everything roger said youve got my land rover roger lit a cigarette in the blackened cab he did not appear interested in climbing out of the wreck you should set up flares i suggested to him and that fat man should get out of your land rover theres gasoline everywhere i dont think you should smoke but roger only continued smoking and ignoring me in the cavelike silence of the second land rover and the fat bowler again cried outas if he were having a dream that was starting over at the beginningis that you roger i went back to my house and called the police in the daytime in my neighborhood i would never have tolerated such mayhem but people who go bowling in each others land rovers are not the usual suburban speeders and i decided they were legitimately lost hello police i said i have learned what you can and what you cant expect of the police i know that they do not really support the notion of citizen arrest when i have reported speeders to them the results have been disappointing they dont seem interested in learning the details i am told there are people whom the police are interested in apprehending but i believe the police are basically sympathetic to speeders and they do not appreciate citizens who make arrests for them i reported the whereabouts of the bowlers accident and when the police asked as they always ask who was calling i told them roger that i knewknowing the policewould be interesting the police are always more interested in bothering the person who reports the crime than they are interested in bothering the criminals and sure enough when they arrived they went straight after roger i could see them all arguing under the streetlamps but i could catch only snatches of their conversation hes roger the fat bowler kept saying hes roger through and through im not the roger who called you fuckers roger told the police thats true the fat bowler declared this roger wouldnt call the police for anything and after a while they began to call out into our dark suburb for another roger is there another roger here one policeman called roger screamed the fat bowler but my dark house and the dark houses of my neighbors were appropriately silent in daylight i knew they would all be gone only their oil slicks and their broken glass would remain relievedand as always pleased with the destruction of automotive vehiclesi watched until almost dawn when the hulking coupled land rovers were finally separated and towed away they were like two exhausted rhinos caught fornicating in the suburbs roger and the fat bowler stood arguing and swinging their bowling balls until the streetlamps in our block were extinguished then as if on signal the bowlers shook hands and departed in different directionson foot and as if they knew where they were going the police came interrogating in the morning still concerned with the possibility of another roger but they learned nothing from mejust as they learn nothing apparently whenever i report a speeder to them well if it happens again they tell me be sure to let us know fortunately i have rarely needed the police i am usually effective with first offenders only once have i had to stop the same driverand him only twice he was an arrogant young man in a bloodred plumbers truck luridyellow lettering advertised on the cab that the plumber handled rotorootering needs and all plumbing services o fecteau owner and head plumber with twotime offenders i come more quickly to the point im calling the cops i told the young man and im calling your boss old o fecteau i should have called him the lost time im my own boss the young man said its my plumbing business fuck off and i realized i was facing o fecteau himselfa runty but successful youth unimpressed with standard authority there are children in this neighborhood i said two of them are mine yeah you already told me the plumber said he revved his engine as if he were clearing his throat there was a hint of menace in his expression like the trace of pubic beard he was growing on his young chin i rested my hands on the doorone on the handle one on the rolleddown window please dont speed here i said yeah ill try said o fecteau i might have let it go at that but the plumber lit a cigarette and smiled at me i thought i saw on his punks face the leer of the world if i catch you driving like that again i said ill stick your rotorooter up your ass we stared at each other o fecteau and i then the plumber gunned his engine and popped his clutch i had to leap back to the curb in the gutter i saw a little metal dump truck a childs toy the front wheels were missing i snatched it up and ran after o fecteau five blocks later i was close enough to throw the dump truck which struck the plumbers cab it made a good noise but it bounced off harmlessly even so o fecteau slammed on his brakes about five long pipes were flipped out of the pickup part of the truck and one of those metal drawers sprang open disgorging a screwdriver and several spools of heavy wire the plumber jumped down from his cab banging the door after himself he had a stillson wrench in his hand you could tell he was sensitive about collecting dents on his bloodred truck i grabbed one of the fallen pipes it was about five feet long and i quickly smashed the trucks left taillight with it for some time now things have just been coming naturally to me in fives for example the circumference in inches of my chest expanded fiftyfive your taillights broken i pointed out to the plumber you shouldnt be driving around that way im going to call the cops on you you crazy bastard said o fecteau this is a citizen arrest i said you broke the speed limit youre endangering the lives of my children well go see the cops together and i poked the long pipe under the trucks rear license plate and folded the plate like a letter you touch my truck again the plumber said and youre in trouble but the pipe felt as light in my hands as a badminton rocket i swung it easily and shattered the other taillight youre already in trouble i pointed out to o fecteau you ever drive in this neighborhood again you better stay in first gear and use your flasher first i knew swinging the pipe he would need to repair his flasher there was an elderly woman just then who came out of her house to observe the commotion she recognized me immediately i catch up to a lot of people at her corner oh good for you she called i smiled to her and she tattered toward me stopping and peering into her wellgroomed lawn where the toy dump truck arrested her attention she seized it with obvious distaste and carried it over to me i put the toy and the pieces of broken glass and plastic from the taillights and the flasher into the back of the pickup it is a clean neighborhood i despise litter on the open road in training i see nothing but litter i put the other pipes in back too and with the long pipe i still held like a warriors javelin i nudged the screwdriver and the spools of wire that had fallen by the curb o fecteau gathered them up and returned them to the metal drawer he is probably a better plumber than a driver i thought the stillson wrench looked very comfortable in his hand you should be ashamed of yourself the old woman told o fecteau the plumber glared at her hes one of the worst ones i told her imagine that the old lady said and youre a big boy she told the plumber you should know better o fecteau edged back to the cab looking as if he would hurl his wrench at me then leap into his truck and back over the old biddy drive carefully i told him when he was safely in the cab i slid the long pipe into the pickup then i took the old womans arm and helped her along the sidewalk when the truck tore away from the curb with that stink of scorched rubber and a noise as raw as bones leaving their sockets i felt the old lady tremble through the frail point of her elbow something of her fear passed into me and i realized how risky it was to make anyone as angry as i had made o fecteau i could hear him maybe five blocks away driving furiously fast and i prayed for all the dogs and cats and children who might be near the street surely i thought modern life is about five times as difficult as life used to be i should stop this crusade against speeders i thought i go too far with them but they make me so angrywith their carelessness their dangerous sloppy way of life which i view as so directly threatening to my own life and the lives of my children i have always hated cars and hated people who drove them stupidly i feel such anger toward people who take such risks with other peoples lives let them race their carsbut in the desert we would not allow an outdoor rifle range in the suburbs let them jump out of airplanes if they wantbut over the ocean not where my children live what would this neighborhood be like without you the old woman wondered aloud i can never remember her name without me i thought this neighborhood would probably be peaceful perhaps deadlier but peaceful they all drive so fast the old lady said if it werent for you i sometimes think theyd be having their smashups right in my living room but i felt embarrassed that i shared such anxiety with eightyyearoldsthat my fears are more like their nervous senile worries than they are the normal anxieties of people my own young middle age what an incredibly dull life i have i thought aiming the old woman toward her front door steering her over the cracks in the sidewalk then the plumber came back i thought the old woman was going to die in my arms the plumber drove over the curb and hurtled past us over the old womans lawn flattening a whiplike young tree and nearly rolling over when he wheeled the truck into a uturn that uprooted a sizable hedge and tore divots from the ground the size of fivepound steaks then down to the sidewalk the truck fledan explosion of tools flying free of the pickup as the rear wheels jounced over the curb o fecteau was off up the street once more terrorizing my neighborhood i saw the violent plumber jump the curb again at the corner of dodge and furlongwhere he grazed the back of a parked car springing open the cars trunk on impact and leaving it flapping helping the shaken old lady inside i called the policeand my wife to tell her to keep the children indoors the plumber was berserk this is how i help the neighborhood i thought i drive mad men madder the old woman sat in a paisley chair in her cluttered living room as carefully as a plant when o fecteau returnedthis time driving within inches of the living room bay window and through the gravel beds for the baby trees his horn blaringthe old woman never moved i stood at the door awaiting the ultimate assault but i thought it wiser not to show myself i knew that if o fecteau saw me he would attempt to drive in the house by the time the police arrived the plumber had rolled his truck in an attempt to avoid a station wagon at the intersection of cold hill and north lane he had broken his collarbone and was sitting upright in the cab though the truck lay on its side he wasnt able to climb out the door above his head or he hadnt tried o fecteau appeared calm he was listening to his radio since that time i have tried to provoke the offending drivers less if i sense them taking offense at my stopping them and presuming to criticize their vile habits i simply tell them i am informing the police and quickly leave that o fecteau turned out to have a long history of violent overreactions to social situations did not allow me to forgive myself look its all the better you got that plumber off the road my wife told meand she usually criticizes my meddlesomeness in the behavior of others but i could only think that i had driven a workingman off his rocker and that during his outburst if o fecteau had killed a child whose fault would it have been partly mine i think in modern times in my opinion either everything is a moral question or there are no more moral questions nowadays there are no compromises or there are only compromises never influenced i keep my vigil there is no letting up dont say anything helen told herself go kiss him and rub against him get him upstairs as fast as you can and talk about the damn story later much later she warned herself but she knew he wouldnt let her the dishes were done and he sat across the table from her she tried her nicest smile and told him i want to go to bed with you you dont like it he asked lets talk in bed she said goddamn it helen he said its the first thing ive finished in a long time i want to know what you think of it she bit her lip and took her glasses off she had not made a single mark with her red pencil i love you she said yes yes he said impatiently i love you too but we can fuck anytime what about the story and she finally relaxed she felt he had released her somehow i tried she thought she felt hugely relieved fuck the story she said no i dont like it and i dont want to talk about it either you dont care to regard what i want obviously youre like a little boy at the dinner tableyou serve yourself first you dont like it garp said oh its not bad she said its just not much of anything its a trifle its a little ditty if youre warming up to something id like to see what it iswhen you get to it but this is nothing you must know that its a tossoff isnt it you can do tricks like this with your left hand cant you its funny isnt it garp asked oh its funny she said but its funny like jokes are funny its all oneliners i mean what is it a selfparody youre not old enough and you havent written enough to start mocking yourself its selfserving its selfjustifying and its not about anything except yourself really its cute son of a bitch said garp cute youre always talking about people who write well but dont have anything to say helen said well what do you call this its no grillparzer certainly it isnt worth a fifth of what grillparzer is worth it isnt worth a tenth of that story helen said the pension grillparzer is the first big thing i wrote garp said this is completely different its another kind of fiction altogether yes one is about something and one is about nothing helen said one is about people and one is about only you one has mystery and precision and one has only wit when helens critical faculties were engaged they were difficult to disengage its not fair to compare them garp said i know this is smaller then lets not talk anymore about it helen said garp sulked for a minute you didnt like the second wind of the cuckold either he said and i dont suppose youll like the next one any better what next one helen asked him are you writing another novel he sulked some more she hated him making her do this to him but she wanted him and she knew she loved him too please she said lets go to bed but now he saw his chance for a little crueltyandor a little truthand his eyes shone at her brightly lets not say another word she begged him lets go to bed you think the pension grillparzer is the best thing ive written dont you he asked her he knew already what she thought of the second novel and he knew that despite helens fondness for procrastination a first novel is a first novel yes she did think grillparzer was his best so far yes she said softly youre a lovely writer you know i think so i guess i just havent lived up to my potential garp said nastily you will she said the sympathy and her love for him were draining from her voice they stared at each other helen looked away he started upstairs are you coming to bed he asked his back was to her his intentions were hidden from herhis feelings for her too either hidden from her or buried in his infernal work not right now she said he waited on the stairs got something to read he asked no im through reading for a while she said garp went upstairs when she came up to him he was already asleep which made her despair if hed had her on his mind at all how could he have fallen asleep but actually hed had so much on his mind hed been confused he had fallen asleep because he was bewildered if hed been able to focus his feelings on any one thing hed still have been awake when she came upstairs they might have saved a lot of things then as it was she sat beside him on the bed and watched his face with more fondness than she thought she could stand she saw he had a hardon as severe as if he had been waiting up for her and she took him into her mouth and sucked him softly until he came he woke up surprised and he was very guiltylookingwhen he appeared to realize where he was and with whom helen however was not in the least guiltylooking she looked only sad garp would think later that it was as if helen had known he had been dreaming of mrs ralph when he came back from the bathroom she was asleep she had quickly drifted off guiltless at last helen felt freed to have her dreams garp lay awake beside her watching the astonishing innocence upon her faceuntil the children woke her walt catches cold when walt caught colds garp slept badly it was as if he were trying to breathe for the boy and for himself garp would get up in the night to kiss and nuzzle the child anyone seeing garp would have thought that he could make walts cold go away by catching it himself oh god helen said its just a cold duncan had colds all winter when he was five nearing eleven duncan seemed to have outgrown colds but walt at five was fully in the throes of cold after coldor it was one long cold that went away and came back by the march mud season walts resistance struck garp as altogether gone the child hacked himself and garp awake each night with a wet wrenching cough garp sometimes fell asleep listening to walts chest and he would wake up frightened when he could no longer hear the thump of the boys heart but the child had merely pushed his fathers heavy head off his chest so that he could roll over and sleep more comfortably both the doctor and helen told garp its just a cough but the imperfection in walts nightly breathing scared garp right out of his sleep he was usually awake therefore when roberta called the latenight anguish of the large and powerful ms muldoon was no longer frightening to garphe had come to expect itbut garps own fretful sleeplessness made helen shorttempered if you were back at work on a book youd be too tired to lie awake half the night she said it was his imagination that was keeping him up helen told him one sign that he hadnt been writing enough garp knew was when he had too much imagination left over for other things for example the onslaught of dreams garp now dreamed only of horrors happening to his children in a dream there was one horror that took place while garp was reading a pornographic magazine he was just looking at the same picture over and over again the picture was very pornographic the wrestlers on the university team with whom garp occasionally worked out had a peculiar vocabulary for such pictures this vocabulary garp noted had not changed since his days at steering when the wrestlers on garps team spoke of such pictures in the same fashion what had changed was the increased availability of the pictures but the names were the same the picture garp looked at in the dream was considered among the highest in the rankings of pornographic pictures among pictures of naked women there were names for how much you could see if you could see the pubic hair but not the sex parts that was called a bush shotor just a bush if you could see the sex parts which were sometimes partially hidden by the hair that was a beaver a beaver was better than just a bush a beaver was the whole thing the hair and the parts if the parts were open that was called a split beaver and if the whole thing glistened that was the best of all in the world of pornography that was a wet split beaver the wetness implied that the woman was not only naked and exposed and open but she was also ready in his dream garp was looking at what the wrestlers called a wet split beaver when he heard children crying he did not know whose children they were but helen and his mother jenny fields were with them they all came down the stairs and filed past him where he struggled to hide from them what hed been looking at they had been upstairs and something terrible had awakened them they were on their way farther downstairsgoing to the basement as if the basement were a bomb shelter and with that thought garp heard the dull crump of bombinghe noted the crumbling plaster he saw the flickering lightsand he grasped the terror of what was approaching them the children two by two marched whimpering after helen and jenny who led them to the bomb shelter as soberly as nurses if they looked at garp at all they regarded him with vague sadness and with scorn as if he had let them all down and was powerless to help them now perhaps he had been looking at the wet split beaver instead of watching for enemy planes this true to the nature of dreams was forever unclear precisely why he felt so guilty and why they looked at him as if theyd been so abused at the end of the line of children were walt and duncan holding hands the socalled buddy system as it is employed at summer camps appeared in garps dream to be the natural reaction to a disaster among children little walt was crying the way garp had heard him cry when he was caught in the grip of a nightmare unable to wake up im having a bad dream he sniveled he looked at his father and almost shouted to him im having a bad dream but in garps dream garp could not wake the child from this one duncan looked stoically over his shoulder at his father a silent and bravely doomed expression on his beautiful young face duncan was appearing very grownup lately duncans look was a secret between duncan and garp that they both knew it was not a dream and that walt could not be helped wake me up walt cried but the long file of children was disappearing into the bomb shelter twisting in duncans grip walt came to about the height of duncans elbow walt looked back at his father im having a dream walt screamed as if to convince himself garp could do nothing he said nothing he made no attempt to follow themdown these last stairs and the dropping plaster coated everything white the bombs kept falling youre having a dream garp screamed after little walt its just a bad dream he cried though he knew he was lying then helen would kick him and hed wake up perhaps helen feared that garps runamuck imagination would turn away from walt and turn on her because if garp had given half the worry to helen that he seemed compelled to give to walt garp might have realized that something was going on helen thought she was in control of what was going on she at least had controlled how it began opening her office door as usual to the slouching michael milton and bidding him enter her room once inside she closed the door behind him and kissed him quickly on the mouth holding his slim neck so that he couldnt even escape for breath and grinding her knee between his legs he kicked over the wastebasket and dropped his notebook theres nothing more to discuss helen said taking a breath she raced her tongue across his upper lip helen was trying to decide if she liked his mustache she decided she liked it or at least she liked it for now well go to your apartment nowhere else she told him its across the river he said i know where it is she said is it clean of course he said and its got a great view of the river i dont care about the view helen said i want it clean its pretty clean he said i can clean it better we can only use your car she said i dont have a car he said i know you dont helen said youll have to get one he was smiling now hed been surprised but now he was feeling sure of himself again well i dont have to get one now do i he asked nuzzling his mustache against her neck he touched her breasts helen unattached herself from his embrace get one whenever you want she said well never use mine and i wont be seen walking with you all over town or riding on the buses if anyone knows about this its over do you understand she sat down at her desk and he did not feel invited to walk around her desk to touch her he sat in the chair her students usually sat in sure i understand he said i love my husband and will never hurt him helen told him michael milton knew better than to smile ill get a car right away he said and clean your apartment or have it cleaned she said absolutely he said now he dared to smile a little what kind of car do you want me to get he asked her i dont care about that she told him just get one that runs get one that isnt in the garage all the time and dont get one with bucket seats get one with a long seat in front he looked more surprised and puzzled than ever so she explained to him i want to be able to lie down comfortably across the front seat she said ill put my head in your lap so that no one will see me sitting up beside you do you understand dont worry he said smiling again its a small town helen said no one must know its not that small a town michael milton said confidently every town is a small town helen said and this one is smaller than you think do you want me to tell you tell me what he asked her youre sleeping with margie tallworth helen said shes in my comp lit shes a junior helen said and you see another very young undergraduateshes in dirksons english i think shes a freshman but i dont know if youve slept with her not for lack of trying if you havent helen added to my knowledge youve not touched any of your fellow graduate students not yet helen said but theres surely someone ive missed or there has been michael milton was both sheepish and proud at the same time and the usual command he held over his expressions escaped him so completely that helen didnt like the expression she saw on his face and she looked away thats how small this town and every town is helen said if you have me she told him you cant have any of those others i know what young girls notice and i know how much theyre inclined to say yes michael milton said he appeared ready to take notes helen suddenly thought of something and she looked momentarily startled you do have a drivers license she asked oh yes michael milton said they both laughed and helen relaxed again but when he came around her desk to kiss her she shook her head and waved him back and you wont ever touch me here she said there will be nothing intimate in this office i dont lock my door i dont even like to have it shut please open it now she asked him and he did as he was told he got a car a huge buick roadmaster the old kind of station wagonwith real wooden slats on the side it was a buick dynaflow heavy and shiny with prekorea chrome and real oak it weighed pounds or almost three tons it held seven quarts of oil and nineteen gallons of gasoline its original price was but michael milton picked it up for less than six hundred dollars its a straighteight cylinder threetwenty cubic power steering with a singlethroat carter carb the salesman told michael its not too badly rusted in fact it was the dull inconspicuous color of clotted blood more than six feet wide and seventeen feet long the front seat was so long and deep that helen could lie across it almost without having to bend her kneesor without having to put her head in michael miltons lap though she did this anyway she did not put her head in his lap because she had to she liked her view of the dashboard and being close to the old smell of the maroon leather of the big slick seat she put her head in his lap because she liked feeling michaels leg stiffen and relax his thigh shifting just slightly between the brake and the accelerator it was a quiet lap to put your head in because the car had no clutch the driver needed to move just one leg and just occasionally michael milton thoughtfully carried his loose change in his left front pocket so there were only the soft wales of his corduroy slacks which made a faint impression on the skin of helens cheekand sometimes his rising erection would touch her ear or reach up into the hair on the back of her neck sometimes she imagined taking him into her mouth while they drove across town in the big car with the gaping chrome grille like the mouth of a feeding fishbuick eight in script across the teeth but that helen knew would not be safe the first indication that the whole thing might not be safe was when margie tallworth dropped helens comp lit without so much as a note of explanation concerning what she might not have liked about the course helen feared it was not the course that margie hadnt liked and she called the young miss tallworth into her office to ask her for an explanation margie tallworth a junior knew enough about school to know that no explanation was required up to a certain point in any semester a student was free to drop any course without the instructors permission do i have to have a reason the girl asked helen sullenly no you dont helen said but if you had a reason i just wanted to hear it i dont have to have a reason margie tallworth said she held helens gaze longer than most students could hold it then she got up to leave she was pretty and small and rather well dressed for a student helen thought if there was any consistency to michael miltons former girl friend and his present taste it appeared only that he liked women to wear nice clothes well im sorry it didnt work out helen said truthfully as margie was leaving she was still fishing for what the girl might actually know she knew helen thought and quickly accused michael youve blown it already she told him coldly because she could speak coldly to himover the phone just how did you drop margie tallworth very gently michael milton said smugly but a drop is a drop no matter how different the ways of doing it are helen did not appreciate it when he attempted to instruct herexcept sexually she indulged the boy that and he seemed to need to be dominant there that was different for her and she didnt really mind he was sometimes rough but not ever dangerous she thought and if she firmly resisted something he stopped once she had had to tell him no i dont like that i wont do that but she had added please because she wasnt that sure of him he had stopped he had been forceful with her but in another wayin a way that was all right with her it was exciting that she couldnt trust him completely but not trusting him to be silent was another matter if she knew he had talked about her that would be that i didnt tell her anything michael insisted i said margie its all over or something like that i didnt even tell her there was another woman and i certainly said nothing about you but shes probably heard you talk about me before helen said before this started i mean she never liked your course anyway michael said we did talk about that once she never liked the course helen said this truly surprised her well shes not very bright michael said impatiently shed better not know helen said i mean it you better find out but he found out nothing margie tallworth refused to speak to him he tried to tell her on the phone that it was all because an old girl friend had come back to himshe had arrived from out of town shed had no place to stay one thing had led to another but margie tallworth had hung up on him before he could polish the story helen smoked a little more she watched garp anxiously for a few daysand once she felt actual guilt when she made love to garp she felt guilty that she had made love to him not because she wanted to but because she wanted to reassure him if he had been thinking that anything was wrong he hadnt been thinking not much or he had thought but only once about the bruises on the small tight backs of helens thighs though he was strong garp was a very gentle man with his children and his wife he also knew what fingermark bruises looked like because he was a wrestler it was a day or so later that he noticed the same small fingermark bruises on the backs of duncans armsjust where garp held him when garp wrestled with the boyand garp concluded that he gripped the people he loved harder than he meant to he concluded that the fingermarks on helen were also his he was too vain a man to be easily jealous and the name he had woken withon his lips one morninghad eluded him there were no more papers by michael milton around the house keeping helen up at night in fact she was going to bed earlier and earlier she needed her rest as for helen she developed a fondness for the bare sharp shaft of the volvos stick shift its bite at the end of the day driving home from her office felt good against the heel of her hand and she often pressed against it until she felt it was only a hair away from the pressure necessary to break her skin she could bring tears to her eyes this way and it made her feel clean again when she arrived homewhen the boys would wave and shout at her from the window where the tv was and when garp would announce what dinner he had prepared for them all when helen walked into the kitchen margie tallworths possible knowledge had frightened helen because although helen had said to michaeland to herselfthat it would be over the instant anyone knew helen now knew that it would be more difficult to end than she had first imagined she hugged garp in his kitchen and hoped for margie tallworths ignorance margie tallworth was ignorant but she was not ignorant of michael miltons relationship with helen she was ignorant of many things but she knew about that she was ignorant in that she thought her own shallow infatuation with michael milton had surpassed as she would say the sexual whereas she assumed helen was merely amusing herself with michael in truth margie tallworth had absolutely wallowed in as she would say the sexual it is difficult in fact to know what else her relationship with michael milton had been about but she was not altogether wrong in assuming that this was what helens relationship with michael milton was also about margie tallworth was ignorant in that she assumed too much too much of the time but in this case she had assumed correctly back when michael milton and helen were actually talking about michaels work margie assumedeven thenthat they were fucking margie tallworth did not believe there was another kind of relationship that one could have with michael milton in this one way she was not ignorant she may have known the kind of relationship helen had with michael before helen knew it herself and through the oneway glass of the fourthfloor ladies room in the english and literature building it was possible for margie tallworth to look through the tinted windshield of the threeton buick gliding like the coffin of a king out of the parking lot margie could see mrs garps slender legs stretched along the long front seat it was a peculiar way to ride in a car with other than the best of friends margie knew their habits better than she understood her own she took long walks to try to forget michael milton and to familiarize herself with the whereabouts of helens house she was soon familiar with the habits of helens husband too because garps habits were much more constant than anyones he padded back and forth from room to room in the mornings perhaps he was out of a job that fitted margie tallworths assumptions of the likely cuckold a man who was out of work at midday he burst out the door in track clothes and ran away miles later he returned and read his mail which nearly always came when he was gone then he padded back and forth in the house again he undressed in pieces on the way to the shower and he was slow to dress when he was out of the shower one thing did not fit her image of the cuckold garp had a good body and why did he spend so much time in the kitchen margie tallworth wondered if perhaps he was an unemployed cook then his children came home and they broke margie tallworths soft little heart he looked quite nice when he played with his children which also fitted margies assumptions of what a cuckold was like someone who had witless good fun with his children while his wife was out getting planked planked was also a word that the wrestlers garp knew used and they had used it back at those bloodandblue days at steering too someone was always bragging about planking a wet split beaver so one day when garp burst out the door in his track clothes margie tallworth waited only as long as it took him to run away then she went up on the garps porch with a perfumed note which she intended to drop in his mail she had thought very carefully that he would have time to read the note and hopefully recover himself before his children came home this was how she assumed such news was absorbed suddenly then there was a reasonable period of recovery and one got ready to face the children here was another case of something margie tallworth was ignorant of the note itself had given her trouble because she was not good with words and it was perfumed not by intention but simply because every piece of paper margie tallworth owned was perfumed if she had thought about it she would have realized perfume was inappropriate to this note but that was another of the things she was ignorant of even her schoolwork was perfumed when helen had read margie tallworths first essay for comp lit she had cringed at its scent what margies note to garp said was your wife is involved with michael milton margie tallworth would grow up to be the sort of person who said that someone passed away instead of died thus she sought delicacy with the words that helen was involved with michael milton and she had this sweetly smelling note in her hand and she was poised on the garps porch with it when it began to rain nothing made garp turn back from a run faster than rain he hated getting his running shoes wet he would run in the cold and run in the snow but when it rained garp ran home swearing and cooked for an hour in a foulweather mood then he put on a poncho and caught the bus to the gym in time for wrestling practice on the way he picked up walt from day care and took walt to the gym with him he called home when he got to the gym to see if duncan was back from school sometimes he gave duncan instructions if the meal was still cooking but usually he just cautioned duncan about riding his bike and he quizzed him about emergency phone numbers did duncan know what to dial in case of fire explosion armed robbery mayhem in the streets then he wrestled and after practice he popped walt into the shower with himself by the time he called home again helen was there to come pick them up therefore garp did not like rain although he enjoyed wrestling rain complicated his simple plans and margie tallworth was unprepared to see him suddenly panting and angry behind her on the porch aaahhh she cried she clutched her scented note as tightly as if it were the main artery of an animal whose blood flow she wished she could stop hello said garp she looked like a babysitter to him he had trained himself off babysitters some time ago he smiled at her with frank curiositythat is all aaa said margie tallworth she couldnt speak garp looked at the crushed message in her hand she shut her eyes and held the note out to him as if she were putting her hand into a fire if at first garp had thought she was one of helens students wanting something now he thought something else he saw that she couldnt speak and he saw the extreme selfconsciousness of her handing him the note garps experience with speechless women who handed out notes selfconsciously was limited to ellen jamesians and he suppressed a momentary flame of angerthat another creepy ellen jamesian was introducing herself to him or had she come to bait him about somethingthe reclusive son of the exciting jenny fields hi im margie im an ellen jamesian her stupid note would say do you know what an ellen jamesian is the next thing you know garp thought theyll be organized like the religious morons who bring those righteous pamphlets about jesus to ones very door it sickened him for example that the ellen jamesians were now reaching girls as young as this one she was too young to know he thought whether she wanted a tongue in her life or not he shook his head and waved the note away yes yes i know i know garp said so what poor margie tallworth was unprepared for this she had come like an avenging angelher terrible duty and what a burden it was to herto bring the bad news that somehow must be made known but he knew already and he didnt even care she clutched her note in both hands so tightly to her pretty trembling breasts that more of the perfume was expressed from itor from herand a wave of her younggirl smell passed over garp who stood glaring at her i said so what garp said do you actually expect me to have respect for someone who cuts her own tongue off margie forced a word out what she said she was frightened now now she guessed why the poor man padded around his house all day out of work he was insane garp had distinctly heard the word it was not a gagged aaahhh or even a little aaait was not the word of an amputated tongue it was a whole word what he said what she said again he stared at the note she held against herself you can talk he said of course she croaked whats that he asked and pointed to her note but now she was afraid of himan insane cuckold god knows what he might do murder the children or murder her he looked strong enough to murder michael milton with one arm and every man looked evil when he was questioning you she backed away from him off the porch wait garp cried is that a note for me what is that is it something for helen who are you margie tallworth shook her head its a mistake she whispered and when she turned to flee she collided with the wet mailman spilling his bag and knocking herself back into garp garp had a vision of duna the senile bear bowling a mailman down a viennese staircaseoutlawed forever but all that happened to margie tallworth was that she fell to the floor of the porch her stockings tore and she skinned one knee the mailman who assumed hed arrived at an awkward moment fumbled for garps mail among his strewn letters but garp was now only interested in what message the crying girl had for him what is it he asked her gently he tried to help her to her feet but she wanted to sit where she was she kept sobbing im sorry margie tallworth said she had lost her nerve she had spent a minute too long around garp and now that she thought she rather liked him it was hard for her to imagine giving him this news your knees not too bad garp said but let me get something to clean you up he went inside for antiseptic for her cut and bandages but she took this opportunity to limp away she could not face him with this news but she could not withhold it from him either she left her note for him the mailman watched her hobble down the side street toward the corner where the buses stopped he wondered briefly what the garps were up to they seemed to get more mail than other families too it was all those letters garp wrote which poor john wolf his editor struggled to answer and there were copies of books to review garp gave them to helen who at least read them there were helens magazines it seemed to garp there were a great many there were garps two magazines his only subscriptions gourmet and amateur wrestling news there were of course bills and a letter rather frequently from jenny it was all she wrote these days and a letter now and then short and sweet from ernie holm sometimes harry fletcher wrote them both and alice still wrote with exquisite fluency about nothing at all to garp and now among the usual was a note reeking of perfume and wet with tears garp put down the bottle of antiseptic and the bandages he did not bother to look for the girl he held the crumpled note and thought he knew more or less what it would be about he wondered why he hadnt thought of it before because there were so many things that pointed to it now that he thought of it he supposed he had thought of it before only not quite this consciously the slow unwrapping of the noteso it wouldnt tearmade sounds as crisp as autumn though all around garp it was a cold march the hurt ground thawing to mud the little note snapped like bones as he opened it with the escaping perfume garp imagined he could still hear the girls sharp little yelp what he knew what what he didnt know was with whomthat name which had kicked around in his mind one morning but then was gone the note of course would provide him with the name michael milton it sounded to garp like a special kind of new ice cream at that shop he took the boys to there was strawberry swirl chockfull of chocolate mocha madness and michael milton it was a disgusting namea flavor garp could tasteand garp tramped to the storm sewer and wadded the vilesmelling note into pieces and stuffed them through the grate then he went inside the house and read the name in a phone book over and over again it seemed to him now that helen had been involved with someone for a long time it seemed that he had known it for some time too but the name michael milton garp had classified himto helenat a party where garp had been introduced to him garp had told helen that michael milton was a wimp they had discussed his mustache michael milton garp read the name so many times he was still peering into the phone book when duncan got home from school and assumed that his father was once more searching a directory for his makebelieve people didnt you get walt yet duncan asked garp had forgotten and walt has a cold too garp thought the boy shouldnt have to wait for me with a cold lets go get him together garp said to duncan to duncans surprise garp threw the phone book into the trash barrel then they walked to the bus stop garp was still in his track clothes and it was still raining duncan found this odd too but he didnt say anything about it he said i got two goals today for some reason all they played at duncans school was soccerfall winter and spring they played only soccer it was a small school but there was another reason for all the soccer garp forgot what it was he had never liked the reason anyway two goals duncan repeated thats great garp said one was a header duncan said with your head garp said thats wonderful ralph gave me a perfect pass duncan said thats still wonderful garp said and good for ralph he put his arm around duncan but he knew duncan would be embarrassed if he tried to kiss him it is walt who lets me kiss him garp thought then he thought of kissing helen and almost stepped in front of the bus dad duncan said and in the bus he asked his father are you okay sure garp said i thought youd be up at the wrestling room duncan said it is raining from walts day care you could look across the river and garp tried to place the exact location there of michael miltons address which he had memorized from the phone book where were you walt complained he coughed his nose dripped he felt hot he expected to go wrestling whenever it rained why dont we all go to the wrestling room as long as were downtown duncan said he was increasingly logical but garp said no he didnt want to wrestle today why not duncan wanted to know because hes got his running stuff on dummy walt said oh shut up walt duncan said they more or less fought on the bus until garp told them they couldnt walt was sick garp reasoned and fighting was bad for his cold im not sick walt said yes you are garp said yes you are duncan teased shut up duncan garp said boy youre in a great mood duncan said and garp wanted to kiss him garp wished to assure duncan that he wasnt really in a bad mood but kissing embarrassed duncan so garp kissed walt instead dad walt complained youre all wet and sweaty because hes got his running stuff on dummy duncan said he called me a dummy walt told garp i heard him garp said im not a dummy walt said yes you are duncan said shut up both of you garp said dads in a great mood isnt he walt duncan asked his brother sure is walt said and they decided to tease their father instead of fight among themselves until the bus deposited thema few blocks from the house in the increasing rain they were a soggy threesome when they were still a block from home and a car that had been going too fast slowed suddenly beside them the window was rolled down after a struggle and in the steamy interior garp saw the frazzled glistening face of mrs ralph she grinned at them you seen ralph she asked duncan nope duncan said the moron doesnt know enough to come out of the rain she said i guess you dont either she said sweetly to garp she was still grinning and garp tried to smile back at her but he couldnt think of anything to say he must have had poor control of his expression he suspected because mrs ralph wouldnt usually pass up the opportunity to go on teasing him in the rain yet instead she looked suddenly shocked by garps ghastly smile she rolled her window back up see ya she called and drove off slowly see ya garp mumbled after her he admired the woman but he was thinking that maybe even this horror would eventually come to pass that he would see mrs ralph in the house he gave walt a hot bath slipping into the tub with himan excuse which he often took to wrestle with that little body duncan was too big for garp to fit in the tub with him anymore whats for supper duncan called upstairs garp realized he had forgotten supper i forgot supper garp called you forgot walt asked him but garp dunked walt in the tub and tickled him and walt fought back and forgot about the issue you forgot supper duncan hollered from downstairs garp decided he was not going to get out of the tub he kept adding more hot water the steam was good for walts lungs he believed he would try to keep the child in the tub with him as long as walt was content to play they were still in the bath together when helen got home dad forgot supper duncan told her immediately he forgot supper helen said he forgot all about it duncan said where is he helen asked hes taking a bath with walt duncan said theyve been taking a bath for hours heavens said helen maybe theyve drowned wouldnt you love that garp hollered from his bath upstairs duncan laughed hes in a great mood duncan told his mother i can see that he is helen said she put her hand softly on duncans shoulder being careful not to let him know that she was actually leaning on him for support she felt suddenly unsure of her balance poised at the bottom of the stairs she called up to garp had a bad day but garp slipped underwater it was a gesture of control because he felt such hatred for her and he didnt want walt to see it or hear it there was no answer and helen tightened her grip on duncans shoulder please not in front of the children she thought it was a new situation for herthat she should find herself in the defensive position in a matter of some contention with garpand she felt frightened shall i come up she called there was still no answer garp could hold his breath a long time walt shouted back downstairs to her dads underwater dad is so weird duncan said garp came up for air just as walt yelled again hes holding his breath i hope so helen thought she didnt know what to do she couldnt move in a minute or so garp whispered to walt tell her im still underwater walt okay walt appeared to think this was a fiendishly clever trick and he yelled downstairs to helen dads still underwater wow duncan said we should time him it must be a record but now helen felt panicked duncan moved out from under her handhe was starting up the stairs to see this breathholding featand helen felt that her legs were lead hes still underwater walt shrieked though garp was drying walt with a towel and had already started to drain the tub they stood naked on the bathmat by the big mirror together when duncan came into the bathroom garp silenced him by putting a finger to his lips now say it together garp whispered on the count of three hes still under one two three hes still under duncan and walt howled together and helen felt her own lungs burst she felt a scream escape her but no sound emerged and she ran up the stairs thinking that only her husband could have conceived of such a plot to pay her back drowning himself in front of their children and leaving her to explain to them why he did it she ran crying into the bathroom so surprising duncan and walt that she had to recover almost immediatelyin order not to frighten them garp was naked at the mirror slowly drying between his toes and watching her in a way she remembered that ernie holm had taught his wrestlers how to look for openings youre too late he told her i already died but its touching and a little surprising to see that you care well talk about this later she asked him hopefullyand smiling as if it had been a good joke we fooled you walt said poking helen on that sharp bone above her hip boy if wed pulled that on you duncan said to his father youd have really been pissed at us the children havent eaten helen said nobodys eaten garp said unless you have i can wait she told him so can i garp told her ill get the kids something helen offered pushing walt out of the bathroom there must be eggs and cereal for supper duncan said that sounds like a great supper he said i just forgot duncan garp said i want toast walt said you can have toast too helen said are you sure you can handle this garp asked helen she just smiled at him god even i can handle toast duncan said i think even walt can fix cereal the eggs are tricky helen said she tried to laugh garp went on drying between his toes when the kids were out of the bathroom helen poked her head back in im sorry and i love you helen said but he wouldnt look up from his deliberate procedure with the towel i never wanted to hurt you she went on how did you find out i have never once stopped thinking of you was it that girl helen whispered but garp gave all his attention to his toes when she had set out food for the children as if they were pets she would think to herself later she went back upstairs to him he was still in front of the mirror sitting naked on the edge of the tub he means nothing he never took anything away from you she told him its all over now really it is since when he asked her as of now she said to garp i just have to tell him dont tell him garp said let him guess i cant do that helen said theres shell in my egg walt hollered from downstairs my toast is burnt duncan said they were plotting together to distract their parents from each otherwhether they knew it or not children garp thought have some instinct for separating their parents when their parents ought to be separated just eat it helen called to them its not so bad she tried to touch garp but he slipped past her out of the bathroom he started to dress eat up and ill take you to a movie he called to the kids what are you doing that for helen asked him im not staying here with you he said were going out you call that wimpish asshole and say goodbye hell want to see me helen said dullythe reality of having it over now that garp knew about it was working on her like novocain if she had been sensitive to how much shed hurt garp at first now her feelings for him were deadening slightly and she was feeling for herself again tell him to eat his heart out garp said you wont see him no last fucks for the road helen just tell him goodbye on the phone nobody said anything about last fucks helen said use the phone garp said ill take the kids out well see a movie please have it over with before we come back you wont see him again i wont i promise helen said but i should see him just onceto tell him i suppose you feel youve handled this very decently garp said helen to a point did feel so she didnt say anything she felt she had never lost sight of garp and the children during this indulgence she felt justified in handling it her way now we should talk about this later she said to him some perspective will be possible later he would have struck her if the children hadnt burst into the room one two three duncan chanted to walt the cereal is stale duncan and walt hollered together please boys helen said your father and i are having a little fight go downstairs they stared at her please garp said to them he turned away from them so they wouldnt see him crying but duncan probably knew and surely helen knew walt probably didnt catch it a fight walt said come on duncan said to him he took walts hand duncan pulled walt out of the bedroom come on walt duncan said or we wont get to see the movie yeah the movie walt cried to his horror garp recognized the attitude of their leavingduncan leading walt away and down the stairs the smaller boy turning and looking back walt waved but duncan pulled him on down and gone into the bomb shelter garp hid his face in his clothes and cried when helen touched him he said dont touch me and went on crying helen shut the bedroom door oh dont she pleaded he isnt worth this he wasnt anything i just enjoyed him she tried to explain but garp shook his head violently and threw his pants at her he was still only half dressedan attitude that was perhaps helen realized the most compromising for men when they were not one thing and also not another a woman half dressed seemed to have some power but a man was simply not as handsome as when he was naked and not as secure as when he was clothed please get dressed she whispered to him and handed him back his pants he took them he pulled them on and went on crying ill do just what you want she said you wont see him again he said to her no not once she said not ever again walt has a cold garp said he shouldnt even be going out but its not too bad for him at a movie and we wont be late he added to her go see if hes dressed warmly enough she did he opened her top drawer where her lingerie was and pulled the drawer from the dresser he pushed his face into the wonderful silkiness and scent of her clotheslike a bear holding a great trough of food in his forepaws and then losing himself in it when helen came back into the room and caught him at this it was almost as if shed caught him masturbating embarrassed he brought the drawer down across his knee and cracked it her underwear flew about he raised the cracked drawer over his head and smacked it down against the edge of the dresser snapping what felt like the spine of an animal about the size of the drawer helen ran from the room and he finished dressing he saw duncans fairly well finished supper on duncans plate he saw walts uneaten supper on walts plate and on various parts of the table and floor if you dont eat walt garp said youll grow up to be a wimp im not going to grow up walt said that gave garp such a shiver that he turned on walt and startled the child dont ever say that garp said i dont want to grow up walt said oh i see garp said softening you mean you like being a kid yup walt said walt is so weird duncan said i am not walt cried you are so duncan said go get in the car garp said and stop fighting you were fighting duncan said cautiously no one reacted and duncan tugged walt out of the kitchen come on he said yeah the movie walt said they went out garp said to helen hes not to come here under any circumstances if you let him in this house he wont get out alive and youre not to go out he said under any circumstances please he added and he had to turn away from her oh darling helen said hes such an asshole garp moaned it could never be anyone like you dont you see helen said it could only be someone who wasnt at all like you he thought of the babysitters and alice fletcher and his inexplicable attraction to mrs ralph and of course he knew what she meant he walked out the kitchen door it was raining outside and already dark perhaps the rain would freeze the mud in the driveway was wet but firm he turned the car around then by habit he edged the car to the top of the driveway and cut the engine and the lights down the volvo rolled but he knew the driveways dark curve by heart the kids were thrilled by the sound of the gravel and the slick mud in the growing blackness and when he popped the clutch at the bottom of the driveway and flicked on the lights both walt and duncan cheered what movie are we going to see duncan asked anything you want garp said they drove downtown to have a look at the posters it was cold and damp in the car and walt coughed the windshield kept fogging over which made it hard to see what was playing at the movie houses walt and duncan continued to fight about who got to stand in the gap between the bucket seats for some reason this had always been the prime spot in the back seat for them and they had always fought over who got to stand or kneel therecrowding each other and bumping garps elbow when he used the stick shift get out of there both of you garp said its the only place you can see duncan said im the only one who has to see garp said and this defroster is such junk he added that no one can see out the windshield anyway why dont you write the volvo people duncan suggested garp tried to imagine a letter to sweden about the inadequacies of the defrost system but he couldnt sustain the idea for very long on the floor in back duncan kneeled on walts foot and pushed him out of the gap between the bucket seats now walt cried and coughed i was here first duncan said garp downshifted hard and the uncovered tip of the stickshift shaft bit into his hand you see this duncan garp asked angrily you see this gearshift its like a spear you want to fall on that if i have to stop hard why dont you get it fixed duncan asked get out of the goddamn gap between the seats duncan garp said the stick shift has been like that for months duncan said for weeks maybe garp said if its dangerous you should get it fixed duncan said thats your mothers job garp said she says its your job dad walt said hows your cough walt garp asked walt coughed the wet rattle in his small chest seemed oversized for the child jesus duncan said thats great walt garp said its not my fault walt complained of course it isnt garp said yes it is duncan said walt spends half his life in puddles i do not walt said look for a movie that looks interesting duncan garp said i cant see unless i kneel between the seats duncan said they drove around the movie houses were all on the same block but they had to drive past them a few times to decide upon which movie and then they had to drive by them a few more times before they found a place to park the children chose to see the only film that had a line waiting to see it extending out from under the cinema marquee along the sidewalk streaked now with a freezing rain garp put his own jacket over walts head so that very quickly walt resembled some illclothed street beggara damp dwarf seeking sympathy in bad weather he promptly stepped in a puddle and soaked his feet garp then picked him up and listened to his chest it was almost as if garp thought the water in walts wet shoes dripped immediately into his little lungs youre so weird dad duncan said walt saw a strange car and pointed it out the car moved quickly down the soaked street splashing through the garish puddles it threw the reflected neon upon itselfa big dark car the color of clotted blood it had wooden slats on its sides and the blond wood glowed in the streetlights the slats looked like the ribs of the long lit skeleton of a great fish gliding through moonlight look at that car walt cried wow its a hearse duncan said no duncan garp said its an old buick before your time the buick that duncan mistook for a hearse was on its way to garps house although helen had done all she could to discourage michael milton from coming i cant see you helen told him when she called its as simple as that its over just the way i said it would be if he ever found out i wont hurt him any more than i already have what about me michael milton said im sorry helen told him but you knew we both knew i want to see you he said maybe tomorrow but she told him that garp had taken the kids to a movie for the sole purpose that she finish it tonight im coming over he told her not here no she said well go for a drive he told her i cant go out either she said im coming michael milton said and he hung up helen checked the time it would be all right she supposed if she could get him to leave quickly movies were at least an hour and a half long she decided she wouldnt let him in the housenot under any circumstances she watched for the headlights to come up the driveway and when the buick stoppedjust in front of the garage like a big ship docking at a dark piershe ran out of the house and pushed herself against the driversside door before michael milton could open it the rain was turning to a semisoft slush at her feet and the icy drops were hardening as they fellthey had some sting as they struck her bare neck when she bent over to speak to him through the rolleddown window he immediately kissed her she tried to lightly peck his cheek but he turned her face and forced his tongue into her mouth all over again she saw the corny bedroom of his apartment the postersized print above his bedpaul klees sinbad the sailor she supposed this was how he saw himself a colorful adventurer but sensitive to the beauty of europe helen pulled back from him and felt the cold rain soak her blouse we cant just stop he said miserably helen couldnt tell if it was the rain through the open window or tears that streaked his face to her surprise he had shaved his mustache off and his upper lip looked slightly like the puckered undeveloped lip of a childlike walts little lip which looked lovely on walt helen thought but it wasnt her idea of the lip for a lover what did you do to your mustache she asked him i thought you didnt like it he said i did it for you but i liked it she said and shivered in the freezing rain please get in with me he said she shook her head her blouse clung to her cold skin and her long corduroy skirt felt as heavy as chain mail her tall boots slipped in the stiffening slush i wont take you anywhere he promised well just sit here in the car we cant just stop he repeated we knew wed have to helen said we knew it was just for a little while michael milton let his head sink against the glinting ring of the horn but there was no sound the big buick was shut off the rain began to stick to the windowsthe car was slowly being encased in ice please get in michael milton moaned im not leaving here he added sharply im not afraid of him i dont have to do what he says its what i say too helen said you have to go im not going michael milton said i know about your husband i know everything about him they had never talked about garp helen had forbidden it she didnt know what michael milton meant hes a minor writer michael said boldly helen looked surprised to her knowledge michael milton had never read garp hed told her once that he never read living writers he claimed to value the perspective he said one could gain only when a writer had been dead for a while it is fortunate that garp didnt know this about himit would certainly have added to garps contempt for the young man it added somewhat to helens disappointment with poor michael now my husband is a very good writer she said softly and a shiver made her twitch so hard that her folded arms sprang open and she had to fold them closed at her breasts again hes not a major writer michael declared higgins said so you certainly must be aware of how your husband is regarded in the department higgins helen was aware was a singularly eccentric and troublesome colleague who managed at the same time to be dull and cloddish to the point of sleep helen hardly felt higgins was representative of the departmentexcept that like many of her more insecure colleagues higgins habitually gossiped to the graduate students about his fellow department members in this desperate way perhaps higgins felt he gained the students trust i was not aware that garp was regarded by the department one way or another helen said coolly most of them dont read anything very contemporary those who do say hes minor michael milton said this competitive and pathetic stand did not warm helens heart to the boy and she turned to go back inside the house i wont go michael milton screamed ill confront him about us right now he cant tell us what to do im telling you michael helen said he slumped against the horn and began to cry she went over and touched his shoulder through the window ill sit with you a minute helen told him but you must promise me that youll leave i wont have him or my children see this he promised give me the keys helen said his look of baleful hurtthat she didnt trust him not to drive off with hertouched helen all over again she put the keys in the deep flap pocket of her long skirt and walked around to the passenger side and let herself in he rolled up his window and they sat not touching the windows fogging around them the car creaking under a coat of ice then he completely broke down and told her that she had meant more to him than all of franceand she knew what france had meant to him of course she held him then and wildly feared how much time had passed or was passing there in the frozen car even if it was not a long movie they must still have a good half hour or fortyfive minutes yet michael milton was nowhere near ready to leave she kissed him strongly hoping this would help but he only began to fondle her wet cold breasts she felt all over as frozen to him as she had felt outside in the hardening sleet but she let him touch her dear michael she said thinking all the while how can we stop was all he said but helen had already stopped she was only thinking about how to stop him she shoved him up straight in the drivers position and stretched across the long seat pulling her skirt back down to cover her knees and putting her head in his lap please remember she said please try this was the nicest part for mejust letting you drive me in the car when i knew where we were going cant you be happycant you just remember that and let it go he sat rigid behind the steering wheel both hands struggling to stay gripped to the wheel both thighs tensed under her head his erection pressing against her ear please try to just let it go at that michael she said softly and they stayed this way a moment imagining that the old buick was carrying them to michaels apartment again but michael milton could not sustain himself on imagination he let one hand stray to the back of helens neck which he gripped very tightly his other hand opened his fly michael she said sharply you said you always wanted to he reminded her its over michael not yet it isnt lie said his penis grazed her forehead bent her eyelashes and she recognized that this was the old michaelthe michael of the apartment the michael who occasionally liked to treat her with some force she did not appreciate it now but if i resist she thought there will be a scene she had only to imagine garp as part of the scene to convince herself that she should avoid any scene at any cost dont be a bastard dont be a prick michael she said dont spoil it you always said you wanted to he said but it wasnt safe you said well now its safe the car isnt even moving there cant be any accidents now he said oddly she realized he had suddenly made it easier for her she did not feel concerned anymore with letting him down gently she felt grateful to him that he had helped her to sort her priorities so forcefully her priorities she felt enormously relieved to know were garp and her children walt shouldnt be out in this weather she thought shivering and garp was more major to her she knew than all her minor colleagues and graduate students together michael milton had allowed her to see himself with what struck helen as a necessary vulgarity suck him off she thought bluntly putting him into her mouth and then hell leave she thought bitterly that men once they had ejaculated were rather quick to abandon their demands and from her brief experience in michael miltons apartment helen knew that this would not take long time was also a factor in her decision there was at least twenty minutes remaining in even the shortest movie they could have gone to see she set her mind to it as she might have done if it were the last task remaining to a messy business which might have ended better but could also have turned out worse she felt slightly proud that she had at least proved to herself that her family was her first priority even garp might appreciate this she thought but one day not right away she was so determined that she hardly noticed michael miltons grip loosen on her neck he returned both hands to the steering wheel as if he were actually piloting this experience let him think what he wants to think she thought she was thinking of her family and she did not notice that the sleet was now nearly as hard as hail it rattled off the big buick like the tapping of countless hammers driving little nails and she did not sense the old car groaning and snapping under its thickening tomb of ice and she did not hear the telephone ringing in her warm house there was too much weather and other interference between her house and where she lay it was a stupid movie typical of the childrens taste in films garp thought typical of the taste in a university town typical of the entire country typical of the world garp raged in his heart and paid more attention to walts labored breathingthe thick rivulets of snot from his tiny nose be careful you dont choke on that popcorn he whispered to walt i wont choke walt said never taking his eyes from the giant screen well you cant breathe very well garp complained so just dont put too much in your mouth you might inhale it you cant breathe through your nose at allthats perfectly clear and he wiped the childs nose again blow he whispered walt blew isnt this great duncan whispered garp felt how hot walts snot was the child must have a temperature of nearly he thought garp rolled his eyes at duncan oh just great duncan garp said duncan had meant the movie you should relax dad duncan suggested shaking his head oh i should garp knew but he couldnt he thought of walt and what a perfect little ass he had and strong little legs and how sweet his sweat smelled when hed been running and his hair was damp behind his ears a body that perfect should not be sick he thought i should have let helen go out on this miserable night i should have made her call that twerp from her officeand tell him to put it in his ear garp thought or in a light socket and turn on the juice i should have called that candyass myself garp thought i should have visited him in the middle of the night when garp walked up the aisle to see if they had a phone in the lobby he heard walt still coughing if she hasnt already gotten in touch with him garp thought ill tell her not to keep trying ill tell her its my turn he was at that point in his feelings toward helen where he felt betrayed but at the same time honestly loved and important to her he had not had time enough to ponder how betrayed he feltor how much truly she had been trying to keep him in her mind it was a delicate point between hating her and loving her terriblyalso he was not without sympathy for whatever shed wanted after all he knew the shoe on the other foot had also been worn and was certainly thinner it even seemed unfair to garp that helen who had always meant so well had been caught like this she was a good woman and she certainly deserved better luck but when helen did not answer the phone this point of delicacy in garps feelings toward her quite suddenly escaped him he felt only rage and only betrayal bitch he thought the phone rang and rang she went out to meet him or theyre even doing it in our house he thoughthe could hear them saying one last time that puny fink with his pretentious short stories about fragile relationships which almost developed in badly lit european restaurants perhaps someone wore the wrong glove and the moment was lost forever there was one where a woman decides not to because the mans shirt was too tight at his throat how could helen have read that crap and how could she have touched that foppish body but the movie isnt half over duncan protested theres going to be a duel i want to see the duel walt said whats a duel were leaving garp told them no duncan hissed walts sick garp mumbled he shouldnt be here im not sick walt said hes not that sick duncan said get out of those seats garp told them he had to grab the front of duncans shirt which made walt get up and stumble into the aisle first duncan grumbling scuffed after him whats a duel walt asked duncan its real neat duncan said now you wont ever see it cut it out duncan garp said dont be mean youre the one whos mean duncan said yeah dad said walt the volvo was shrouded in ice the windshield solid with it there were various scrapers and broken snow brushes and junk of that sort somewhere in the trunk garp supposed but by march the winter driving had worn out much of this equipment or the children had played with it and lost it garp wasnt going to take the time to clean the windshield anyway how can you see duncan asked i live here garp said i dont have to see but in fact he had to roll down the driversside window and stick his face out into the raining sleet as hard as hail he drove toward home that way its cold walt shivered shut the window i need it open to see garp said i thought you didnt have to see duncan said im too cold walt cried dramatically he coughed but all of this as garp saw it was helens fault she was to blamefor however walt suffered his cold or for its growing worse it was her fault and for duncans disappointment in his father for that unforgivable way in the theater that garp had grabbed the boy and stood him up out of his seat she was to blame the bitch with her runt lover but at the moment his eyes were teary in the cold wind and the sleet and he thought to himself how he loved helen and would never be unfaithful to her againnever hurt her like this he would promise her that at the same moment helen felt her conscience clear her love for garp was very fine and she sensed that michael milton was about to be released he was exhibiting the familiar signs the angle that he bent at the waist and the peculiar way he pointed his hips the straining of that muscle used for little else on the inside of his thigh its almost over helen thought her nose touched the cold brass of his belt buckle and the back of her head bumped the bottom of the steering wheel which michael milton gripped as if he expected the threeton buick to suddenly leave the ground garp hit the bottom of his driveway at about forty miles per hour he came off the downhill road in third gear and accelerated just as he exited he glimpsed how the driveway was glazed with frozen slush and he worried momentarily that the volvo might slip on the short uphill curve he held the car in gear until he felt what grip he had of the road it was good enough and he popped the sharp stick shift into neutrala second before he killed the engine and flicked out the headlights they coasted up into the black rain it was like that moment when you feel an airplane lift off the runway the children both cried out in excitement garp could feel the children at his elbow crowding each other for the one favored position in the gap between the bucket seats how can you see now duncan asked he doesnt have to see walt said there was a high thrill in walts voice which suggested to garp that walt wished to reassure himself i know this by heart garp assured them its like being underwater cried duncan he held his breath its like a dream said walt he reached for his brothers hand the world according to marcus aurelius that was how jenny fields became a kind of nurse again after all her years in her white uniform nursing the womens movement jenny was appropriately dressed for her role it was at jennys suggestion that the garp family moved into the fields estate at dogs head harbor there were many rooms for jenny to take care of them in and there was the healing sound of the sea rushing in and out rinsing everything clean all his life duncan garp would associate the sound of the sea with his convalescence his grandmother would remove the bandage there was a kind of tidal irrigation of the hole where duncans right eye had been his father and mother could not stand the sight of that empty hole but jenny was an old hand at staring down wounds until they went away it was with his grandmother jenny fields that duncan would see his first glass eye see jenny said its big and brown its not quite as pretty as your left one but you just make sure the girls see your left one first it was not a very feminist thing to say she supposed but jenny always said that she was first and foremost a nurse duncans eye was gouged out when he was flung forward between the bucket seats the uncovered tip of the stickshift shaft was the first thing to break his fall garps right arm reaching into the gap between the seats was too late duncan passed under it putting out his right eye and breaking three fingers of his right hand which was jammed into the seatbelt release mechanism by no ones estimate could the volvo have been moving faster than twentyfiveat the most thirtyfivemiles per hour but the collision was astonishing the threeton buick did not yield quite an inch to garps coasting car inside the volvo the children were like eggs out of the egg boxloose inside the shopping bagat the moment of impact even inside the buick the jolt had surprising ferocity helens head was flung forward narrowly missing the steering column which caught her at the back of her neck many wrestlers children have hardy necks because helens did not breakthough she wore a brace for almost six weeks and her back would bother her the rest of her life her right collarbone was broken perhaps by the rising slam of michael miltons knee and her nose was gashed across the bridgerequiring nine stitchesby what must have been michael miltons belt buckle helens mouth was snapped shut with such force that she broke two teeth and required two neat stitches in her tongue at first she thought she had bitten her tongue off because she could feel it swimming in her mouth which was full of blood but her head ached so severely that she didnt dare open her mouth until she had to breathe and she couldnt move her right arm she spat what she thought was her tongue into the palm of her left hand it wasnt her tongue of course it was what amounted to three quarters of michael miltons penis the warm wash of blood over her face felt to helen like gasoline she began to screamnot for her own safety but for garps and the childrens she knew what had hit the buick she struggled to get out of michael miltons lap because she had to see what had happened to her family she dropped what she thought was her tongue on the floor of the buick and with her good left arm she punched michael milton whose lap pinned her against the steering column it was only then that she heard other screams above her own michael milton was screaming of course but helen heard beyond himto the volvo that was duncan who was screaming she was sure and helen fought her left arm across michael miltons bleeding lap to the door handle when the door opened she pushed michael out of the buick she felt incredibly strong michael never once corrected his bentdouble sittingup position he lay on his side in the freezing slush as if he were still in the drivers seat though he bellowed and bled like a steer when the door light came on in the huge buick garp could dimly see the gore in the volvoduncans streaming face split with his gaping wail garp began to bellow too but his bellow issued forth no louder than a whimper his own odd sound scared him so much that he tried to talk softly to duncan it was then garp realized he couldnt talk when garp had flung out his arm to break duncans fall he had turned almost sideways in the drivers seat and his face had struck the steering wheel hard enough to break his jaw and mangle his tongue twelve stitches in the long weeks of garps recovery at dogs head harbor it is fortunate for jenny that shed had much experience with ellen jamesians because garps mouth was wired shut and his messages to his mother were written ones he sometimes wrote pages and pages on the typewriter which jenny would then read aloud to duncanbecause although duncan could read he was instructed not to strain his remaining eye more than was necessary in time the eye would compensate for the other eyes loss but garp had much to say that was immediateand no way to say it when he sensed that his mother was editing his remarksto duncan and to helen to whom he also wrote pages and pagesgarp would grunt his protest through his wires holding his sore tongue very still and jenny fields like the good nurse she was would wisely move him to a private room this is the dogs head harbor hospital helen said to jenny once although helen could talk she said little she did not have pages and pages to say she spent most of her convalescence in duncans room reading to the boy because helen was a much better reader than jenny and there were only two stitches in helens tongue in this period of recovery jenny fields could deal with garp better than helen could deal with him helen and duncan often sat side by side in duncans room duncan had a fine oneeyed view of the sea which he watched all day as if he were a camera getting used to having one eye is something like getting used to the world through a camera there are similarities in depth of field and in the problems of focus when duncan seemed ready to discover this helen bought him a cameraa singlelens reflex camera for duncan that kind made the most sense it was in this period of time duncan garp would recall that the thought of being an artist a painter and a photographer first occurred to him he was almost eleven although he had been athletic his one eye would make him like his father forever leery of sports involving balls even running he said he was bothered by the lack of peripheral vision duncan claimed it made him clumsy it was eventually added to garps sadness that duncan did not care for wrestling either duncan spoke in terms of the camera and he told his father that one of his problems with depth of field included not knowing how far away the mat was when i wrestle he told garp i feel like im going downstairs in the dark i dont know when i get to the bottom until i feel it garp concluded of course that the accident had made duncan insecure about sports but helen pointed out to him that duncan had always had a certain timidity a reserveeven though he was good at games and clearly well coordinated hed always had a tendency not to participate not as energetically certainly as waltwho was intrepid who flung his body into every new circumstance with faith and grace and with temerity walt helen said was the real athlete between them after a while garp supposed she was right helen is often right you know jenny told garp one night at dogs head harbor the context of this remark could have been anything but it was sometime soon after the accident because duncan had his own room and helen had her own room and garp had his own room and so forth helen is often right his mother had told him but garp looked angry and wrote jenny a note not this time mom said the note meaningperhapsmichael milton meaning the whole thing it was not expressly because of michael milton that helen resigned the availability of jennys big hospital on the ocean as both garp and helen would come to think of it was a way to leave the unwanted familiarity of their house and of that driveway and in the faculty code of ethics moral turpitude is listed as one ground for revoking tenurethough this never came to debate sleeping with students was not generally treated too harshly it might be a hidden reason why a faculty member wasnt given tenure it would rarely be a reason for revoking someones tenure helen may have supposed that biting off three quarters of a students penis was fairly high on the scale of conceivable abuse to students sleeping with them simply happened though it was not encouraged there were many worse ways of evaluating students and categorizing them for life but amputation of their genitalia was certainly severe even for bad students and helen must have felt inclined to punish herself so she denied herself the pleasure of continuing at the task she had prepared for so well and she removed herself from the arousement that books and their discussion had always meant to her in her later life helen would spare herself considerable unhappiness by refusing to feel guilty in her later life the whole business with michael milton would more often make her angry than it would make her sadbecause she was strong enough to believe that she was a good woman which she was whod been made to suffer disproportionately for a trivial indiscretion but at least for a time helen would heal herself and her family never having had a mother and having had little chance to use jenny fields in that way helen submitted to this period of hospitalization at dogs head harbor she calmed herself by nursing duncan and she hoped that jenny could nurse garp this aura of the hospital was not new to garp whose earliest experienceswith fear with dreams with sexhad all occurred in the infirmary atmosphere of the old steering school he adapted it helped him that he had to write out what he wanted to say because this made him careful it made him reconsider many of the things he might have thought he wanted to say when he saw them written downthese raw thoughtshe realized that he couldnt or shouldnt say them when he went to revise them he knew better and threw them away there was one for helen which read three quarters is not enough he threw it away then he wrote one for helen that he did give to her i dont blame you later he wrote another one i dont blame me either the note said only in this way can we be whole again garp wrote to his mother and jenny fields padded whitely through the saltdamp house room to room with her nursing ways and garps notes it was all the writing he could manage of course the house at dogs head harbor was used to recoveries jennys wounded women had gotten hold of themselves there these seasmelling rooms had histories of sadnesses outlived among them the sadness of roberta muldoon who had lived there with jenny through the most difficult periods of her sex reassignment in fact roberta had failed at living aloneand at living with a number of menand she was back living at dogs head harbor with jenny again when the garps moved in as the spring warmed up and the hole that had been duncans right eye slowly healed and was less vulnerable to sticking bits of sand roberta took duncan to the beach it was on the beach that duncan discovered his depthoffield problem as it was related to a thrown ball because roberta muldoon tried playing catch with duncan and very soon hit him in the face with the football they gave up the ball and roberta contented duncan with diagraming in the sand all the plays she once ran at the tight end position for the philadelphia eagles she focused on the part of the eagles offense that concerned her when she was robert muldoon no and she relived for duncan her occasional touch down passes her dropped balls her offside penalties her most vicious hits it was against the cowboys she told duncan we were playing in dallas when that snake in the grasseight ball everyone called himcame up on my blind side and roberta would regard the quiet child who had a blind side for life and she would deftly change the subject to garp robertas subject was the ticklish detail of sex reassignment because garp seemed interested and roberta knew that garp probably liked hearing about a problem so thoroughly removed from his own i always knew i should have been a girl she told garp i dreamed about having love made to me by a man but in the dreams i was always a woman i was never a man having love made to me by another man there was more than a hint of distaste in robertas references to homosexuals and garp thought it strange that people in the process of making a decision that will plant them firmly in a minority forever are possibly less tolerant of other minorities than we might imagine there was even a bitchiness about roberta when she complained of the other troubled women who came to get well at dogs head harbor with jenny fields that damn lesbian crowd roberta said to garp theyre trying to make your mother into something she isnt i sometimes think thats what mom is for garp teased roberta she makes people happy by letting them think she is something she isnt well they tried to confuse me roberta said when i was preparing myself for the operation they kept trying to talk me out of it be gay they said if you want men have them as you are if you become a woman youll just be taken advantage of they told me they were all cowards roberta concluded though garp knew sadly that roberta had been taken advantage of over and over again robertas vehemence was not unique garp pondered how these other women in his mothers house and in her care had all been victims of intoleranceyet most of them hed met seemed especially intolerant of each other it was a kind of infighting that made no sense to garp and he marveled at his mother sorting them all out keeping them happy and out of each others hair robert muldoon garp knew had spent several months in drag before his actual operation hed go off in the morning dressed as robert muldoon he went out shopping for womens clothes and almost no one knew that he paid for his sex change with the banquet fees he collected for the speeches he gave to boys clubs and mens clubs in the evenings at dogs head harbor robert muldoon would model his new clothes for jenny and the critical women who shared her house when the estrogen hormones began to enlarge his breasts and shift the former tight ends shape around robert gave up the banquet circuit and marched forth from the dogs head harbor house in mannish womens suits and rather conservative wigs he tried being roberta long before he had the surgery clinically now roberta had the same genitalia and urological equipment as most other women but of course i cant conceive she told garp i dont ovulate and i dont menstruate neither do millions of other women jenny fields had reassured her when i came home from the hospital roberta said to garp do you know what else your mother told me garp shook his head home to roberta garp knew was dogs head harbor she told me i was less sexually ambiguous than most people she knew roberta said i really needed that she said because i had to use this horrible dilator all the time so that my vagina wouldnt close i felt like a machine good old mom garp scribbled theres such sympathy for people in what you write roberta told him suddenly but i dont see that much sympathy in you in your real life she said it was the same thing jenny had always accused him of but now he felt he had more with his jaw wired shut with his wife with her arm in a sling all dayand duncan with only half his pretty face intactgarp felt more generous toward the other wretches who wandered into dogs head harbor it was a summer town out of season the bleached shingled house with its porches and garrets was the only occupied mansion along the graygreen dunes and the white beach at the end of ocean lane an occasional dog sniffed through the bonecolored driftwood and retired people living some miles inland in their former summer houses occasionally strolled the shore scrutinizing the shells in summer there were lots of dogs and children and mothers helpers all over the beach and always a bright boat or two in the harbor but when the garps moved in with jenny the shoreline seemed abandoned the beach littered with the debris washed in with the high tides of winter was deserted the atlantic ocean through april and through may was the livid color of a bruisewas the color of the bridge of helens nose visitors to the town in the offseason were quickly spotted as lost women in search of the famous nurse jenny fields in summer these women often spent a whole day in dogs head harbor trying to find someone who knew where jenny lived but the permanent residents of dogs head harbor all knew the last house at the end of ocean lane they told the damaged girls and women who asked for directions its as big as a hotel honey you cant miss it sometimes these searchers would trudge out to the beach first and view the house for a long time before they got up the nerve to come see if jenny was home sometimes garp would see them single or in twos and threes squatting on the windy dunes and watching the house as if they were trying to read the degree of sympathy therein if there were more than one they conferred on the beach one of them was elected to knock on the door while the others huddled on the dunes like dogs told to stay until theyre called helen bought duncan a telescope and from his room with a sea view duncan spied on the trepid visitors and often announced their presence hours before the knock on the door someone for grandma hed say focusing always focusing shes about twentyfour or maybe fourteen she has a blue knapsack she has an orange with her but i dont think shes going to eat it someones with her but i cant see her face shes lying down no shes being sick no shes wearing a kind of mask maybe shes the other ones motherno her sister or just a friend now shes eating the orange it doesnt look very good duncan would report and roberta would look too and sometimes helen it was often garp who answered the door yes shes my mother hed say but shes out shopping right now please come in if you want to wait for her and he would smile though all the time he would be scrutinizing the person as carefully as the retired people along the beach looked at their seashells and before his jaw healed and his mauled tongue grew back together garp would answer the door with a ready supply of notes many of the visitors were not in the least surprised by being handed notes because this was the only way they communicated too hello my name is beth im an ellen jamesian and garp would give her his hello my name is garp i have a broken jaw and hed smile at them and hand them a second note depending on the occasion one said theres a nice fire in the wood stove in the kitchen turn left and there was one that said dont be upset my mother will be back very soon there are other women here would you like to see them it was in this period that garp took to wearing a sport jacket again not out of nostalgia for his days at steering or in viennaand certainly not out of any necessity to be well dressed at dogs head harbor where roberta seemed the only woman who was concerned with what she worebut only because of his need for pockets he carried so many notes he tried running on the beach but he had to give it up it jarred his jaw and jangled his tongue against his teeth but he walked for miles along the sand he was returning from a walk the day the police car brought the young man to jennys house arm in arm the policemen helped him up the big front porch mr garp one of the policemen asked garp dressed in running gear for his walks he didnt have any notes on him but he nodded yes he was mr garp you know this kid the policeman asked of course he does the young man said you cops dont ever believe anybody you dont know how to relax it was the kid in the purple caftan the boy garp had escorted from the boudoir of mrs ralphwhat seemed to garp like years ago garp considered not recognizing him but he nodded the kids got no money the policeman explained he doesnt live around here and hes got no job hes not in school anywhere and when we called his folks they said they didnt even know where he wasand they didnt sound very interested to find out but he says hes staying with youand youll speak up for him garp of course couldnt speak he pointed to his wire mesh and imitated the act of writing a note on his palm whend you get the braces the kid asked most people have them when theyre younger theyre the craziestlooking braces i ever saw garp wrote out a note on the back of a traffic violation form that the policeman handed him yes ill take responsibility for him but i cant speak up for him because i have a broken jaw the kid read the note over the policemans shoulder wow he said grinning what happened to the other guy he lost three quarters of his prick garp thought but he did not write this on a traffic violation form or on anything else ever the boy turned out to have read garps novels while he was in jail if id known you were the author of those books the kid said i would never have been so disrespectful his name was randy and he had become an ardent garp fan garp was convinced that the mainstream of his fans consisted of waifs lonely children retarded grownups cranks and only occasional members of the citizenry who were not afflicted with perverted taste but randy had come to garp as if garp were now the only guru randy obeyed in the spirit of his mothers home at dogs head harbor garp couldnt very well turn the boy away roberta muldoon took on the task of briefing randy on the accident to garp and his family whos the great big lovely chick randy asked garp in an awed whisper dont you recognize her garp wrote she was a tight end for the philadelphia eagles but even garps sourness could not dim randys likable enthusiasm not right away the boy entertained duncan for hours god knows how garp complained to helen he probably tells duncan about all his drug experiences the boys not on anything helen assured garp your mother asked him then he relates to duncan the exciting history of his criminal record garp wrote randy wants to be a writer helen said everyone wants to be a writer garp wrote but it wasnt true he didnt want to be a writernot anymore when he tried to write only the deadliest subject rose up to greet him he knew he had to forget itnot fondle it with his memory and exaggerate its awfulness with his art that was madness but whenever he thought of writing his only subject greeted him with its leers its fresh visceral puddles and its stink of death and so he did not write he didnt even try at last randy went away though duncan was sorry to see him go garp felt relieved he did not show anybody else the note randy left for him ill never be as good as youat anything even if thats true you could be a little more generous about how you rub that in so im not kind garp thought what else is new he threw randys note away when the wires came off and the rawness left his tongue garp ran again as the weather warmed up helen swam she was told it was good for restoring her muscle tone and strengthening her collarbone though this still hurt herespecially the breaststroke she swam for what seemed to be miles to garp straight out to sea and then along the shoreline she said she went out so far because the water was calmer there closer to shore the waves interfered with her but garp worried he and duncan sometimes used the telescope to watch her what am i going to do if something happens garp wondered he was a poor swimmer moms a good swimmer duncan assured him duncan was also becoming a good swimmer she goes out too far garp said by the time the summer people arrived the garp family took its exercise in slightly less ostentatious ways they played on the beach or in the sea only in the early morning in the crowded moments of the summer days and in the early evenings they watched the world from the shaded porches of jenny fields home they withdrew to the big cool house garp got a little better he began to writegingerly at first long plot outlines and speculations about his characters he avoided the main characters at least he thought they were the main charactersa husband a wife a child he concentrated instead on a detective an outsider to the family garp knew what terror would lurk at the heart of his book and perhaps for that reason he approached it through a character as distant from his personal anxiety as the police inspector is distant from the crime what business do i have writing about a police inspector he thought and so he made the inspector into someone even garp could understand then garp stood close to the stink itself the bandages came off duncans eye hole and the boy wore a black patch almost handsome against his summer tan garp took a deep breath and began a novel it was in the late summer of garps convalescence that the world according to bensenhaver was begun about that time michael milton was released from a hospital walking with a postsurgical stoop and a woebegone face due to an infection the result of improper drainageand aggravated by a common urological problemhe had to have the remaining quarter of his penis removed in an operation garp never knew this and at this point it might not even have cheered him up helen knew garp was writing again i wont read it she told him not one word of it i know you have to write it but i never want to see it i dont mean to hurt you but you have to understand i have to forget it if you have to write about it god help you people bury these things in different ways its not about it exactly he told her i do not write autobiographical fiction i know that too she said but i wont read it just the same of course i understand he said writing he always knew was a lonely business it was hard for a lonely thing to feel that much lonelier jenny he knew would read it she was tough as nails jenny watched them all get well she watched new patients come and go one was a hideous young girl named laurel who made the mistake of sounding off about duncan one morning at breakfast could i sleep in another part of the house she asked jenny theres this creepy kidwith the telescope the camera and the eye patch hes like a fucking pirate spying on me even little boys like to paw you over with their eyeseven with one eye garp had fallen while running in the predawn light on the beach he had hurt his jaw again and wasagainwired shut he had no old notes handy for what he wanted to say to this girl but he scribbled very hastily on his napkin fuck you he scribbled and threw the napkin at the surprised girl look the girl said to jenny this is just the kind of routine i had to get away from some man bullying me all the time some dingdong threatening me with his bigprick violence who needs it i mean especially herewho needs it did i come here for more of the same fuck you to death said garps next note but jenny ushered the girl outside and told her the history of duncans eye patch and his telescope and his camera and the girl tried very hard to avoid garp during the last part of her stay her stay was just a few days and then someone was there to get her a sporty car with new york plates and a man who looked like a dingdongand someone who had actually threatened poor laurel with bigprick violence all the time hey you dildos he called to garp and roberta who were sitting on the large porch swing like oldfashioned lovers is this the whorehouse where youre keeping laurel were not exactly keeping her roberta said shut up you big dyke said the new york man he came up on the porch hed left the motor running to his sports car and its idle charged and calmed itselfcharged and calmed itself and charged again the man wore cowboy boots and green suede bellbottom pants he was tall and chesty though not quite as tall and chesty as roberta muldoon im not a dyke roberta said well youre no vestal virgin either the man said where the fuck is laurel he wore an orange tshirt with bright green letters between his nipples shape up the letters read garp searched his pockets for a pencil to scribble a note but all he came up with was old notes all the old standbys which did not seem to apply to this rude person is laurel expecting you roberta muldoon asked the man and garp knew that roberta was having a sexidentity problem again she was goading the moron in hopes that she could then feel justified in beating the shit out of him but the man to garp looked as if he might make a fair match for roberta all that estrogen had changed more than robertas shape garp thoughtit had unmuscled the former robert muldoon to a degree that roberta seemed prone to forget look sweethearts the man said to both garp and roberta if laurel doesnt get her ass out here im going to clean house what kind of fag joint is this anyway everyones heard of it i didnt have any trouble finding out where she went every screwy bitch in new york knows about this cunt hangout roberta smiled she was beginning to rock back and forth on the big porch swing in a way that was making garp feel sick to his stomach garp clawed through his pockets at a frantic rate scanning note after worthless note look you clowns the man said i know what sort of douche bags hang out here its a big lesbian scene right he prodded the edge of the big porch swing with his cowboy boot and set the swing to moving oddly and what are you he asked garp you the man of the house or the court eunuch garp handed the man a note theres a nice fire in the wood stove in the kitchen turn left but it was august that was the wrong note whats this shit the man said and garp handed him another note the first one to fly out of his pocket dont be upset my mother will be back very soon there are other women here would you like to see them fuck your mother the man said he started toward the big screen door laurel he screamed you in there you bitch but it was jenny fields who met him in the doorway hello she said i know who you are the man said i recognize the dumb uniform my laurels not your type sweetie she likes to fuck perhaps not with you said jenny fields whatever abuse the man in the shape up tshirt was then prepared to deliver to jenny fields went unsaid roberta muldoon threw a crossbody block on the surprised man hitting him from behind and a little to one side of the backs of his knees it was a flagrant clip worthy of a fifteenyard penalty in robertas days as a philadelphia eagle the man hit the gray boards of the porch deck with such force that the hanging flowerpots were set swinging he tried but could not get up he appeared to have suffered a knee injury common to the sport of footballthe very reason in fact why clipping was a fifteenyard penalty the man was not plucky enough to hurl further abuse at anyone from his back he lay with a calm moonlike expression upon his face which whitened slightly in his pain that was too hard roberta jenny said ill get laurel roberta said sheepishly and she went inside in robertas heart of hearts garp and jenny knew she was more feminine than anyone but in her body of bodies she was a highly trained rock garp had found another note and he dropped it on the new york mans chest right where it said shape up it was a note garp had many duplicates of hello my name is garp i have a broken jaw my name is harold the man said too bad about your jaw garp found a pencil and wrote another note too bad about your knee harold laurel was fetched oh baby she said you found me i dont think i can drive the fucking car harold said out on ocean lane the mans sport car still chugged like an animal interested in eating sand i can drive baby laurel said you just never let me now ill let you harold groaned believe me oh baby laurel said roberta and garp carried the man to the car i think i really need laurel the man confided to them fucking bucket seats the man complained when they had gingerly squeezed him in harold was large for his car it was the first time in what seemed like years to garp that garp had been this near to an automobile roberta put her hand on garps shoulder but garp turned away i guess harold needs me laurel told jenny fields and gave a little shrug but why does she need him said jenny fields to no one in particular as the little car drove away garp had wandered off roberta punishing herself for her momentarily lapsed femininity went to find duncan and mother him helen was talking on the phone to the fletchers harrison and alice who wanted to come visit that might help us helen thought she was right and it must have boosted helens confidence in herselfto be right about something again the fletchers stayed a week there was at last a child for duncan to play with even if it was not his age and not his sex it was at least a child who knew about his eye and duncan lost most of his selfconsciousness about the eye patch when the fletchers left he was more willing to go to the beach by himself even at those times of the day when he might encounter other childrenwho might ask him or of course tease him harrison provided helen with a confidant as he had been for her before she was able to tell harrison things about michael milton that were simply too raw to tell garp and yet she needed to say them she needed to talk about her anxieties for her marriage now and how she was dealing with the accident so differently from garp harrison suggested another child get pregnant he advised helen confided that she was no longer taking the pills but she did not tell harrison that garp had not slept with hernot since it had happened she didnt really need to tell harrison that harrison noted the separate rooms alice encouraged garp to stop the silly notes he could talk if he tried if he wasnt so vain about how he sounded if she could talk certainly he could spit the words out alice reasonedteeth wired together delicate tongue and all he could at least try alish garp said yeth said alice thatth my name whatth yours arp garp managed to say jenny fields passing whitely to another room shuddered like a ghost and moved on i mish him garp confessed to alice you mith him yeth of courth you do said alice and she held him while he cried it was quite some time after the fletchers left when helen came to garps room in the night she was surprised to find him lying awake because he was listening to what shed heard too it was why she couldnt sleep someone one of jennys late arrivalsa new guestwas taking a bath first the garps had heard the tub being drawn then theyd heard the plunking in the waternow the splashing and soapy sounds there was even a little light singing or the person was humming they remembered of course the years walt had washed himself within their hearing how they would listen for any telltale slipping sounds or for the most frightening sound of allwhich was no sound and then theyd call walt and walt would say what and they would say okay just checking to make sure that he hadnt slipped under and drowned walt liked to lie with his ears underwater listening to his fingers climbing the walls of the tub and often he wouldnt hear garp or helen calling him hed look up surprised to see their anxious faces suddenly above him peering over the rim of the tub im all right hed say sitting up just answer for gods sake walt garp would tell him when we call you just answer us i didnt hear you walt said then keep your head out of the water helen said but how can i wash my hair walt asked thats a lousy way to wash your hair walt garp said call me ill wash your hair okay said walt and when they left him alone hed put his head underwater again and listen to the world that way helen and garp lay beside each other on garps narrow bed in one of the guest rooms in one of the garrets at dogs head harbor the house had so many bathroomsthey couldnt even be sure which bathroom they were listening to but they listened its a woman i think helen said here garp said of course its a woman i thought at first it was a child helen said i know garp said the humming i guess helen said you know how he used to talk to himself i know garp said they held each other in the bed that was always a little damp so close to the ocean and with so many windows open all day and the screen doors swinging and banging i want another child said helen okay garp said as soon as possible helen said right away said garp of course if its a girl helen said well name her jenny because of your mother good said garp i dont know if its a boy said helen not walt garp said okay helen said not ever another walt said garp although i know some people do that i wouldnt want to helen said some other name if its a boy garp said i hope its a girl said helen i wont care gart said of course neither will i really said helen im so sorry garp said he hugged her no im so sorry she said no im so sorry said garp i am helen said i am he said they made love so carefully helen imagined that she was roberta muldoon fresh out of surgery trying out a brandnew vagina garp tried not to imagine anything whenever garp began imagining he only saw the bloody volvo there were duncans screams and outside he could hear helen calling and someone else he twisted himself from behind the steering wheel and kneeled on the drivers seat he held duncans face in his hands but the blood would not stop and garp couldnt see everything that was wrong its okay he whispered to duncan hush youre going to be all right but because of his tongue there were no wordsonly a soft spray duncan kept screaming and so did helen and someone else kept groaningthe way a dog dreams in its sleep but what did garp hear that frightened him so what else its all right duncan believe me he whispered incomprehensibly youre going to be all right he wiped the blood from the boys throat with his hand nothing at the boys throat was cut he could see he wiped the blood from the boys temples and saw that they were not bashed in he kicked open the driversside door to be sure the door light went on and he could see that one of duncans eyes was darting the eye was looking for help but garp could see that the eye could see he wiped more blood with his hand but he could not find duncans other eye its okay he whispered to duncan but duncan screamed even louder over his fathers shoulder duncan had seen his mother at the volvos open door blood streamed from her gashed nose and her sliced tongue and she held her right arm as if it had broken off somewhere near her shoulder but it was the fright in her face that frightened duncan garp turned and saw her something else frightened him it was not helens screaming it was not duncans screaming and garp knew that michael milton who was grunting could grunt himself to deathfor all garp cared it was something else it was not a sound it was no sound it was the absence of sound wheres walt helen said trying to see into the volvo she stopped screaming walt cried garp he held his breath duncan stopped crying they heard nothing and garp knew walt had a cold you could hear from the next roomeven two rooms away you could hear that wet rattle in the childs chest walt they screamed both helen and garp would whisper to each other later that at that moment they imagined walt with his ears underwater listening intently to his fingers at play in the bathtub i can still see him helen whispered later all the time garp said i know i just shut my eyes said helen right garp said i know but duncan said it best duncan said that sometimes it was as if his missing right eye was not entirely gone its like i can still see out of it sometimes duncan said but its like memory its not realwhat i see maybe its become the eye you see your dreams with garp told him sort of duncan said but it seems so real its your imaginary eye garp said that can be very real its the eye i can still see walt with duncan said you know i know garp said many wrestlers children have hardy necks but not all the children of wrestlers have necks that are hardy enough for duncan and helen now garp seemed to have an endless reservoir of gentleness for a year he spoke softly to them for a year he was never impatient with them they must have grown impatient with his delicacy jenny fields noticed that the three of them needed a year to nurse each other in that year jenny wondered what did they do with the other feelings human beings have helen hid them helen was very strong duncan saw them only with his missing eye and garp he was strong but not that strong he wrote a novel called the world according to bensenhaver into which all his other feelings flew when garps editor john wolf read the first chapter of the world according to bensenhaver he wrote to jenny fields what in hell is going on out there wolf wrote to jenny it is as if garps grief has made his heart perverse but t s garp felt guided by an impulse as old as marcus aurelius who had the wisdom and the urgency to note that in the life of a man his time is but a momenthis sense a dim rushlight the world according to bensenhaver hope standish was at home with her son nicky when oren rath walked into the kitchen she was drying the dishes and she saw immediately the long thinbladed fishermans knife with the slick cutting edge and the special sawtoothed edge that they call a disgorgerscaler nicky was not yet three he still ate in a high chair and he was eating his breakfast when oren rath stepped up behind him and nudged the ripper teeth of his fishermans knife against the childs throat set them dishes aside he told hope mrs standish did as she was told nicky gurgled at the stranger the knife was just a tickle under his chin what do you want hope asked ill give you anything you want you sure will said oren rath whats your name hope mines oren thats a nice name hope told him nicky couldnt turn in the high chair to see the stronger who was tickling his throat he had wet cereal on his fingers and when he reached for oren raths hand rath stepped up beside the high chair and touched the fine slicing edge of his fishermans blade to the fleshy pouch of the boys cheek he made a quick cut there as if he were briefly outlining the childs cheekbone then he stepped back to observe nickys surprised face his simple cry a thread thin line of blood appeared like the stitching for a pocket on the boys cheek it was as if the child had suddenly developed a gill i mean business said oren rath hope started toward nicky but rath waved her back he dont need you he just dont care for his cereal he wants a cookie nicky bowled hell choke on it when hes crying hope said you want to argue with me said oren rath you want to talk about choking ill cut his pecker off and stuff it down his throatif you want to talk about choking hope gave nicky a zwieback and he stopped crying you see said oren rath he picked up the high chair with nicky in it and hugged it to his chest were going to the bedroom now he said he nodded to hope you first they went down the hall together the standish family lived in a ranch house then with a new baby they had agreed ranch houses were safer in the case of a fire hope went into the bedroom and oren rath put down the high chair with nicky in it just outside the bedroom door nicky had almost stopped bleeding there was just a little blood on his cheek oren rath wiped this off with his hand then wiped his hand on his pants then he stepped into the bedroom after hope when he closed the door nicky started to cry please hope said he really might choke and he knows how to get out of that high chairor it might tip over he doesnt like to be alone oren rath went to the night table and slashed through the phone cord with his fishermans knife as easily as a man halving a very ripe pear you dont want to argue with me he said hope sat down on the bed nicky was crying but not hysterically it sounded as if he might stop hope started crying too just take off your clothes oren said he helped her undress he was tall and reddishblond his hair as lank and as close to his head as high grass beaten down by a flood he smelled like silage and hope remembered the turquoise pickup shed noticed in the driveway just before he appeared in her kitchen youve even got a rug in the bedroom he said to her he was thin but muscular his hands were large and clumsy like the feet of a puppy whos going to be a big dog his body seemed almost hairless but he was so pale so very blond that his hair was hard to see against his skin do you know my husband hope asked him i know when hes home and when he aint rath said listen he said suddenly hope held her breath you hear your kid dont even mind it nicky was murmuring vowel sounds outside the bedroom door talking wetly to his zwieback hope began crying harder when oren rath touched her awkward and fast she thought she was so dry that she wouldnt even get big enough for his horrible finger please wait she said no arguing with me no i mean i can help you she said she wanted him in and out of her as fast as possible she was thinking of nicky in the high chair in the hall i can make it nicer i mean she said unconvincingly she did not know how to say what she was saying oren rath grabbed one of her breasts in such a way that hope knew he had never touched a breast before his hand was so cold she flinched in his awkwardness he butted her in the mouth with the top of his head no arguing he grunted hope someone called they both heard it and froze oren rath gaped at the cut phone cord hope it was margot a neighbor and a friend oren rath touched the cool flat blade of his knife to hopes nipple shes going to walk right in here hope whispered shes a good friend my god nicky they could hear margot say i see youre eating all over the house is your mother getting dressed ill have to fuck you both and kill everybody whispered oren rath hope scissored his waist with her good legs and hugged him knife and all to her breasts margot she screamed grab nicky and run please she shrieked theres a crazy man whos going to kill us all take nicky take nicky oren rath lay stiffly against her as if it were the first time hed ever been hugged he did not struggle he did not use his knife they both lay rigid and listened to margot dragging nicky down the hall and out the kitchen door one leg of the high chair was snapped off against the refrigerator but margot didnt stop to remove nicky from the chair until she was half a block down the street and kicking open her own door dont kill me hope whispered just go quickly and youll get away shes calling the police right now get dressed said oren rath i aint had you yet and im going to where hed butted her with the oval crown of his head he had split her lip against her teeth and made her bleed i mean business he repeated but uncertainly he was as roughboned and graceless as a young steer he made her put her dress on without any underwear he shoved her barefoot down the hall carrying his boots under his arm hope didnt realize until she was beside him in the pickup that he had put on one of her husbands flannel shirts margot has probably written down the license number of this truck she told him she turned the rearview mirror so that she could see herself she dabbed at her split lip with the broad floppy collar of her dress oren rath stiffarmed her in the ear rapping the far side of her head off the passenger door of the cab i need that mirror to see he said dont mess around or ill really hurt you hed taken her bra with him and he used it to tie her wrists to the thick rusty hinges of the glovecompartment door which gaped open at her he drove as if he were in no special hurry to get out of town he did not seem impatient when he got stuck at the long traffic light near the university he watched all the pedestrians crossing the street he shook his head and clucked his tongue when he saw how some of the students were dressed hope could see her husbands office window from where she sat in the trucks cab but she didnt know if he would be in his office or actually at that moment teaching a class in fact he was in his officefour floors up dorsey standish looked out his window and saw the lights change the traffic was allowed to flow the hordes of marching students were temporarily restrained at the gates to the crosswalks dorsey standish liked watching traffic there are many foreign and flashy cars in a university town but here these cars were contrasted with the vehicles of the natives farmers trucks slatsided conveyors of pigs and cattle strange harvesting machinery everything muddy from the farms and county roads standish knew nothing about farms but he was fascinated by the animals and the machinesespecially the dangerous baffling vehicles there went one now with a chutefor whatand a latticework of cables that pulled or suspended something heavy standish liked to try to visualize how everything worked below him a lurid turquoise pickup moved ahead with the traffic its fenders were pockmarked its grille bashed in and black with mashed flies andstandish imaginedthe heads of imbedded birds in the cab beside the driver dorsey standish thought he saw a pretty womansome thing about her hair and profile reminded him of hope and a flash of the womans dress struck him as a color his wife liked to wear but he was four floors up the truck was past him and the cabs rear window was so thickly caked with mud that he couldnt glimpse more of her besides it was time for his ninethirty class dorsey standish decided it was unlikely that a woman riding in such an ugly truck would be at all pretty i bet your husband is screwing his students all the time said oren rath his big hand with the knife lay in hopes lap no i dont think so hope said shit you dont know nothing he said im going to fuck you so good you wont even want it to stop i dont care what you do hope told him you cant hurt my baby now i can do things to you said oren rath lots of things yes you mean business hope said mockingly they were driving into the farm country rath didnt say anything for a while then he said im not as crazy as you think i dont think youre crazy at all hope lied i think youre just a dumb horny kid whos never been laid oren rath must have felt at this moment that his advantage of terror was slipping away from him fast hope was seeking any advantage she might find but she didnt know if oren rath was sane enough to be humiliated they turned off the county road up a long dirt driveway toward a farmhouse whose windows were blurred with plastic insulation the scruffy lawn was strewn with tractor parts and other metal trash the mailbox said r r w e and o rath these raths were not related to the famous sausage raths but it appeared that they were pig farmers hope saw a series of outbuildings gray and slanted with rusted roofs on the ramp by the brown barn a fullgrown sow lay on her side breathing with difficulty beside the pig were two men who looked to hope like mutants of the same mutation that had produced oren rath i want the black truck now oren said to them people are out looking for this one he used his knife matteroffactly to slice through the bra that bound hopes wrists to the glove compartment shit one of the men said the other man shrugged he had a red blotch on his facea kind of birthmark which was the color and nubbled surface of a raspberry in fact that is what his family called him raspberry roth fortunately hope didnt know this they had not looked at oren or at hope the hardbreathing sow shattered the barnyard calm with a rippling fart shit there she goes again the man without the birthmark said except for his eyes his face was more or less normal his name was weldon raspberry rath read the label on a brown bottle he held out toward the pig like a drink may produce excessive gas and flatulence it says dont say anything about producing a pig like this weldon said i need the black truck oren said well the keys in it oren said weldon rath if you think you can manage by yourself oren rath shoved hope toward the black pickup raspberry was holding the bottle of pig medicine and staring at hope when she said to him hes kidnapping me hes going to rape me the police ate already looking for him raspberry kept staring at hope but weldon turned to oren i hope you aint doing nothing too stupid he said i aint oren said the two men now turned their total attention to the pig id wait another hour and then give her another squirt raspberry said aint we seen enough of the vet this week he scratched the mudsmeared neck of the sow with the toe of his boot the sow farted oren led hope behind the barn where the corn spilled out of the silo some piglets barely bigger than kittens were playing in it they scattered when oren started the black pickup hope started to cry are you going to let me go she asked oren i aint had you yet he said hopes bare feet were cold and black with the spring muck my feet hurt she said where are we going shed seen an old blanket in the back of the pickup matted and flecked with straw thats where she imagined she was going into the cornfields then spread on the spongy spring groundand when it was over and her throat was slit and shed been disemboweled with the fishermans knife hed wrap her up in the blanket that was lumped stiffly on the floor of the pickup as if it covered some stillborn livestock i got to find a good place to have you said oren rath i would of kept you at home but id of had to share you hope standish was trying to figure out the foreign machinery of oren rath he did not work like the human beings she was accustomed to what youre doing is wrong she said no it isnt he said it aint youre going to rape me hope said thats wrong i just want to have you he said he hadnt bothered to tie her to the glove compartment this time there was nowhere she could go they were driving only on those milelong plots of county roads driving slowly west in little squares the way a knight advances on a chessboard one square ahead two sideways one sideways two ahead it seemed purposeless to hope but then she wondered if he didnt know the roads so very well that he knew how to cover a considerable distance without ever passing through a town they saw only the signposts for towns and although they couldnt have moved more than thirty miles from the university she didnt recognize any of the names coldwater hills fields plainview maybe they arent towns she thought but only crude labels for the natives who lived hereidentifying the land for them as if they didnt know the simple words for the things they saw every day you dont have any right to do this to me hope said shit he said he pumped his brakes hard throwing her forward against the trucks solid dashboard her forehead bounced off the windshield the back of her hand was mashed against her nose she felt something like a small muscle or a very light bone give way in her chest then he tromped on the accelerator and tossed her back into the seat i hate arguing he said her nose bled she sat with her head forward in her hands and the blood dripped on her thighs she sniffed a little the blood dripped over her lip and filmed her teeth she tipped her head back so that she could taste it for some reason it calmed herit helped her to think she knew there was a rapidly blueing knot on her forehead swelling under her smooth skin when she ran her hand up to her face and touched the lump oren rath looked at her and laughed she spit at hima thin phlegm laced pink with blood it caught his cheek and ran down to the collar of her husbands flannel shirt his hand as flat and broad as the sole of a boot reached for her hair she grabbed his forearm with both her hands she jerked his wrist to her mouth and bit into the soft part where the hairs dont always grow and the blue tubes carry the blood she meant to kill him in this impossible way but she barely had time to break the skin his arm was so strong that he snapped her body upright and across his lap he pushed the back of her neck against the steering wheelthe horn blew through her headand he broke her nose with the heel of his left hand then he returned that hand to the wheel he cradled her head with his right hand holding her face against his stomach when he felt that she wasnt struggling he let her head rest on his thigh his hand lightly cupped her ear as if to hold the sound of the horn inside her she kept her eyes shut against the pain in her nose he made several left turns more right turns each turn she knew meant they had driven one mile his hand now cupped the back of her neck she could hear again and she felt his fingers working their way into her hair the front of her face felt numb i dont want to kill you he said dont then hope said got to oren rath told her after we do it ill have to this affected her like the taste of her own blood she knew he didnt care for arguing she saw that she had lost a step her rape he was going to do it to her she had to consider that it was done what mattered now was living she knew that meant outliving him she knew that meant getting him caught or getting him killed or killing him against her cheek she felt the change in his pocket his blue jeans were soft and sticky with farm dust and machine grease his belt buckle dug into her forehead her lips touched the oily leather of his belt the fishermans knife was kept in a sheath she knew but where was the sheath she couldnt see it she didnt dare to hunt for it with her hands suddenly against her eye she felt his penis stiffening she felt thenfor really the first timealmost paralyzed panicked beyond helping herself no longer able to sort out the priorities once again it was oren rath who helped her look at it this way he said your kid got away i was going to kill the kid too you know the logic of oren raths peculiar version of sanity made everything sharpen for hope she heard the other cars there were not many but every few minutes or so there was a car passing she wished she could see but she knew they were not as isolated as they had been now she thought before he gets to where were goingif he even knows where were going she thought he did at least before he gets off this roadbefore im somewhere again where there arent any people oren rath shifted in his seat his erection was making him uncomfortable hopes warm face in his lap his hand in her hair was reaching him now hope thought she moved her cheek against his thigh just slightly he did not stop her she moved her face in his lap as if she were making herself more comfortable against a pillowagainst his prick she knew she moved until the bulge under his rank pants rose untouched by her face but she could reach it with her breath it stuck up out of his lap near her mouth and she began to breathe on it it hurt too much to breathe out of her nose she drew her lips into an oshaped kiss she focused her breathing and very softly she blew oh nicky she thought and dorsey her husband she would see them again she hoped to oren rath she gave her warm careful breath on him she focused her one cold thought im going to get you you son of a bitch it was apparent that the sexual experience of oren rath had not previously involved such subtleties as hopes directed breathing he tried to move her head in his lap so that he would once again have contact with her hot face but at the some time he didnt want to disturb her soft breath what she was doing made him want more contact but it was excruciating to imagine losing the teasing contact he now had he began to squirm hope didnt hurry it was his movement that finally brought the bulge of sour jeans to touch her lips she closed them there but didnt move her mouth oren rath felt only a hot wind passing through the crude weave of his clothes he groaned a car approached then passed him he corrected the truck he was aware he was beginning to wander across the center of the road what are you doing he asked hope she very lightly applied her teeth to his swollen clothes he brought his knee up pumped the brake jarred her head hurt her nose he forced his hand between her face and his lap she thought he was going to really hurt her but he was struggling with his zipper ive seen pictures of this he told her let me she said she had to sit up just a little to get his fly open she wanted to get a look at where they were they were still out in the country of course but there were pointed lines on the road she took him out of his pants and into her mouth without looking at him shit he said she thought she would gag she was afraid she would be sick then she got him into the back of her cheek where she thought she could take a lot of time he was sitting so stiffly still but trembling that she knew he was already far beyond even his imaginary experiences that steadied hope it gave her confidence and a sense of time she went ahead with it very slowly listening for other cars she could tell he had slowed down at the first sign she had that he was leaving this road she would have to change her plans could i bite the damn thing off she wondered but she thought that she probably couldntat least not quickly enough then two trucks went by them closely following each other in the distance she thought she heard another cars horn she started working fasterhe raised his lap higher she thought their truck had speeded up a car passed themawfully close she thought its horn blared at them fuck you oren rath yelled after it he was beginning to jounce up and down in the seat hurting hopes nose hope now had to be careful not to hurt him she wanted to hurt him very much just make him lose his head she encouraged herself suddenly there was the sound of gravel spraying the underside of the truck she closed her mouth fast around him but they were neither crashing nor turning off the road he was pulling abruptly to the roadside and stopping the truck stalled out he put both his hands on either side of her face his thighs hardened and slapped against her jaw im going to choke on it she thought but he was lifting her face up out of his lap no no he cried a truck flinging tiny stones tore by them and cut into his words i dont have the thing on he said to her if you have any germs theyll swim right up me hope sat on her knees her lips hot and sore her nose throbbing he was going to put on a rubber but when he tore it from its little tinfoil package he stared at it as if it wasnt at all what he expected to seeas if he thought they were bright green as if he didnt know how to put it on take your dress off he said he was embarrassed that she was looking at him she could see the cornfields on either side of the road and the back side of a billboard a few yards away from them but there were no houses no signs no intersecting roads no cars and trucks were coming she thought her heart would simply stop oren rath tore himself out of her husbands shirt he threw it out his window hope saw it flap in the road he scraped his boots off on the brake pedal whacking his narrow blond knees on the steering wheel shove over he said she was wedged against the passengerside door she kneweven if she could get out the doorthat she couldnt outrun him she didnt have any shoesand his feet appeared to have a dogs rough pads he was having trouble with his pants he clutched the rolledup rubber in his teeth then he was nakedhed flung his pants somewhereand he shoved the rubber down over himself as if his penis were no more sensitive than a turtles leathery tail she was trying to unbutton her dress and her tears were coming back though she was fighting them when he suddenly caught her dress and began to yank it over her head it caught on her arms he jerked her elbows painfully behind her back he was too long to fit in the cab one door had to be open she reached for the handle over her head but he bit her in the neck no he hollered he thrashed his feet aroundshe saw his shin was bleeding hed cut it on the rim of the hornand his hard heels struck the door handle on the drivers side with both feet he launched the door open she saw the gray smear of the road over his shoulderhis long ankles stuck out into the traffic lane but there was no traffic now her head hurt she was jammed against the door she had to wriggle herself back down the seat farther under him and her movement made him yell something unintelligible she felt his rubbered prick slipping over her stomach then his whole body braced and he bit into her shoulder fiercely hed come shit he cried i done it already no she said hugging him no you can do more she knew that if he thought he was through with her he would kill her much more she said in his ear which smelled like dust she had to wet her fingers to wet herself god ill never get him inside me she thought but when she found him with her hand she knew that the rubber was the lubricated kind oh he said he lay still on top of her he seemed surprised by where shed put him as if he didnt really know what was where oh he repeated oh what now hope wondered she held her breath a car a flash of red whined past their open doorthe horn blast and some muffled derisive hoots fading away from them of course she thought we look like two farmers fucking off the side of the road its probably done all the time no one will stop she thought unless its the police she imagined a breadfaced trooper appearing over roths lurching shoulder writing out a ticket not on the road buddy hed be saying and when she screamed at him rape hes raping me the trooper would wink at oren rath the bewildered rath seemed to be feeling rather cautiously for something inside her if hes just come hope thought how much time do i have before he comes again but he seemed more like a goat than a human to her and the babylike gurgle in his throat hot against her ear seemed close to the last sound she imagined shed hear she looked at everything she could see the keys dangling from the ignition were too for to reach and what could she do with a set of keys her back hurt and she pushed her hand against the dashboard to try to shift his weight on her this excited him and made him grunt against her dont move he said she tried to do what he said oh he said approvingly thats real good ill kill you quick you wont even know it you just do like that and ill kill you good her hand grazed a metal button smooth and round her fingers touched it and she did not even have to turn her face away from him and look at it to know what it was it opened the glove compartment and she pushed it the springrelease door was a sudden weight in her hand she said a long and loud aaahhh to conceal the sound of the things in the glove compartment that rattled around her hand touched cloth her fingers felt grit there was a spool of wire something sharp but too smallthings like screws and nails a bolt perhaps a hinge to something else there was nothing she could use reaching around in there was hurting her arm she let her hand trail to the floor of the cab when another truck passed themcatcalls and bloops from the air horn and no sign of even slowing down for a better lookshe started to cry i got to kill you rath moaned have you done this before she asked him sure he said and he thrust into herstupidly as if his brute lunges could impress her and did you kill them too hope asked her hand aimless now toyed with somethingsome materialon the floor of the cab they were animals rath admitted but i had to kill them too hope sickened her fingers clutched the thing on the flooran old jacket or something pigs she asked him pigs he cried shit nobody fucks pigs he told her hope thought that probably somebody did they was sheep rath said and one calf but this was hopeless she knew she felt him shrinking inside her she was distracting him she choked a sob that felt like it would split her head if it ever escaped her please try to be kind to me hope said dont talk any he said move like you did she moved but apparently not the right way no he shouted his fingers dug into her spine she tried moving another way yup he said he moved now determined and purposefulmechanical and dumb oh god hope thought oh nicky and dorsey then she felt what she held in her hand his pants and her fingers suddenly as wise as a braille readers located the zipper and moved on her fingers passed over the change in the pocket they slipped around the wide belt yup yup yup said oren rath sheep hope thought to herself and one calf oh please concentrate she cried aloud to herself dont talk said oren rath but now her hand held it the long hard leather sheath that is the little hook her fingers told her and that is the little metal clasp and thatoh yesis the head of the thing the bony handle of the fishermans knife he had used to cut her son nickys cut was not serious in fact everyone was trying to figure out how he got it nicky was not talking yet he enjoyed looking in the mirror at the thin halfmoon slit that was already closed must have been something very sharp the doctor told the police margot the neighbor had thought shed better call a doctor too shed found blood on the childs bib the police had found more blood in the bedroom a single drop on the creamwhite bedspread they were puzzled about it there was no other sign of violence and margot had seen mrs standish leave she had looked all right the blood was from hopes split lipfrom the time oren rath had butted herbut there was no way any of them could know that margot thought there might have been sex but she wasnt suggesting it dorsey standish was too shocked to think the police did not think there had been time for sex the doctor knew no blow had been connected with nickys cutprobably not even a fall a razor he suggested or a very sharp knife the police inspector a solidly round and florid man a year away from his retirement found the cut phone cord in the bedroom a knife he said a sharp knife with some weight to it his name was arden bensenhaver and he had once been a police superintendent in toledo but his methods had been judged as unorthodox he pointed at nickys cheek its a flick wound he said he demonstrated the proper wrist action but you dont see many flick knives around here bensenhaver told them its a flicktype of wound but its probably some kind of hunting or fishing knife margot had described oren rath as a farm kid in a farm truck except that the trucks color revealed the unnatural influence of the town and the university upon the farmers turquoise dorsey standish did not even associate this with the turquoise truck he had seen or the woman in the cab whom hed thought had resembled hope he still didnt understand anything did they leave a note he asked arden bensenhaver stared at him the doctor looked down at the floor you know about a ransom standish said he was a literal man struggling for a literal hold someone he thought had said kidnap wasnt there ransom in the case of kidnap theres no note mr standish bensenhaver told him it doesnt look like that kind of thing they were in the bedroom when i found nicky outside the door margot said but she was all right when she left dorsey i saw her they hadnt told standish about hopes panties discarded on the bedroom floor theyd been unable to find the matching bra margot had told arden bensenhaver that mrs standish was a woman who usually wore a bra she had left barefoot they knew that too and margot had recognized dorseys shirt on the farm kid shed got only a partial reading of the license plate it was an instate commercial plate and the first two numbers placed it within the county but she hadnt gotten them all the rear plate had been spattered with mud the front plate was missing well find them arden bensenhayer said theres not much in the way of turquoise trucks around here the county sheriffs boys will probably know it nicky what happened dorsey standish asked the boy he sat him on his lap what happened to mommy the child pointed out the window so he was going to rape her dorsey standish asked them all margot said dorsey lets wait until we know wait standish said you got to excuse me asking you said arden bensenhaver but your wife wasnt seeing anybody was she you know standish was mute at the question but it seemed as if he were importantly considering it no she wasnt margot told bensenhaver absolutely not i got to ask mr standish bensenhaver said god margot said no i dont think she was standish told the inspector of course she wasnt dorsey margot said lets go take nicky for a walk she said to him she was a busy businesslike woman whom hope liked very much she was in and out of the house five times a day she was always in the process of finishing something twice a year she had her phone disconnected and connected again it was like trying to stop smoking is for some people margot had children of her own but they were olderthey were in school all dayand she often watched nicky so that hope could do something by herself dorsey standish took margot for granted although he knew she was a kind and generous person those were not qualities that especially arrested his attention margot he realized now wasnt especially attractive either she was not sexually attractive he thought and a bitter feeling rose up in standish he thought that no one would ever try to rape margotwhereas hope was a beautiful woman anyone could see anyone would want her dorsey standish was all wrong about that he didnt know the first thing about rapethat the victim hardly ever matters at one time or another people have tried to force sex on almost anyone imaginable very small children very old people even dead people also animals inspector arden bensenhaver who knew a good deal about rape announced that he had to get on with his job bensenhaver felt better with lots of open space around him his first employment had been the nighttime beat in a squad car cruising old route between sandusky and toledo in the summers it was a road speckled with beer joints and little homemade signs promising bowling pool smoked fish and live bait and arden bensenhaver would drive slowly over sandusky bay and along lake erie to toledo waiting for the drunken carfuls of teenagers and fishermen to play chicken with him on that unlit twolane road later when he was the police superintendent of toledo bensenhaver would be driven in the daytime over that harmless stretch of road the bait shops and beer palaces and fastfood services looked so exposed in the daylight it was like watching a oncefeared bully strip down for a fight you saw the thick neck the dense chest the wristless armsand then when the last shirt was off you saw the sad helpless paunch arden bensenhaver hated the night bensenhavers big plea with the city government of toledo had been for better lighting on saturday nights toledo was a workingmans city and bensenhaver believed that if the city could afford to light itself brightly on saturday night half the gashings and maimingsthe general bodily abusingswould stop but toledo had thought the idea was dim toledo was as unimpressed with arden bensenhavers ideas as it was questioning of his methods now bensenhaver relaxed in all this open country he had a perspective on the dangerous world that he always wanted to have he was circling the flat open land in a helicopterabove it all the detached overseer observing his contained welllit kingdom the county deputy said to him theres only one truck around here thats turquoise its those damn raths raths bensenhaver asked theres a whole family of them the deputy said i hate going out there why bensenhaver asked below him he watched the shadow of the helicopter cross a creek cross a road move alongside a field of corn and a field of soybeans theyre all weird the deputy said bensenhaver looked at hima young man puffyfaced and smalleyed but pleasant his long hair hung in a hunk under his tight hat almost touching his shoulders bensenhaver thought of all the football players who wore their hair spilling out under their helmets they could braid it some of them he thought now even lawmen looked like this he was glad he was retiring soon he couldnt understand why so many people wanted to look the way they did weird said bensenhaver their language was all the same too he thought they used just four or five words for almost everything well i got a complaint about the younger one just last week the deputy said bensenhaver noted this casual use of ias in i got a complaintwhen in fact bensenhaver knew that the sheriff or his office would have received the complaint and that the sheriff probably thought it was simple enough to send this young deputy out on it but why did they give me such a young one for this bensenhaver wondered the youngest brothers name is oren the deputy said they all have weird names too what was the complaint bensenhayer asked his eyes followed a long dirt driveway to what appeared to be a random dropping of barns and outbuildings one of which he knew was the main farmhouse where the people lived but arden bensenhaver couldnt tell which one that might be to him all the buildings looked vaguely unfit for animals well the deputy said this kid oren was screwing around with someones dog was screwing around bensenhaver asked patiently that could mean anything he thought well the deputy said the people whose dog it was thought that oren was trying to fuck it was he bensenhayer asked probably the deputy said but i couldnt tell anything when i got there oren wasnt aroundand the dog looked all right i mean how could i tell if the dog had been fucked shouldve asked it said the copter pilota kid bensenhayer realized even younger than the deputy even the deputy looked at him with contempt one of these halfwits the national guard gives us the deputy whispered to bensenhaver but bensenhaver had spotted the turquoise truck it was parked out in the open alongside a low shed no attempt had been made to conceal it in a long pen a tide of pigs surged this way and that driven crazy by the hovering helicopter two lean men in overalls squatted over a pig that lay sprawled at the foot of a ramp to a barn they looked up at the helicopter shielding their faces from the stinging dirt not so close put it down over on the lawn bensenhaver told the pilot youre scaring the animals i dont see oren or the old man the deputy said theres more of them than those two you ask those two where oren is bensenhaver said i want to look at that truck the men obviously knew the deputy they hardly watched him approach but they watched bensenhaver in his dull duncolored suit and tie crossing the barnyard toward the turquoise pickup arden bensenhaver didnt look at them but he could see them just the same they are morons he thought bensenhaver had seen all kinds of bad men in toledovicious men unjustifiably angry men dangerous men cowardly and ballsy thieves men who murdered for money and men who murdered for sex but bensenhaver had not seen quite such benign corruption as he thought he saw on the faces of weldon and raspberry rath it gave him a chill he thought hed better find mrs standish quickly he didnt know what he was looking for when he opened the door of the turquoise pickup but arden bensenhaver knew how to look for unknowns he saw it immediatelyit was easy the slashed bra a piece of it still tied to the hinge of the glovecompartment door the other two pieces were on the floor there was no blood the bra was a soft natural beige very classy arden bensenhaver thought he had no style himself but hed seen dead people of all kinds and he could recognize something of a persons style in the clothes he put the pieces of the silky bra into one hand then he put both hands into the floppy stretched pockets of his suit jacket and started across the yard toward the deputy who was talking to the rath brothers they havent seen the kid all day the deputy told bensenhaver they say oren sometimes stays away overnight ask them whos the last one who drove that truck bensenhaver said to the deputy he wouldnt look at the raths he treated them as if they couldnt possibly understand him directly i already asked them that the deputy said they say they dont remember ask them whens the last time a pretty young woman rode in that truck bensenhaver said but the deputy didnt have time weldon rath laughed bensenhaver felt grateful that the one with the blotch on his face like a wine spill had kept quiet shit weldon said theres no pretty young woman around here no pretty young woman ever sat her ass in that truck tell him said bensenhaver to the deputy that he is a liar youre a liar weldon the deputy said raspberry rath said to the deputy shit who is he coming in here telling us what to do arden bensenhaver took the three pieces of the bra from his pocket he looked at the sow lying beside the men she had one frightened eye which appeared to be looking at all of them at once and it was hard to tell where her other eye was looking is that a boy pig or a girl pig asked bensenhaver the raths laughed anyone can see its a sow raspberry said do you ever cut the balls off the boy pigs bensenhover asked do you do that yourselves or do you have others do it for you we castrate them ourselves said weldon he looked a little like a boar himself with wild tufts of hair sprouting upward out of his ears we know all about castrating theres nothing to it well said bensenhaver holding up the bra for them and the deputy to see well thats exactly what the new law provides forin the case of these sexual crimes neither the deputy nor the roths spoke any sexual crime bensenhaver said is now punishable by castration if you fuck anybody you shouldnt said bensenhaver or if you assist in the act of getting a person fuckedby not helping us to stop itthen we can castrate you weldon rath looked at his brother raspberry who looked a little puzzled but weldon leered at bensenhaver and said you do it yourselves or do you have others do it for you he nudged his brother raspberry tried to grin pulling his birthmark askew but bensenhaver was deadpan turning the bra over and over in his hands of course we dont do it he said theres all new equipment for it now the national guard does it thats why we got the national guard helicopter we just fly you right out to the national guard hospital and fly you right back home again theres nothing to it he said as you know we have a big family raspberry rath said theres a lot of us brothers we dont know from one day to the next whos riding around in what truck theres another truck bensenhaver asked the deputy you didnt tell me there was another truck yeah its black i forgot the deputy said they have a black one too the raths nodded where is it bensenhaver asked he was contained but tense the brothers looked at each other weldon said i havent seen it in a while might be that oren has it said raspberry might be our father whos got it weldon said we dont have time for this shit bensenhaver told the deputy sharply well find out what they weighthen see if the pilot can carry them the deputy thought bensenhaver is almost as much of a moron as the brothers go on bensenhaver said to the deputy then with impatience he turned to weldon rath name he asked weldon weldon said weight bensenhaver asked weight said weldon what do you weigh bensenhaver asked him if were going to lug you off in the copter we got to know what you weigh oneeightysomething weldon said you bensenhaver asked the younger one oneninetysomething he said my names raspberry bensenhaver shut his eyes thats threeseventysomething bensenhaver told the deputy go ask the pilot if we can carry that youre not taking us anywhere now are you weldon asked well just take you to the national guard hospital bensenhaver said then if we find the woman and shes all right well take you home but if she aint all right we get a lawyer right raspberry asked bensenhaver one of those people in the courts right if who aint all right bensenhaver asked him well this woman youre looking for raspberry said well if shes not all right bensenhaver said then we already got you in the hospital and we can castrate you and send you back home the same day you boys know more about whats involved than i do he admitted ive never seen it done but it doesnt take long does it and it doesnt bleed much does it but theres courts and a lawyer raspberry said of course there is weldon said shut up no no more courts for this kind of thingnot with the new law bensenhover said sex crimes are special and with the new machines its just so easy to castrate someone that it makes the most sense yeah the deputy hollered from the helicopter the weights okay we can take them shit raspberry said shut up said weldon theyre not cutting my balls off raspberry yelled at him i didnt even get to have her weldon hit raspberry so hard in the stomach that the younger man pitched over sideways and landed on the prostrate pig it squealed its short legs spasmed it evacuated suddenly and horribly but otherwise it didnt move raspberry lay gasping beside the sows stenchful waste and arden bensenhaver tried to knee weldon rath in the balls weldon was too quick though he caught bensenhavers leg at the knee and tossed the old man over backwards over raspberry and the poor pig goddamnit bensenhaver said the deputy drew his gun and fired one shot in the air weldon dropped to his knees holding his ears you all right inspector the deputy asked yes of course i am bensenhaver said he sat beside the pig and raspberry he realized without the smallest touch of shame that he felt toward them more or less equally raspberry he said the name itself made bensenhaver close his eyes if you want to keep your balls on you tell us where the woman is the mans birthmark flashed at bensenhaver like a neon sign you keep still raspberry weldon said and bensenhaver told the deputy if he opens his mouth again shoot his balls off right here save us the trip then he hoped to god that the deputy was not so stupid that he would actually do it orens got her raspberry told bensenhaver he took the black truck whered he take her bensenhaver asked dont know raspberry said he took her for a ride was she all right when she left here bensenhaver asked well she was all right i guess raspberry said i mean i dont think oren had hurt her yet i dont think hed even had her yet why not bensenhaver asked well if hed already had her raspberry said why would he want to keep her bensenhaver again shut his eyes he got to his feet find out how long ago he told the deputy then fuck up that turquoise truck so they cant drive it then get your ass back to the copter and leave them here the deputy asked sure bensenhaver said therell be plenty of time to cut their balls off later arden bensenhaver had the pilot send a message that the abductors name was oren rath and that he was driving a black not a turquoise pickup this message meshed interestingly with another one a state trooper had received a report that a man all alone in a black pickup had been driving dangerously wandering in and out of his rightful driving lane looking like he was drunk or stoned or something else the trooper had not followed this up because at the time hed thought he was supposed to be more concerned about a turquoise pickup arden bensenhaver of course couldnt know that the man in the black pickup hadnt really been alonethat in fact hope standish had been lying with her head in his lap the news simply gave bensenhaver another of his chills if rath was alone he had already done something to the woman bensenhaver yelled to the deputy to hurry over to the copterthat they were looking for a black pickup that had last been seen on the bypass that intersects the system of county roads near the town called sweet wells know it bensenhaver asked oh yeah the deputy said they were in the air again below them the pigs once more in a panic the poor medicated pig that had been fallen on was lying as still as when theyd come but the rath brothers were fightingit appeared quite savagelyand the higher and farther from them that the helicopter moved the more the world returned to a level of sanity of which arden bensenhaver approved until the tiny fighting figures below and to the east were no more than miniatures to him and he was so far from their blood and fear that when the deputy said he thought that raspberry could whip weldon if raspberry just didnt allow himself to get scared bensenhaver laughed his toledo deadpan laugh theyre animals he said to the deputy who despite whatever young mans cruelty and cynicism were in him seemed a little shocked if they both killed each other bensenhaver said think of the food they would have eaten in their lifetimes that other human beings could now eat the deputy realized that bensenhavers lie about the new lawabout the instant castration for sexual crimeswas more than a farfetched story for bensenhaver although he knew it was clearly not the law it was what he thought the law should be it was one of arden bensenhavers toledo methods that poor woman bensenhaver said he wrung the pieces of her bra in his thickveined hands how old is this oren he asked the deputy sixteen maybe seventeen the deputy said just a kid the deputy was at least twentyfour himself if hes old enough to get a hardon arden bensenhover said hes old enough to have it cut off but what should i cut oh where can i cut him wondered hopethe long thin fishermans knife now snug in her hand her pulse thrummed in her palm but to hope it felt as if the knife had a heartbeat of its own she brought her hand very slowly up to her hip up over the edge of the thrashed seat to where she could glimpse the blade should i use the sawtoothed edge or the one that looks so sharp she thought how do you kill a man with one of these alongside the sweating swiveling ass of oren rath that knife in her hand was a cool and distant miracle do i slash him or stick him she wished she knew both his hot hands were under her buttocks lifting her jerking up his chin dug into the hollow near her collarbone like a heavy stone then she felt him slip one of his hands out from under her and his fingers reaching for the floor grazed her hand that held the knife move he grunted now move she tried to arch her back but couldnt she tried to twist her hips but she couldnt she felt him groping for his own peculiar rhythm trying to find the last pace that would make him come his handunder her nowspread over the small of her back his other hand clawed the floor then she knew he was looking for the knife and when his fingers found the empty sheath she would be in trouble aaahhh he cried quick she thought between the ribs into his sideand slide the knife upor straight down as hard as she could between the shoulder blades reaching all the way through his back to a lung until she felt the point of the thing poking her own crushed breast she waved her arm in the air above his hunching back she saw the oily blade glintand his hand suddenly rising flung his empty pants back toward the steering wheel he was trying to push himself up off her but his lower half was locked into his longsought rhythm his hips shuddered in little spasms he couldnt seem to control while his chest rose up off her chest and his hands shoved hard against her shoulders his thumbs crawled toward her throat my knife he asked his head whipped back and forth he looked behind him he looked above him his thumbs pried her chin up she was trying to hide her adams apple then she scissored his pale ass he could not stop pumping down there though his brain must have known there was suddenly another priority my knife he said and she reached over his shoulder and faster than she herself could see it happen she slid the slimedged side of the blade across his throat for a second she saw no wound she only knew that he was choking her then one of his hands left her throat and went to find his own he hid from her the gash shed expected to see but at last she saw the dark blood springing between his tight fingers he brought his hand awayhe was searching for her hand the one that held the knifeand from his slashed throat a great bubble burst over her she heard a sound like someone sucking the bottom of a drink with a clogged straw she could breathe again where were his hands she wondered they seemed at once to loll beside her on the seat and to be darting like panicked birds behind his back she stabbed the long blade into him just above his waist thinking that perhaps a kidney was there because the blade went in so easily and out again oren rath laid his cheek against her cheek like a child hed have screamed then of course but her first slash had cut cleanly through his windpipe and his vocal cords hope now tried the knife higher up but encountered a rib or something difficult she had to probe and unsatisfied withdrew the knife after only a few inches he was flopping on her now as if he wanted to get off her his body was sending distress signals to itself but the signals were not getting all the way through he heaved himself against the back of the seat but his head wouldnt stay up and his penis still moving attached him still to hope she took advantage of this opportunity to insert the knife again it slipped into his belly at the side and moved straightaway to within an inch of his navel before engaging some major obstruction thereand his body slumped back on top of her trapping her wrist but this was easy she twisted her hand and the slippery knife came free something to do with his bowels relaxed hope was overwhelmed with his wetness and with his smell she let the knife drop to the floor oren rath was emptying by quartfulsby gallons he felt actually lighter on top of her their bodies were so slick that she slipped out from under him easily she shoved him over on his back and crouched beside him on the trucks puddled floor hopes hair was gravid with bloodhis throat had fountained over her when she blinked her eyelashes stuck to her cheeks one of his hands twitched and she slapped it stop she said his knee rose then flopped down stop it stop now hope said she meant his heart his life she would not look at his face against the dark slime coating his body the white translucent condom hugged his shrunken cock like a congealed fluid quite foreign to the human matter of blood and bowel hope recalled a zoo and a gob of camel spit upon her crimson sweater his balls contracted that made her angry stop she hissed the balls were small and rounded and tight then they fell slack please stop she whispered please die there was a tiny sigh as if someone had let out a breath too small to bother taking back but hope squatted for some time beside him feeling her heart pound and confusing her pulse with his own he had died fairly quickly she realized later out the open door of the pickup oren raths clean white feet his drained toes pointed upward in the sunlight inside the sunbaked cab the blood was coagulating everything clotted hope standish felt the tiny hairs on her arms stiffen and tug her skin as her skin dried everything that was slick was turning sticky i should get dressed hope thought but something seemed wrong with the weather out the truck windows hope saw the sunlight flicker like a lamp whose light is shone through the blades of a fast fan and the gravel at the roadside was lifted up in little swirls and dry shards and stubble from last years corn were whisked along the flat bare ground as if a great wind was blowingbut not from the usual directions this wind appeared to be blowing straight down and the noise it was like being in the afterblow of a speeding truck but there was still no traffic on the road its a tornado hope thought she hated the midwest with its strange weather she was an easterner who could understand a hurricane but tornadoes shed never seen one but the weather forecasts were always full of tornado watches what does one watch for shed always wondered for this she guessedthis whirling din all around her these clods of earth flying the sun turned brown she was so angry she struck the cool viscid thigh of oren rath after she had lived through this now there was a fucking tornado too the noise resembled a train passing over the pelted truck hope imagined the funnel descending other trucks and cars already caught up in it somehow she could hear their engines were still running sand flew in the open door stuck to her glazed body she groped for her dressdiscovered the empty armholes where the sleeves had been it would have to do but she would have to step outside the truck to put it on there was no room to maneuver beside rath and his gore now dappled with roadside sand and out there she had no doubt her dress would be torn from her hands and she would be sucked up naked into the sky i am not sorry she whispered i am not sorry she screamed and again she struck at the body of rath then a voice a terrible voiceloud as the loudest loudspeakershook her in the cab if youre in there come out put your hands over your head come out climb into the back of the pickup and lie the fuck down i am actually dead thought hope im already in the sky and its the voice of god she was not religious and it seemed fitting to hope if there were a god god would have a bullying loudspeaker voice come out now god said do it now oh why not she thought you big fucker what can you do to me next rape was an outrage even god couldnt understand in the helicopter shuddering above the black truck arden bensenhaver barked into the megaphone he was sure that mrs standish was dead he could not tell the sex of the feet he saw protruding from the open door of the cab but the feet hadnt moved during the helicopters descent and they seemed so naked and drained of any color in the sunlight that bensenhaver was sure that they were dead feet that oren rath could be the one who was dead had not crossed the deputys or bensenhavers mind but they couldnt understand why rath would have abandoned the truck after performing his foul acts and so bensenhaver had told the pilot to hold the helicopter just above the pickup if hes still in there with her bensenhaver told the deputy maybe we can scare the bastard to death when hope standish brushed between those stiff feet and huddled alongside the cab trying to shield her eyes from the flying sand arden bensenhaver felt his finger go limp against the trigger of the megaphone hope tried to wrap her face in her flapping dress but it snapped around her like a torn sail she felt her way along the truck toward the tailgate cringing against the stinging gravel that clung to the places on her body where the blood hadnt quite dried its the woman the deputy said back off bensenhaver told the pilot jesus what happened to her the deputy asked frightened bensenhaver roughly handed him the megaphone move away he said to the pilot set this thing down across the road hope felt the wind shift and the clamor in the tornados funnel seemed to pass over her she kneeled at the side of the road her wild dress quieted in her hands she held it to her mouth because the dust was choking her a car come along but hope was unaware of it the driver passed in the proper lanethe black pickup off the road to his right the helicopter settling down off the road to his left the bloody praying woman naked and caked with grit took no notice of him driving past her the driver had a vision of an angel on a trip back from hell the drivers reaction was so delayed that he was a hundred yards beyond everything hed seen before he surprisingly attempted a uturn in the road without slowing down his front wheels caught the soft shoulder and slithered him across the road ditch and into the soft spring earth of a plowed bean field where his car sank up to his bumpers and he could not open his door he rolled down his window and peered across the mire to the roadlike a man whod been sitting peacefully on a dock when the dock broke free from the shore and he was drifting out to sea help he cried the vision of the woman had so terrified him that he feared there might be more like her around or that whoever had made her look that way might be in search of another victim jesus christ said arden bensenhaver to the pilot youll have to go see if that fool is all right why do they let everyone drive a car bensenhaver and the deputy dropped out of the helicopter and into the same lush muck that had trapped the driver goddamnit bensenhaver said mother said the deputy across the road hope standish looked up at them for the first time two swearing men were wallowing toward her out of a muddy field the blades of the helicopter were slowing down there was also a man peeping witlessly out the window of his car but that seemed far away hope stepped into her dress one armhole where a sleeve had been was torn open and hope had to pin a flap of material to her side with her elbow or else leave her breast exposed it was then that she noticed how sore her shoulders and her neck were arden bensenhaver out of breath and soaked with mud from his knees down was in front of her suddenly the mud made his trousers hug his legs so that to hope he looked like an old man wearing knickers mrs standish he asked she turned her back to him and hid her face nodding so much blood he said helplessly im sorry we took so long are you hurt she turned and stared at him he saw the swelling around both eyes and her broken noseand the blue bulge on her forehead its mostly his blood she said but i was raped he did it she told bensenhaver bensenhaver had his handkerchief out he seemed about to dab at her face with it as he might wipe the mouth of a child but then he despaired at what a job it would be to clean her up and he put his handkerchief away im sorry he said im so sorry we got here as fast as we could we saw your baby and hes fine bensenhaver said i had to put him in my mouth hope said to him bensenhaver shut his eyes and then he fucked me and fucked me she said he was going to kill me laterhe told me he would i had to kill him and im not sorry of course youre not bensenhaver said and you shouldnt be mrs standish im sure you did the very best thing she nodded her head to him then stared down at her feet she put one hand out toward bensenhavers shoulder and he let her lean against him though she was slightly taller than bensenhaver and in order to rest her head against him she had to scrunch down bensenhaver was aware of the deputy then he had been to the cab to look at oren rath and had vomited all over the trucks front fender and in full view of the pilot who was walking the shocked driver of the stuck car across the road the deputy with his face the bloodless color of oren raths sunlit feet was imploring bensenhaver to come see but bensenhaver wanted mrs standish to feel every possible reassurance so you killed him after he raped you when he was relaxed not paying attention he asked her no during she whispered against his neck the awful reek of her almost got to bensenhaver but he kept his face very close to her where he could hear her you mean while he was raping you mrs standish yes she whispered he was still inside me when i got his knife it was in his pants on the floor and he was going to use it on me when he was finished so i had to she said of course you did bensenhaver said it doesnt matter he meant that she should have killed him anywayeven if he hadnt been planning to kill her to arden bensenhaver there was no crime as serious as rapenot even murder except perhaps the murder of a child but he knew less about that he had no children of his own he had been married seven months when his pregnant wife had been raped in a laundromat while he waited outside for her in the car three kids had done it they had opened one of the big springdoored dryers and sat her ass on the open door pushed her head into the warm dryer where she could only scream into the hot muffling sheets and pillowcases and hear her own voice boom and bounce around the great metal drum her arms were in the dryer with her head so she was helpless her feet couldnt even reach the floor the spring door made her jounce up and down under all three of them although she probably tried not to move the boys had no idea of course that they were raping the police superintendents wife and all the bright lighting possible for downtown toledo on a saturday night would not have saved her they were an earlymorning couple the bensenhavers they were young still and they took their laundry to the laundromat together monday morning before breakfast they read the newspapers during the wash cycle then they put their laundry in the dryer and went home and had breakfast mrs bensenhaver picked it up on her way downtown to the police station with bensenhaver he would wait in the car while she went inside to get it sometimes someone would have taken it out of the dryer while they were having breakfast and mrs bensenhaver would have to run it for another few minutes bensenhaver then waited but they liked the early morning because there was rarely anyone else in the laundromat only when bensenhaver saw the three kids leaving did he start to worry about how long his wife had been collecting the dry laundry but it does not take very long to rape someone even three times bensenhaver went into the laundromat where he saw his wifes legs sticking out of the dryer her shoes had fallen off those were not the first dead feet bensenhaver had seen but they were very important feet to him she had suffocated in her own clean washor she had vomited and chokedbut they had not meant to kill her that part had been an accident and at the trial a great deal had been made of the unplanned nature of mrs bensenhavers death their attorney had said that the boys had planned to just rape hernot kill her too and the phrase just rapeas in she was just raped lucky thing a wonder she wasnt killedappalled arden bensenhaver its good that you killed him bensenhaver whispered to hope standish we couldnt have done nearly enough to him he confided to her nothing like he deserved good for you he whispered good for you hope had expected another sort of police experience a more critical investigationat least a more suspicious cop and certainly a man very different from arden bensenhaver she was so grateful for one thing that bensenhaverwas an old man clearly in his sixtieslike an uncle to her or even more sexually remote a grandfather she said she felt better that she was all right when she straightened up and stood away from him she saw she had smeared his shirt collar and his cheek with blood but bensenhaver hadnt noticed or didnt care okay show me bensenhaver said to the deputy but again he smiled gently at hope the deputy led him to the open cab oh my god the driver of the stuck car was saying dear jesus look at this and whats that christ look i think thats his liver isnt that what a liver looks like the pilot gawked in mute wonder and bensenhaver caught both men by their coat shoulders and steered them roughly away they started toward the rear of the truck where hope was composing herself but bensenhaver hissed at them stay away from mrs standish stay away from the truck go radio our position he told the pilot theyll need an ambulance or something here well take mrs standish with us theyll need a plastic bag for him said the deputy pointing to oren rath hes all over the place i can see with my own eyes said arden bensenhaver he looked inside the cab and whistled admiringly the deputy started to ask was he doing it when thats right said bensenhaver he put his hand into a horrible mess by the accelerator pedal but he didnt seem to mind he was reaching for the knife on the floor of the passengers side he picked it up in his handkerchief he looked it over carefully wrapped it in the handkerchief and put it in his pocket look the deputy whispered conspiratorially did you ever hear of a rapist wearing a rubber its not common bensenhaver said but its not unknown its weird to me said the deputy he looked amazed as bensenhaver pinched the prophylactic tight just below its bulge bensenhaver snapped the rubber off and held it without spilling a drop up to the light the sack was as large as a tennis ball it hadnt leaked it was full of blood bensenhaver looked satisfied he tied a knot in the condom the way youd knot a balloon and he flung it so far into the bean field that it was out of sight i dont want someone suggesting that it might not have been a rape bensenhayer said softly to the deputy got it he didnt wait for the deputy to answer bensenhaver went to the back of the truck to be with mrs standish how old was hethat boy hope asked bensenhaver old enough bensenhaver told her about twentyfive or twentysix he added he did not want anything to diminish her survivalparticularly in her own eyes he waved to the pilot who was to help mrs standish aboard then he went to clear things with the deputy you stay here with the body and the bad driver he told him im not a bad driver the driver whined christ if youd seen that lady therein the road and keep anyone away from the truck bensenhaver said on the road was the shirt belonging to mrs standishs husband bensenhaver picked it up and trotted to the helicopter in his funny overweight way of running the two men watched bensenhaver climb aboard the helicopter and rise away from them the weak spring sun seemed to leave with the copter and they were suddenly cold and didnt know where to go not in the truck certainly and sitting in the drivers car meant crossing that field of muck they went to the pickup lowered the tailgate and sat on it will he call a tow truck for my car the driver asked hell probably forget the deputy said he was thinking about bensenhaver he admired him but he feared him and he also thought that bensenhaver was not to be totally trusted there were questions of orthodoxy if thats what it was which the deputy had never considered mainly the deputy just had too many things to think about at one time the driver paced back and forth in the pickup which irritated the deputy because it jounced him on the tailgate the driver avoided the foul bunched blanket crammed in the corner next to the cab he cleared a seethrough spot on the dusted and caked rear window so that he could occasionally squint inside the cab at the rigid and disemboweled body of oren rath all the blood was dry now and through the mottled rear window the body looked to the driver to be similar in color and in gloss to an eggplant he went and sat down on the tailgate beside the deputy who got up walked back in the truck and peered in the window at the gashed corpse you know what the driver said even though she was all messed up you could tell what a really goodlooking woman she was yes you could the deputy agreed the driver now paced around in the back of the truck with him so the deputy went to the tailgate and sat down dont get sore the driver said im not sore the deputy said i dont mean that i can sympathize with anyone whod want to rape her you know the driver said i know what you dont mean said the deputy the deputy knew he was over his head in these matters but the simplemindedness of the driver forced the deputy to adopt what he imagined was bensenhayers attitude of contempt for him you see a lot of this huh the driver asked you know rape and murder enough the deputy said with selfconscious solemnity he had never seen a rape or murder before and he realized that even now he had not actually seen it through his own eyes as much as hed been treated to the experience through the eyes of arden bensenhaver he had seen rape and murder according to bensenhaver he thought the deputy felt very confused he sought some point of view all his own well said the driver peering in the rear window again i seen some stuff in the service but nothing like this the deputy couldnt respond the world according to bensenhaver this is like war i guess the driver said this is like a bad hospital the deputy wondered if he should let the fool look at raths body if it mattered or not and to whom certainly it couldnt matter to rath but to his unreal family to the deputyhe didnt know and would bensenhaver object hey dont mind my asking you a personal question the driver said dont get sore okay okay said the deputy well the driver said what happened to the rubber what rubber asked the deputy he might have had some questions concerning bensenhavers sanity but the deputy had no doubt that in this case bensenhaver had been right in the world according to bensenhaver no trivial detail should make less of rapes outrage hope standish at that moment felt safe at last in bensenhavers world she floated and dipped over the farmlands beside him trying not to be sick she was beginning to notice things about her body againshe could smell herself and feel every sore spot she felt such disgust but here was this cheerful policeman who sat there admiring herhis heart touched by her violent success are you married mr bensenhaver she asked him yes mrs standish he said i am youve been awfully nice hope told him but i think im going to be sick now oh sure said bensenhaver he grabbed a waxy paper bag at his feet it was the pilots lunch bag there were some uneaten frenchfried potatoes at the bottom and the grease had turned the waxed paper translucent bensenhaver could see his own hand through the french fries and through the bottom of the bag here he said you go right ahead she was already retching she took the bag from him and turned her head away the bag did not feel big enough to contain what vileness she was sure she held inside her she felt bensenhavers hard heavy hand on her back with his other hand he held a strand of her matted hair out of her way thats right he encouraged her keep it coming get it all out and youll feel much better hope recalled that whenever nicky was being sick she told him the same thing she marveled how bensenhaver could even turn her vomiting into a victory but she did feel much betterthe rhythmic heaving was as soothing to her as his calm dry hands holding her head and patting her back when the bag ripped and spilled bensenhaver said good riddance mrs standish you dont need the bag this is a national guard helicopter well let the national guard clean it up after allwhats the national guard for the pilot flew on grimly his expression never changing what a day its been for you mrs standish bensenhaver went on your husband is going to be so proud of you but bensenhaver was thinking that hed better make sure hed better have a talk with the man it was arden bensenhavers experience that husbands and other people did not always take a rape in the right way the first assassin what do you mean this is chapter one garps editor john wolf wrote him how can there be any more of this there is entirely too much as it stands how can you possibly go on it goes on garp wrote back youll see i dont want to see john wolf told garp on the phone please drop it at least put it aside why dont you take a trip it would be good for youand for helen im sure and duncan can travel now cant he but garp not only insisted that the world according to bensenhaver was going to be a novel he insisted that john wolf try to sell the first chapter to a magazine garp had never had an agent john wolf was the first man to deal with garps writing and he managed everything for him just as he managed everything for jenny fields sell it john wolf said yes sell it garp said advance publicity for the novel this had happened with garps first two books excerpts had been sold to magazines but john wolf tried to tell garp that this chapter was unpublishable and the worst possible publicityshould anyone be fool enough to publish it he said that garp had a small but serious reputation as a writer that his first two novels had been decently reviewedhad won him respected supporters and a small but serious audience garp said he hated the reputation of small but serious though he could see that this appealed to john wolf i would rather be rich and wholly outside caring about what the idiots call serious he told john wolf but who is ever outside caring about that garp actually felt that he could buy a sort of isolation from the real and terrible world he imagined a kind of fort where he and duncan and helen and a new baby could live unmolested even untouched by what he called the rest of life what are you talking about john wolf asked him helen asked him too and so did jenny but jenny fields liked the first chapter of the world according to bensenhaver she thought it had all its priorities in orderthat it knew whom to heroize in such a situation that it expressed the necessary outrage that it made properly grotesque the vileness of lust actually jennys fondness for the first chapter was more troubling to garp than john wolfs criticism garp suspected his mothers literary judgment above all things my god look at her book he kept saying to helen but helen as she promised would not allow herself to be drawn in she would not read garps new novel not one word of it why does he suddenly want to be rich john wolf asked helen whats all this about i dont know helen said i think he believes it will protect him and all of us from what john wolf said from whom youll have to wait until you read the whole book garp said to his editor every business is a shitty business i am trying to treat this book like business and i want you to treat it that way too i dont care if you like it i want you to sell it i am not a vulgar publisher john wolf said and you are not a vulgar writer either im sorry i have to remind you john wolfs feelings were hurt and he was angry at garp for presuming to talk about a business that john wolf understood far better than garp but he knew garp had been through a bad time he knew garp was a good writer who would write more and he thought better books and he wanted to continue publishing him every business is a shitty business garp repeated if you think the book is vulgar then you should have no trouble selling it thats not the only way it works wolf said sadly no one knows what makes books sell ive heard that before garp said you have no call to speak to me like this john wolf said im your friend garp knew that was true so he hung up the telephone and answered no mail and finished the world according to bensenhaver two weeks before helen delivered with only jennys help their third childa daughter who spared helen and garp the problem of having to agree upon a boys name that in no way resembled the name of walt the daughter was named jenny garp which was the name jenny fields would have had if she had gone about the business of having garp in a more conventional way jenny was delighted to have someone at least partially named after her but theres going to be some confusion she warned with two of us around ive always called you mom garp reminded her he did not remind his mother that a fashion designer had already named a dress after her it was popular in new york for about a year a white nurses uniform with a bright red heart sewn over the left breast a jenny fields original the heart said when jenny garp was born helen said nothing helen was grateful she felt for the first time since the accident that she was delivered from the insanity of grief that had crushed her with the loss of walt the world according to bensenhaver which was garps deliverance from the same insanity resided in new york where john wolf read it over and over again he had arranged to have the first chapter published in a porno magazine of such loathsome crudity that he felt sure even garp would be convinced of the books doom the magazine was called crotch shots and it was full of exactly thatthose wet split beavers of garps childhood between the pages of his story of violent rape and obvious revenge at first garp accused john wolf of deliberately placing the chapter there of not even trying the better magazines but wolf assured garp that he had tried them all that this was the bottom line of the listthis was exactly how garps story was interpreted lurid sensational violence and sex of no redeeming value whatsoever thats not what its about garp said youll see but garp often wondered about the first chapter of the world according to bensenhaver which had been published in crotch shots if it had been read at all if anyone who bought those magazines ever looked at the words perhaps they read some of the stories after they masturbate to the pictures garp wrote to john wolf he wondered if that was a good mood to be read in after masturbation the reader was at least relaxed possibly lonely a good state in which to read garp told john wolf but maybe the reader felt guilty too and humiliated and overwhelmingly responsible that was not such a good condition in which to read garp thought in fact he knew it was not a good condition in which to write the world according to bensenhaver is about the impossible desire of the husband dorsey standish to protect his wife and child from the brutal world thus arden bensenhaver who is forced to retire from the police for repeated unorthodoxy in his methods of arrest is hired to live like an armed uncle in the house with the standish familyhe becomes the lovable family bodyguard whom hope must finally reject though the worst of the real world has been visited upon hope it is her husband who fears the world most after hope insists that bensenhaver not live with them standish continues to support the old policeman as a kind of hovering angel bensenhaver is paid to tail the child nicky but bensenhaver is an aloof and curious kind of watchdog subject to fits of his own awful memories he gradually seems more of a menace to the standishes than he seems a protector he is described as a lurker at the last edge of lighta retired enforcer barely alive on the rim of darkness hope counters her husbands anxiety by insisting they have a second child the child is born but standish seems destined to create one monster of paranoia after another now more relaxed about possible assaults upon his wife and children he begins to suspect that hope is having an affair slowly he realizes that this would wound him more than if she were raped again thus he doubts his love for her and doubts himself guiltily he begs bensenhaver to spy on hope and determine if she is faithful but arden bensenhaver will no longer do dorseys worry work for him the old policeman argues that he was hired to protect standishs family from the outside worldnot to restrict the free choices of the family to live as it wants without bensenhavers support dorsey standish panics one night he leaves the house and the children unprotected while he goes out to spy on his wife while dorsey is gone the younger child chokes to death on a piece of nickys chewing gum guilt abounds in garps work guilt always abounds with hope toobecause she was seeing someone although who could blame her bensenhaver morbid with responsibility has a stroke partially paralyzed he moves back in with the standishes dorsey feels responsible for him hope insists they have another child but the events have made standish determinedly sterile he agrees that hope should encourage her loverbut merely to impregnate herself as he puts it ironically this was the only part of the book that jenny fields called farfetched once again dorsey standish seeks a control situationmore like a laboratory experiment at life than life itself garp wrote hope cannot adjust to such a clinical arrangement emotionally either she has a lover or she doesnt insisting that the lovers meet for the sole purpose of impregnating hope dorsey tries to control the whereabouts the number and length of their meetings suspecting that hope is meeting her lover clandestinely as well as according to plan standish alerts the senile bensenhaver to the existence of a prowler a potential kidnapper and rapist whose presence in the neighborhood has already been detected still not satisfied dorsey standish takes to sudden unannounced visits at his own house at times when hes least expected home he never catches hope at anything but bensenhaver armed and deadly with senility catches dorsey a cunning invalid arden bensenhaver is surprisingly mobile and silent in his wheelchair he is also still unorthodox in his methods of arrest in fact bensenhaver shoots dorsey standish with a twelvegauge shotgun from a distance of less than six feet dorsey had been hiding in the upstairs cedar closet stumbling among his wifes shoes waiting for her to make a phone call from the bedroom whichfrom the closethe could overhear he deserves to be shot of course the wound is fatal arden bensenhaver thoroughly mad is taken away hope is pregnant with her lovers child when the child is born nickynow twelvefeels unburdened by the relaxing tension in the family the terrible anxiety of dorsey standish which has been so crippling to all their lives is at last lifted from them hope and her children live on even cheerfully dealing with the wild rantings of old bensenhaver too tough to die who goes on and on with his versions of the nightmarish world from his wheelchair in an oldage home for the criminally insane he is seen finally as belonging where he is hope and her children visit him often not merely out of kindnessfor they are kindbut also to remind themselves of their own precious sanity hopes endurance and the survival of her two children make the old mans ravings tolerable finally even comic to her that peculiar oldage home for the criminally insane by the way bears an astonishing resemblance to jenny fields hospital for wounded women at dogs head harbor it is not so much that the world according to bensenhaver is wrong or even misperceived as it is out of proportion to the worlds need for sensual pleasure and the worlds need and capacity for warmth dorsey standish is not true to the world either he is too vulnerable to how delicately he loves his wife and children he is seen together with bensenhaver as not well suited for life on this planet where immunity counts hopeand the reader hopes her childrenmay have better chances somehow implicit in the novel is the sense that women are better equipped than men at enduring fear and brutality and at containing the anxiousness of feeling how vulnerable we are to the people we love hope is seen as a strong survivor of a weak mans world john wolf sat in new york hoping that the visceral reality of garps language and the intensity of garps characters somehow rescued the book from sheer soap opera but wolf thought one might as well call the thing anxiousness of life it would make a fantastic series for daytime television he thoughtif suitably edited for invalids senior citizens and preschool children john wolf concluded that the world according to bensenhaver despite the visceral reality of garps language and so forth was an xrated soap opera much later of course even garp would agree it was his worst work but the fucking world never gave me credit for the first two he wrote to john wolf thus i was owed that garp felt was the way it worked most of the time john wolf was more basically concerned that is he wondered if he could justify the books publication with books he did not absolutely take to john wolf had a system that rarely failed him at his publishing house he was envied for his record of being right about those books destined to be popular when he said a book was going to be populardistinct from being good or likable or nothe was almost always right there were many books that were popular without his saying so of course but no book hed ever claimed would be popular was ever unpopular nobody knew how he did it he did it first for jenny fieldsand for certain surprising books every year or two he had been doing it ever since there was a woman who worked in the publishing house who once told john wolf that she never read a book that didnt make her want to close it and go to sleep she was a challenge to john wolf who loved books and he spent many years giving this woman good books and bad books to read the books were alike in that they put this woman to sleep she just didnt like to read she told john wolf but he would not give up on her no one else in the publishing house ever asked this woman to read anything at all in fact they never asked this womans opinion of anything the woman moved through the books lying all around the publishing house as if these books were ashtrays and she was a nonsmoker she was a cleaning woman every day she emptied the wastebaskets she cleaned everyones office when they went home at night she vacuumed the rugs in the corridors every monday she dusted the display cases every tuesday and the secretaries desks on wednesdays she scrubbed the bathrooms on thursdays and sprayed air freshener on everything on fridaysso that she told john wolf the entire publishing house had the whole weekend to gather up a good smell for the next week john wolf had watched her for years and hed never seen her so much as glance at a book when he asked her about books and she told him how unlikable they were to her he kept using her to test books he wasnt sure ofand the books he thought he was very sure of too she was consistent in her dislike of books and john wolf had almost given up on her when he gave her the manuscript of a sexual suspect the autobiography of jenny fields the cleaning woman read it overnight and asked john wolf if she could have a copy of her very own to readover and over againwhen the book was published after that john wolf sought her opinion scrupulously she did not disappoint him she did not like most things but when she liked something it meant to john wolf that nearly everybody else was at least sure to be able to read it it was almost by rote that john wolf gave the cleaning woman the world according to bensenhaver then he went home for the weekend and thought about it he tried to call her and tell her not even to try to read it he remembered the first chapter and he didnt want to offend the woman who was somebodys grandmother and of course somebodys mother tooand after all she never knew she was paid to read all the stuff john wolf gave her to read that she had a rather whopping salary for a cleaning lady was known only to john wolf the woman thought all good cleaning ladies were well paid and should be her name was jillsy sloper and john wolf marveled to note that there was not one sloper with even the first initial of j in the new york phone directory apparently jillsy didnt like phone calls any more than she liked books john wolf made a note to apologize to jillsy the first thing monday morning he spent the rest of a miserable weekend trying to phrase to himself exactly how he would tell t s garp that he believed it was in his own best interests and certainly in the best interests of the publishing house not to publish the world according to bensenhaver it was a hard weekend for him because john wolf liked garp and he believed in garp and he also knew that garp had no friends who could advise him against embarrassing himselfwhich is one of the valuable things friends are for there was only alice fletcher who so loved garp that she would love indiscriminately everything he utteredor else she would be silent and there was roberta muldoon whose literary judgment john wolf suspected was even more newfound and awkward if existent at all than her adopted sex and helen wouldnt read it and jenny fields john wolf knew was not biased toward her son in the way a mother is usually biased she had demonstrated the dubious taste to dislike some of the better things her son had written the problem with jenny john wolf knew was one of subject matter a book about an important subject was to jenny fields an important book and jenny fields thought that garps new book was all about the stupid male anxieties that women are asked to suffer and endure how a book was written never mattered to jenny that was one thread that interested john wolf in publishing the book if jenny fields liked the world according to bensenhaver it was at least a potentially controversial book but john wolf like garp knew that jennys status as a political figure was due largely to a general hazy misunderstanding of jenny wolf thought and thought about it all weekend and he completely forgot to apologize to jillsy sloper the first thing monday morning suddenly there was jillsy redeyed and twitching like a squirrel the ratted manuscript pages of the world according to bensenhaver held fast in her rough brown hands lawd jillsy said she rolled her eyes she shook the manuscript in her hands oh jillsy john wolf said im sorry lawd jillsy crowed i never had a worse weekend i got no sleep i got no food i got no trips to the cemetery to see my family and my friends the pattern of jillsy slopers weekend seemed strange to john wolf but he said nothing he just listened to her as he had listened to her for more than a dozen years this mans crazy jillsy said nobody sane ever wrote a book like this i shouldnt have given it to you jillsy john wolf said i should have remembered that first chapter first chapter aint so bad jillsy said that first chapter aint nothin its that nineteenth chapter that got me jillsy said lawd lawd she crowed you read nineteen chapters john wolf asked you didnt give me no more than nineteen chapters jillsy said jesus lawd is there another chapter do it keep goin on no no john wolf said thats the end of it thats all there is i should hope so jillsy said aint nothin left to go on with got that crazy old cop where he belongsat long lastand that crazy husband with his head blowed off thats the only proper state for that husbands head if you ask me blowed off you read it john wolf said lawd jills screamed youd think it was him who got raped the way he went on and on if you ask me jillsy said thats just like men rape you half to death one minute and the next minute go crazy fussin over who youre givin it toof your own free will its not their damn business either way is it jillsy asked im not sure said john wolf who sat bewildered at his desk you didnt like the book like it jillsy cawed theres nothin to like about it she said but you read it john wolf said whyd you read it lawd jillsy said as if she were sorry for john wolfthat he was so hopelessly stupid i sometimes wonder if you know the first thing about all these books youre makin she said she shook her head i sometimes wonder why youre the one whos makin the books and im the one whos cleanin the bathrooms except id rather clean the bathrooms than read most of them jillsy said lawd lawd if you hated it whyd you read it jillsy john wolf asked her same reason i read anythin for jillsy said to find out what happens john wolf stared at her most books you know nothins gonna happen jillsy said lawd you know that other books she said you know just whats gonna happen so you dont have to read them either but this book jillsy said this books so sick you know somethins gonna happen but you cant imagine what you got to be sick yourself to imagine what happens in this book jillsy said so you read it to find out john wolf said there surely aint no other reason to read a book is there jillsy sloper said she put the manuscript heavily for it was large on john wolfs desk and hitched up the long extension cord for the vacuum cleaner which jillsy wore on mondays like a belt around her broad middle when its a book she said pointing to the manuscript id be happy if i could have a copy of my own if its okay she added you want a copy john wolf asked if its no trouble jillsy said now that you know what happens john wolf said what would you want to read it again for well jillsy said she looked confused john wolf had never seen jillsy sloper look confused beforeonly sleepy well i might lend it she said there might be someone i know who needs to be reminded what men in this world is like she said would you ever read it again yourself john wolf asked well jillsy said not all of it i imagine at least not all at once or not right away again she looked confused well she said sheepishly i guess i mean theres parts of it i wouldnt mind readin again why john wolf asked lawd jillsy said tiredly as if she were finally impatient with him it feels so true she crooned making the word true cry like a loon over a lake at night it feels so true john wolf repeated lawd dont you know it is jillsy asked him if you dont know when a books true jillsy sang to him we really ought to trade jobs she laughed now the stout threepronged plug for the vacuumcleaner cord clutched like a gun in her fist i do wonder mr wolf she said sweetly if youd know when a bathroom was clean she went over and peered in his wastebasket or when a wastebasket was empty she said a book feels true when it feels true she said to him impatiently a books true when you can say yeah thats just how damn people behave all the time then you know its true jillsy said leaning over the wastebasket she seized the one scrap of paper lying alone on the bottom of the basket she stuffed it into her cleaning apron it was the crumpledup first page of the letter john wolf had tried to compose to garp months later when the world according to bensenhaver was going to the printers garp complained to john wolf that there was no one to dedicate the book to he would not have it in memory of walt because garp hated that kind of thing that cheap capitalizing as he called it on ones autobiographical accidentsto try to hook the reader into thinking youre a more serious writer than you are and he would not dedicate a book to his mother because he hated as he called it the free ride everyone else gets on the name of jenny fields helen of course was out of the question and garp felt with some shame that he couldnt dedicate a book to duncan if it was a book he would not allow duncan to read the child wasnt old enough he felt some distaste as a father for writing something he would forbid his own children to read the fletchers he knew would be uncomfortable with a book dedicated to them as a couple and to dedicate a book to alice alone might be insulting to harry not to me john wolf said not this one i wasnt thinking of you garp lied how about roberta muldoon john wolf said the book has absolutely nothing to do with roberta garp said though garp knew that roberta at least wouldnt object to the dedication how funny to write a book really no one would like to have dedicated to them maybe ill dedicate it to the ellen jamesians garp said bitterly dont make trouble for yourself john wolf said thats just plain stupid garp sulked for mrs ralph he thought but he still didnt know her real name there was helens fatherhis good old wrestling coach ernie holmbut ernie wouldnt understand the gesture it would hardly be a book ernie would like garp hoped in fact that ernie wouldnt read it how funny to write a book you hope someone doesnt read to fat stew he thought for michael milton in memory of bonkers he bogged down he could think of no one i know someone john wolf said i could ask her if shed mind very funny garp said but john wolf was thinking of jillsy sloper the person he knew who was responsible for getting this book of garps published at all shes a very special woman who loved the book john wolf told garp she said it was so true garp was interested in the idea i gave her the manuscript for one weekend john wolf said and she couldnt put it down whyd you give her the manuscript garp asked she just seemed right for it john wolf said a good editor will not share all his secrets with anyone well okay garp said it seems naked having no one tell her id appreciate it shes a close friend of yours garp asked garps editor winked at him and garp nodded whats it all mean anyway jillsy sloper asked john wolf suspiciously whats it mean he wants to dedicate that terrible book to me it means that your response was valuable to him john wolf said he thinks the book was written almost with you in mind lawd jillsy said with me in mind whats that mean i told him how you responded to his book john wolf said and he thinks youre the perfect audience i guess the perfect audience jillsy said lawd he is crazy isnt he hes got no one else to dedicate it to john wolf admitted kind of like needin a witness for a weddin jillsy sloper asked kind of john wolf guessed it dont mean i approve of the book jillsy asked lord no john wolf said lawd no huh jillsy said no ones going to blame you for anything in the book if thats what you mean john wolf said well said jillsy john wolf showed jillsy where the dedication would be he showed her other dedications in other books they all looked nice to jillsy sloper and she nodded her head gradually pleased by the idea one thing she said i wont have to meet him or anythin will i lord no said john wolf so jillsy agreed there remained only one more stroke of genius to launch the world according to bensenhaver into that uncanny halflight where occasional serious books glow for a time as also popular books john wolf was a smart and cynical man he knew about all the shitty autobiographical associations that make those rabid readers of gossip warm to an occasional fiction years later helen would remark that the success of the world according to bensenhaver lay entirely in the book jacket john wolf was in the habit of letting garp write his own jacket flaps but garps description of his own book was so ponderous and glum that john wolf took matters into his own hands he went straight to the dubious heart of the matter the world according to bensenhaver the book jacket flap said is about a man who is so fearful of bad things happening to his loved ones that he creates an atmosphere of such tension that bad things are almost certain to occur and they do t s garp the jacket flap went on is the only child of the noted feminist jenny fields john wolf shivered slightly when he saw this in print because although he had written it and although he knew very well why he had written it he also knew that it was information garp never wanted mentioned in connection with his own work t s garp is also a father the jacket flap said and john wolf shook his head in shame to see the garbage he had written there he is a father who has recently suffered the tragic loss of a fiveyearold son out of the anguish that a father endures in the aftermath of an accident this tortured novel emerges and so forth it was in garps opinion the cheapest reason to read of all garp always said that the question he most hated to be asked about his work was how much of it was truehow much of it was based on personal experience truenot in the good way that jillsy sloper used it but true as in real life usually with great patience and restraint garp would say that the autobiographical basisif there even was onewas the least interesting level on which to read a novel he would always say that the art of fiction was the act of imagining trulywas like any art a process of selection memories and personal historiesall the recollected traumas of our unmemorable liveswere suspicious models for fiction garp would say fiction has to be better made than life garp wrote and he consistently detested what he called the phony mileage of personal hardshipwriters whose books were important because something important had happened in their lives he wrote that the worst reason for anything being part of a novel was that it really happened everything has really happened sometime he fumed the only reason for something to happen in a novel is that its the perfect thing to have happen at that time tell me anything thats ever happened to you garp told an interviewer once and i can improve upon the story i can make the details better than they were the interviewer a divorced woman with four young children one of whom was dying of cancer had her face firmly fixed in disbelief garp saw her determined unhappiness and its terrible importance to her and he said to her gently if its sadeven if its very sadi can make up a story thats sadder but he saw in her face that she would never believe him she wasnt even writing it down it wouldnt even be a part of her interview and john wolf knew this one of the first things most readers want to know is everything they can about a writers life john wolf wrote garp for most people with limited imaginations the idea of improving on reality is pure bunk on the book jacket flap of the world according to bensenhaver john wolf created a bogus sense of garps importance the only child of the noted feminist jenny fields and a sentimental sympathy for garps personal experience the tragic loss of a fiveyearold son that both pieces of information were essentially irrelevant to the art of garps novel did not deeply concern john wolf garp had made john wolf sore with all his talk about preferring riches to seriousness its not your best book john wolf wrote garp when he sent the galleys for garp to proofread one day youll know that too but it is going to be your biggest book just wait and see you cant imagine yet how youre going to hate many of the reasons for your success so i advise you to leave the country for a few months i advise you to read only the reviews i send to you and when it blows overbecause everything blows overyou can come back home and pick up your considerable surprise at the bank and you can hope that bensenhavers popularity is big enough to make people go back and read the first two novelsfor which you deserve to be better known tell helen i am sorry garp but i think you must know i have always had your own interests at heart if you want to sell this book well sell it every business is a shitty business garp i am quoting you garp was very puzzled by the letter john wolf of course had not shown him the jacket flaps why are you sorry garp wrote back dont weep just sell it every business is a shitty business wolf repeated i know i know garp said take my advice wolf said i like reading the reviews garp protested not these you wont john wolf said take a trip please then john wolf sent the jacket flap copy to jenny fields he asked her for her confidence and her help in getting garp to leave the country leave the country jenny said to her son its the best thing you can do for yourself and your family helen was actually keen on the idea shed never been abroad duncan had read his fathers first story the pension grillparzer and he wanted to go to vienna viennas not really like that garp told duncan but it touched garp very much that the boy liked the old story garp liked it too in fact he was beginning to wish that he liked everything else he had written half as much with a new baby why go to europe garp complained i dont know its complicated the passportsand the baby will need lots of shots or something you need some shots yourself said jenny fields the baby will be perfectly safe dont you want to see vienna again helen asked garp ah just imagine the scene of your old crimes john wolf said heartily old crimes garp mumbled i dont know please dad duncan said garp was a sucker to what duncan wanted he agreed helen cheered up and even took a glance at the galleys of the world according to bensenhaver though it was a quick nervous glance and she had no intention of doing any real reading therein the first thing she saw was the dedication for jillsy sloper who in gods name is jillsy sloper she asked garp i dont know really garp said helen frowned at him no really he said its some girl friend of johns he said she loved the bookcouldnt put it down wolf took it as a kind of omen i guess it was his suggestion anyway garp said and i thought it was nice hm said helen she put the galleys aside they both imagined john wolfs girl friend in silence john wolf had been divorced before they met him though the garps had gotten to meet some of wolfs grownup children they had never met his first and only wife there had been a conservative number of girl friends all smart and sleekly attractive womenall younger than john wolf some working girls in the publishing business but mostly young women with divorces of their own and moneyalways money or always the look of money garp remembered most of them by how nicely they smelled and how their lipstick tastedand the highgloss touchable quality of their clothes neither garp nor helen could ever have imagined jillsy sloper the offspring of a white person and a quadroonwhich made jillsy an octoroon or one eighth negro her skin was a sallow brown like a lightly stained pine board her hair was straight and short and waxyblack beginning to gray at her bangs which were coarsely chopped above her shining wrinkled forehead she was short with long arms and her ring finger was missing from her left hand by the deep scar on her right cheek one could imagine that the ring finger had been cut off in the same battle by the same weaponperhaps during a bad marriage for she had certainly had a bad marriage which she never spoke of she was about fortyfive and looked sixty she had the trunk of a labrador retriever about to have puppies and she shuffled whenever and wherever she walked because her feet killed her in a few years she would so long ignore the lump she could feel in her own breast which no one else ever felt that she would die needlessly of cancer she had an unlisted phone number as john discovered only because her former husband threatened to kill her every few months and she tired of hearing from him the reason she had a phone at all was that her children needed a place to call collect so that they could ask her to send them money but helen and garp when they imagined jillsy sloper did not for a moment see anyone approximating this sad hardworking octoroon john wolf seems to be doing everything for this book except writing it helen said i wish he had written it garp suddenly said garp had reread the book and he felt full of doubt in the pension grillparzer garp thought there was a certainty concerning how the world behaved in the world according to bensenhaver garp had felt less certainan indication he was getting older of course but artists he knew should also get better with baby jenny and oneeyed duncan garp and helen left for europe out of a cool new england august most transatlantic travelers were headed the other way why not wait until after thanksgiving ernie holm asked them but the world according to bensenhaver would be published in october john wolf had received various responses to the uncorrected proofs he circulated through the summer they had all been enthusiastic responsesenthusiastically praising the book or enthusiastically condemning it hed had difficulty keeping garp from seeing the advance copies of the actual bookthe book jacket for example but garps own enthusiasm for the book was so sporadic and generally low that john wolf had been able to stall him garp was now excited about the trip and he was talking about other books he was going to write a good sign john wolf told helen jenny and roberta drove the garps to boston where they took a plane to new york dont worry about the airplane jenny said it wont fall jesus mom garp said what do you know about airplanes they fall all the time keep your arms in constant motion like wings roberta told duncan dont scare him roberta helen said im not scared duncan said if your father keeps talking you cant fall jenny said if he keeps talking helen said well never land they could see that garp was all wound up ill fart all the way if you dont leave me alone garp said and well go in a great explosion you better write often jenny said remembering dear old tinch and his last trip to europe garp told his mother this time im just going to abababsorb a lot mom im not going to write a wwword they both laughed at this and jenny fields even cried a little although only garp noticed he kissed his mother goodbye roberta whose sex reassignment had made her a dynamite kisser kissed everyone several times jesus roberta garp said ill look after the old girl while youre gone roberta said her giant arm dwarfing jenny who looked so small and suddenly very gray beside her i dont need any looking after jenny fields said its mom who looks after everyone else garp said helen hugged jenny because she knew how true that was from the airplane garp and duncan could see jenny and roberta waving from the observation deck there had been some seat changes because duncan had wanted a window seat on the lefthand side of the plane the righthand side is just as nice a stewardess said not if you dont have a right eye duncan told her pleasantly and garp admired how the boy was feeling so bold about himself helen and the baby sat across the aisle from them can you see grandma helen asked duncan yes duncan said although the observation deck was suddenly overrun with people wanting to see the takeoff jenny fieldsas alwaysstood out in her white uniform even though she was short why does nana look so tall duncan asked garp and it was true jenny fields towered head and shoulders above the crowd garp realized that roberta was lifting his mother up as if his mother were a child oh robertas got her duncan cried garp looked at his mother hefted up in the air to wave goodbye to him safe in the arms of the old tight end jennys shy confident smile touched him and he waved out the window to her although garp knew that jenny couldnt see inside the plane for the first time his mother looked old to him he looked awayacross the aisle at helen with their new child here we go helen said helen and garp held hands across the aisle when the plane lifted off because garp knew helen was terrified of flying in new york john wolf put them up in his apartment he gave garp and helen and baby jenny his own bedroom and graciously offered to share the guest room with duncan the grownups had a late dinner and too much cognac garp told john wolf about the next three novels he was going to write the first one is called my fathers illusions garp said its about an idealistic father who has many children he keeps establishing little utopias for his kids to grow up in and after his kids grow up he becomes a founder of small colleges but all of them go brokethe colleges and the kids the father keeps trying to give a speech at the un but they keep throwing him out its the same speechhe keeps revising and revising it then he tries to run a free hospital its a disaster then he tries to institute a nationwide freetransportation system meanwhile his wife divorces him and his children keep growing older and turning out unhappy or fuckedupor just perfectly normal you know the only thing the children have in common are these dreadful memories of the utopias their father tried to have them grow up in finally the father becomes the governor of vermont vermont john wolf asked yes vermont garp said he becomes governor of vermont but he really thinks of himself as a king more utopias you see the king of vermont john wolf said thats a better title no no garp said thats another book no relation the second book after my fathers illusions will be called the death of vermont same cast of characters helen asked no no garp said another story its about the death of vermont well i like something that is what it says it is john wolf said one year spring doesnt come garp said spring never does come to vermont anyway helen said no no garp said frowning this year summer doesnt come either winter never stops it warms up one day and all the buds appear maybe in may one day in may there are buds on the trees the next day there are leaves and the next day the leaves have all turned its fall already the leaves fall off the trees a short foliage season helen said very funny garp said but thats what happens its winter again it will be winter forever the people die john wolf asked im not sure about the people garp said some leave vermont of course not a bad idea helen said some stay some die maybe they all die garp said whats it mean john wolf asked ill know when i get there garp said helen laughed and theres a third novel after that john wolf asked its called the plot against the giant garp said thats a poem by wallace stevens helen said yes of course garp said and he recited the poem for them the plot against the giant first girl when this yokel comes maundering whetting his hacker i shall run before him difusing the civilest odors out of geraniums and unsmelled flowers it will check him second girl i shall run before him arching cloths besprinkled with colors as small as fisheggs the threads will abash him third girl oh la le pauvre i shall run before him with a curious puffing he will bend his ear then i shall whisper heavenly labials in a world of gutturals it will undo him what a nice poem helen said the novel is in three parts garp said girl one girl two girl three john wolf asked and is the giant undone helen asked is he ever garp said is he a real giant in the novel john wolf asked i dont know yet garp said is he you helen asked i hope not garp said i hope not too said helen write that one first john wolf said no write it last helen said the death of vermont seems the logical one to write last john wolf said no i see the plot against the giant as last garp said wait and write it after im dead helen said everyone laughed but there are only three john wolf said what then what happens after the three i die garp said that will make six novels altogether and thats enough everyone laughed again and do you also know how you die john wolf asked him lets stop this helen said and to garp she said if you say in an airplane i will not forgive you behind the lightly drunk humor in her voice john detected a seriousness it made him stretch his legs you two better go to bed he said and get rested for your trip dont you want to know how i die garp asked them they didnt say anything i kill myself garp said pleasantly in order to become fully established that seems almost necessary i mean it really garp said in the present fashion youll agree this is one way of recognizing a writers seriousness since the art of the writing doesnt always make the writers seriousness apparent its sometimes necessary to reveal the depth of ones personal anguish by other means killing yourself seems to mean that you were serious after all its true garp said but his sarcasm was unpleasant and helen sighed john wolf stretched again and thereafter garp said much seriousness is suddenly revealed in the workwhere it had escaped notice before garp had often remarked irritably that this would be his final duty as a father and providerand he was fond of citing examples of the middling writers who were now adored and read with great avidity because of their suicides of those writersuicides whom he tooin some casestruly admired garp only hoped that at the moment the act was accomplished at least some of them had known about this lucky aspect of their unhappy decision he knew perfectly well that people who really killed themselves did not romanticize suicide in the least they did not respect the seriousness that the act supposedly lent to their worka nauseating habit in the book world garp thought among readers and reviewers garp also knew he was no suicide he knew it somewhat less surely after the accident to walt but he knew it he was as distant from suicide as he was from rape he could not imagine actually doing it but he liked to imagine the suicidal writer grinning at his successful mischief while once more he read and revised the last message he would leavea note aching with despair and appropriately humorless garp liked to imagine that moment bitterly when the suicide note was perfect the writer took the gun the poison the plungelaughing hideously and full of the knowledge that he had at last got the better of the readers and reviewers one note he imagined was i have been misunderstood by you idiots for the last time what a sick idea helen said the perfect writers death said garp its late john wolf said remember your flight in the guest room where john wolf wanted to fall asleep he found duncan garp still wideawake excited by the trip duncan wolf asked the boy my fathers been to europe before duncan said but i havent i know john wolf said is my father going to make a lot of money duncan asked i hope so john wolf said we dont really need it because my grandmother has so much duncan said but its nice to have your own john wolf said why duncan asked well its nice to be famous john wolf said do you think my fathers going to be famous duncan asked i think so john wolf said my grandmothers already famous duncan said i know john wolf said i dont think she likes it duncan said why john wolf asked too many strangers around duncan said thats what nana says ive heard her too many strangers in the house well your dad probably wont be famous in quite the same way that your grandmother is john wolf said how many different ways are there to be famous duncan asked john wolf expelled a long restrained breath then he began to tell duncan garp about the differences between very popular books and just successful ones he talked about political books and controversial books and works of fiction he told duncan the finer points of book publishing in fact he gave duncan the benefit of more of his personal opinions about publishing than he had ever given garp garp wasnt really interested duncan wasnt either duncan would not remember one of the finer points he fell asleep rather quickly after john wolf started explaining it was simply john wolfs tone of voice that duncan loved the long story the slow explanation it was the voice of roberta muldoonof jenny fields of his mother of garptelling him stories at night in the house at dogs head harbor putting him to sleep so soundly that he wouldnt have any nightmares duncan had gotten used to that tone of voice and he had been unable to fall asleep in new york without it in the morning garp and helen were amused by john wolfs closet there was a pretty nightgown belonging no doubt to one of john wolfs recent sleek womensomeone who had not been asked to spend last night there were about thirty dark suits all with pinstripes all quite elegant and all failing to fit garp by about three extra inches in the pantlegs garp wore one he liked to breakfast with the pants rolled up jesus you have a lot of suits he said to john wolf take one john wolf said take two or three take the one youre wearing its too long garp said holding up a foot have it shortened john wolf said you dont have any suits helen told garp garp decided he liked the suit so well that he wanted to wear it to the airport with the pantlegs pinned up jesus helen said im slightly embarrassed to be seen with you john wolf confessed but he drove them to the airport he was making absolutely certain that the garps got out of the country oh your book he said to garp in the car i keep forgetting to get you a copy i noticed garp said ill send you one john wolf said i never even saw what went on the jacket garp said a photograph of you on the back john wolf said its an old oneits one youve seen im sure whats on the front garp said well the title john wolf said oh really garp said i thought maybe you decided to leave the title off just the title john wolf said over a kind of photograph a kind of photograph garp said what kind of photograph maybe i have one in my briefcase wolf said ill look at the airport wolf was being careful he had already let it slip that he thought the world according to bensenhaver was an xrated soap opera garp hadnt seemed bothered mind you its awfully well written wolf had said but its still somehow soap opera its too much somehow garp had sighed life garp had said is too much somehow life is an xrated soap opera john garp had said in john wolfs briefcase was a snipout of the front cover of the world according to bensenhaver missing the backjacket photograph of garp and of course the jacket flaps john wolf planned to hand this snipout to garp just moments before they said goodbye this snipout of the front cover was sealed in an envelope the envelope was sealed in another envelope john wolf felt pretty certain that garp would not be able to undo the thing and look at it until he was safely seated in the plane when garp got to europe john wolf would send him the rest of the book jacket for the world according to bensenhaver wolf felt certain that it would not make garp quite angry enough to fly home this is bigger than the other plane duncan said at the window on the lefthand side a little in front of the wing it has to be bigger because its going all the way across the ocean garp said please dont mention that again helen said across the aisle from duncan and garp a stewardess was fashioning an intriguing sling for baby jenny who hung on the back of the seat in front of helen like someone elses baby or a papoose john wolf said you were going to be rich and famous duncan told his father hm garp said he was involved in the tedious process of opening the envelopes john wolf had given him he was having a hell of a time with them are you duncan asked i hope so garp said at last he looked at the cover of the world according to bensenhaver he could not tell if it was the sudden apparent weightlessness of the great airplane leaving the ground that gave him such a chillor if it was the photograph blown up in black and white with grains as fat as flakes of snow was a picture of an ambulance unloading at a hospital the glum futility on the gray faces of the attendants expressed the fact that there was no need to hurry the body under the sheet was small and completely covered the photograph had the quick fearful quality of the entrance marked emergency at any hospital it was any hospital and any ambulanceand any small body arriving too late a kind of wet finish glazed the photograph whichwith its grainy aspect and the fact that this accident appeared to have happened on a rainy nightmade it a picture out of any cheap newspaper it was any catastrophe it was any small death anywhere anytime but of course it only reminded garp of the gray despairing on all their faces when they were struck by the sight of walt lying broken the cover of the world according to bensenhaver an xrated soap opera shouted a grim warning this was a disaster story the cover called for your cheap but immediate attention it got it the cover promised you a sudden sickening sadness garp knew that the book would deliver it if he could have read the jacketflap description of his novel and his life at that time he might very well have taken the next plane back to new york as soon as he landed in europe but he would have time to resign himself to this kind of advertisingjust as john wolf had planned by the time garp read the jacket flaps hed already have absorbed that horrible frontcover photograph helen would never absorb it and she never forgave john wolf for it either nor would she ever forgive him for the backcover photograph of garp it was a picture taken several years before the accident of garp with duncan and walt helen had taken the picture and garp had sent it to john wolf instead of a christmas card garp was on a dock in maine he was wearing nothing but a bathing suit and he looked in terrific physical shape he was duncan stood behind him his lean arm rested on his fathers shoulder duncan also wore a bathing suit he was very tan with a white sailors cap cocked jauntily on his head he grinned into the camera staring it down with his beautiful eyes walt sat on garps lap walt was so fresh out of the water that he was as slick as a seal puppy garp was trying to wrap him warmly in a towel and walt was squirming wildly happy his clownish round face beamed at the cameraat his mother taking the picture when garp looked at that picture he could feel walts cold wet body growing warm and dry against him beneath the photograph the caption cashed in on one of the least noble instincts of human beings t s garp with his children before the accident the implication was that if you read the book you would find out what accident of course you wouldnt the world according to bensenhaver would tell you nothing about that accident reallyalthough it is fair to say that accidents play an enormous part in the novel the only thing you would really learn about the accident referred to under the photograph was contained in the garbage that john wolf wrote on the jacket flap but even so that photographof a father with his doomed childrenhad a way of hooking you people bought the book by the sad son of jenny fields in droves on the airplane to europe garp had only the picture of the ambulance to use his imagination on even at that altitude he could imagine people buying the book in droves he sat feeling disgusted at the people he imagined buying the book he also felt disgusted that he had written the kind of book that could attract people in droves droves of anything but especially of people were not comforting to t s garp he sat in the airplane wishing for more isolation and privacyfor himself and for his familythan he would ever know again what will we do with all the money duncan asked him suddenly all the money garp said when youre rich and famous duncan said what will we do well have lots of fun garp told him but his handsome sons one eye pierced him with doubt well be flying at an altitude of thirtyfive thousand feet the pilot said wow said duncan and garp reached for his wifes hand across the aisle a fat man was making his unsure way down the aisle to the lavatory garp and helen could only look at each other and convey a kind of handinhand contact with their eyes in his minds eye garp saw his mother jenny fields all in white held up in the sky by the towering roberta muldoon he did not know what it meant but his vision of jenny fields raised above a crowd chilled him in the same way that the ambulance on the cover of the world according to bensenhaver had chilled him he began talking to duncan about anything at all duncan began talking about walt and the undertowa famous family story for as far back as duncan could remember the garps had gone every summer to dogs head harbor new hampshire where the miles of beach in front of jenny fields estate were ravaged by a fearful undertow when walt was old enough to venture near the water duncan said to himas helen and garp had for years said to duncanwatch out for the undertow walt retreated respectfully and for three summers walt was warned about the undertow duncan recalled all the phrases the undertow is bad today the undertow is strong today the undertow is wicked today wicked was a big word in new hampshirenot just for the undertow and for years walt watched out for it from the first when he asked what it could do to you he had only been told that it could pull you out to sea it could suck you under and drown you and drag you away it was walts fourth summer at dogs head harbor duncan remembered when garp and helen and duncan observed walt watching the sea he stood ankledeep in the foam from the surf and peered into the waves without taking a step for the longest time the family went down to the waters edge to have a word with him what are you doing walt helen asked what are you looking for dummy duncan asked him im trying to see the under toad walt said the what said garp the under toad walt said im trying to see it how big is it and garp and helen and duncan held their breath they realized that all these years walt had been dreading a giant toad lurking offshore waiting to suck him under and drag him out to sea the terrible under toad garp tried to imagine it with him would it ever surface did it ever float or was it always down under slimy and bloated and everwatchful for ankles its coated tongue could snare the vile under toad between helen and garp the under toad became their code phrase for anxiety long after the monster was clarified for walt undertow dummy not under toad duncan had howled garp and helen evoked the beast as a way of referring to their own sense of danger when the traffic was heavy when the road was icywhen depression had moved in overnightthey said to each other the under toad is strong today remember duncan asked on the plane how walt asked if it was green or brown both garp and duncan laughed but it was neither green nor brown garp thought it was me it was helen it was the color of bad weather it was the size of an automobile in vienna garp felt the under toad was strong helen did not seem to feel it and duncan like an elevenyearold passed from one feeling to the next the return to the city for garp was like returning to the steering school the streets the buildings even the paintings in the museums were like his old teachers grown older he barely recognized them and they did not know him at all helen and duncan saw everything garp was content to walk with baby jenny he strolled her through the long warm fall in a carriage as baroque as the city itselfhe smiled and nodded to all the tongueclucking elderly who peered into the carriage and approved of his new baby the viennese appeared well fed and comfortable with luxuries that looked new to garp the city was years away from the russian occupation the memory of the war the reminders of ruins if vienna had been dying or already dead in his time there with his mother garp felt that something new but common had grown in the old citys place at the same time garp liked showing duncan and helen around he enjoyed his personal history tour mixed with the guidebook history of vienna and this is where hitler stood when he first addressed the city and this is where i used to shop on saturday mornings this is the fourth district a russian zone of occupation the famous karlskirche is here and the lower and upper belvedere and between the prinzeugenstrasse on your left and the argentinierstrasse is the little street where mom and i they rented some rooms in a nice pension in the fourth district they discussed enrolling duncan in an englishspeaking school but it was a long drive or a long strassenbahn ride every morning and they didnt really plan on staying even half the year vaguely they imagined christmas at dogs head harbor with jenny and roberta and ernie holm john wolf finally sent the book complete book jacket and all and garps sense of the under toad grew unbearably for a few days then kicked deeper beneath the surface it appeared to be gone garp managed a restrained letter to his editor he expressed his sense of personal hurt his understanding that this had been done with the best intentions businesswise butand so forth how angry could he really beat wolf garp had provided the package wolf had only promoted it garp heard from his mother that the first reviews were not nice but jennyon john wolfs advicedid not enclose any reviews with her letter john wolf clipped the first rave from among the important new york reviews the womens movement has at last exhibited a significant influence on a significant male writer wrote the reviewer who was an associate professor of womens studies somewhere she went on to say that the world according to bensenhaver was the first indepth study by a man of the peculiarly male neurotic pressure many women are made to suffer and so forth christ garp said it sounds as if i wrote a thesis its a fucking novel its a story and i made it up well it sounds as if she liked it helen said its not it she liked garp said she liked something else but the review helped to establish the rumor that the world according to bensenhaver was a feminist novel like me jenny fields wrote her son it appears you are going to be the beneficiary of one of the many popular misunderstandings of our time other reviews called the book paranoid crazed and crammed with gratuitous violence and sex garp was not shown most of those reviews but they probably didnt hurt the sales either one reviewer admitted that garp was a serious writer whose tendencies toward baroque exaggeration have run amuck john wolf couldnt resist sending garp that reviewprobably because john wolf agreed with it jenny wrote that she was becoming involved with new hampshire politics the new hampshire gubernatorial race is taking all our time roberta muldoon wrote how could anyone give all her time to a new hampshire governor garp wrote back there was apparently some feminist issue at stake and some generally illiberal nonsense and crimes the incumbent governor was actually proud of the administration boasted that a raped fourteenyearold had been denied an abortion thus stemming the tide of nationwide degeneracy the governor truly was a crowing reactionary moron among other things he appeared to believe that poor people should not be helped by the state or federal government largely because the condition of the poor seemed to the governor of new hampshire to be a deserved punishmentthe just and moral judgment of a superior being the incumbent governor was obnoxious and clever for example the sense of fear that he successfully evoked that new hampshire was in danger of being victimized by teams of new york divorcees the divorced women from new york allegedly were moving into new hampshire in droves their intentions were to turn new hampshire women into lesbians or at the very least to encourage them to be unfaithful to their new hampshire husbands their intentions also included the seduction of new hampshire husbands and new hampshire high school boys the new york divorcees apparently represented widespread promiscuity socialism alimony and something ominously referred to in the new hampshire press as group female living one of the centers for this alleged group female living was dogs head harbor of course the den of the radical feminist jenny fields there had also been a widespread increase the governor said of venereal diseasea known problem among these liberationists he was a terrific liar the candidate running for governor against this wellliked fool was apparently a woman jenny and roberta and jenny wrote teams of new york divorcees were running her campaign somehow in the sole new hampshire newspaper of statewide distribution garps degenerate novel was referred to as the new feminist bible a violent hymn to the moral depravity and sexual danger of our time wrote one west coast reviewer a pained protest against the violence and sexual combat of our groping age said another newspaper somewhere else whether it was liked or disliked the novel was largely looked upon as news one way for novels to be successful is for the fiction to resemble somebodys version of the news that is what happened to the world according to bensenhaver like the stupid governor of new hampshire garps book became news new hampshire is a backwoods state with base politics garp wrote his mother for gods sake dont get involved thats what you always say jenny wrote when you come home youre going to be famous then let me see you try not to get involved just watch me garp wrote her nothing could be easier his involvement with the transatlantic mail had momentarily distracted garp from his sense of the awesome and lethal under toad but now helen told him that she detected the presence of the beast too lets go home she said weve had a nice time they got a telegram from john wolf stay where you are it said people are buying your book in droves roberta sent garp a tshirt new york divorcees are good for new hampshire the tshirt said my god garp said to helen if were going home lets at least wait until after this mindless election thus he missed thankfully the dissenting feminist opinion of the world according to bensenhaver published in a giddy popular magazine the novel the reviewer said steadfastly upholds the sexist notion that women are chiefly an assemblage of orifices and the acceptable prey of predatory males t s garp continues the infuriating male mythology the good man is the bodyguard of his family the good woman never willingly lets another man enter her literal or figurative door even jenny fields was cajoled into reviewing her sons novel and it is fortunate that garp never saw this either jenny said that although it was her sons best novelbecause it was his most serious subjectit was a novel marred by repeated male obsessions which could become tedious to women readers however jenny said her son was a good writer who was still young and would only get better his heart she added is in the right place if garp had read that he might have stayed in vienna a lot longer but they made their plans to leave as usual anxiousness quickened the garps plans one night duncan was not home from the park before dark and garp running out to look for him called back to helen that this was the final sign they would leave as soon as possible city life in general made garp too fearful for duncan garp ran along the prinzeugenstrasse toward the russian war memorial at the schwarzenbergplatz there was a pastry shop near there and duncan liked pastry although garp had repeatedly warned the child that it would ruin his supper duncan he ran calling and his voice against the stolid stone buildings bounced back to him like the froggy belching of the under toad the foul and warty beast whose sticky nearness he felt like breath but duncan was munching happily on a grillparzertorte in the pastry shop it gets dark earlier and earlier he complained im not that late garp had to admit it they walked home together the under toad disappeared up a small dark streetor else its not interested in duncan garp thought he imagined he felt the tug of the tide at his own ankles but it was a passing feeling the telephone that old cry of alarma warrior stabbed on guard duty screaming his shockstartled the pension where they lived and brought the trembling landlady like a ghost to their rooms bitte bitte she came pleading she conveyed with little shakes of excitement that the call was from the united states it was about two in the morning the heat was off and garp shivered after the old woman down the corridor of the pension the hall rug was thin he recalled the color of a shadow he had written that years ago and he looked for the rest of his cast the hungarian singer the man who could only walk on his hands the doomed bear and all the members of the sad circus of death he had imagined but they were gone only the old womans lean erect body guided himher erectness unnaturally formal as if she were overcorrecting a stoop there were no photographs of speedskating teams on the walls there was no unicycle parked by the door to the wc down a staircase and into a room with a harsh overhead light like a hasty operating room set up in a city under siege garp felt he followed the angel of deathmidwife to the under toad whose swampy smell he sniffed at the mouthpiece of the phone yes he whispered and for a moment was relieved to hear roberta muldoonanother sexual rejection perhaps that was all or perhaps an update on the new hampshire gubernatorial race garp looked up at the old inquiring face of the landlady and realized that she had not taken the time to put in her teeth her cheeks were sucked into her mouth the loose flesh drooped below her jawlineher whole face was as slack as a skeletons the room reeked of toad i didnt want you to see it on the news roberta was saying if it would be on tv over therei couldnt know for sure or even the newspapers i just didnt want you to find out that way who won garp asked lightly though he knew that this call had little to do with the new or old governor of new hampshire shes been shotyour mother roberta said theyve killed her garp a bastard shot her with a deer rifle who garp whispered a man roberta wailed it was the worst word she could use a man a man who hated women roberta said he was a hunter roberta sobbed it was hunting season or it was almost hunting season and no one thought there was anything wrong about a man with a rifle he shot her dead garp said i caught her before she fell roberta cried she never struck the ground garp she never said a word she never knew what happened garp im sure did they get the man garp asked someone shot him or he shot himself roberta said dead garp asked yes the bastard roberta said hes dead too are you alone roberta garp asked her no roberta wept there are a lot of us here were at your place and garp could imagine them all the wailing women at dogs head harbortheir leader murdered she wanted her body to go to a med school garp said roberta i hear you roberta said thats just so awful thats what she wanted garp said i know roberta said youve got to come home right away garp said we dont know what to do roberta said what is there to do garp asked theres nothing to do there should be something roberta said but she said she never wanted a funeral certainly not garp said she wanted her body to go to a med school you get that accomplished roberta thats what mom would have wanted but there ought to be something roberta protested maybe not a religious service but something dont you get involved in anything until i get there garp told her theres a lot of talk roberta said people want a rally or something im her only family roberta garp said you tell them that she meant a lot to a lot of us you know roberta said sharply yes and it got her killed garp thought but he said nothing i tried to look after her roberta cried i told her not to go in that parking lot nobodys to blame roberta garp said softly you think somebodys to blame garp roberta said you always do please roberta garp said youre my best friend ill tell you whos to blame roberta said its men garp its your filthy murderous sex if you cant fuck us the way you want to you kill us in a hundred ways not me roberta please garp said yes you too roberta whispered no man is a womans friend im your friend roberta garp said and roberta cried for a whilea sound as acceptable to garp as rain falling on a deep lake im so sorry roberta whispered if id seen the man with the gunjust a second sooneri could have blocked the shot i would have you know i know you would have roberta garp said he wondered if he would have he felt love for his mother of course and now an aching loss but did he ever feel such devotion to jenny fields as the followers among her own sex he apologized to the landlady for the lateness of the phone call when he told her that his mother was dead the old woman crossed herselfher sunken cheeks and her empty gums were mute but clear indications of the family deaths she had herself outlived helen cried for the longest time she would not let jennys namesake little jenny garp out of her arms duncan and garp searched the newspapers but the news would be a day getting to austriaexcept for the marvel of television garp watched his mothers murder on his landladys tv there was some election nonsense at a shopping plaza in new hampshire the landscape had a vaguely seacoast appearance and garp recognized the place as being a few miles from dogs head harbor the incumbent governor was in favor of all the same swinish stupid things the woman running against him seemed educated and idealistic and kind she also seemed to barely restrain her anger at the same swinish stupid things the governor represented the parking lot at the shopping plaza was circled by pickup trucks the pickups were full of men in hunting coats and caps apparently they represented local new hampshire interestsas opposed to the interest in new hampshire taken by the new york divorcees the nice woman running against the governor was also a kind of new york divorcee that she had lived fifteen years in new hampshire and her children had gone to school there was a fact more or less ignored by the incumbent governor and by his supporters who circled the parking lot in their pickup trucks there were lots of signs there was a steady jeering there was also a high school football team in uniformtheir cleats clacking on the cement of the parking lot one of the woman candidates children was on the team and he had assembled the football players in the parking lot in hopes of demonstrating to new hampshire that it was perfectly manly to vote for his mother the hunters in their pickup trucks were of the opinion that to vote for this woman was to vote for faggotryand lesbianism and socialism and alimony and new york and so forth garp had the feeling watching the telecast that those things were not tolerated in new hampshire garp and helen and duncan and baby jenny sat in the viennese pension about to watch the murder of jenny fields their bewildered old landlady served them coffee and little cakes only duncan ate anything then jenny fields had her turn to speak to the assembled people in the parking lot she spoke from the back of a pickup truck roberta muldoon lifted her up to the tailgate and adjusted the microphone for her garps mother looked very small in the pickup truck especially beside roberta but jennys uniform was so white that she stood out bright and clear i am jenny fields she saidto some cheers and some whistles and some hoots there was a blaring of horns from the pickup trucks circling the parking lot the police were telling the pickup trucks to move on they moved on and came back and moved on again most of you know who i am jenny fields said there were more hoots more cheers more blowing of hornsand a single sharp gunshot as conclusive as a wave breaking on the beach no one saw where it came from roberta muldoon held garps mother under her arms jennys white uniform seemed struck by a small dark splash then roberta dropped down from the tailgate with jenny in her arms and knifed through the breaking crowd like an old tight end carrying the ball for a hard first down the crowd parted jennys white uniform was almost concealed in robertas arms there was a police car moving to intercept roberta when they neared each other roberta held out the body of jenny fields toward the squad car for a moment garp saw his mothers unmoving white uniform lifted above the crowd and into the arms of a policeman who helped her and roberta into the car the car as they say sped away the camera was distracted by an apparent shootout taking place among the circling pickup trucks and several more police cars later there was the still body of a man in a hunting coat lying in a dark puddle of what looked like oil later still there was a closeup of what the newsmen would only identify as a deer rifle it was pointed out that the deer season had not officially opened except for the fact that there had been no nudity in the telecast the event was an xrated soap opera from start to finish garp thanked the landlady for allowing them to watch the news within two hours they were in frankfurt where they changed planes for new york the under toad was not on the plane with themnot even for helen who was so afraid of planes for a while they knew the under toad was elsewhere all garp could think somewhere over the atlantic ocean was that his mother had delivered some adequate last words jenny fields had ended her life saying most of you know who i am on the airplane garp tried out the line most of you know who i am he whispered duncan was asleep but helen overheard him she reached across the aisle and held garps hand thousands of feet above sea level t s garp cried in the airplane that was bringing him home to be famous in his violent country the first feminist funeral and other funerals ever since walt died wrote t s garp my life has felt like an epilogue when jenny fields died garp must have felt his bewilderment increasethat sense of time passing with a plan but what was the plan garp sat in john wolfs new york office trying to comprehend the plethora of plans surrounding his mothers death i didnt authorize a funeral garp said how can there be a funeral where is the body roberta roberta muldoon said patiently that the body was where jenny wanted her body to go it was not her body that mattered roberta said there was simply going to be a kind of memorial service it was better not to think of it as a funeral the newspapers had said it was to be the first feminist funeral in new york the police had said that violence was expected the first feminist funeral garp said she meant so much to so many women roberta said dont be angry you didnt own her you know john wolf rolled his eyes duncan garp looked out the window of john wolfs office forty floors above manhattan it probably felt to duncan a little like being on the plane he had just got off helen was making a phone call in another office she was trying to reach her father in the good old town of steering she wanted ernie to meet their plane out of new york when it landed in boston all right garp said slowly he held the baby little jenny garp on his knee all right you know i dont approve of this roberta but ill go youll go john wolf said no roberta said i mean you dont have to she said i know garp said but yore right she probably would have liked such a thing so ill go whats going to happen at it theres going to be a lot of speeches roberta said you dont want to go and theyre going to read from her book john wolf said weve donated some copies but you dont want to go garp roberta said nervously please dont go i want to go garp said i promise you i wont hiss or boono matter what the assholes say about her i have something of hers i might read myself if anyones interested he said did you ever see that thing she wrote about being called a feminist roberta and john wolf looked at each other they looked stricken and gray she said i hate being called one because its a label i didnt choose to describe my feelings about men or the way i write i dont want to argue with you garp roberta said not now you know perfectly well she said other things too she was a feminist whether she liked the label or not she was simply one for pointing out all the injustices to women she was simply for allowing women to live their own lives and make their own choices oh said garp and did she believe that everything that happened to women happened to them because they were women you have to be stupid to believe that garp roberta said you make us all sound like ellen jamesians please stop it both of you john wolf said jenny garp squawked briefly and slapped garps knee he looked at her surprisedas if hed forgotten she was a live thing there in his lap what is it he asked her but the baby was quiet again watching some pattern in the landscape of john wolfs office that was invisible to the rest of them what time is this wingding garp asked roberta five oclock in the afternoon roberta said i believe it was chosen john wolf said so that half the secretaries in new york could walk off their jobs an hour early not all the working women in new york are secretaries roberta said the secretaries said john wolf are the only ones wholl be missed between four and five oh boy garp said helen came in and announced that she could not reach her father on the phone hes at wrestling practice garp said the wrestling season hasnt begun yet helen said garp looked at the calendar on his watch which was several hours out of sync with the united states he had last set it in vienna but garp knew that wrestling at steering did not officially begin until after thanksgiving helen was right when i called his office at the gym they said he was at home helen told garp and when i called home there was no answer well rent a car at the airport garp said and anyway we cant leave until tonight i have to go to this damn funeral no you dont have to roberta insisted in fact helen said you cant roberta and john wolf again looked stricken and gray garp simply looked uninformed what do you mean i cant he asked its a feminist funeral helen said did you read the paper or did you stop at the headlines garp looked accusingly at roberta muldoon but she looked at duncan looking out the window duncan had his telescope out spying on manhattan you cant go garp roberta admitted its true i didnt tell you because i thought it would really piss you off i didnt think youd want to go anyway im not allowed garp said its a funeral for women roberta said women loved her women will mourn her thats how we wanted it garp glared at roberta muldoon i loved her he said im her only child do you mean i cant go to this wingding because im a man i wish you wouldnt call it a wingding roberta said whats a wingding duncan asked jenny garp squawked again but garp didnt listen to her helen took her from him do you mean no men are allowed at my mothers funeral garp asked roberta its not exactly a funeral as i told you roberta said its more like a rallyits a kind of reverent demonstration im going roberta garp said i dont care what you call it oh boy helen said she walked out of the office with baby jenny im going to try to get my father again she said i see a man with one arm duncan said please dont go garp roberta said softly shes right john wolf said i wanted to go too i was her editor after all but let them have it their way garp i think jenny would have liked the idea i dont care what she would have liked garp said thats probably true roberta said thats another reason you shouldnt be there you dont know garp how some of the womens movement people have reacted to your book john wolf advised him roberta muldoon rolled her eyes the accusation that garp was cashing in on his mothers reputation and the womens movement had been made before roberta had seen the advertisement for the world according to bensenhaver which john wolf had instantly authorized upon jennys assassination garps book appeared to cash in on that tragedy toothe ad conveyed a sick sense of a poor author whos lost a son and now a mother too it is fortunate garp never saw that ad even john wolf regretted it the world according to bensenhaver sold and sold and sold for years it would be controversial it would be taught in colleges fortunately garps other books would be taught in colleges sporadically too one course taught jennys autobiography together with garps three novels and stewart percys a history of everett steerings academy the purpose of that course apparently was to figure out everything about garps life by hunting through the books for those things that appeared to be true it is fortunate garp never knew anything about that course either i see a man with one leg announced duncan garp searching the streets and windows of manhattan for all the crippled and misarrangeda task that could take years please stop it duncan garp said to him if you really want to go garp roberta muldoon whispered to him youll have to go in drag if its all that tough for a man to get in garp snapped at roberta you better hope they dont have a chromosome check at the door he felt instantly sorry hed said that he saw roberta wince as if hed slapped her and he took both her big hands in his and held them until he felt her squeeze him back sorry he whispered if ive got to go in drag its a good thing youre here to help me dress up i mean youre an old hand at that right right roberta said this is ridiculous john wolf said if some of those women recognize you roberta told garp theyll tear you limb from limb at the very least they wont let you in the door helen came back in the office with jenny garp squawking on her hip ive called dean bodger she told garp i asked him to try to reach daddy its just not like him to be nowhere garp shook his head we should just go to the airport now helen told him rent a car in boston drive to steering let the children rest she said then if you want to run back to new york on some crusade you can do it you go garp said ill take a plane and rent my own car later thats silly helen said and needlessly expensive roberta said i have a lot of money now garp said his wry smile to john wolf was not returned john wolf volunteered to take helen and the kids to the airport one man with one arm one man with one leg two people who limped said duncan and someone without any nose you should wait awhile and get a look at your father roberta muldoon said garp thought of himself a grieving exwrestler in drag for his mothers memorial service he kissed helen and the children and even john wolf dont worry about your dad garp told helen and dont worry about garp roberta told helen im going to disguise him so that everyone will leave him alone i wish youd try to leave everyone alone helen told garp there was suddenly another woman in john wolfs crowded office no one had noticed her but she had been trying to get john wolfs attention when she spoke she spoke out in a single clear moment of silence and everyone looked at her mr wolf the woman said she was old and brownblackgray and her feet appeared to be killing her she wore an electrical extension cord wrapped twice around her thick waist yes jillsy john wolf said and garp stared at the woman it was jillsy sloper of course john wolf should have known that writers remember names i was wonderin jillsy said if i could get off early this afternoonif youd say a word for me because i want to go to that funeral she spoke with her chin down a stiff mutter of bitten wordsas few as possible she did not like to open her mouth around strangers also she recognized garp and she didnt want to be introduced to himnot ever yes of course you can john wolf said quickly he didnt want to introduce jillsy sloper to garp any more than she wanted it just a minute garp said jillsy sloper and john wolf froze are you jillsy sloper garp asked her no john wolf blurted garp glared at him how do you do jillsy said to garp she would not look at him how do you do garp said he could see at a glance that this sorrowful woman had not as john wolf said loved his book im sorry about your mom jillsy said thank you very much garp said but he could seethey all could seethat jillsy sloper was seething about something she was worth two or three of you jillsy suddenly cried to garp there were tears in her muddyyellow eyes she was worth four or five of your terrible books she crooned lawd she muttered leaving them all in john wolfs office lawd lawd another person with a limp thought duncan garp but he could see that his father did not want to hear about his body count at the first feminist funeral held in the city of new york the mourners appeared unsure how to behave this was perhaps the result of the gatherings being not in a church but in one of these enigmatic buildings of the city university systeman auditorium old with the echo of speeches no one had listened to the giant space was slightly seedy with the sense of past cheeringfor rock bands and for the occasional wellknown poet but the space was also serious with the certain knowledge that large lectures had taken place there it was a room in which hundreds of people had taken notes the name of the space was school of nursing hallthus it was oddly appropriate as a place of tribute to jenny fields it was hard to tell the difference between the mourners wearing their jenny fields originals with the little red hearts stitched over the breast and the real nurses forever white and unfashionable who had other reasons to be in the environs of the nursing school but had paused to peek in on the ceremonieseither curious or genuinely sympathetic or both there were many white uniforms among the enormous milling softly mumbling audience and garp immediately cursed roberta i told you i could have dressed as a nurse garp hissed i could have been a little less conspicuous i thought youd be conspicuous as a nurse roberta said i didnt know thered be so many its going to be a fucking national trend garp muttered just wait and see he said but he said no more he huddled small and garish beside roberta feeling that everyone was looking at him and somehow sensing his malenessor at least as roberta had warned him his hostility they sat deadcenter in the massive auditorium only three rows back from the stage and the speakers platform a sea of women had moved in and sat behind themrows and rows of themand farther back at the wideopen rear of the hall where there were no seats the women who were less interested in seating themselves for the entire ritual but whod wanted to come pay their respects filed slowly in one door and slowly out another it was as if the larger seated audience were the open casket of jenny fields that the slowwalking women had come to observe garp of course felt that he was an open casket and all the women were observing himhis pallor his hue his preposterous disguise roberta had done this to him perhaps to get even with him for his bullying her into letting him come at allor for his cruel crack concerning her chromosomes roberta had dressed garp in a cheap turquoise jump suit the color of oren raths pickup truck the jump suit had a gold zipper that ran from garps crotch to garps throat garp did not adequately fill the hips of the suit but his breastsor rather the falsies roberta had fashioned for himstrained against the snapflap pockets and twisted the vulnerable zipper askew what a set you have roberta had told him you animal roberta garp had hissed to her the shoulder straps of the huge hideous bra dug into his shoulders but whenever garp felt that a woman was staring at him perhaps doubting his sex he would simply turn himself sideways to her and show off thus eliminating any possible doubt or so he hoped he was less sure of the wig a tousled whores head of honeyblond hair under which his own scalp itched a pretty green silk scarf was at his throat his dark face was powdered a sickly gray but this concealed roberta said his stubble of beard his rather thin lips were cherrycolored but he kept licking them and had smeared the lipstick at one corner of his mouth you look like youve just been kissed roberta reassured him though garp was cold roberta had not allowed him to wear his ski parkait made his shoulders look too thick and on garps feet was a towering pair of kneehigh bootsa kind of cherry vinyl that matched roberta said his lipstick garp had seen himself reflected in a storefront window and hed told roberta that he thought he looked like a teenage prostitute an aging teenage prostitute roberta had corrected him a faggot parachutist garp had said no you look like a woman garp roberta had assured him not a woman with especially good taste but a woman so garp sat squirming in school of nursing hall he twisted the itchy rope braids of his ridiculous purse a scraggily hemp thing with an oriental design barely big enough to hold his wallet in her large bursting shoulder bag roberta muldoon had hidden garps real clotheshis other identity this is manda hortonjones roberta whispered indicating a thin hawknosed woman speaking nasally and with her rodential head pointed down she read a stiff prepared speech garp didnt know who manda hortonjones was he shrugged enduring her the speeches had ranged from strident political calls for unity to disturbed painful personal reminiscences of jenny fields the audience did not know whether to applaud or to praywhether to voice approval or to nod grimly the atmosphere was both one of mourning and one of urgent togethernesswith a strong sense of marching forth thinking about it garp supposed this was natural and fitting both to his mother and to his dim perception of what the womens movement was this is sally devlin roberta whispered the woman now climbing to the speakers platform looked pleasant and wise and vaguely familiar garp felt immediately the need to defend himself from her he didnt mean it but solely to goad roberta garp whispered she has nice legs nicer than yours roberta said pinching his thigh painfully between her strong thumb and her long passcatching index fingerone of the fingers garp supposed that had been broken so many times during robertas fling as a philadelphia eagle sally devlin looked down on them with her soft sad eyes as if she were silently scolding a classroom of children who were not paying attentionnot even sitting still that senseless murder does not really merit all this she said quietly but jenny fields simply helped so many individuals she simply was so patient and generous with women who were having a bad time anyone whos ever been helped by someone else should feel terrible about whats happened to her garp felt truly terrible at that moment he heard a combined sigh and sob of hundreds of women beside him robertas broad shoulders shook against him he felt a hand perhaps of the woman sitting directly behind him grip his own shoulder cramped in the terrible turquoise jump suit he wondered if he was about to be slapped for his offensive inappropriate attire but the hand just held on to his shoulder perhaps the woman needed support at this moment garp knew they all felt like sisters didnt they he looked up to see what sally devlin was saying but his own eyes were teary and he could not see ms devlin clearly he could hear her though she was sobbing great heartfelt and heaving cries she was trying to get back to her speech but her eyes couldnt find her place on the page the page rattled against the microphone some very powerfullooking woman whom garp thought he had seen beforeone of those bodyguard types he had often seen with his mothertried to help sally devlin off the platform but ms devlin didnt want to leave i wasnt going to do this she said still cryingmeaning her sobs her loss of control i had more to say she protested but she could not get hold of her voice damn it she said with a dignity that moved garp the big toughlooking woman found herself alone at the microphone the audience waited quietly garp felt a tremble or maybe a tug from the hand on his shoulder looking at robertas large hands folded in her lap garp knew that the hand on his shoulder must be very small the big toughlooking woman wanted to say something and the audience waited but they would wait forever to hear a word from her roberta knew her roberta stood up beside garp and began to applaud the big hardlooking womans silenceher exasperating quiet in front of the microphone other people joined robertas applauseeven garp though he had no idea why he was clapping shes an ellen jamesian roberta whispered to him she cant say anything yet the woman melted the audience with her pained sorry face she opened her mouth as if she were singing but no sound came out garp imagined he could see the severed stump of her tongue he remembered how his mother supported themthese crazies jenny was wonderful to every single one of them who came to her but jenny had finally admitted her disapproval of what they had doneperhaps only to garp theyre making victims of themselves jenny had said and yet thats the same thing theyre angry at men for doing to them why dont they just take a vow of silence or never speak in a mans presence jenny said its not logical to maim yourself to make a point but garp now touched by the mad woman in front of him felt the whole history of the worlds selfmutilationthough violent and illogical it expressed perhaps like nothing else a terrible hurt i am really hurt said the womans huge face dissolving before him in his own swimmy tears then the little hand on his shoulder hurt him he remembered himselfa man at a ritual for womenand he turned around to see the rather tiredlooking young woman behind him her face was familiar but he didnt recognize her i know you the young woman whispered to him she did not sound happy that she knew him either roberta had warned him not to open his mouth to anyone not even to try to speak he was prepared for handling that problem he shook his head he took a pad of paper out of the flap pocket which was crushed against his mammoth false bosom and he snatched a pencil out of his absurd purse the sharp clawlike fingers of the woman bit into his shoulder as if she were keeping him from running away hi im an ellen jamesian garp scribbled on the pad he tore the slip off and handed it to the young woman she didnt take it like hell you are she said youre t s garp the word garp bounced like the burp of an unknown animal into the silence of the suffering auditorium still conducted by the quiet ellen jamesian on stage roberta muldoon turned around and looked panicstricken she had never seen this particular young woman in her life i dont know who your big playmate is the young woman told garp but youre t s garp i dont know where you got that dumb wig or those big tits but id know you anywhere you havent changed a bit since you were fucking my sisterfucking her to death the young woman said and garp knew who his enemy was the last and youngest of the percy family horde bainbridge little pooh percy who was wearing diapers as a preteen and for all garp knew might be wearing them still garp looked at her garp had bigger tits than she did pooh was asexually attired her haircut was similar to a popular and unisexual style her features were neither delicate nor coarse pooh wore a us army shirt with sergeant stripes and a campaign button for the woman whod hoped to be the new governor of the state of new hampshire with a shock garp realized that the woman running for governor was sally devlin he wondered if shed won hello pooh garp said and saw her wincea hated nickname obviously and one she was never called anymore bainbridge garp muttered but it was too late to make friends it was years too late it was too late from the night garp had bitten off bonkers ear had violated cushie in the steering school infirmary had not ever really loved herhad not come to her wedding and not to her funeral whatever grudge against garp this was or whatever loathing for men in general pooh percy had her enemy at her mercyat last robertas big warm hand was at the small of garps back and her heavy voice urged him get out of here move fast dont say a word theres a man here bainbridge percy shouted to the grieving silence of school of nursing hall that even brought a small soundperhaps a gruntfrom the troubled ellen jamesian on stage theres a man here pooh screamed and hes t s garp garp is here she cried roberta tried to lead him to the aisle a tight end is chiefly a good blocker secondarily a passreceiver but even the former robert muldoon could not quite move all these women please roberta said excuse us please she was his motheryou must know that her only child my only mother garp thought plowing against robertas back he felt pooh percys needlelike claws rake his face she snatched his wig off he snatched it back and clutched it to his big bosom as if it mattered to him he fucked my sister to death pooh percy wailed how this perception of garp had convinced her garp would never knowbut convinced of it pooh clearly was she climbed over the seat he had abandoned and moved in behind him and robertawho finally broke through into the aisle she was my mother garp said to a woman he was passing a woman who looked like a potential mother herself she was pregnant in the womans scornful face garp saw reason and kindness he also saw restraint and contempt let him pass the pregnant woman murmured but without much feeling others seemed more sympathetic someone cried out that he had a right to be therebut there were other things shouted rather lacking sympathy of any kind farther up the aisle he felt his falsies punched he put his hand out for roberta and realized roberta had as they say in football been taken out of the play she was down several young women wearing navy pea coats appeared to be sitting on her it occurred to garp that they might think roberta was also a man in drag their discovery that roberta was real could be painful take off garp roberta cried yes run you little fucker one woman in a pea coat hissed he ran he was almost up to the milling women at the rear of the hall when someones blow landed where it was aimed he had not been hit in the balls since a wrestling practice at steeringso many years ago he realized he had forgotten the total incapacity that resulted he covered himself and lay curled on one hip they kept trying to rip his wig out of his hands and his tiny purse he held on as if this were some mugging he felt a few shoes a few slaps and then the minty breath of an elderly woman breathing in his face try to get up she said gently he saw she was a nurse a real nurse there was no fashionable heart sewn above her breast there was just the little brassandblue nameplateshe was r n soandso my name is dotty the nurse told him she was at least sixty hello garp said thank you dotty she took his arm and led him at a fast pace through the remaining mob no one appeared to want to hurt him when he was with her they let him go do you have money for a cab the nurse named dotty asked him when they were outside school of nursing hall yes i think so garp said he checked his horrid purse his wallet was safely there and his wigtousled still furtherwas under his arm roberta had garps real clothes and garp looked in vain for any sign of roberta emerging from the first feminist funeral put that wig on dotty advised him or youll be mistaken for one of those transvestites he struggled to put it on she helped him people are really rough on transvestites dotty added she took several bobby pins from her own gray head of hair and fastened garps wig more decently in place the scratch on his cheek she told him would stop bleeding very soon on the steps of school of nursing hall a tall black woman who looked like an even match for roberta shook her fist at garp but said not a word perhaps she was another ellen jamesian a few other women were gathering there and garp feared they might be thinking over the advisability of an open attack oddly at the fringe of their group but seeming to have no connection with them was a wraithlike girl or barely grownup child she was a dirty blondheaded girl with piercing eyes the color of coffeestained saucerslike a drugusers eyes or someone long involved in hard tears garp felt frozen by her stare and frightened of heras if she were really crazy a kind of teenage hit man for the womens movement with a gun in her oversized purse he clutched his own ratty bag recalling that his wallet was at least full of credit cards he had enough cash for a cab to the airport and the credit cards could get him a flight to boston and the bosom so to speak of his remaining family he wished he could relieve himself of his ostentatious tits but there they were as if hed been born with themand born too in this alternately tight and baggy jump suit it was all he had and it would have to do from the din escaping from school of nursing hall garp knew that roberta was deep in the throes of debateif not combat someone who had fainted or had been mauled was carried out more police went in your mother was a firstrate nurse and a woman who made every woman proud the nurse named dotty told him ill bet she was a good mother too she sure was garp said the nurse got him a cab the last he saw of her she was walking away from the curb back toward school of nursing hall the other women whod seemed so threatening on the steps outside the building appeared to be not interested in molesting her more police were arriving to garp looked for the strange saucereyed girl but she was not among the other women he asked the cabby who the new governor of new hampshire was garp tried to conceal the depth of his voice but the cabby familiar with the eccentricities of his job seemed unsurprised at both garps voice and garps appearance i was out of the country garp said you didnt miss nothin sweetie the cabby told him that broad broke down sally devlin said garp she cracked up right on the tv the cabby said she was so flipped out over the assassination she couldnt control herself she was givin this speech but she couldnt get through it you know she looked like a real idiot to me the cabby said she couldnt be no governor if she couldnt control herself no better than that and garp saw the pattern of the womans loss emerging perhaps the foul incumbent governor had remarked that ms devlins inability to control her emotions was just like a woman disgraced by her demonstration of her feelings for jenny fields sally devlin was judged not competent enough for whatever dubious work being a governor entailed garp felt ashamed he felt ashamed of other people in my opinion the cabby said it took something like that shooting to show the people that the woman couldnt handle the job you know shut up and drive garp said look honey the cabby said i dont have to put up with no abuse youre an asshole and a moron garp told him and if you dont drive me to the airport with your mouth shut ill tell a cop you tried to paw me all over the cabby floored the accelerator and drove for a while in furious silence hoping the speed and recklessness of his driving would scare his passenger if you dont slow down garp said ill tell a cop you tried to rape me fucking weirdo the cabby said but he slowed down and drove to the airport without another word garp put the money for the tip on the taxis hood and one of the coins rolled into the crack between the hood and fender fucking women the cabby said fucking men said garp feelingwith mixed feelingsthat he had done his duty to ensure that the sex war went on at the airport they questioned garps american express card and asked for further identification inevitably they asked him about the initials t s the airline ticketmaker was clearly not in touch with the literary worldnot to know who t s garp was he told the ticketmaker that t was for tillie s was for sarah tillie sarah garp the ticketmaker said she was a young woman and she clearly disapproved of garps oddly fetching but whorish appearance nothing to check and no carryon luggage garp was asked no nothing he said you have a coat the stewardess asked him also giving him a condescending appraisal no coat garp said the stewardess gave a start at the deepness of his voice no bags and nothing to hang up he said smiling he felt that all he had was breaststhe terrific knockers roberta had made for himand he walked slouched and stoopshouldered to try to hold them back there was no holding them back though as soon as he chose a seat some man chose to sit beside him garp looked out the window passengers were still hurrying to his plane among them he saw a wraithlike dirty blondhaired girl she had no coat and no carryon luggage either just that oversized pursebig enough for a bomb thickly garp sensed the under toada wriggle at his hip he looked toward the aisle so that he would notice where the girl chose to sit but he looked into the leering face of the man whod taken the aisle seat beside him perhaps when were in the air the man said knowingly i could buy you a little drink his small closetogether eyes were riveted on the twisted zipper of garps straining turquoise jump suit garp felt a peculiar kind of unfairness overwhelm him he had not asked to have such an anatomy he wished he could have spent a quiet time just talking with that wise and pleasantlooking woman sally devlin the failed gubernatorial candidate from new hampshire he would have told her that she was too good for the rotten job thats some suit you got said garps leering seat partner go stick it in your ear garp said he was after all the son of a woman whod slashed a masher at a movie in bostonyears ago long ago the man struggled to get up but he couldnt his seat belt would not release him he looked helplessly at garp garp leaned over the mans trapped lap garp gagged on his own dose of perfume which he remembered roberta slathering over him he got the seatbelt clasp to operate properly and released the man with a sharp snap then garp growled a menacing whisper in the mans very red ear when were in the air cutie he whispered to the frightened fellow go blow yourself in the bathroom but when the man deserted garps company the aisle seat was vacant inviting someone else garp glared challengingly at the empty seat daring the next man on the make to sit there the person who approached garp shook his momentary confidence she was very thin her girlish hands bony and clutching her oversized purse she didnt ask first she just sat down the under toad is a very young girl today garp thought when she reached into her purse garp caught her wrist and pulled her hand out of the bag and into her lap she was not strong and in her hand there was no gun there was not even a knife garp saw only a pad of paper and a pencil with the eraser bitten down to a nub im sorry he whispered if she was not an assassin he guessed he knew who or what she was why is my life so full of people with impaired speech he wrote once or is it only because im a writer that i notice all the damaged voices around me the nonviolent waif on the airplane beside him wrote hastily and handed him a note yes yes he said wearily youre an ellen jamesian but the girl bit her lip and fiercely shook her head she pushed the note into his hand my name is ellen james the note informed garp i am not an ellen jamesian youre the ellen james he asked her though it was unnecessary and he knew itjust looking at her he should have known she was the right age not so long ago she would have been that elevenyearold child raped and untongued the dirtysaucer eyes were up close not dirty they were simply bloodshot perhaps insomniac her lower lip was ragged it looked like the pencil eraserbitten down she scribbled more i came from illinois my parents were killed in an auto accident recently i came east to meet your mother i wrote her a letter and she actually answered me she wrote me a wonderful reply she invited me to come stay with her she also told me to read all your books garp turned these tiny pages of notepaper he kept nodding he kept smiling but your mother was killed from the big purse ellen james pulled a brown bandanna into which she blew her nose i went to stay with a womens group in new york but i already knew too many ellen jamesians theyre all i know i get hundreds of christmas cards she wrote she paused for garp to read that line yes yes im sure you do he encouraged her i went to the funeral of course i went because i knew youd be there i knew youd come she wrote she stopped now to smile at him then she hid her face in her dirty brown bandanna you wanted to see me garp said she nodded fiercely she pulled from the big bag her mangled copy of the world according to bensenhaver the best rape story i have ever read wrote ellen james garp winced do you know how many times i have read this book she wrote he looked at her teary admiring eyes he shook his head as mutely as an ellen jamesian she touched his face she had a childlike inability with her hands she held up her fingers for him to count all of one little hand and most of the other she had read his awful book eight times eight times garp murmured she nodded and smiled at him now she settled back in the plane seat as if her life were accomplished now that she was sitting beside him en route to bostonif not with the woman she had admired all the way from illinois at least with the womans only son who would have to suffice have you been to college garp asked her ellen james held up one dirty finger she made an unhappy face one year garp translated but you didnt like it it didnt work out she nodded eagerly and what do you want to be he asked her barely keeping himself from adding when you grow up she pointed to him and blushed she actually touched his gross breasts a writer garp guessed she relaxed and smiled he understood her so easily her face seemed to say garp felt his throat constricting she struck him as one of those doomed children he had read about the ones who have no antibodiesthey have no natural immunities to disease if they dont live their lives in plastic bags they die of their first common cold here was ellen james of illinois out of her sack both your parents were killed garp asked she nodded and bit again her chewed lip and you have no other family he asked her she shook her head he knew what his mother would have done he knew helen wouldnt mind and of course roberta would always be of help and all those women whod been wounded and were now healed in their fashion well you have a family now garp told ellen james he held her hand and winced to hear himself make such an offer he heard the echo of his mothers voice her old soapopera role the adventures of good nurse ellen james shut her eyes as if she had fainted for joy when the stewardess asked her to fasten her seat belt ellen james didnt hear garp fastened her belt for her all the short flight to boston the girl wrote her heart out i hate the ellen jamesians she wrote i would never do this to myself she opened her mouth and pointed to the wide absence in there garp cringed i want to talk i want to say everything wrote ellen james garp noticed that the gnarled thumb and index finger of her writing hand were easily twice the size of the unused instruments on her other hand she had a writing muscle such as hed never seen no writers cramp for ellen james he thought the words come and come she wrote she waited for his approval line by line he would nod she would go on she wrote him her whole life her high school english teacher the only one who mattered her mothers eczema the ford mustang that her father drove too fast i have read everything she wrote garp told her that helen was a big reader too he thought she would like helen the girl looked very hopeful who was your favorite writer when you were a boy joseph conrad garp said she sighed her approval jane austen was mine thats fine garp said to her at logan airport she was almost asleep on her feet garp steered her up the aisles and leaned her on the counters while he filled out the necessary forms for the rental car t s the rentalcar person asked one of garps falsies was slipping sideways and the rentalcar person appeared anxious that this entire turquoise body might selfdestruct in the car north on the dark road to steering ellen james slept like a kitten curled in the back seat in the rearview mirror garp noted that her knee was skinned and that the girl sucked her thumb while she slept it had been a proper funeral for jenny fields after all some essential message had passed from mother to son here he was playing nurse to someone more essentially garp finally understood what his mothers talent had been she had right instinctsjenny fields always did what was right one day garp hoped he would see the connection between this lesson and his own writing but that was a personal goallike others it would take a little time importantly it was in the car north to steering with the real ellen james asleep and in his care that t s garp decided he would try to be more like his mother jenny fields a thought it occurred to him that would have pleased his mother greatly if it had only come to him when she was alive death it seems garp wrote does not like to wait until we are prepared for it death is indulgent and enjoys when it can a flair for the dramatic thus garp with his defenses down and his sense of the under toad fled from himat least since his arrival in bostonwalked into the house of ernie holm his fatherinlaw carrying the sleeping ellen james in his arms she might have been nineteen but she was easier to carry than duncan garp was not prepared for the grizzled face of dean bodger alone in ernies dim living room watching tv the old dean who would soon retire seemed to accept that garp was dressed as a whore but he stared with horror at the sleeping ellen james is she shes asleep garp said wheres everyone and with the voicing of his question garp heard the cold hop of the under toad thudding across the cold floors of the silent house i tried to reach you dean bodger told him its ernie his heart garp guessed yes bodger said they gave helen something to help her sleep shes upstairs and i thought id stay until you got hereyou know so that if the children woke up and needed anything they wouldnt disturb her im sorry garp these things sometimes come all at once or they seem to garp knew how bodger had liked his mother too he put the sleeping ellen james on the livingroom couch and turned off the sickly tv which was turning the girls face bluish in his sleep garp asked bodger pulling off his wig did you find ernie here now the poor dean looked nervous he was on the bed upstairs bodger said i called up the stairs but i knew id have to go up and find him i fixed him up a little before i called anyone fixed him up garp said he unzipped the terrible turquoise jump suit and ripped off his breasts the old dean perhaps thought this was a common traveling disguise of the nowfamous writer please dont ever tell helen bodger said tell her what garp asked bodger brought out the magazineout from under his bulging vest it was the issue of crotch shots where the first chapter of the world according to bensenhaver had been published the magazine looked very worn and used ernie had been looking at it you know bodger said when his heart stopped garp took the magazine from bodger and imagined the death scene ernie holm had been masturbating to the splitbeaver pictures when his heart quit there was a joke during garps days at steering that this was the preferred way to go so ernie had gone that way and the kindly bodger had pulled up the coachs pants and hidden the magazine from the coachs daughter i had to tell the medical examiner you know bodger said a nasty metaphor from his mothers past came up to garp in a wave like nausea but he did not express it to the old dean lust lays another good man low ernies lonely life depressed garp and your mom sighed bodger shaking his head under the cold porch light that glowed into the black steering campus your mom was someone special the old man mused she was a real fighter the scrappy bodger said with pride i still have copies of the notes she wrote to stewart percy you were always nice to her garp reminded him she was worth a hundred stewart percys you know garp bodger said she sure was garp said you know hes gone too bodger said fat stew said garp yesterday bodger said after a long illnessyou know what that usually means dont you no garp said he hadnt ever thought about it cancer usually bodger said gravely he had it for a long time well im sorry garp said he was thinking of pooh and of course of cushie and his old challenger bonkers whose ear in his dreams he could still taste theres going to be some confusion about the steering chapel bodger explained helen can tell you she understands stewart has a service in the morning ernie has his later in the day and of course you know the bit about jenny what bit garp asked the memorial god no garp said a memorial here there are girls here now you know bodger said i should say women he added shaking his head i dont know theyre awfully young theyre girls to me students garp said yes students bodger said the girl students voted to name the infirmary after her the infirmary garp said well its never had a name you know bodger said most of our buildings have names the jenny fields infirmary garp said numbly sort of nice isnt it bodger asked he wasnt too sure if garp would think so but garp didnt care in the long night baby jenny woke up once by the time garp had moved himself away from helens warm and deeply sleeping body he saw that ellen james had already found the crying baby and was warming a bottle odd cooing and grunting sounds appropriate to babies came softly out of the tongueless mouth of ellen james she had worked in a daycare center in illinois she had written garp on the plane she knew all about babies and could even make noises like them garp smiled at her and went back to bed in the morning he told helen about ellen james and they talked about ernie it was good that he went in his sleep helen said when i think of your mother yes yes garp told her duncan was introduced to ellen james oneeyed and notongued thought garp my family will pull together when roberta called to describe her arrest duncanwho was the leasttired talking human in the houseexplained to her about ernies heart attack helen found the turquoise jump suit and the huge loaded bra in the kitchen wastebasket it seemed to cheer her up the cherrycolored vinyl boots actually fit her better than they had fit garp but she threw them out anyway ellen james wanted the green scarf and helen took the girl shopping for some more clothes duncan asked for and received the wig whichto garps irritationhe wore most of the morning dean bodger called to ask to be of use a man who was the new director of physical facilities for the steering school stopped at the house to talk confidentially with garp the physical facilities director explained that ernie had lived in a school house and as soon as it was convenient for helen ernies things should be moved out garp had understood that the original steering family house midge steering percys house had been given back to the school some years agoa gift of midge and fat stew for which a ceremony had been arranged garp told the physical facilities director that he hoped helen had as much time to move out as midge would be given oh well sell that albatross the man confided to garp its a lemon you know the steering family house in garps memory was no lemon all that history garp said i should think youd want itand it was a gift after all the plumbings terrible the man said he implied that in their advancing senility midge and fat stew had let the place fall into a wretched state it may be a lovely old house and all that the young man said but the school has to look ahead weve got enough history around here we cant sink our housing funds into history we need more buildings that the school can use no matter what you do with that old mansion its just another family house when garp told helen that the steering percy house was going to be sold helen broke down of course she was really crying for her father and for everything but the thought that the steering school did not even want the grandest house of their childhood years depressed both garp and helen then garp had to check with the organist at the steering chapel so that the same music would not be played for ernie that in the morning would be played for fat stew this mattered to helen she was upset so garp didnt question the seeming meaninglessness to him of his errand the steering chapel was a squat tudor attempt at a building the church was so wreathed in ivy that it appeared to have thrust itself up out of the ground and was struggling to break through the matted vines the pantlegs of john wolfs dark pinstriped suit dragged under garps heels as he peered into the musty chapelhe had never delivered the suit to a proper tailor but had attempted to take up the pants himself the first wave of gray organ music drifted over garp like smoke he thought he had come early enough but to his dread he saw that fat stews funeral had already begun the audience was old and hardly recognizablethose ancients of the steering school community who would attend anyones death as if in double sympathy they were anticipating their own this death garp thought was chiefly attended because midge was a steering stewart percy had made few friends the pews were pockmarked with widows their little black hats with veils were like dark cobwebs that had fallen on the heads of these old women im glad youre here jack a man in black said to garp garp had slipped almost unnoticed into a back pew he was going to wait out the ordeal and then speak to the organist were short some muscle for the casket the man said and garp recognized himhe was the hearse driver from the funeral home im not a pallbearer garp whispered youve got to be the driver said or well never get him out of here hes a big one the hearse driver smelled of cigars but garp had only to glance about the sundappled pews of the steering chapel to see that the man was right white hair and baldness winked at him from the occasional male heads there must have been thirteen or fourteen canes hooked on the pews there were two wheelchairs garp let the driver take his arm they said thered be more men the driver complained but nobody healthy showed up garp was led to the pew up front across from the family pew to his horror an old man lay stretched out in the pew garp was supposed to sit in and garp was waved instead into the percy pew where he found himself seated next to midge garp briefly wondered if the old man stretched out in the pew was another body waiting his turn thats uncle harris stanfull midge whispered to garp nodding her head to the sleeper who looked like a dead man across the aisle uncle horace salter mother said the man on midges other side garp recognized stewie two redfaced with corpulencethe eldest percy child and sole surviving son he had something to do with aluminum in pittsburgh stewie two hadnt seen garp since garp was five he showed no signs of knowing who garp was neither did midge indicate that she knew anybody anymore wizened and white with brown blotches on her face the size and complexity of unshelled peanuts midge had a jitter in her head that made her bob in her pew like a chicken trying to make up its mind what to peck at a glance garp saw that the pallbearing would be handled by stewie two the hearse driver and himself he doubted that they could manage it how awful to be this unloved he thought looking at the gray ship that was stewart percys casketfortunately closed im sorry young man midge whispered to garp her gloved hand rested as lightly on his arm as one of the percy family parakeets i dont recall your name she said gracious into senility uh garp said and somewhere between the names smith and jones garp stumbled on a word that escaped him smoans he said surprising both midge and himself stewie two did not appear to notice mr smoans midge said yes smoans garp said smoans class of i had mr percy in history my part of the pacific oh yes mr smoans how thoughtful of you to come midge said i was sorry to hear of it mr smoans said yes we all were midge said looking cautiously around the halfempty chapel a convulsion of some kind made her whole face shake and the loose skin on her cheeks made a soft slapping noise mother stewie two cautioned her yes yes stewart she said to mr smoans she said its a pity not all of our children could be here garp of course knew that dopeys strained heart had already quit him that william was lost in a war that cushie was a victim of making babies garp guessed he knew vaguely where poor pooh was to his relief bainbridge percy was not in the family pew it was there in the pew of remaining percys that garp remembered another day where do we go after we die cushie percy once asked her mother fat stew belched and left the kitchen all the percy children were there william whom a war was waiting for dopey whose heart was gathering fat cushie who could not reproduce whose vital tubes would tangle stewie two who turned into aluminum and only god knows what happened to pooh little garp was there tooin the sumptuous country kitchen of the vast grand steering family house well after death midge steering percy told the childrenlittle garp toowe all go to a big house sort of like this one but bigger stewie two said seriously i hope so said william worriedly dopey didnt get what was meant pooh was not old enough to talk cushie said she didnt believe itonly god knows where she went garp thought of the vast grand steering family housenow for sale he realized that he wanted to buy it mr smoans midge nudged him uh garp said the coffin jack whispered the hearse driver stewie two bulging beside him looked seriously toward the enormous casket that now housed the debris of his father we need four the driver said at least four no i can take one side myself garp said mr smoans looks very strong midge said not very large but strong mother stewie two said yes yes stewart she said we need four thats all there is to it the driver said garp didnt believe it he could lift it you two on the other side he said and up she goes a frail mutter reached garp from the mourners at fat stews funeral aghast at the apparently unmovable casket but garp believed in himself it was just death in there of course it would be heavythe weight of his mother jenny fields the weight of ernie holm and of little walt who was the heaviest of all god knows what they all weighed together but garp planted himself on one side of fat stews gray gunboat of a coffin he was ready it was dean bodger who volunteered to be the necessary fourth i never thought youd be here bodger whispered to garp do you know mr smoans midge asked the dean smoans garp said oh yes smoans of course bodger said and the catcher of pigeons the bandylegged sheriff of the steering school lifted his share of the coffin with garp and the others thus they launched fat stew into another life or into another house hopefully bigger bodger and garp trailed behind the stragglers limping and tottering to the cars that would transport them to the steering cemetery when the aged audience was no more around them bodger took garp to busters snack and grill where they sat over coffee bodger apparently accepted that it was garps habit to disguise his sex in the evening and change his name during the day ah smoans bodger said perhaps now your life will settle down and youll be happy and prosperous at least prosperous garp said garp had completely forgotten to ask the organist not to repeat fat stews music for ernie holm garp hadnt noticed the music anyway he wouldnt recognize it if it were repeated and helen hadnt been there she wouldnt know the difference neither garp knew would ernie why dont you stay with us awhile bodger asked garp with his strong pudgy hand sweeping the bleary windows in busters snack and grill the dean indicated the campus of the steering school were not a bad place really he said youre the only place i know garp said neutrally garp knew that his mother had chosen steering once at least for a place to bring up children and jenny fields garp knew had right instincts he drank his coffee and shook dean bodgers hand affectionately garp had one more funeral to get through then with helen he would consider the future habits of the under toad although she received a most cordial invitation from the department of english helen was not sure about teaching at the steering school i thought you wanted to teach again garp said but helen would wait awhile before accepting a job at the school where girls were not admitted when she was a girl perhaps when jennys old enough to go helen said meanwhile im happy to read just read as a writer garp was both envious and mistrustful of people who read as much as helen and they were both developing a fearfulness that worried them here they were thinking so cautiously about their lives as if they were truly old people of course garp had always had this obsession about protecting his children now at last he saw that jenny fields old notion of wanting to continue living with her son was not so abnormal after all the garps would stay at steering they had all the money they would ever need helen didnt have to do anything if she didnt want to but garp needed something to do youre going to write helen said tiredly not for a while garp said maybe never again at least not for a while this really did strike helen as a sign of rather premature senility but she had come to share his anxiousnesshis desire to keep what he had including sanityand she knew that he shared with her the vulnerability of conjugal love she did not say anything to him when he went to the steering athletic department and offered himself as ernie holms replacement you dont have to pay me he told them money doesnt matter to me i just want to be the wrestling coach of course they had to admit he would do a decent job what had been a strong program would begin to slump without a replacement for ernie you dont want any money the chairman of the athletic department asked him i dont need any money garp told him what i need is something to dosomething thats not writing except for helen no one knew that there were only two things in this world that t s garp ever learned to do he could write and he could wrestle helen was perhaps the only one who knew why he couldnt at the moment write her theory would later be expressed by the critic a j harms who claimed that garps work was progressively weakened by its closer and closer parallels to his personal history as he became more autobiographical his writing grew narrower also he became less comfortable about doing it it was as if he knew that not only was the work more personally painful to himthis memory dredgingbut the work was slimmer and less imaginative in every way harms wrote garp had lost the freedom of imagining life truly which he had so early promised himself and us all with the brilliance of the pension grillparzer according to harms garp could now be truthful only by remembering and that methodas distinct from imaginingwas not only psychologically harmful to him but far less fruitful but the hindsight of harms is easy helen knew this was garps problem the day he accepted the job as wrestling coach at the steering school he would be nowhere near as good as ernie they both knew but he would run a respectable program and garps wrestlers would always win more than they would lose try fairy tales helen suggested she thought of his writing more often than he did try making something up the whole thingcompletely made up she never said like the pension grillparzer she never mentioned it although she knew that he now agreed with her it was the best he had done sadly it had been the first whenever garp would try to write he would see only the dull undeveloped facts of his personal life the gray parking lot in new hampshire the stillness of walts small body the hunters glossy coats and their red capsand the sexless selfrighteous fanaticism of pooh percy those images went nowhere he spent a great deal of time fussing with his new house midge steering percy never knew who bought her familys mansion and her gift to the steering school if stewie two ever found it out he was at least smart enough never to tell his mother whose memory of garp was clouded by her fresher memory of the nice mr smoans midge steering percy died in a nursing home in pittsburgh because of what stewie two had to do with aluminum he had moved his mother into a nursing home not far from where all that metal was made god knows what happened to pooh helen and garp fixed up the old steering mansion as it was called by many in the school community the name percy faded fast in most memories now midge was always referred to as midge steering garps new home was the classiest place on or near the steering campus and when the steering students gave guided tours of the campus to parents and to prospective steering students they rarely said and this is where t s garp the writer lives it was the original steering family house circa the students were more playful than that what they usually said was and this is where our wrestling coach lives and the parents would look at one another politely and the prospective student would ask is wrestling a big sport at steering very soon garp thought duncan would be a steering student it was an unembarrassed pleasure that garp looked forward to he missed duncans presence in the wrestling room but he was happy that the boy had found his place the swimmin poolwhere either his nature or his eyesight or both felt completely comfortable duncan sometimes visited the wrestling room swaddled in towels and shivering from the pool he sat on the soft mats under one of the blow heaters getting warm how you doing garp would ask him youre not wet are you dont drip on the mat okay no i wont duncan would say im just fine more frequently helen visited the wrestling room she was reading everything again and she would come to the wrestling room to readlike reading in a sauna she often saidoccasionally looking up from what she was reading when there was an unusually loud slam or a cry of pain the only thing that had ever been hard for helen about reading in a wrestling room was that her glasses kept fogging up are we already middleaged helen asked garp one night in their beautiful house from the front parlor of which on a clear night they could see the window squares of light in the jenny fields infirmary and look over the greenblack lawn to the solitary night light above the door of the infirmary annexfar awaywhere garp had lived as a child jesus garp said middleaged we are already retiredthats what we are we skipped middle age altogether and moved directly into the world of the elderly does that depress you helen asked him cautious not yet garp said when it starts to depress me ill do something else or ill do something anyway i figure helen that we got a head start on everyone else we can afford to take a long timeout helen grew tired of garps wrestling terminology but she had grown up with it after all it was water off a duck for helen holm and although garp wasnt writing he seemed to helen to be happy helen read in the evenings and garp watched tv garps work had developed a curious reputation not altogether unlike what he would have wanted for himself and even stranger than john wolf had imagined although it embarrassed garp and john wolf to see how politically the world according to bensenhaver was both admired and despised the books reputation had caused readers even if for the wrong reasons to return to garps earlier work garp politely refused invitations to speak at colleges where he was wanted to represent one side or another of socalled womens issues also to speak on his relationship to his mother and her work and the sex roles he ascribed to various characters in his books the destruction of art by sociology and psychoanalysis he called it but there were an almost equal number of invitations for him simply to read from his own fiction an occasional one or two of theseespecially if it was somewhere helen wanted to gohe accepted garp was happy with helen he wasnt unfaithful to her anymore that thought seldom occurred to him it was perhaps his contact with ellen james that finally cured him of ever looking at young girls in that way as for other womenhelens age and oldergarp exercised a willpower that was not especially difficult for him enough of his life had been influenced by lust ellen james who was eleven when she was raped and untongued was nineteen when she moved in with the garps she was immediately an older sister to duncan and a fellow member of the maimed society to which duncan shyly belonged they were so close she helped duncan with his homework because ellen james was very good at reading and writing duncan interested ellen in swimming and in photography garp built them a darkroom in the steering mansion and they spent hours in the dark developing and developingduncans ceaseless babble concerning lens openings and light and the wordless ooohs and aaahs of ellen james helen bought them a movie camera and ellen and duncan wrote a screenplay together and acted in their own moviethe story of a blind prince whose vision is partially restored by kissing a young cleaning woman only one of the princes eyes is restored to sight because the cleaning woman allows the prince only to kiss her on the cheek she is embarrassed to let anyone kiss her on the lips because she has lost her tongue despite their handicaps and their compromises the young couple marries the involved story is told through pantomime and subtitles which ellen wrote the best thing about the film duncan would say later is that its only seven minutes long ellen james was also a great help to helen with baby jenny ellen and duncan were expert babysitters with the girl whom garp took to the wrestling room on sunday afternoons there he claimed she would learn to walk and run and fall without hurting herself although helen claimed that the mat would give the child the misconception that the world underfoot felt like a barely firm sponge but that is what the world does feel like garp said since he had stopped writing the only ongoing friction in garps life concerned his relationship with his best friend roberta muldoon but roberta was not the source of the friction when jenny fields was dead and gone garp discovered that her estate was tremendous and that jenny as if to plague her son had designated him to be the executor of her last wishes for her fabulous loot and the mansion for wounded women at dogs head harbor why me garp had howled why not you garp yelled at roberta but roberta muldoon was rather hurt that it hadnt been her i cant imagine why you indeed roberta admitted of all people mom was out to get me garp decided or she was out to make you think roberta suggested what a good mother she was oh boy garp said for weeks he puzzled over the single sentence that stated jennys intentions for the spending of her money and the use of her enormous seacoast house i want to leave a place where worthy women can go to collect themselves and just be themselves by themselves oh boy garp said a kind of foundation roberta guessed the fields foundation garp suggested thats terrific roberta said yes grants for womenand a place to go to go do what garp said and grants for what to go get well if they have to or to go be by themselves if thats what they need roberta said and to write if thats what they door paint or a home for unwed mothers garp said a grant for getting well oh boy be serious roberta said this is important dont you see she wanted you to understand the need she wanted you to have to deal with the problems and who decides if a woman is worthy garp asked oh boy mom he cried out i could wring your neck for this shit you decide roberta said thats what will make you think how about you garp asked this is your kind of thing roberta roberta was clearly torn she shared with jenny fields the desire to educate garp and other men concerning the legitimacy and complexity of womens needs she also thought garp would be rather terrible at this and she knew she would do it very well well do it together roberta said that is youre in charge but ill advise you ill tell you when i think youre making a mistake roberta garp said youre always telling me im making a mistake roberta at her most flirtatious kissed him on the lips and clubbed him on the shoulderin both cases so hard that he winced jesus garp said the fields foundation roberta cried its going to be wonderful thus was friction kept in the life of t s garp who without friction of some kind would probably have lost his senses and his grip upon the world it was friction that kept garp alive when he wasnt writing roberta muldoon and the fields foundation would provide him with friction at the very least roberta became the inresidence administrator of the fields foundation at dogs head harbor the house became all at once a writers colony a recovery center and a birthadvisory clinicand the few welllit garret rooms provided light and solitude for painters once women knew that there was a fields foundation there were many women who wondered who was eligible for aid garp wondered too all applicants wrote roberta who assembled a small staff of women who alternately liked and disliked garpbut always argued with him together twice a month roberta and her board of trustees would assemble in garps grouchy presence and choose among the applicants in good weather they sat in the balmy sideporch room of the dogs head harbor estate although garp increasingly refused to go there all the weirdosinresidence garp told roberta they remind me of other times so then they met at steering in the steering family mansion the wrestling coachs home where garp felt slightly more comfortable in the company of these fierce women he would have felt more comfortable no doubt to have met them all in the wrestling room though even there garp knew perfectly well the former robert muldoon would have made garp struggle for his every point applicant no was named charlie pulaski i thought they had to be women garp said i thought there was at least one firm criterion charlie pulaski is a woman roberta told garp shes just always been called charlie i should say that was enough to disqualify her someone said it was marcia foxa lean spare poet with whom garp frequently crossed swords although he admired her poems he could never be that economical what does charlie pulaski want garp asked by rote some of the applicants only wanted money some of them wanted to live at dogs head harbor for a while some of them wanted lots of money and a room at dogs head harbor forever she just wants money roberta said to change her name asked marcia fox she wants to quit her job and write a book roberta said oh boy said garp advise her to keep her job said marcia fox she was one of those writers who resented other writers and wouldbe writers marcia even resents dead writers garp told roberta but marcia and garp both read a manuscript submitted by ms charlie pulaski and they agreed that she should hold on to whatever job she could get applicant no an associate professor of microbiology wanted time off from her job to write a book too a novel garp asked studies in molecular virology said dr joan axe she was on leave from the duke university medical center to do some research of her own when garp asked her what it was she had told him mysteriously that she was interested in the unseen diseases of the bloodstream applicant no had an uninsured husband who was killed in a plane crash she had three children under the age of five and she needed fifteen more semester hours to complete her ma degree in french she wanted to go back to school get the degree and find a decent job she wanted money for thisand rooms enough for her children and for a babysitter at dogs head harbor the board of trustees unanimously decided to award the woman sufficient money to complete her degree and to pay a livein babysitter but the children the babysitter and the woman would all have to live wherever the woman chose to complete her degree dogs head harbor was not for children and babysitters there were women there who would go crazy upon the sight or sound of a single child there were women there whose lives had been made miserable by babysitters that was an easy one to decide no caused some problems she was the divorced wife of the man who had killed jenny fields she had three children one of whom was in a reform school for preteens and her childsupport payments had stopped when her husband jenny fields assassin was shot by a barrage from the new hampshire state police and some other hunters with guns who had been cruising the parking lot the deceased kenny truckenmiller had been divorced less than a year hed told friends that the child support was breaking his ass he said that womens lib had screwed up his wife so much that she divorced him the lawyer who got the job done in favor of mrs truckenmiller was a new york divorcee kenny truckenmiller had beaten his wife at least twice weekly for almost thirteen years and he had physically and mentally abused each of his three children on several occasions but mrs truckenmiller had not known enough about herself or what rights she might possibly have until she read a sexual suspect the autobiography of jenny fields that started her thinking that perhaps the suffering of her weekly beatings and the abuse of her children was actually kenny truckenmillers fault for thirteen years she had thought it was her problem and her lot in life kenny truckenmiller had blamed the womens movement for the selfeducation of his wife mrs truckenmiller had always been selfemployed a hair stylist in the town of north mountain new hampshire she went right on being a hair stylist when kenny was forced by the court to move out of her house but now that kenny was no longer driving a truck for the town mrs truckenmiller found the support of her family difficult by hair styling alone she wrote in her nearly illegible application that she had been forced to compromise herself to make ends meet and that she did not care to repeat the act of compromising herself in the future mrs truckenmiller who never once referred to herself as having a first name realized that the loathing for her husband was so great as to prejudice the board against her she would understand she wrote if they chose to ignore her john wolf who was against his will an honorary member of the boardand valued for his shrewd financial headsaid immediately that nothing could be better or wider publicity for the fields foundation than awarding this unfortunate relation of jennys killer what she asked for it would be instant news it would pay for itself john wolf decided in that it would surely gain the foundation untold sums in gift donations were already doing pretty well on gift donations garp hedged suppose shes just a whore roberta suggested of the unfortunate mrs truckenmiller they all stared at her roberta had an advantage among them of being able to think like a woman and like a philadelphia eagle just think a minute roberta said suppose shes just a floozy someone who compromises herself all the time and always hasand thinks nothing of it then suddenly were a joke then weve been had so we need a character reference said marcia fox someones got to see the woman talk with her garp suggested find out if shes honorable if shes really trying to live independently they all stared at him well roberta said im not about to discover whether shes a whore or not oh no garp said not me wheres north mountain new hampshire asked marcia fox not me john wolf said im out of new york too much of the time as it is oh boy garp said suppose she recognizes me people do you know i doubt she will said hilma bloch a psychiatric social worker whom garp detested those people most motivated to read autobiographies such as your mothers are rarely attracted to fictionor only tangentially that is if she read the world according to bensenhaver she would have done so only because of who you are and that would not have been sufficient reason to cause her to finish the book in all probabilityand given the fact that shes a hair stylist after allshe would have bogged down and not read it and not remembered your picture on the cover eitheronly your face and only vaguely you were a face in the news of course but really only around the time of jennys murder surely at that time jennys face was the face to recall a woman like this watches a lot of television shes not a bookworld person i strongly doubt that a woman like this would even have a picture of you in her mind john wolf rolled his eyes away from ielma bloch even roberta rolled her eyes thank you hilma said garp quietly it was decided that garp would visit mrs truckenmiller to determine something more concrete about her character at least find out her first name said marcia fox ill bet its charlie roberta said they passed on to the reports who was living presently at dogs head harbor whose tenancy was expiring who was about to move in and what were the problems there if any there were two paintersone in the south garret one in the north the southgarret painter coveted the northgarret painters light and for two weeks they didnt get along not a word to each other at breakfast and accusations concerning lost mail and so forth then it appeared they became lovers now only the northgarret painter was painting at allstudies of the southgarret painter who modeled all day in the good light her nakedness about the upstairs of the house bothered at least one of the writers an outspoken antilesbian playwright from cleveland who had trouble sleeping she said because of the sound of the waves it was probably the lovemaking of the painters that bothered her she was described as overextended anyway but her complaints ceased once the other writerinresidence suggested that all the dogs head harbor guests read aloud the parts of the dramatists play in progress this was done successfully for all and the upper floors of the house were now happy the other writer a good shortstory writer whom garp had enthusiastically recommended a year ago was about to move out however her term of residency was expiring who would go in her room the woman whose motherinlaw had just won custody of her children following the suicide of her husband i told you not to accept her garp said the two ellen jamesians who just one day showed up now wait a minute garp said whats this ellen jamesians showing up thats not allowed jenny always took them in roberta said this is now roberta garp said the other members of the board were more or less in agreement with him ellen jamesians were not much admiredthey never had been and their radicalism now seemed growingly obsolete and pathetic its almost a tradition though roberta said she described two old ellen jamesians whod been back from a bad time in california years ago they had stayed at dogs head harbor returning there roberta argued was a kind of sentimental recovery for them jesus roberta garp said get rid of them they were people your mother always took care of roberta said at least theyll be quiet said marcia fox whose economy of tongue garp did admire but only garp laughed i think you should get them to leave roberta dr joan axe said they really resent the entire society hilma bloch said that could be infectious on the other hand they are almost the essence of the spirit of the place john wolf rolled his eyes there is the doctor researching cancerrelated abortions joan axe said what about her yes put her on the second floor garp said ive met her shell scare the shit out of anyone who tries to come upstairs roberta frowned the downstairs of the dogs head harbor mansion was the largest part containing two kitchens and four complete baths as many as twelve could sleep very privately downstairs and there were still the various conference rooms as roberta now called themthey were parlors and giant dens in the days of jenny fields and a vast dining room where food mail and whoever wanted company collected all during the day and night it was the most social floor of dogs head harbor usually not suited for the writers and painters it was the best floor for the potential suicides garp had told the board because theyll be forced to drown themselves in the ocean rather than jump out the windows but roberta ran the place in a strong motherly tightend fashion she could talk almost anyone out of anything and if she couldnt she could overpower anybody she had been much more successful at making the local police her allies than jenny ever had been occasional unhappies were picked up by the police far down the beach or wailing on the boardwalks of the village they were always gently returned to roberta the dogs head harbor police were all football fans full of respect for the savage line play and the vicious downfield blocking of the former robert muldoon i would like to make a motion that no ellen jamesian be eligible for aid and comfort from the fields foundation garp said second said marcia fox this is open to discussion roberta told them all i dont see the necessity of having such a rule we are not in the business of supporting what we largely would agree is a stupid form of political expression but that doesnt mean that one of these women without a tongue couldnt be genuinely in need of helpid say in fact they have already demonstrated a definite need to locate themselves and we can expect to go on hearing from them they are truly needful people they are insane garp said this is too general said hilma bloch there are productive women marcia fox said who have not given up their voicesin fact they are fighting to use their voicesand i am not in favor of rewarding stupidity and selfimposed silence there are virtues in silence roberta argued jesus roberta garp said and then he saw a light in this dark subject for some reason the ellen jamesians made him angrier than his image even of the kenny truckenmillers of this world and although he saw that the ellen jamesians were fading from fashion they could not fade fast enough to suit garp he wanted them gone he wanted them more than gonehe wanted them disgraced helen had already told him that his hatred of them was inappropriate to what they were its just madness and simplemindedwhat theyve done helen said why cant you ignore them and leave them alone but garp said lets ask ellen james thats fair isnt it lets ask ellen james for her opinion of the ellen jamesians jesus id like to publish her opinion of them do you know how theyve made her feel this is too personal a matter hilma bloch said they had all met ellen they all knew that ellen james hated being tongueless and hated the ellen jamesians lets back off this for now john wolf said i move we table the motion damn garp said all right garp roberta said lets vote it right now they all knew they would vote it down that would get rid of it i withdraw the motion garp said nastily long live the ellen jamesians but he did not withdraw it was madness that had killed jenny fields his mother it was extremism it was selfrighteous fanatical and monstrous selfpity kenny truckenmiller was only a special kind of moron a true believer who was also a thug he was a man who pitied himself so blindly that he could make absolute enemies out of people who contributed only the ideas to his undoing and how was an ellen jamesian any different was not her gesture as desperate and as empty of an understanding of human complexity come on john wolf said they havent murdered anyone not yet garp said they have the equipment they are capable of making mindless decisions and they believe they are so right theres more to killing someone than that roberta said they let garp seethe what else could they do it was not one of garps better points tolerance of the intolerant crazy people made him crazy it was as if he personally resented them giving in to madnessin part because he so frequently labored to behave sanely when some people gave up the labor of sanity or failed at it garp suspected them of not trying hard enough tolerance of the intolerant is a difficult task that the times asks of us helen said although garp knew helen was intelligent and often more farseeing than he was he was rather blind about the ellen jamesians they of course were rather blind about him the most radical criticism of garpconcerning his relationship to his mother and his own workshad come from various ellen jamesians baited by them he baited them back it was hard to see why it should have started or if it should have but garp had become a case of controversy among feminists largely through the goading of ellen jamesiansand garp goading them in return for the very same reasons garp was liked by many feminists and disliked by as many as for the ellen jamesians they were no more complicated in their feelings for garp than they were complicated in their symbology their tongues hacked off for the hackedoff tongue of ellen james ironically it would be ellen james who escalated this longtime cold war she was in the habit constantly of showing garp her writingher many stories her remembrances of her parents of illinois her poems her painful analogies to speechlessness her appreciations of the visual arts and swimming shes the real thing garp kept telling helen shes got the ability but shes also got the passion and i believe shell have the stamina the aforementioned stamina was a word helen let slide away because she feared for garp that he had given up his he certainly had the ability and the passion but she felt hed also taken a narrow pathhed been misdirectedand only stamina would let him grow back in all the other ways it saddened her for the time being helen kept thinking she would content herself with whatever garp got passionate aboutthe wrestling even the ellen jamesians because helen believed energy begets energyand sooner or later she thought he would write again so helen did not interfere too vehemently when garp got excited about the essay ellen james showed him the essay was why im not an ellen jamesian by ellen james it was powerful and touching and it moved garp to tears it recounted her rape her difficulty with it her parents difficulty with it it made what the ellen jamesians did seem like a shallow wholly political imitation of a very private trauma ellen james said that the ellen jamesians had only prolonged her anguish they had made her into a very public casualty of course garp was susceptible to being moved by public casualties and of course to be fair the better of the ellen jamesians had meant to publicize the general dread that so brutally menaced women and girls for many of the ellen jamesians the imitation of the horrible untonguing had not been wholly political it had been a most personal identification in some cases of course ellen jamesians were women who had also been raped what they meant was that they felt as if their tongues were gone in a world of men they felt as if they had been shut up forever that the organization was full of crazies no one would deny not even some ellen jamesians would have denied that it was generally true that they were an inflammatory political group of feminist extremists who often detracted from the extreme seriousness of other women and other feminists around them but ellen james attack on them was as inconsiderate of the occasional individuals among the ellen jamesians as the action of the group had been inconsiderate of ellen jamesnot really thinking how an elevenyearold girl would have preferred to get over her horror more privately everyone in america knew how ellen james had lost her tongue except the younger generation just now growing up who often confused ellen with the ellen jamesians this was a most painful confusion for ellen because it meant that she was suspected of having done it to herself it was a necessary rage for her to have helen said to garp about ellens essay im sure she needed to write it and its done her a world of good to say all this ive told her that ive told her she should publish it garp said no helen said i really dont think so what good does it do what good garp asked well its the truth and it will be good for ellen and for you helen asked knowing that he wanted a kind of public humiliation of the ellen jamesians okay he said okay okay but shes right goddamnit those nuts ought to hear it from the original source but why said helen for whose good good good garp muttered though in his heart he must have known that helen was right he told ellen she should file her essay ellen wouldnt communicate with either garp or helen for a week it was not until john wolf called garp that either garp or helen realized ellen had sent the essay to john wolf what am i suppose to do with it he asked god send it back helen said no damn it garp said ask ellen what she wants you to do with it old pontius pilate washing his hands helen said to garp what do you want to do with it garp asked john wolf me john wolf said it means nothing to me but im sure its publishable i mean its very well written thats not why its publishable garp said and you know it well no john wolf said but its also nice that its well said ellen told john wolf she wanted it published helen tried to talk her out of it garp refused to get involved you are involved helen told him and by saying nothing you know youll get what you want that painful attack published thats what you want so garp spoke to ellen james he tried to be enthusiastic in his reasoning to herwhy she shouldnt publicly say all those things these women were sick sad confused tortured abused by others and now selfabusedbut what point was there in criticizing them everyone would forget them in another five years theyll hand out their notes and people will say whats an ellen jamesian you mean you cant talk you got no tongue ellen looked sullen and determined i wont forget them she wrote garp not in years not in years will i ever forget them i will remember them the way i remember my tongue garp admired how the girl liked to use the good old semicolon he said softly i think its better not to publish this ellen will you be angry with me if i do she asked he admitted he would not be angry and helen helen will only be angry with me garp said you make people too angry helen told him in bed you get them all wound up you inflame you should lay off you should do your own work garp just your own work you used to say politics were stupid and they meant nothing to you you were right they are stupid they do mean nothing youre doing this because its easier than sitting down and making something up from scratch and you know it youre building bookshelves all over the house and finishing floors and fucking around in the garden for christs sake did i marry a handyman did i ever expect you to be a crusader you should be writing the books and letting other people make the shelves and you know im right garp youre right he said he tried to remember what had enabled him to imagine that first sentence of the pension grillparzer my father worked for the austrian tourist bureau where had it come from he tried to think of sentences like it what he got was a sentence like this the boy was five years old he had a cough that seemed deeper than his small bony chest what he got was memory and that made muck he had no pure imagination anymore in the wrestling room he worked out three straight days with the heavyweight to punish himself more fucking around in the garden so to speak said helen then he announced he had a mission a trip to make for the fields foundation to north mountain new hampshire to determine if a fields foundation fellowship would be wasted on a woman named truckenmiller more fucking around in the garden helen said more bookshelves more politics more crusades thats the kind of thing people do who cant write but he was gone he was out of the house when john wolf called to say that a very well read and much seen magazine was going to publish why im not an ellen jamesian by ellen james john wolfs voice over the phone had the cold unseen quick flick of the tongue of old youknowwhothe under toad thats who helen thought but she didnt know why not yet she told ellen james the news helen forgave ellen immediately and even allowed herself to be excited with her they took a drive to the shore with duncan and little jenny they bought lobstersellens favoriteand enough scallops for garp who was not crazy about lobster champagne ellen wrote in the car does champagne go with lobster and scallops of course helen said it can they bought champagne they stopped at dogs head harbor and invited roberta to dinner when will dad be back duncan asked i dont know where north mountain new hampshire is helen said but he said hed be back in time to eat with us thats what he told me too said ellen james nanettes beauty salon in north mountain new hampshire was really the kitchen of mrs kenny truckenmiller whose first name was harriet are you nanette garp asked her timidly from the outside steps frosted with salt and crunchy with melting slush there aint no nanette she told him im harriet truckenmiller behind her in the dark kitchen a large dog strained and snarled mrs truckenmiller kept the dog from getting to garp by thrusting her long hip back against the lunging beast her pale scarred ankle wedged open the kitchen door her slippers were blue in her long robe her figure was lost but garp could see she was talland that she had been taking a bath uh do you do mens hair he asked her no she said but would you garp asked her i dont trust barbers harriet truckenmiller looked suspiciously at garps black knit ski hat which was pulled down over his ears and concealed all his hair but the thick tufts that touched his shoulders from the back of his short neck i cant see your hair she said he took the stocking hat off his hair wild with static electricity and tangled in the cold wind i dont want just a haircut garp said neutrally eyeing the womans sad drawn face and the soft wrinkles beside her gray eyes her own hair a washedout blond was in curlers you dont have no appointment harriet truckenmiller said the woman was no whore he could plainly see she was tired and frightened of him what exactly do you want done to your hair anyway she asked him just a trim garp mumbled but i like a slight curl in it a curl said harriet truckenmiller trying to imagine this from garps crown of very straight hair like a permanent you mean she asked well he said running his hand sheepishly through the snarls whatever you can do with it you know harriet truckemniller shrugged i have to get dressed she said the dog devious and strong thrust most of his stout body between her legs and jammed his broad grimacing face into the opening between the storm and the main door garp tensed for the attack but harriet truckenmiller brought her big knee up sharply and staggered the animal with a blow to its muzzle she twisted her hand into the loose skin of its neck the dog moaned and melted into the kitchen behind her the frozen yard garp saw was a mosaic of the dogs huge turds captured in ice there were also three cars in the yard garp doubted if any of them ran there was a woodpile but no one had stacked it there was a tv antenna which at one time might have been on the roof now it leaned against the beige aluminum siding of the house its wires running like a spider web out a cracked window mrs truckenmiller stepped back and opened the door for garp in the kitchen he felt his eyes dry from the heat of the wood stove the room smelled of baking cookies and hair rinsein fact the kitchen seemed divided between the functions of a kitchen and the paraphernalia of harriets business a pink sink with a shampoo hose cans of stewed tomatoes a threeway mirror framed with stage lights a wooden rack with spices and meat tenderizer the rows of ointments lotions and goo and a steel stool over which a hair dryer hung suspended from a steel rodlike an original invention of an electric chair the dog was gone and so was harriet truckenmiller she had slipped away to dress herself and her surly companion appeared to have gone with her garp combed his hair he looked in the mirror as if he were trying to remember himself he was about to be altered and rendered unrecognizable to all he imagined then the door to the outside opened and a big man in a hunting coat with a hunters red cap walked in he had an enormous armload of wood which he carried to the wood box by the stove the dog who all along had been crouched under the sinkinches away from garps trembling kneesmoved quickly to intercept the man the dog slunk quietly not even growling the man was known here go lie down you damn fool he said and the dog did as it was told is that you dickie called harriet truckenmiller from somewhere in another part of the house who else was you expectin he shouted then he turned and saw garp in front of the mirror hello garp said the big man called dickie stared he was perhaps fifty his huge red face looked scraped by ice and garp recognized immediately from his familiarity with duncans expressions that the man had a glass eye lo dickie said i got a customer harriet called i see you do said dickie garp nervously touched his hair as if he could suggest to dickie how important his hair was to himto have come all the way to north mountain new hampshire and nanettes beauty salon for what must have appeared to dickie to be the simple need of a haircut he wants a curl called harriet dickie kept his red cap on though garp could plainly see that the man was bald i dont know what you really want fella dickie whispered to garp but a curl is all you get you hear i dont trust barbers garp said i dont trust you dickie said dickie he hasnt done anything harriet truckenmiller said she was dressed in rather tight turquoise slacks which reminded garp of his discarded jump suit and a print blouse full of flowers that never grow in new hampshire her hair was tied back with a scarf of unmatching plants and she had done her face but not overdone it she looked nice like somebodys mother who bothered to keep herself up she was garp guessed a few years younger than dickie but just a few he dont want no curl harriet dickie said whats he want to have his hair played with for huh he dont trust barbers harriet truckenmiller said for a brief moment garp wondered if dickie were a barber he didnt think so i really dont mean any disrespect garp said he had seen all he needed to see he wanted to go tell the fields foundation to give harriet truckermiller all the money she needed if this makes anyone uncomfortable garp said ill just forget it he reached for his parka which hed put on an empty chair but the big dog had the parka pinned down on the floor please you can stay mrs truckenmiller said dickies just lookin after me dickie looked ashamed of himself he stood with one mighty boot on top of the other i brung you some dry wood he said to harriet i guess i shoulda knocked he pouted by the stove dont dickie harriet said to him and she kissed him fondly on his big pink cheek he left the kitchen with one last glare for garp hope you get a good haircut dickie said thank you said garp when he spoke the dog shook his parka here stop that harriet told the dog she put garps parka back on the chair you can go if you want to harriet said but dickie wont bother you hes just lookin after me your husband garp asked though he doubted it my husband was kenny truckenmiller harriet said everybody knows that and no matter who you are you know who he was yes garp said dickies my brother he just worries about me harriet said some guys have been messin around since kennys gone she sat at the bright counter of mirrors beside garp and leaned her long veiny hands on her turquoise thighs she sighed she did not look at garp when she spoke i dont know what you heard and i dont care she said i do hairjust hair if you really want somethin done to your hair ill do it but thats all i do harriet said no matter what anybody told you i dont mess around just hair just hair garp said i just want my hair done thats all thats good she said still not looking at him there were little photographs stuck under the molding and framed against the mirrors one was a wedding picture of young harriet truckenmiller and her grinning husband kenny they were awkwardly maiming a cake another photograph was of a pregnant harriet truckenmiller holding a young baby there was another child maybe walts age leaning his cheek against her hip harriet looked tired but not daunted and there was a photograph of dickie he was standing next to kenny truckenmiller and they were both standing next to a gutted deer hung upsidedown from the branch of a tree the tree was in the front yard of nanettes beauty salon garp recognized that photograph quickly he had seen it in a national magazine after jennys assassination the photograph apparently demonstrated to the simpleminded that kenny truckemniller was a bornandraised killer besides shooting jenny fields he had at one time shot a deer why nanette garp asked harriet later when he dared look only at her patient fingers and not at her unhappy faceand not at his hair i thought it sounded sort of french harriet said but she knew he was from somewhere in the outside worldoutside north mountain new hampshireand she laughed at herself well it does garp said laughing with her sort of he added and they both laughed in a friendly way when he was ready to go she wiped the slobber of the dog off his parka with a sponge arent you even going to look at it she asked him she meant the hairdo he took a breath and confronted himself in the threeway mirror his hair he thought was beautiful it was his same old hair the same color even the same length but it seemed to fit his head for the first time in his life his hair clung to his skull yet it was still light and fluffy a slight wave in it made his broken nose and his squat neck appear less severe garp seemed to himself to fit his own face in a way he had never thought possible this was the first beauty salon he had ever been to of course in fact jenny had cut his hair until he married helen and helen had cut his hair after that he had never even been to a barber its lovely he said his missing ear remained artfully hidden oh go on harriet said giving him a pleasant little shovebut he would tell the fields foundation not a suggestive shove not at all he wanted to tell her then that he was jenny fields son but he knew that his motive for doing so would have been wholly selfishto have been personally responsible for moving someone it is unfair to take advantage of anyones emotional vulnerability wrote the polemical jenny fields thus garps new creed capitalize not on the emotions of others thank you and goodbye he said to mrs truckenmiller outside dickie wielded a splitting ax in the woodpile he did it very well he stopped splitting when garp appeared goodbye garp called to him but dickie walked over to garpwith the ax lets get a look at the hairdo dickie said garp stood still while dickie examined him you were a friend of kenny truckenmillers garp asked yup dickie said i was his only friend i introduced him to harriet dickie said garp nodded dickie eyed the new hairdo its tragic garp said he meant everything that had happened it aint bad dickie said he meant garps hair jenny fields was my mother garp said because he wanted someone to know and he felt certain he was taking no emotional advantage of dickie you didnt tell her that did you dickie said pointing toward the house and harriet with his long ax no no garp said thats good dickie said she dont want to hear nothinlike that i didnt think so garp said and dickie nodded approvingly your sister is a very nice woman garp added she is she is dickie said nodding fiercely well so long garp said but dickie touched him lightly with the handle of the ax i was one of them who shot him dickie said you know that you shot kenny garp said i was one of them who did dickie said kenny was crazy somebody had to shoot him im very sorry garp said dickie shrugged i liked the guy dickie said but he got crazy at harriet and he got crazy at your mother he wouldnt ever have got well you know dickie said he just got sick about women he got sick for good you could tell he wasnt ever going to get over it a terrible thing said garp so long dickie said he turned back to his woodpile garp turned toward his car across the frozen turds that dotted the yard your hair looks good dickie called to him the remark seemed sincere dickie was splitting logs again when garp waved to him from the drivers seat of his car in the window of nanettes beauty salon harriet truckenmiller waved to garp it was not a wave meant to encourage him or anything he was quite sure he drove back through the village of north mountainhe drank a cup of coffee in the one diner he got gas at the one gas station everyone looked at his pretty hair in every mirror garp looked at his pretty hair then he drove home arriving in time for the celebration ellens first publication if it made him as uneasy as the news had made helen he did not admit it he sat through the lobster the scallops and the champagne waiting for helen or duncan to comment on his hair it was only when he was doing the dishes that ellen james handed him a soggy note you had your hair done he nodded irritably i dont like it helen told him in bed i think its terrific garp said its not like you helen said she was doing her best to muss it up it looks like the hair on a corpse she said in the darkness a corpse garp said jesus a body prepared by an undertaker said helen almost frantically running her hands through his hair every little hair in place she said its too perfect you dont look alive she said then she cried and cried and garp held her and whispered to hertrying to find out what the matter was garp did not share her sense of the under toadnot this timeand he talked and talked to her and made love to her finally she fell asleep the essay by ellen james why im not an ellen jamesian appeared to engender no immediate fuss it takes a while for most letters to the editor to be printed there were the expectable personal letters to ellen james condolences from idiots propositions from sick menthe ugly antifeminist tyrants and baiters of women who as garp had warned ellen would see themselves as being on her side people will always make sides garp said of everything there was not a written word from a single ellen jamesian garps first steering wrestling team produced an season as it approached its final dual meet with its arch rival the bad boys from bath of course the teams strength rested on some very well coached wrestlers whom ernie holm had brought along for the last two or three years but garp had kept everyone sharp he was trying to estimate the wins and losses weight class by weight class in the upcoming match with bathsitting at the kitchen table in the vast house now in memory of steerings first familywhen ellen james burst upon him in tears with the new issue of the magazine that had published her a month ago garp felt he should have warned ellen about magazines too they had of course published a long epistolary essay written by a score of ellen jamesians in response to ellens bold announcement that she felt used by them and she disliked them it was just the kind of controversy magazines love ellen felt especially betrayed by the magazines editor who had obviously revealed to the jamesians that ellen james now lived with the notorious t s garp thus the ellen jamesians had that to get their teeth into ellen james poor child had been brainwashed into her antifeminist stance by the male villain garp the betrayer of his mother the smirking capitalizer on womensmovement politics in the various letters garps relationship with ellen james was referred to as seductive slimy and underhanded im sorry ellen wrote its okay its okay nothings your fault garp assured her im not an antifeminist of course youre not garp told her they make everything so black and white of course they do said garp thats why i hate them they force you to be like themor else youre their enemy yes yes garp said i wish i could talk and then she dissolved crying on garps shoulder her wordless angry blubber rousing helen from the faroff reading room of the great house driving duncan from the darkroom and waking baby jenny from her nap so foolishly garp decided to take them on these grownup crazies these devout fanatics whoeven when their chosen symbol rejected theminsisted they knew more about ellen james than ellen james knew about herself ellen james is not a symbol garp wrote she is a rape victim who was raped and dismembered before she was old enough to make up her own mind about sex and men thus he began he went on and on and of course they published itliking any fuel to any fire it was also the first published piece of anything by t s garp since the famous novel the world according to bensenhaver actually it was the second in a little magazine shortly after jennys death garp published his first and only poem it was a strange poem it was about condoms garp felt his life was marred by condomsmans device to spare himself and others the consequences of his lust our lifetime garp felt was stalked by condomscondoms in the parking lots in the early mornings condoms discovered by children in the playing sand of the beaches condoms used for messages one to his mother on the door knob of their tiny wing apartment in the infirmary annex condoms unflushed down the dormitory toilets of the steering school condoms lying slick and cocky in public urinals once a condom delivered with the sunday paper once a condom in the mailbox at the end of the driveway and once a condom on the stickshift shaft of the old volvo someone had used the car overnight but not for driving condoms found garp the way ants found sugar he traveled miles he changed continents and therein the bidet of the otherwise spotless but unfamiliar hotel roomtherein the back seat of the taxi like the removed eye of a large fish thereeyeing him from the bottom of his shoe where he picked it up somewhere from everywhere condoms came to him and vilely surprised him condoms and garp went way back they were somehow joined at the beginning how often he recalled his first condom shock the condoms in the cannons mouth it was a fair poem but almost no one read it because it was gross many more people read his essay on ellen james vs the ellen jamesians that was news that was a contemporary event sadly garp knew that is more interesting than art helen begged him not to be baited not to get involved even ellen james told him that it was her fight she did not ask for his support more fucking around in the garden helen warned more bookshelves but he wrote angrily and well he said more firmly what ellen james had meant he spoke with eloquence for those serious women who suffered by association the radical selfdamage of the ellen jamesiansthe kind of shit that gives feminism a bad name he could not resist putting them down and though he did it well helen rightly asked for whom who is serious who doesnt already know the ellen jamesians are crazy no garp youve done this for themnot for ellen either youve done it for the fucking ellen jamesians youve done it to get to them and why jesus in another year no one would have remembered themor why they did what they did they were a fashion a stupid fashion but you couldnt just let them pass by why but he was sullen about it with the predictable attitude of someone who has been rightat all costs and therefore wonders if he was wrong it was a feeling that isolated him from everyoneeven from ellen she was ready to be quits with it she was sorry she had started it but they started it garp insisted not really the first man who raped someone and tried to hurt her so she couldnt tellhe started it said ellen james okay garp said okay okay the girls sad truth hurt him hadnt he only wanted to defend her the steering wrestling team whipped bath academy in the seasons final dual meet and finished with a secondplace team trophy in the new england tournament and one individual champion a pounder whom garp had personally done the most work with but the season was over garp the retired writer once more had too much time on his hands he saw a lot of roberta they played endless games of squash between them they broke four rackets in three months and the little finger on garps left hand garp had an unmindful backswing that accounted for nine stitches across the bridge of robertas nose roberta hadnt had any stitches since her eagle days and she complained about them bitterly on a crosscourt charge robertas long knee gave garp a groin injury that had him hobbling for a week honestly you two helen told them why dont you just go off and have a torrid affair it would be safer but they were the best of friends and if ever such urges occurredfor either garp or robertathey were quickly made into a joke also robertas love life was at last coolly organized like a born woman she valued her privacy and she enjoyed the directorship of the fields foundation at dogs head harbor roberta reserved her sexual self for not infrequent but never excessive flings upon the city of new york where she kept a calm number of lovers on edge for her sudden visits and trysts its the only way i can manage it she told garp its a good enough way roberta garp said not everyone is so fortunateto have this separation of power and so they played more squash and when the weather warmed they ran on the curvy roads that stretched from steering to the sea on one road dogs head harbor was a flat six miles from steering they often ran from one mansion to the other when roberta did her business in new york garp ran alone he was alone nearing the halfway point to dogs head harborwhere he would turn around and run back to steeringwhen the dirtywhite saab passed him appeared to slow down then sped ahead of him and out of sight that was the only thing strange about it garp ran on the lefthand side of the road so that he could see the cars approaching closest to him the saab had passed him on the right in its proper lanenothing funny about it garp was thinking about a reading he had promised to give at dogs head harbor roberta had talked him into reading to the assembled fields foundation fellows and their invited guests he was after all the chief trusteeand roberta frequently organized small concerts and poetry readings and so forthbut garp was leery of it he disliked readingsand especially now to women his putdown of the ellen jamesians had left so many women feeling raw most serious women of course agreed with him but most of them were also intelligent enough to recognize a kind of personal vindictiveness in his criticisms of the ellen jamesians which was stronger than logic they sensed a kind of killer instinct in himbasically male and basically intolerant he was as helen said too intolerant of the intolerant most women surely thought garp had written the truth about the ellen jamesians but was it necessary to have been so rough in his own wrestling terminology perhaps garp was guilty of unnecessary roughness it was his roughness many women suspected and when he read now even to mixed audiencesat colleges mainly where roughness seemed presently unfashionablehe was aware of a silent dislike he was a man who had publicly lost his temper he had demonstrated that he could be cruel and roberta had advised him not to read a sex scene not that the fields foundation fellows were essentially hostile but they were wary roberta said you have lots of other scenes to read roberta said besides sex neither of them mentioned the possibility that he might have anything new to read and it was mainly for this reasonthat he had nothing new to readthat garp had grown increasingly unhappy about giving readings anywhere garp topped the slight hill by a farm for black angus cattlethe only hill between steering and the seaand passed the twomile mark on his run he saw the blueblack noses of the beasts pointed at him like doublebarreled guns over a low stone wall garp always spoke to the cattle he mooed at them the dirtywhite saab was now approaching him and garp moved into the dust of the soft shoulder one of the black angus mooed back at garp two shied away from the stone wall garp had his eyes on them the saab was not going very fastdid not appear reckless there seemed no reason to keep an eye on it it was only his memory that saved him writers have very selective memories and fortunately for garp he had chosen to remember how the dirtywhite saab had slowedwhen it first passed him going the other wayand how the drivers head appeared to be lining him up in the rearview mirror garp looked away from the angus and saw the silent saab engine cut coasting straight at him in the soft shoulder a trail of dust spurning behind its quiet white shape and over the intent hunched head of the driver the driver aiming the saab at garp was the closest visual image garp would ever have of what a ball turret gunner who was at work looked like garp took two bounds to the stone wall and vaulted it not seeing the single line of electric fencing above the wall he felt the tingle in his thigh as he grazed the wire but he cleared the fence and the wall and landed in the wet green stubble of the field chewed and pockmarked by the herd of angus he lay hugging the wet ground he heard the croak of the viletasting under toad in his dry throathe heard the explosion of hooves as the angus thundered away from him he heard the rockandmetal meeting of the dirtywhite saab with the stone wall two boulders the size of his head bounced lazily beside him one wildeyed angus bull stood his ground but the saabs horn was stuck perhaps the steady blare kept the bull from charging garp knew he was alive the blood in his mouth was only because he had bitten his lip he moved along the wall to the point of impact where the bashed saab was imbedded its driver had lost more than her tongue she was in her forties the saabs engine had driven her knees up around the mangled steering column she had no rings on her hands which were shortfingered and reddened by the rough winter or winters she had known the saabs door post on the drivers side or else the windshields frame had struck her face and dented one temple and one cheek this left her face a little lopsided her brown bloodmatted hair was ruffled by the warm summer wind which blew through the hole where the windshield had been garp knew she was dead because he looked in her eyes he knew she was an ellen jamesian because he looked in her mouth he also looked in her purse there was only the predictable note pad and pencil there were lots of used and new notes too one of them said hi my name is and so forth another one said you asked for this garp imagined that this was the note she had intended to stick under the bloody waistband of his running shorts when she left him dead and mangled by the side of the road another note was almost lyrical it was the one the newspapers would love to use and reuse i have never been raped and i have never wanted to be i have never been with a man and i have never wanted to be either my whole lifes meaning has been to share the suffering of ellen james oh boy garp thought but he left that note to be discovered with her other things he was not the sort of writer or the sort of man who concealed important messageseven if the messages were insane he had aggravated his old groin injury by vaulting the stone wall and the electric fence but he was able to jog back toward town until a yogurt truck picked him up garp and the yogurt driver went to tell the police together by the time the yogurt driver passed the scene of the accident on his way to discover garp the black angus had escaped through the rent in the stone wall and were milling around the dirtywhite saab like large beastly mourners surrounding this fragile angel killed in a foreign car maybe that was the under toad i felt helen thought lying awake beside the soundly sleeping garp she hugged his warm body she nestled in the smell of her own rich sex all over him maybe that dead ellen jamesian was the under toad and now shes gone thought helen she squeezed garp so hard that he woke up what is it he asked but wordless as ellen james helen hugged his hips her teeth chattered against his chest and he hugged her until she stopped shivering a spokesperson for the ellen jamesians remarked that this was an isolated act of violence not sanctioned by the society of ellen jamesians but obviously provoked by the typically male aggressive rapist personality of t s garp they were not taking responsibility for this isolated act the jamesians declared but they were not surprised or especially sorry about it either roberta told garp that under the circumstances if he didnt feel like reading to a group of women she would understand but garp read to the assembled fields foundation fellows and their assorted guests at dogs head harbora crowd of less than one hundred people cozily comfortable in the sun room of jennys estate he read them the pension grillparzer which he introduced by saying this is the first and best thing i ever wrote and i dont even know how i thought it up i think it is about death which i didnt even know very much about when i wrote it i know more about death now and im not writing a word there are eleven major characters in this story and seven of them die one of them goes mad one of them runs away with another woman im not going to give away what happens to the other two characters but you can see that the odds for surviving this story arent great then he read to them some of them laughed four of them cried there were lots of sneezes and coughs perhaps because of the ocean dampness nobody left and everyone applauded an older woman in the back by the piano slept soundly through the entire story but even she applauded at the end she woke up to the applause and joined in it happily the event seemed to charge garp duncan had attended the readingit was his favorite among his fathers works actually one of the few things his father had written that duncan had been allowed to read duncan was a talented young artist and he had more than fifty drawings of the characters and situations in his fathers story which he revealed to garp after garp drove them both home some of the drawings were fresh and unpretentious all of them were thrilling to garp the old bears withered flanks engulfing the absurd unicycle the grandmothers matchstick ankles appearing frail and exposed under the wc door the evil mischief in the dream mans excited eyes the floozy beauty of herr theobalds sister as if her life and her companions had never been exotic to heras if they had always been staging a ludicrous and doomed effort at reclassification and the brave optimism of the man who could only walk on his hands how long have you been doing this garp asked duncan he could have wept he felt so proud it charged him very much he proposed to john wolf a special edition a book of the pension grillparzer illustrated by duncan the storys good enough to be a book all by itself garp wrote john wolf and im certainly well known enough for it to sell except for a little magazine and an anthology or two its really never been published before besides the drawings are lovely and the story really holds up i hate it when a writer starts cashing in on a reputationpublishing all the shit in his drawers and republishing all the old shit that deserved to be missed but this isnt a case of that john you know it isnt john wolf knew he thought duncans drawings were fresh and unpretentious but also not really very good the boy was not yet thirteenno matter how talented he was but john wolf also knew a good idea for publishing when he saw it to be sure of course he gave the book the secret jillsy sloper test garps story and especially duncans drawings passed jillsys scrutiny with the highest praise her only reservations concerned garps using too many words she didnt know a father and son book john wolf thought would be nice for christmas and the sad gentleness of the story its full pity and its mild violence would perhaps ease the tension of garps war with the ellen jamesians the groin healed and garp ran the road from steering to the sea all summer nodding his recognition to the brooding angus every day they now had the safety of that fortunate stone wall in common and garp felt forever identified with these large lucky animals happily grazed and happily bred and slaughtered one day quickly garp did not think of their slaughter or his own he watched out for cars but not nervously an isolated act he told helen and roberta and ellen james they nodded but roberta ran with him whenever she could helen thought she would feel more at ease when the weather got cold again and garp ran on the indoor track in the miles seabrook field house or when he started wrestling again and rarely went out at all those warm mats and that padded room were a safety symbol to helen holm who had grown up in such an incubator garp too looked forward to another wrestling season and to the father and son publication of the pension grillparzera tale by t s garp illustrated by duncan garp at last a garp book for children and for grownups it was also of course like starting over going back to the beginning and getting a fresh start what a world of illusions blossoms with the idea of starting over suddenly garp started writing again he started by writing a letter to the magazine that had published his attack on the ellen jamesians in the letter he apologized for the vehemence and selfrighteousness of his remarks although i believe ellen james was used by these women who had little concern for the reallife ellen james i can see that the need to use ellen james in some way was genuine and great i feel of course at least partially responsible for the death of that very needful and violent woman who felt provoked enough to try to kill me i am sorry of course apologies are rarely acceptable to true believersor to anyone who believes in pure good or in pure evil the ellen jamesians who responded in print all said that garp was obviously afraid for his own life they said he obviously feared an endless line of hit men or hit persons whom the ellen jamesians would send after him until they got him they said that along with being a male swine and a bully of women t s garp was clearly a yellow chickenshit coward with no balls if garp saw these responses he appeared not to care it is likely that he never read them he wrote to apologize mainly because of his writing it was an act meant to clear his desk not his conscience he meant to rid his mind of the gardentending bookshelfmaking trivia that had occupied his time while he was waiting to write seriously again he thought he would make peace with the ellen jamesians and then forget them although helen could not forget them ellen james certainly could not forget them either and even roberta was alert and edgy whenever she was out with garp about a mile beyond the bull farm one fine day when they were running toward the sea roberta felt suddenly convinced that the approaching volkswagen housed another wouldbe assassin she threw a magnificent crossbody block on garp and belted him off the soft shoulder and down a twelvefoot embankment into a muddy ditch garp sprained an ankle and sat howling at roberta from the stream bed roberta seized a rock with which she threatened the volkswagen which was full of frightened teenagers returning from a beach party roberta talked them into making room for garp whom they drove to the jenny fields infirmary you are a menace garp told roberta but helen was especially happy for robertas presenceher tight ends instinct for blindside hits and cheap shots garps sprained ankle kept him off the road for two weeks and stepped up his writing he was working on what he called his father book or the book of fathers it was the first of the three projects he had jauntily described to john wolf the night before he left for europethis one was the novel to be called my fathers illusions because he was inventing a father garp felt more in touch with the spirit of pure imagination that he felt had kindled the pension grillparzer a long way from which he had been falsely led he had been too impressed by what he now called the mere accidents and casualties of daily life and the understandable trauma resulting therefrom he felt cocky again as if he could make up anything my father wanted us all to have a better life garp began but better than whathe was not so sure i do not think that he knew what life was only that he wanted it better as he did in the pension grillparzer he made up a family he gave himself brothers and sisters and auntsboth an eccentric and an evil uncleand he felt he was a novelist again a plot to his delight thickened in the evenings garp read aloud to ellen james and helen sometimes duncan stayed up and listened and sometimes roberta stayed for supper and he would read to her too he became suddenly generous in all matters concerning the fields foundation in fact the other board members were exasperated with him garp wanted to give every applicant something she sounds sincere he kept saying look shes had a hard life he told them isnt there enough money not if we spend it this way marcia fox said if we dont discriminate between these applicants more than you suggest said hilma bloch we are lost lost garp said how could we get lost overnight it seemed to them all except roberta garp had become the weakest sort of liberal he would evaluate no one but he was full of imagining the whole sad histories of his fictional family thus full of sympathy he was a soft touch in the real world the anniversary of jennys murder and of the sudden funerals for ernie holm and stewart percy passed quickly for garp in the midst of his renewed creative energy then the wrestling season was again upon him helen had never seen him so taken up so completely focused and relentless he became again the determined young garp who had made her fall in love and she felt so drawn to him that she often cried when she was alonewithout knowing why she was alone too much now that garp was busy again helen realized she had kept herself inactive too long she agreed to let the steering school employ her so that she could teach and use her mind for her own ideas again she also taught ellen james to drive a car and ellen drove twice a week to the state university where she took a creative writing course this family isnt big enough for two writers ellen garp teased her how they all cherished the good mood he was in and now that helen was working again she was much less anxious in the world according to garp an evening could be hilarious and the next morning could be murderous later they would often remark roberta too how good it was that garp got to see the first edition of the pension grillparzerillustrated by duncan garp and out in time for christmasbefore he saw the under toad life after garp he loved epilogues as he showed us in the pension grillparzer an epilogue garp wrote is more than a body count an epilogue in the disguise of wrapping up the past is really a way of warning us about the future that february day helen heard him telling jokes to ellen james and duncan at breakfast he certainly sounded as if he felt good about the future helen gave little jenny garp a bath and powdered her and oiled her scalp and clipped her tiny fingernails and zipped her into a yellow playsuit that walt once wore helen could smell the coffee garp had made and she could hear garp hurrying duncan off to school not that hat duncan for christs sake garp said that hat couldnt keep a bird warm its twelve below its twelve above dad duncan said thats academic garp said its very cold thats what it is ellen james must have come in through the garage door then and written out a note because helen heard garp say that hed help her in a minute obviously ellen couldnt start the car then it was quiet in the great house for a while as if from far away helen heard only the squeak of boots in the snow and the slow cranking of the cars cold engine have a good day she heard garp call to duncan who must have been walking down the long drivewayoff to school yup duncan called you too the car started ellen james would be driving off to the university drive carefully garp called after her helen had her coffee alone occasionally the inarticulateness with which baby jenny talked to herself reminded helen of the ellen jamesiansor of ellen when she was upsetbut not this morning the baby was playing quietly with some plastic things helen could hear garps typewriterthat was all he wrote for three hours the typewriter would burst for three or four pages then be silent for such a long time that helen imagined garp had stopped breathing then when she had forgotten about it and was lost in her reading or in some task with jenny the typewriter would burst out again at eleventhirty in the morning helen heard him call roberta muldoon garp wanted a squash game before wrestling practice if roberta could get away from her girls as garp called the fields foundation fellows how are the girls today roberta garp said but roberta couldnt play helen heard the disappointment in garps voice later poor roberta would repeat and repeat how she should have played if only she had played she went on saying maybeshe would have spotted it comingmaybe she would have been around alert and edgy recognizing the spoor of the real world the paw prints garp had always overlooked or ignored but roberta muldoon could not play squash garp wrote for another half hour helen knew he was writing a letter somehow she could tell the difference in the sound of the typing he wrote to john wolf about my fathers illusions he was pleased with how the book was coming along he complained that roberta took her job too seriously and was letting herself get out of shape no administrative job was worth as much time as roberta gave to the fields foundation garp said that the low sales figures on the pension grillparzer were about what he expected the main thing was that it was a lovely bookhe liked looking at it and giving it to people and its rebirth had been a rebirth for him he said he expected a better wrestling season than last year although he had lost his starting heavyweight to a knee operation and his one new england champion had graduated he said that living with someone who read as much as helen was both irritating and inspiring he wanted to give her something to read that would make her close her other books at noon he came and kissed helen and fondled her breasts and kissed baby jenny over and over again while he dressed her in a snowsuit that had also been worn by waltand before walt even duncan had gotten some wear out of it garp drove jenny to the daycare center as soon as ellen james came back with the car then garp showed up at busters snack and grill for his customwy cup of tea with honey his one tangerine and his one banana that was all the lunch he ran or wrestled on he explained why to a new teacher in the english departmenta young man fresh out of graduate school who adored garps work his name was donald whitcomb and his nervous stutter reminded garp affectionately of the departed mr tinch and the race in his pulse he still felt for alice fletcher this particular day garp was eager to talk about writing to anyone and young whitcomb was eager to listen don whitcomb would remember that garp told him what the act of starting a novel felt like its like trying to make the dead come alive he said no no thats not rightits more like trying to keep everyone alive forever even the ones who must die in the end theyre the most important to keep alive finally garp said it in a way that seemed to please him a novelist is a doctor who sees only terminal cases garp said young whitcomb was so awed that he wrote this down it would be whitcombs biography years later that the wouldbe biographers of garp would all envy and despise whitcomb reflected that this bloom period in garps writing as whitcomb called it was really due to garps sense of mortality the attempt on garps life by the ellen jamesian in the dirtywhite saab whitcomb claimed had given garp the urgency necessary to make him write again helen would endorse that thesis it was not a bad idea although garp would surely have laughed at it he really had forgotten the ellen jamesians and he was not on the lookout for more of them but unconsciously perhaps he might have been feeling that urgency young whitcomb expressed in busters snack and grill garp held whitcomb enthralled until it was time for wrestling practice on his way out leaving whitcomb to pay the young man later recalled goodnaturedly garp ran into dean bodger who had just spent three days hospitalized with some heart complaint they found nothing wrong bodger complained but did they find your heart garp asked him the dean young whitcomb and garp all laughed bodger said hed brought only the pension grillparzer with him to the hospital and since it was so short a book hed been able to read it completely three times it was a gloomy story to read in a hospital bodger said though he was glad to report that he had not yet had the grandmothers dream thus he knew he would live awhile longer bodger said he had loved the story whitcomb would remember that garp then grew embarrassed though he was obviously pleased by bodgers praise whitcomb and bodger waved goodbye to him garp forgot his skiers knit hat but bodger told whitcomb he would bring it to garpat the gym dean bodger said to whitcomb that he liked dropping in on garp in the wrestling room occasionally he is so in his element there bodger said donald whitcomb was no wrestling fan but he talked enthusiastically about garps writing the young and the old man agreed garp was a man with remarkable energy whitcomb recalled that he returned to his small apartment in one of the dormitories and tried to write down everything that had impressed him about garp he had to stop unfinished in time for supper when whitcomb went to the dining hall he was one of the few people at the steering school whod heard nothing about what had happened it was dean bodgerhis eyes redrimmed his face suddenly years olderwho stopped young whitcomb going into the dining hall the dean who had left his gloves at the gym clutched garps ski hat in his cold hands when whitcomb saw that the dean still had garps hat he kneweven before looking in bodgers eyesthat something was wrong garp missed his hat as soon as he trotted out on the snowy footpath that led from busters snack and grill to the seabrook gymnasium and field house but rather than go back for it he stepped up his usual pace and ran to the gym his head was cold when he got there in less than three minutes his toes were cold too and he warmed his feet in the steamy trainers room before putting on his wrestling shoes he talked briefly with his pounder in the trainers room the boy was getting his little finger taped to his ring finger so that he would give some support to what the trainer said was only a sprain garp asked if thered been an x ray there had been and it was negative garp tapped his pounder on the shoulder asked him what he weighed in at frowned at the answerwhich was probably a lie and still about five pounds too heavyand went to suit up he stopped again in the trainers room before going to practice just to put some vaseline on one ear the trainer recalled garp had a cauliflower ear in progress and the vaseline made his ear slippery he thought this protected it garp did not like wrestling in a headgear those ear guards had not been part of the required uniform when hed been a wrestler and he saw no reason to wear one now he jogged a mile around the indoor track with his pounder before opening the wrestling room garp challenged the boy to a sprint in the last lap but the pounder had more left than garp and beat him by six feet at the end garp then played with the pounderin lieu of warming upin the wrestling room he took the kid down easily about five or six times then rode him around the mat for about five minutesor until the boy showed signs of tiring then garp allowed the boy to reverse him garp let the pounder try to pin him while he defended himself on the bottom but there was a muscle in garps back that was tight that would not stretch enough to suit him so garp told the pounder to go play with someone else garp sat by himself against the padded wall sweating happily and watching the room fill up with his team he let them warm up on their ownhe hated organized calisthenicsbefore demonstrating the first of the drills he wanted them to practice get a partner get a partner he said by rote and he added eric get a harder partner eric or youll work with me eric his pounder had a habit of coasting through workouts with the secondstring pounder who was erics roommate and best friend when helen came in the wrestling room the temperature was up to є or so and climbing the coupled boys upon the mat were already breathing hard garp was intently watching a time clock one minute left garp yelled when helen walked by him he had a whistle in his mouthso she did not kiss him she would remember that whistle and not kissing him for as long as she would livewhich would be a long time helen went to her usual corner of the wrestling room where she could not easily be fallen on she opened her book her glasses fogged up she wiped them off she had her glasses on when the nurse entered the wrestling room at the farthest end of the room from helen but helen never looked up from her book unless there was a loud body slam upon the mat or an unusually loud cry of pain the nurse closed the wrestlingroom door behind her and moved quickly past the grappling bodies toward garp with his time clock in his hands and his whistle in his mouth garp took the whistle out and hollered fifteen seconds that was all the time he had left too garp put the whistle back in his mouth and got ready to blow when he saw the nurse he mistook her for the kindly nurse named dotty who had helped him escape from the first feminist funeral garp was simply judging her by her hair which was irongray and in a braid coiled like a rope around her headit was a wig of course the nurse smiled at him there was probably no one garp felt as comfortable with as a nurse he smiled back at her then glanced at the time clock ten seconds when garp looked up at the nurse again he saw the gun he had just been thinking about his mother jenny fields and how she must have looked when she walked into the wrestling room not quite twenty years ago jenny was younger than this nurse he was thinking if helen had looked up and seen this nurse helen might have been fooled again into thinking that her missing mother had finally decided to come out of hiding when garp saw the gun he also noticed that it wasnt a real nurses uniform it was a jenny fields original with the characteristic red heart sewn over the breast it was then that garp saw the nurses breaststhey were small but they were too firm and youthfully erect for a woman with irongray hair and her hips were too slim her legs too girlish when garp looked again at her face he saw the family resemblance the square jawline that midge steering had given to all her children the sloping forehead that had been the contribution of fat stew the combination gave all the percys heads the shape of violent navy vessels the first shot forced the whistle out of garps mouth with a sharp tweet and caused the time clock to fly from his hands he sat down the mat was warm the bullet had traveled through his stomach and had lodged in his spine there were fewer than five seconds remaining on the time clock when bainbridge percy fired a second time the bullet struck garps chest and drove him still in a sitting position back against the padded wall the stunned wrestlers who were only boys seemed incapable of motion it was helen who tackled pooh percy to the mat and kept her from firing a third shot helens screams aroused the wrestlers one of them the secondstring heavyweight pinned pooh percy belly down to the mat and ripped her hand with the gun in it out from under her his pumping elbow split helens lip but helen hardly felt it the starting pounder with his little finger taped to his ring finger wrenched the gun out of poohs hand by breaking her thumb at the moment her bone clicked pooh percy screamed even garp saw what had become of herthe surgery must have been recent in pooh percys open yelling mouth anyone near her could see the black gathering of stitches like ants clustered on the stump of what had been her tongue the secondstring heavyweight was so frightened of pooh that he squeezed her too hard and cracked one of her ribs bainbridge percys recent madnessto become an ellen jamesianwas certainly painful to her igs she screamed ucking igs an ucking ig was a fucking pig but you had to be an ellen jamesian to understand pooh percy now the starting pounder held the gun at arms length pointed down to the mat and into an empty corner of the wrestling room ig pooh gagged at him but the trembling boy stared at his coach helen held garp steady he was starting to slide against the wall he could not talk he knew he could not feel he could not touch he had only a keen sense of smell his brief eyesight and his vivid memory garp was glad for once that duncan wasnt interested in wrestling by virtue of his preference for swimming duncan had missed seeing this garp knew that duncan would either just be getting out of school or already at the swimming pool garp was sorry for helenthat she was herebut he was happy to have her scent nearest him he savored it among those other intimate odors in the steering wrestling room if he could have talked he would have told helen not to be frightened of the under toad anymore it surprised him to realize that the under toad was no stranger was not even mysterious the under toad was very familiaras if he had always known it as if he had grown up with it it was yielding like the warm wrestling mats it smelled like the sweat of clean boysand like helen the first and last woman garp loved the under toad garp knew now could even look like a nurse a person who is familiar with death and trained to make practical responses to pain when dean bodger opened the wrestlingroom door with garps ski hat in his hands garp had no illusions that the dean had arrived once again to organize the rescue partyto catch the body falling from the infirmary annex four floors above where the world was safe the world was not safe dean bodger garp knew would do his best to be of service garp smiled gratefully to him and to helenand to his wrestlers some of them were weeping now garp looked fondly at his sobbing secondstring heavyweight who lay crushing pooh percy to the mat garp knew what a difficult season the poor fat boy was about to experience garp looked at helen all he could move was his eyes helen he saw was trying to smile back at him with his eyes garp tried to reassure her dont worryso what if there is no life after death there is life after garp believe me even if there is only death after death after death be grateful for small favorssometimes there is birth after sex for example and if you are very fortunate sometimes there is sex after birth oh yeth as alice fletcher would have said and if you have life said garps eyes there is hope youll have energy and never forget there is memory helen his eyes told her in the world according to garp young donald whitcomb would write we are obliged to remember everything garp died before they could move him from the wrestling room he was thirtythree the same age as helen ellen james was just starting her twenties duncan was thirteen little jenny garp was going on three walt would have been eight the news of garps death promoted the immediate printing of a third and fourth edition of the father and son book the pension grillparzer over a long weekend john wolf drank too much and contemplated leaving publishing it sometimes nauseated him to see how a violent death was so good for business but it comforted wolf to realize how garp would have taken the news even garp could not have imagined that his own death would be better than a suicide at establishing his literary seriousness and his fame not bad for someone who at thirtythree had written one good short story and perhaps one and a half good novels out of three garps rare manner of dying was in fact so perfect that john wolf had to smile when he imagined how pleased garp would have been with it it was a death wolf thought which in its random stupid and unnecessary qualitiescomic and ugly and bizarreunderlined everything garp had ever written about how the world works it was a death scene john wolf told jillsy sloper that only garp could have written helen would remark bitterly but only once that garps death was really a kind of suicide after all in the sense that his whole life was a suicide she said mysteriously she would later explain that all she meant was he made people too angry he had made pooh percy too angry at least that was clear he made others pay him tribute small and strange the steering school cemetery got the honor of his gravestone if not his body like his mothers garps body went to medicine the steering school also chose to honor him by naming after him its one remaining building that was not named after anybody else it was old dean bodgers idea if there was a jenny fields infirmary the good dean argued then there should be a garp infirmary annex in later years the functions of these buildings would alter slightly although they would remain in name the fields infirmary and the garp annex the fields infirmary would one day become the old wing of the new steering health clinic and laboratories the garp annex would become a building used chiefly for storagea kind of warehouse for medical kitchen and classroom supplies it could also be used for epidemics of course there werent many epidemics anymore garp probably would have liked the idea to have a storage building named after him he wrote once that a novel was only a place for storageof all the meaningful things that a novelist isnt able to use in his life he would have liked the idea of an epilogue tooso here it is an epilogue warning us about the future as t s garp might have imagined it alice and harrison fletcher would remain married through thick and through thinin part their marriage lasted because of alices difficulty with finishing anything their only child a daughter would play the cellothat large and cumbersome and silkenvoiced instrumentin a manner so graceful that the pure deep sound of it aggravated alices speech defect for hours after each performance harrison who would get and hold his tenure after a while would outgrow his habits with his prettier students about the time his talented daughter began to assert herself as a serious musician alice who would never complete her second novel or her third or fourth would never have a second child either she remained smoothly fluent on the page and agonizing in the flesh alice never again took to other men to the degree that she had taken to garp even in her memory he was a passion that was strong enough to keep her from ever becoming close to helen and harrys old fondness for helen seemed to fade with each of his fastfading affairs until the fletchers rarely kept track of the surviving garps at all once duncan garp met the fletcher daughter in new york after her maiden cello solo in that dangerous city duncan took her to dinner does he look like his mother harrison asked the girl i dont remember her very well the daughter said did he make a path at you alice asked i dont think so said her daughter whose firstchosen and bestloved partner would always be that bighipped cello the fletchers both harry and alice would die in their ripe middle age when their airplaneto martiniquecrashed during the christmas holidays one of harrisons students had driven them to the airport if you live in new england alice confided to the student you owe yourthelf a holiday in the thun right harrithon helen had always thought that alice was a little loony helen holm who most of her life would be known as helen garp would live a long long time a slim dark woman with an arresting face and precise language she would have her lovers but never remarry each lover suffered the presence of garpnot only in helens relentless memory but in the articles of fact that helen surrounded herself with in the steering mansion which she rarely left for example garps books and all of duncans photographs of him and even garps wrestling trophies helen maintained that she could never forgive garp for dying so young and leaving her to live so much of her life alonehe had also spoiled her she claimed for ever considering seriously the possibility of living with another man helen would become one of the most respected teachers the steering school ever had though she would never lose her sense of sarcasm about the place she had some friends there though they were few old dean bodger until he died and the young scholar donald whitcomb who would become as enchanted with helen as he was enchanted with the work of garp there was also a woman a sculptor who was an artistinresidencesomeone roberta had introduced helen to john wolf was a lifelong friend whom helen forgave in small pieces but never completely for his success at making garp a success helen and roberta remained close toohelen occasionally joining roberta for robertas famous flings upon the city of new york the two of them growing older and more eccentric were guilty of lording it over the fields foundation for years in fact the wit of their running commentary on the outside world became almost a tourist attraction at dogs head harbor from time to time when helen was lonely or bored at steeringwhen her children were grown up and pursuing their own lives elsewhereshe went to stay with roberta at jenny fields old estate it was always lively there when roberta died helen appeared to age twenty years very late in her lifeand only after she had complained to duncan that she had survived all her favorite contemporarieshelen holm was stricken suddenly with an illness that affects the bodys mucous membranes she would die in her sleep she had successfully outlived many cutthroat biographers who were waiting for her to die so that they could swoop in on the remains of garp she had protected his letters the unfinished manuscript of my fathers illusions most of his journals and jottings she told all the wouldbe biographers exactly as he would have read the work forget the life she herself wrote several articles which were respected in her field one was called the adventurers instinct in narration it was a comparative study of the narrative technique of joseph conrad and virginia woolf helen always considered herself as a widow left with three childrenduncan baby jenny and ellen james who all survived helen and wept copiously at her death they had been too young and too astonished to weep as much for garp dean bodger who wept almost as much as helen at garps death remained as loyal as a pit bull and as tenacious long after his retirement he still stormed the steering campus by night unable to sleep fitfully capturing lurkers and lovers who slunk along the footpaths and hugged each other to the spongy groundunder the soft bushes alongside the beautiful old buildings and so forth bodger remained active at steering for as long as it took duncan garp to graduate i saw your father through boy the dean told duncan ill see you through too and if they let me ill stay to see your sister through but they finally forced his retirement they cited to themselves among other problems his habit of talking to himself during chapel and his bizarre arrests at midnight of the boys and girls caught out after hours they also mentioned the deans recurring fantasy that it had been the young garp he caught in his armsone night years agoand not a pigeon bodger refused to move from the campus even when he was retired and despiteor perhaps because ofhis obstinacy he became steerings most honored emeritus they would drag him out for all the schools ceremonies they would totter him up to the stage introduce him to people who didnt know who he was and then they would lead him away perhaps because they could display him on these dignified occasions they tolerated his odd behavior long through his seventies for example bodger would be convincedsometimes for weeks at a timethat he was still the dean you are the dean really helen liked to tease him of course i am bodger roared they saw each other often and as bodger grew deafer and deafer he was more frequently seen on the arm of that nice ellen james who had her ways of talking to people who couldnt hear dean bodger remained loyal even to the steering wrestling team whose glory years soon faded from the memories of most the wrestlers were never again to have a coach the equal of ernie holm or even the equal of garp they became a losing team yet bodger always supported them hollering through the last bout to the poor steering boy flopping on his back about to be pinned it was at a wrestling match that bodger died in the unlimited class an unusually close matchthe steering heavyweight lay floundering with his equally exhausted and outofshape opponent like beached baby whales they groveled for the upper hand and the winning points as the clock ran down fifteen seconds the announcer boomed the big boys struggled bodger rose to his feet stamping and urging gott he squawked his german emerging at the end when the bout ended and the stands emptied there was the retired deandead in his seat it took much comforting from helen for the sensitive young whitcomb to gain control of his grief at bodgers loss donald whitcomb would never sleep with helen despite rumors among the envious wouldbe biographers who longed to get their hands on garps property and garps widow whitcomb would be a monkish recluse all his life which he spent in virtual hiding at the steering school it was his happy fortune to have discovered garp there moments before garps death and his happy fortune too to find himself befriended and looked after by helen she trusted him to adore her husband perhaps even more uncritically than she did poor whitcomb would always be referred to as the young whitcomb even though he would not always be young his face would never grow a beard his cheeks would be forever pinkunder his brown his gray his finally frostwhite hair his voice would remain a stuttering eager yodel his hands would wring themselves forever but it would be whitcomb whom helen would trust with the family and literary record he would be garps biographer helen would read all but the last chapter which whitcomb waited for years to write it was the chapter eulogizing her whitcomb was the garp scholar the final garp authority he had the proper meekness for a biographer duncan always joked he was a good biographer from the garp familys point of view whitcomb believed everything that helen told himhe believed every note that garp leftor every note that helen told him garp left life garp wrote is sadly not structured like a good oldfashioned novel instead an ending occurs when those who are meant to peter out have petered out all thats left is memory but even a nihilist has a memory whitcomb even loved garp at his most whimsical and at his most pretentious among garps things helen found this note no matter what my fucking last words were please say they were these i have always known that the pursuit of excellence is a lethal habit donald whitcomb who loved garp uncriticallyin the manner of dogs and childrensaid that those indeed were garps last words if whitcomb said so then they were duncan always said jenny garp and ellen jamesthey agreed about this too it was a family matterkeeping garp from the biographers wrote ellen james and why not asked jenny garp what does he owe the public he always said he was only grateful for other artists and to the people who loved him so who else deserves to have a piece of him now wrote ellen james donald whitcomb was even faithful to helens last wish although helen was old her final illness was sudden and it had to be whitcomb who defended her deathbed request helen did not want to be buried in the steering school cemetery alongside garp and jenny her father and fat stewand all the others she said that the town cemetery would do her just fine she did not want to be left to medicine either since she was so old she was sure there was little left of her body that anyone could possibly use she wanted to be cremated she told whitcomb and her ashes were to remain the property of duncan and jenny garp and ellen james after burying some of her ashes they could do anything they chose with what ashes remained but they could not scatter them anywhefe on the property of the steering school she would be damned helen told whitcomb if the steering school which did not admit women students when she had been of age would get to have any part of her now the gravestone in the town cemetery she told whitcomb should say simply that she was helen holm daughter of the wrestling coach ernie holm and that she had not been allowed to attend the steering school because she was a girl furthermore she was the loving wife of the novelist t s garp whose gravestone could be seen in the steering school cemetery because he was a boy whitcomb was faithful to this request which amused duncan especially how dad would have loved this duncan kept saying boy i can just hear him how jenny fields would have applauded helens decision was a point made most often by jenny garp and ellen james ellen james would grow up to be a writer she was the real thing as garp had guessed her two mentorsgarp and the ghost of his mother jenny fieldswould somehow prove overbearing for ellen who because of them both would not ever write much nonfiction or fiction she became a very good poetthough of course she was not much on the reading circuit her wonderful first book of poems speeches delivered to plants and animals would have made garp and jenny fields very proud of her it did make helen very proud of herthey were good friends and they were also like mother and daughter ellen james would outlive the ellen jamesians of course garps murder drove them deeper underground and their occasional surfacing over the years would be largely disguised even embarrassed hi im mute their notes finally said or ive had an accidentcant talk but i write good as you can see you arent one of those ellen somebodies are you they were occasionally asked a what they learned to reply and the more honest among them would write no not now now they were just women who couldnt speak unostentatiously most of them worked hard to discover what they could do most of them turned constructively to helping those who also couldnt do something they were good at helping disadvantaged people and also good at helping people who felt too sorry for themselves more and more their labels left them and one by one these speechless women appeared under names more of their own making some of them even won fields foundation fellowships for the things they did some of them of course went on trying to be ellen jamesians in a world that soon forgot what an ellen jamesian was some people thought that the ellen jamesians were a criminal gang who flourished briefly near midcentury others ironically confused them with the very people that the ellen jamesians had originally been protesting rapists one ellen jamesian wrote ellen james that she stopped being an ellen jamesian when she asked a little girl if she knew what an ellen jamesian was someone who rapes little boys the little girl replied there was also a bad but very popular novel that followed garps murder by about two months it took three weeks to write and five weeks to publish it was called confessions of an ellen jamesian and it did much to drive the ellen jamesians even wackier or simply away the novel was written by a man of course his previous novel had been called confessions of a porn king and the one before that had been called confessions of a child slave trader and so forth he was a sly evil man who became something different about every six months one of his cruelly forced jokes in confessions of an ellen jamesian was that he conceived of his narratorheroine as a lesbian who doesnt realize until after shes cut off her tongue that she has made herself undesirable as a lover too the popularity of this vulgar trash was enough to embarrass some ellen jamesians to death there were actually suicides there are always suicides garp wrote among people who are unable to say what they mean but in the end ellen james sought them out and befriended them it was she thought what jenny fields would have done ellen took to giving poetry readings with roberta muldoon who had a huge booming voice roberta would read ellens poems while ellen sat beside her looking as if she were wishing very hard that she could say her own poems this brought out of hiding a lot of ellen jamesians who had been wishing they could talk too a few of them became ellens friends ellen james would never marry she may have known an occasional man but more because he was a fellow poet than because he was a man she was a good poet and an ardent feminist who believed in living like jenny fields and believed in writing with the energy and the personal vision of t s garp in other words she was stubborn enough to have personal opinions and she was also kind to other people ellen would maintain a lifelong flirtation with duncan garpher younger brother really the death of ellen james would cause duncan much sorrowing ellen at an advanced age became a longdistance swimmerabout the time she succeeded roberta as the director of the fields foundation ellen worked up to swimming several times across the wide neck of dogs head harbor her last and best poems used swimming and the oceans pull as metaphors but ellen james remained a girl from the midwest who never thoroughly understood the undertow one cold fall day when she was too tired it got her when i swim she wrote to duncan i am reminded of the strenuousness but also the gracefulness of arguing with your father i can also feel the seas eagerness to get at meto get at my dry middle my landlocked little heart my landlocked little ass your father would say im sure but we tease each other the sea and i i suppose you would say you raunchy fellow that this is my substitute for sex florence cochran bowlsby who was best known to garp as mrs ralph would live a life of larkish turmoil with no substitute for sex in sightor apparently in need she actually completed a phd in comparative literature and was eventually tenured by a large and confused english department whose members were only unified by their terror of her she had at various times seduced and scorned nine of the thirteen senior memberswho were alternately admitted to and then ridiculed from her bed she would be referred to by her students as a dynamite teacher so that she at least demonstrated to other people if not to herself some confidence in an area other than sex she would hardly be referred to at all by her cringing lovers whose tails between their legs were all remindful to mrs ralph of the manner in which garp had once left her house in sympathy at the news of garps shocking death mrs ralph was among the very first to write to helen his was a seduction mrs ralph wrote whose nonoccurrence i have always regretted but respected helen came to rather like the woman with whom she occasionally corresponded roberta muldoon also had occasion to correspond with mrs ralph whose application for a fields foundation fellowship was rejected roberta was quite surprised by the note sent the fields foundation by mrs ralph up yours the note said mrs ralph did not appreciate rejection her own child ralph would die before her ralph became quite a good newspaperman and like william percy was killed in a war bainbridge percy who was best known to garp as pooh would live a long long time the last of a train of psychiatrists would claim to have rehabilitated her but pooh percy may simply have emerged from analysisand a number of institutionstoo thoroughly bored with rehabilitation to be violent anymore however it was achieved pooh was after a great while peaceably reintroduced to social intercourse she reentered public life a functioning if not speaking member of society more or less safe and finally useful it was in her fifties that she became interested in children she worked especially well and patiently with the retarded in this capacity she would frequently meet other ellen jamesians who in their various ways were also rehabilitatedor at least vastly changed for almost twenty years pooh would not mention her dead sister cushie but her fondness for children eventually confused her she got herself pregnant when she was fiftyfour no one could imagine how and she was returned to institutional observation convinced as she was that she would die in childbirth when this didnt occur pooh became a devoted mother she also continued her work with the retarded pooh percys own child for whom her mothers violent history would be a severe shock in her later life was fortunately not retarded in fact she would have reminded garp of cushie pooh percy some said became a positive example for those who would forever put an end to capital punishment her rehabilitation was so impressive only not to helen and to duncan garp who would wish to their graves that pooh percy had died at that moment when she last cried ig in the steering wrestling room one day pooh would die of course she would succumb to a stroke in florida where she was visiting her daughter it was a small consolation to helen that helen would outlive her the faithful whitcomb would choose to describe pooh percy as garp had once described her following his escape from the first feminist funeral an androgynous twerp garp said to dean bodger with a face like a ferret and a mind completely sodden by spending nearly fifteen years in diapers that official biography of garp which donald whitcomb titled lunacy and sorrow the life and art of t s garp would be published by the associates of john wolf who would not live to see the good book in print john wolf had contributed much effort to the books careful making and he had worked in the capacity of an editor to whitcombover most of the manuscriptbefore his untimely demise john wolf died of lung cancer in new york at a relatively young age he had been a careful conscientious attentive even elegant manmost of his lifebut his deep restlessness and unrelieved pessimism could only be numbed and disguised by smoking three packs of unfiltered cigarettes per day from the time he was eighteen like many busy men who maintain an otherwise calm and managed air about themselves john wolf smoked himself to death his service to garp and to garps books is inestimable although he may from time to time have held himself responsible for the fame which in the end provoked garps own violent killing wolf was far too sophisticated a man to dwell on such a narrow view assassination in wolfs opinion was an increasingly popular amateur sport of the times and political true believers as he called nearly everybody were always the sworn enemy of the artistwho insisted however arrogantly on the superiority of a personal vision besides wolf knew it was not only that pooh percy had become an ellen jamesian and had responded to garps baiting hers was a grievance as old as childhood possibly aggravated by politics but basically as deep as her long need for diapers pooh had gotten it into her head that garps and cushies love for fucking each other had finally been lethal to cushie at least it is true it was lethal to garp a professional in a world that too often worshiped the contemporaneity it had created john wolf insisted to his end that his proudest publication was the father and son edition of the pension grillparzer he was proud of the early garp novels of course and came to speak of the world according to bensenhaver as inevitablewhen you consider the violence garp was exposed to but it was grillparzer that elevated wolfit and the unfinished manuscript of my fathers illusions which john wolf looked upon lovingly and sadly as garps road back to his right way to write for years wolf edited the messy first draft of the unfinished novel for years he consulted with helen and with donald whitcomb about its merits and its faults only after im dead helen insisted garp would let nothing go if he didnt think it was finished wolf agreed but he died before helen whitcomb and duncan would be left to publish my fathers illusionsconsiderably posthumously it was duncan who spent the most time with john wolf during wolfs torturous dying of lung cancer wolf lay in a private hospital in new york sometimes smoking a cigarette through a plastic tube inserted in his throat what would your father say to this wolf asked duncan wouldnt it suit one of his death scenes isnt it properly grotesque did he ever tell you about the prostitute who died in vienna in the rudolfinerhaus what was her name charlotte duncan said he was close to john wolf wolf had even come to like the early drawings duncan had done for the pension grillparzer and duncan had moved to new york he told wolf that his first sense of knowing he wanted to be a painter as well as a photographer was his view of manhattan from john wolfs officethe day of the first feminist funeral in new york in a letter john wolf dictated to duncan from his deathbed wolf left word for his associates that duncan garp was to be allowed to come look at manhattan from his office for as long as the publishing company occupied the building for many years after john wolf died duncan took advantage of the offer a new editor moved into wolfs office but the name of garp made all the editors in that publishing house scurry for years secretaries would come in and say excuse me its that young garp to look out the window again duncan and john wolf spent the many hours it took john wolf to die discussing how good a writer garp was he would have been very very special john wolf told duncan would have been maybe duncan said but what else could you say to me no no im not lying theres no need wolf said he had the vision and he always had the language but mainly vision he was always personal he just got sidetracked for a while but he was back on the beam with that new book he was back to the good impulses again the pension grillparzer is his most charming but its not his most original he was still too young there are other writers who could have written that story procrastination is an original idea and a brilliant first novelbut its a first novel second wind of the cuckold is very funny and his best title its also very original but its a novel of mannersand rather narrow of course the world according to bensenhaver is his most original even if it is an xrated soap operawhich it is but its so harsh its raw foodgood food but very raw i mean who wants it who needs to suffer such abuse your father was a difficult fellow he never gave an inchbut thats the point he was always following his nose wherever it took him it was always his nose and he was ambitious he started out daring to write about the worldwhen he was just a kid for christs sake he still took it on then for a whilelike a lot of writershe could only write about himself but he also wrote about the worldit just didnt come through as cleanly he was starting to get bored with writing about his life and he was beginning to write about the whole world again he was just starting and jesus duncan you must remember he was a young man he was thirtythree and he had energy duncan said oh he would have written a lot theres no question john wolf said but he began to cough and had to stop talking but he could never just relax duncan said so what was the point wouldnt he have just burned himself out anyway shaking his headbut delicately not to loosen the tube in his throatjohn wolf went on coughing not him wolf gasped he could have just gone on and on duncan asked you think so the coughing wolf nodded he would die coughing roberta and helen would attend his funeral of course the rumormongers would be hissing because it was often speculated in the small town of new york that john wolf had looked after more than garps literary estate knowing helen it seems unlikely that she would ever have had such a relationship with john wolf whenever helen heard how she was linked with someone helen would just laugh roberta muldoon was more vehement with john wolf roberta said helen and wolf youve got to be kidding robertas confidence was well founded on occasion when she flung herself upon the city of new york roberta muldoon had enjoyed a tryst or two with john wolf and to think i used to watch you play john wolf told roberta once you can still watch me play roberta said i mean football john wolf said there are better things than football said roberta but you do so many things well john wolf told her ha but you do roberta all men are liars said roberta muldoon who knew this was true because she had once been a man roberta muldoon formerly robert muldoon no of the philadelphia eagles would outlive john wolfand most of her lovers she would not outlive helen but roberta lived long enough to grow at last comfortable with her sex reassignment approaching fifty she would remark to helen that she suffered the vanity of a middleaged man and the anxieties of a middleaged woman but roberta added this perspective is not without advantages now i always know what men are going to say before they say it but i know too roberta helen said roberta laughed her frightening boomer of a laugh she had a habit of bearhugging her friends which made helen nervous roberta had once broken a pair of helens glasses roberta had successfully dwarfed her enormous eccentricity by becoming responsiblechiefly to the fields foundation which she ran so vigorously that ellen james had given her a nickname captain energy ha roberta said garp was captain energy roberta was also greatly admired in the small community of dogs head harbor for jenny fields estate had never been so respectable in the old days and roberta was a far more outgoing participant in the affairs of the town than jenny had ever been she spent ten years as the chairperson of the local school boardalthough of course she could never have a child of her own she organized coached and pitched on the rockingham county womens softball teamfor twelve years the best team in the state of new hampshire once upon a time the same stupid swinish governor of new hampshire suggested that roberta be given a chromosome test before she be allowed to play in the title game roberta suggested that the governor should meet her just before the start of the gameon the pitchers moundand see if he can fight like a man nothing came of it andpolitics being what they arethe governor threw out the first ball roberta pitched a shutout chromosomes and all and it is to the credit of the athletic director of the steering school that roberta was offered the position of offensive line coach for the steering football team but the former tight end politely refused the job all those young boys roberta said sweetly id get in terrible trouble her favorite young boy all her life was duncan garp whom she mothered and sistered and smothered with her perfume and her affection duncan loved her he was one of the few male guests ever allowed at dogs head harbor although roberta was angry with him and stopped inviting him for a period of almost two yearsfollowing duncans seduction of a young poet his fathers son helen said hes charming the boy is too charming roberta told helen and that poet was not stable she was also far too old for him you sound jealous roberta helen said it was a violation of trust roberta said loudly helen agreed that it was duncan apologized even the poet apologized i seduced him she told roberta no you didnt roberta said you couldnt all was forgiven one spring in new york when roberta surprised duncan with a dinner invitation im bringing this smashing girl just for youa friend roberta told him so wash the paint off your hands and wash your hair and look nice ive told her youre nice and i know you can be i think youll like her thus having set duncan up with a date who was a woman of her choice roberta felt somehow better over a long period it came out that roberta had hated the poet whom duncan had slept with and that was the worst of the problem when duncan crashed his motorcycle within a mile of a vermont hospital roberta was the first to get there she had been skiing farther north helen had called her and roberta beat helen to the hospital riding a motorcycle in the snow roberta roared what would your father say duncan could barely whisper every limb appeared in traction there was a complication involving a kidney and unknown to both duncan and robertaat the timeone of his arms would have to come off helen and roberta and duncans sister jenny garp waited for three days until duncan was out of danger ellen james was too shaken to come wait with them roberta railed the whole time what should he be on a motorcycle forwith only one eye what kind of peripheral vision is that roberta asked one side is always blind that had been what had happened exactly a drunk had run a stoplight and duncan had seen the car too late when hed tried to outmaneuver the car the snow had locked him in place and held him an almost motionless target for the drunken driver everything had been broken he is too much like his father helen mourned but captain energy knew in some ways duncan was not like his father duncan lacked direction in robertas opinion when duncan was out of danger roberta broke down in front of him if you get killed before i die you little son of a bitch she cried it will kill me and your mother probablyand ellen possiblybut you can be sure about me it will absolutely kill me duncan you little bastard roberta wept and wept and duncan wept too because he knew it was true roberta loved him and was terribly vulnerable in that way to whatever happened to him jenny garp who was only a freshman at college dropped out of school so that she could stay in vermont with duncan while duncan got well jenny had graduated from the steering school with the highest honors she would have no trouble returning to college when duncan recovered she volunteered her help to the hospital as a nurses aide and she was a great source of optimism for duncan who had a long and painful convalescence ahead of him duncan of course had some experience with convalescence helen came from steering to see him every weekend roberta went to new york to look after the deplorable state of duncans livein studio duncan was afraid that all his paintings and photographs and his stereo would be stolen when roberta first went to duncans studioapartment she found a lank willowy girl living there wearing duncans clothes all splattered with paint the girl was not doing such a hot job with the dishes move out honey roberta said letting herself in with duncans key duncans back in the bosom of his family who are you the girl asked roberta his mother his wife sweetheart roberta said ive always gone for younger men his wife the girl said gawking at roberta i didnt know he was married his kids are coming up in the elevator roberta told the girl so you better use the stairs his kids are practically as big as me his kids the girl said she fled roberta had the studio cleaned and invited a young woman she knew to move in and watch after the place the woman had just undergone a sexual transformation and she needed to match her new identity with a new place to live it will be perfect for you roberta told the new woman a luscious young man owns it but hell be away for months you can take care of his things and have dreams about him and ill let you know when you have to move out in vermont roberta told duncan i hope you clean up your life stop the motorcycles and the messand stop the girls who dont know the first thing about you my god sleeping with strangers youre not your father yet you havent gotten down to work if you were really being an artist duncan you wouldnt have time for all the other shit all the selfdestruction shit particularly captain energy was the only one who could talk to duncan that waynow that garp was gone helen could not criticize him helen was too happy just to have duncan alive and jenny was ten years younger than duncan all she could do was look up to him and love him and be there while he took so long to heal ellen james who loved duncan fiercely and possessively became so exasperated with him that she would throw her note pad and her pencil in the air and then of course she had nothing to say a oneeyed onearmed painter duncan complained oh boy be happy youve still got one head and one heart roberta told him do you know many painters who hold the brush in both hands you need two eyes to drive a motorcycle dummy but only one to paint jenny garp who loved her brother as if he were her brother and her fatherbecause she had been too young to know her father reallywrote duncan a poem while he recuperated in the hospital it was the first and only poem young jenny garp ever wrote she did not have the artistic inclination of her father and her brother and only god knows what inclination walt might have had here lies the firstborn lean and long with one arm handy and one arm gone with one eye lit and one gone out with family memories clout by clout this mothers son must keep intact the remains of the house that garp built it was a lousy poem of course but duncan loved it ill keep myself intact he promised jenny the young transsexual whom roberta had placed in duncans studioapartment sent duncan getwell postcards from new york the plants are doing okay but the big yellow painting by the fireplace was warpingi dont think it was stretched properlyso i took it down and leaned it with the others in the pantry where its colder i love the blue painting and the drawingsall the drawings and the one roberta tells me is a selfportrait of youi love that especially oh boy duncan groaned jenny read him all of joseph conrad who had been garps favorite writer when garp was a boy it was good for helen that she had her teaching duties to distract her from worrying about duncan that boy will straighten out roberta assured her hes a young man roberta helen said hes not a boy anymorealthough he certainly acts like one theyre all boys to me roberta said garp was a boy i was a boy before i became a girl duncan will always be a boy to me oh boy helen said you ought to take up some sport roberta told helen to relax you please roberta helen said try running roberta said you run ill read helen said roberta ran all the time in her late fifties she was becoming forgetful of using her estrogen which must be used for the whole of a transsexuals life to maintain a female body shape the lapses in her estrogen and her steppedup running made robertas large body change shape and change back again before helens eyes i sometimes dont know whats happening to you roberta helen told her its sort of exciting roberta said i never know what im going to feel like i never know what im going to look like either roberta ran in three marathon races after she was fifty but she developed problems with bursting blood vessels and was advised by her doctor to run shorter distances twentysix miles was too much for a former tight end in her fiftiesold number ninety duncan occasionally teased her roberta was a few years older than garp and helen and had always looked it she went back to running the old sixmile route she and garp used to take between steering and the sea and helen never knew when roberta might suddenly arrive at the steering house sweaty and gasping and wanting to use the shower roberta kept a large robe and several changes of clothes at helens house for these occasions when helen would look up from her book and see roberta muldoon in her running costumeher stopwatch held like her heart in her big passcatching hands roberta died that spring duncan was hospitalized in vermont she had been doing wind sprints on the beach at dogs head harbor but shed stopped running and had come up on the porch complaining of popping sounds in the back of her heador possibly in her temples she couldnt exactly locate them she said she sat on the porch hammock and looked at the ocean and let ellen james go get her a glass of ice tea ellen sent a note out to roberta with one of the fields foundation fellows lemon no just sugar roberta called when ellen brought the ice tea roberta downed the whole glass in a few gulps thats perfect ellen roberta said ellen went to fix roberta another glass perfect roberta repeated give me another one just like that one roberta called i want a whole life just like that one when ellen came back with the ice tea roberta muldoon was dead in the hammock something had popped something had burst if robertas death struck helen and made her feel low helen had duncan to worry aboutfor once a grateful distraction ellen james whom roberta had supported so much was spared an overdose of grief by her sudden responsibilitiesshe was busy taking over robertas job at the fields foundation she had big shoes to fill as they say in fact size young jenny garp had never been as close to roberta as duncan had been it was duncan still in traction who took it the hardest jenny stayed with him and gave him one pep talk after another but duncan could remember roberta and all the times she had bailed out the garps beforeduncan especially he cried and cried he cried so much they had to change a cast on his chest his transsexual tenant sent him a telegram from new york ill get out now now that r is gone if you dont feel comfortable about my being here ill go i wonder could i have that picture of her the one of r and you i assume thats you with the football youre in the jersey with the thats too big for you duncan had never answered her cards her reports on the welfare of his plants and the exact location of his paintings it was in the spirit of old no that he answered her now whoever she wasthis poor confused boygirl whom roberta duncan knew would have been kind to please stay as long as you want to he wrote to her but i like that photograph too when i get back on my feet ill make a copy just for you roberta had told him to pull his life together and duncan regretted he would not be able to show her that he could he felt a responsibility now and wondered at his father being a writer when he was so younghaving children having duncan when he was so young duncan made lots of resolutions in the hospital in vermont he would keep most of them too he wrote ellen james who was still too upset at his accident to come see him all plastered and full of pins time we both got to work though i have some catching up to doto catch up to you with gone were a smaller family lets work at not losing anybody else he would have written to his mother that he intended to make her proud of him but he would have felt silly saying it and he knew how tough his mother washow little she ever needed pep talks it was to young jenny that duncan turned his new enthusiasm goddamnit weve got to have energy duncan told his sister who had plenty of energy thats what you missedby not knowing the old man energy youve got to get it on your own ive got energy jenny said jesus what do you think ive been doingjust taking care of you it was a sunday afternoon duncan and jenny always watched the pro football on duncans hospital tv it was a further good omen duncan thought that the vermont station carried the game that sunday from philadelphia the eagles were about to get creamed by the cowboys the game however didnt matter it was the beforethegame ceremony that duncan appreciated the flag was at halfmast for the former tight end robert muldoon the scoreboard flashed duncan noted how the times had changed for example there were feminist funerals everywhere now he had just read about a big one in nebraska and in philadelphia the sports announcer managed to say without snickering that the flag flew at halfmast for roberta muldoon she was a fine athlete the announcer mumbled a great pair of hands an extraordinary person agreed the coannouncer the first man spoke again yeah he said she didda lot for and he struggled while duncan waited to hear for whomfor freaks for weirdos for sexual disasters for his father and his mother and himself and ellen james she didda lot for people wid complicated lives the sports announcer said surprising himself and duncan garpbut with dignity the band played the dallas cowboys kicked off to the philadelphia eagles it would be the first of many kickoffs that the eagles would receive and duncan garp could imagine his father appreciating the announcers struggle to be tactful and kind duncan actually imagined garp whooping it up with roberta somehow duncan felt that roberta would be thereprivy to her own eulogy she and garp would be hilarious at the awkwardness of the news garp would mimic the announcer she didda lot for refashioning da vagina ha roberta would roar oh boy garp would holler oh boy when garp had been killed duncan remembered roberta muldoon had threatened to have her sexual reversal reversed id rather be a lousy man again she wailed than think there are women in this world who are actually gloating over this filthy murder by that filthy cunt stop it stop it dont ever say that word scribbled ellen james there are only those of us who loved him and those of us who didnt know himmen and women wrote ellen james then roberta muldoon had picked them all up one by one she gave to themformally seriously and generouslyher famous bear hug when roberta died some talking person among the fields foundation fellows at dogs head harbor called helen on the phone helen gathering herselfonce againwould be the one to call duncan in vermont helen would advise young jenny how to break the news to duncan jenny garp had inherited a fine bedside manner from her famous grandmother jenny fields bad news duncan young jenny whispered kissing her brother on the lips old number ninety has dropped the ball duncan garp who survived both the accident that cost him an eye and the accident that cost him an arm became a good and serious painter he was something of a pioneer in the artistically suspect field of color photography which he developed with his painters eye for color and his fathers habit of an insistent personal vision he did not make nonsense images you can be sure and he brought to his painting an eerie sensual almost narrative realism it was easy knowing who he was to say that this was more of a writers craft than it was a craft that belonged in a pictureand to criticize him as he was criticized for being too literal whatever that means duncan always said what do they expect of a oneeyed onearmed artistand the son of garp no flaws he had his fathers sense of humor after all and helen was very proud of him he must have made a hundred paintings in a series called family albumthe period of his work he was best known for they were paintings modeled from the photographs he had taken as a child after his eye accident they were of roberta and his grandmother jenny fields his mother swimming at dogs head harbor his father running with his healed jaw along the beach there was one series of a dozen small paintings of a dirtywhite saab the series was called the colors of the world because duncan said all the colors of the world are visible in the twelve versions of the dirtywhite saab there were baby pictures of jenny garp too and in the large group portraitslargely imagined not from any photographthe critics said that the blank face or the repeated figure very small with its back to the camera was always walt duncan did not want children of his own too vulnerable he told his mother i couldnt stand watching them grow up what he meant was he couldnt stand watching them not grow up since he felt that way duncan was fortunate not to have children be an issue in his lifethey werent even a worry he came home from his four months of hospitalization in vermont and found an extremely lonely transsexual living in his new york studioapartment she had made the place look as if a real artist already lived there and by a curious processit was almost a kind of osmosis of his thingsshe already seemed to know a great deal about him she was in love with him toojust from pictures another gift to duncans life from roberta muldoon and there were some who saidjenny garp for examplethat she was even beautiful they were married because if ever there was a boy with no discrimination in his heart about transsexuals that boy was duncan garp its a marriage made in heaven jenny garp told her mother she meant roberta of course roberta was in heaven but helen was a natural at worrying about duncan since garp had died shed had to take over much of the worrying and since roberta had died helen felt shed had to take over all the worrying i dont know i dont know helen said duncans marriage made her anxious that damn roberta helen said she always got her way but this way theres no chance of unwanied pregnancy wrote ellen james oh stop it helen said i sort of wanted granddhildren you know one or two anyway ill give them to you jenny promised oh boy helen said if im still alive kid sadly she wouldnt be although she would get to see jenny pregnant and be able to imagine she was a grandmother imagining something is better than remembering something garp wrote and helen certainly had to be happy with how duncans life straightened out as roberta had promised after helens death duncan worked very hard with the meek mr whitcomb they made a respectable presentation out of garps unfinished novel my fathers illusions like the father and son edition of the pension grillparzer duncan illustrated what there was of my fathers illusionsa portrait of a father who plots ambitiously and impossibly for a world where his children will be safe and happy the illustrations duncan contributed were largely portraits of garp sometime after the books publication duncan was visited by an old old man whose name duncan could not remember the man claimed to be at work on a critical biography of garp but duncan found his questions irritating the man asked over and over again about the events leading up to the terrible accident where walt was killed duncan wouldnt tell him anything duncan didnt know anything and the man went away emptyhandedbiographically speaking the man was michael milton of course it had appeared to duncan that the man was missing something though duncan couldnt have known that michael milton was missing his penis the book he supposedly was writing was never seen and no one knows what happened to him if the world of the reviewer seemed content after the publication of my fathers illusions to call garp merely an eccentric writer a good but not a great writer duncan didnt mind in duncans own words garp was original and the real thing garp had been the type after all to compel blind loyalty oneeyed loyalty duncan called it he had a longstanding code with his sister jenny and with ellen james the three of them were as thick as thieves heres to captain energy they would say when they were drinking together theres no sex like transsex they would shout when they were drunk which occasionally embarrassed duncans wifealthough she certainly agreed hows the energy they would write and phone and telegraph each other when they wanted to know what was up and when they had plenty of energy they would describe each other as full of garp although duncan would live a long long time he would die unnecessarily and ironically because of his good sense of humor he would die laughing at one of his own jokes which was surely a garpfamily thing to do it was at a kind of comingout party for a new transsexual a friend of his wifes duncan aspirated an olive and choked to death in just a few seconds of violent laughter that is a horrible and stupid way to die but everyone who knew him said that duncan would not have objectedeither to that form of death or to the life hed had duncan garp always said that his father suffered the death of walt more than anyone in the family suffered anything else and among the chosen forms of death death finally was the same between men and women as jenny fields once said only death is shared equally jenny garp who in the field of death had much more specific training than her famous grandmother would not have agreed young jenny knew that between men and women not even death gets shared equally men get to die more too jenny garp would outlive them all if she had been at the party where her brother choked to death she probably could have saved him at least she would have known exactly what to do she was a doctor she always said it was her time in the vermont hospital looking after duncan that had made up her mind to turn to medicinenot her famous grandmothers history of nursing because jenny garp know that only secondhand young jenny was a brilliant student like her mother she absorbed everythingand everything she learned she could redeliver like jenny fields she got her feeling for people as a roamer of hospitalsinching what kindness was possible and recognizing what wasnt while she was an intern she married another young doctor jenny garp would not give up her name however she stayed a garp and in a frightful war with her husband she saw that her three children would all be garps too she would divorce eventuallyand remarry but in no hurry that second time would suit her he was a painter much older than herself and if any of her family had been alive to nag her they would have no doubt warned her that she was imagining something of duncan in the man so what she would have said like her mother she had her own mind like jenny fields she kept her own name and her father in what way was jenny garp even slightly like himwhom she never really knew she was only a baby after all when he died well she was eccentric she made a point of going into every bookstore and asking for her fathers books if the store was out of stock she would order she had a writers sense of immortality if youre in print and on the shelves youre alive jenny garp left fake names and addresses all over america the books she ordered would be sold to someone she reasoned t s garp would not go out of printat least not in his daughters lifetime she was also avid in her support of the famous feminist her grandmother jenny fields but like her father jenny garp did not put much stock in the writing of jenny fields she did not bother bookstores about keeping a sexual suspect on the shelves most of all she resembled her father in the kind of doctor she became jenny garp would turn her medical mind to research she would not have a private practice she would go to hospitals only when she was sick instead jenny spent a number of years working closely with the connecticut tumor registry she would eventually direct a branch of the national cancer institute like a good writer who must love and worry each detail jenny garp would spend hours noticing the habits of a single human cell like a good writer she was ambitious she hoped she would get to the bottom of cancer in a sense she would she would die of it like other doctors jenny garp took that sacred oath of hippocrates the socalled father of medicine wherein she agreed to devote herself to something like the life garp once described to young whitcombalthough garp was concerned with a writers ambitions trying everyone alive forever even the ones who must die in the end theyre the most important to keep alive thus cancer research did not depress jenny garp who liked to describe herself as her father had described a novelist a doctor who sees only terminal cases in the world according to her father jenny garp knew we must have energy her famous grandmother jenny fields once thought of us as externals vital organs absentees and goners but in the world according to garp we are all terminal cases end
