jim butcher white night chapter one many things are not as they seem the worst things in life never are i pulled my battlescarred multicolored old volkswagen beetle up in front of a rundown chicago apartment building not five blocks from my own rented basement apartment usually by the time the cops call me things are pretty frantic theres at least one corpse several cars a lot of flashing blue lights yellowandblack tape and members of the pressor at least the promise of the imminent arrival of same this crime scene was completely quiet i saw no marked police cars and only one ambulance parked its lights off a young mother went by one child in a stroller the other toddling along holding mommys hand an elderly man walked a labrador retriever past my car no one was standing around and gawking or otherwise doing anything at all out of the ordinary odd a creepy shiver danced over the nape of my neck even though it was the middle of a sunny may afternoon normally i didnt start getting wigged out until id seen at least one nightmarish thing doing something graphic and murderous i put it down to the paranoia of advancing age it isnt like im all that old or anything especially for a wizard but age is always advancing and im fairly sure its up to no good i parked the blue beetle and headed into the apartment building i went up several flights of stairs that needed their old tile replaced or at least scrubbed and shined i left them to find a hallway carpeted in a low greyblue pile that had been crushed down to shiny smoothness in the middle the apartment doors were battered old but made of thick oak i found murphy waiting for me at five feet and small change a hundred and not much she didnt exactly look like a tough chicago cop who could face down monsters and maniacs with equal nerve chicks like that arent supposed to be blond or have a cute nose sometimes i think murphy became that tough cop she didnt look like purely for the sake of contrarinessno amount of sparkling blue eyes or seeming harmlessness could hide the steel in her nature she gave me her wereatwork nod and a terse greeting dresden lieutenant murphy i drawled with an elaborate bow and flourish of one hand deliberately at odds with her brusque demeanor i wasnt doing it out of pure contrariness im not like that i am dazzled by your presence once more i expected a snort of derision instead she gave me a polite brittle little smile and corrected me in a gentle tone sergeant murphy open mouth insert foot way to go harry the opening credits arent done rolling on this case and youve already reminded murphy of what it cost her to be your friend and ally murphy had been a detective lieutenant and in charge of special investigations si was chicago pds answer to problems that didnt fall within the boundaries of normal if a vampire slaughtered a transient if a ghoul killed a graveyard watchman or if a faerie cursed someones hair to start growing in instead of out someone had to examine it someone had to look into it and reassure the government and the citizenry that everything was normal it was a thankless job but si handled it through sheer guts and tenacity and sneakiness and by occasionally calling in wizard harry dresden to give them a hand her bosses got real upset about her abandoning her duties in a time of crisis while she helped me on a case shed already been exiled to professional siberia by being put in charge of si by taking away the rank and status she had worked her ass off to earn they had humiliated her and dealt a dreadful blow to her pride and her sense of selfworth sergeant i said sighing sorry murph i forgot she shrugged a shoulder dont worry about it i forget sometimes too when i answer the phone at work mostly still i should be less stupid we all think that harry murphy said and thumped me lightly on the biceps with one fist but no one blames you thats real big of you mini mouse i replied she snorted and rang for the elevator on the way up i asked her its a lot quieter than most crime scenes isnt it she grimaced it isnt one it isnt not exactly she said she glanced up at me not officially ah i said i guess im not actually consulting not officially she said they cut stallingss budget pretty hard he can keep the equipment functional and the paychecks steady barely but i arched a brow i need your opinion she said about what she shook her head i dont want to prejudice you just look and tell me what you see i can do that i said ill pay you myself murph you dont need to she gave me a very hard look sergeant murphys wounded pride wouldnt allow her to take charity i lifted my hands in mock surrender relenting whatever you say boss damn right she took me to an apartment on the seventh floor there were a couple of doors in the hall standing slightly open and i caught furtive looks from their residents from the corner of my eye as we walked past at the far end of the hall stood a pair of guys who looked like medtechsbored grouchy medtechs one of them was smoking the other leaning against a wall with his arms crossed and his caps bill down over his eyes murphy and the two of them ignored one another as murphy opened the apartment door murphy gestured for me to go in and planted her feet clearly intending to wait i went into the apartment it was small worn and shabby but it was clean a miniature jungle of very healthy green plants covered most of the far wall framing the two windows from the door i could see a tiny television on a tv stand an old stereo and a futon the dead woman lay on the futon she had her hands folded over her stomach i didnt have the experience to tell exactly how long shed been there but the corpse had lost all its color and its stomach looked slightly distended so i guessed that she died at least the day before it was hard to guess at her age but she couldnt have been much more than thirty she wore a pink terrycloth bathrobe a pair of glasses and had her brown hair pulled up into a bun on the coffee table in front of the futon there was a prescription bottle its top off empty a decanter of golden brown liquid dusted for prints and covered by a layer of plastic sat beside it as did a tumbler that was empty but for a quarter inch of water still in its bottom enough for a melted ice cube or two next to the tumbler there was a handwritten note also inside in a plastic bag along with a geltip pen i looked at the woman then i went over to the futon and read the note im so tired of being afraid theres nothing left forgive me janine i shuddered id seen corpses before dont get me wrong in fact id seen crime scenes that looked like photos of hells slaughterhouse id smelled worse toobelieve you me an eviscerated body puts off a stench of death and rot so vile that it is almost a solid object by comparison to some of my previous cases this one was quite peaceful well organized tidy even it looked nothing like the home of a dead woman maybe thats what made it feel so creepy except for janines corpse the apartment looked like its owners had just stepped out for a bite to eat i prowled around careful not to touch anything the bathroom and one of the bedrooms were like the living room neat a little sparse not rich but obviously well cared for i hit the kitchen next dishes were soaking in nowcold water in the sink in the fridge chicken was marinating in some kind of sauce its glass bowl covered with saran i heard a quiet step behind me and said suicides dont usually leave a meal marinating do they or dishes soaking to be cleaned or their glasses on murphy made a noncommittal noise in her throat no pictures up anywhere i mused no family portraits graduation shots pictures of everyone at disneyland i added up some other things as i turned toward the second bedroom no hair in the sink or bathroom trash can no computers i opened the door to the master bedroom and closed my eyes reaching out with my senses to get a feel of the room i found what i expected she was a practitioner i said quietly janine had set up her temple on a low wooden table against the east wall as i drew near it there was a sense of gentle energy like heat coming up from a fire that had burned down to mostly ashes the energy around the table had never been strong and it was fading and had been since the womans death within another sunrise it would be completely gone there were a number of items on the table carefully arranged a bell a thick leatherbound book probably a journal there was also an old pewter chalice very plain but free of tarnish and a slender little mahogany wand with a crystal bound to its end with copper wire one thing was out of place an old old knife a slenderbladed weapon from the early renaissance called a misericord lay on the carpet in front of the shrine its tip pointing at an angle toward the other side of the bedroom i grunted i paced around the room to the knife i hunkered down thinking then looked up the blade of the knife to its hilt i paced back to the bedroom door and peered at the living room the hilt of the knife pointed at janines body i went back to the bedroom and squinted down the knife toward its tip it was pointed at the far wall i glanced back at murphy now standing in the doorway murphy tilted her head what did you find not sure yet hang on i walked over to the wall and held up my hand about half an inch from its surface i closed my eyes and focused on a very faint trace of energy left there after several moments of concentration i lowered my hand again theres something there i said but its too faint for me to make it out without using my sight and im getting sick of doing that what does that mean murphy asked me it means i need something from my kit be right back i went outside and down to my car where i kept a fishermans tackle box i snagged it and went back up to the dead womans bedroom thats new murphy said i set the box on the floor and opened it ive been teaching my apprentice thaumaturgy we have to go out to the country sometimes for safetys sake i rummaged through the box and finally drew out a plastic test tube full of metallic grains i just tossed things into a grocery sack for the first couple of weeks but it was easier to put together a more permanent mobile kit whats that murphy asked copper filings i said they conduct energy if theres some kind of pattern here i might be able to make it out ah youre dusting for prints murphy said pretty much yeah i pulled a lump of chalk out of my dusters pocket and squatted to draw a very faint circle on the carpet i willed it closed as i completed the circle and felt it spring to life an invisible screen of power that kept random energies away from me and focused my own magic the spell was a delicate one for me anyway and trying to use it without a circle would have been like trying to light a match in a hurricane i closed my eyes concentrating and poured an ounce or two of copper filings into my right palm i willed a whisper of energy down into the filings enough to create a magical charge in them that would draw them toward the faint energy on the wall when they were ready i murmured illumina magnus then i broke the circle with my foot releasing the spell and cast the filings outward they glittered with little bluewhite sparks crackling audibly as they struck the wall and stayed there the scent of ozone filled the air i leaned forward and blew gently over the wall clearing any stray filings that might have clung to the wall on their own then i stepped back the copper filings had fallen into definite shapesspecifically letters exodus murphy furrowed her brow and stared at it a bible verse yeah i dont know that one she said do you i nodded its one that stuck in my head suffer not a witch to live chapter two murder then murphy said i grunted looks like and the killer wanted you to know it she came to stand beside me frowning up at the wall a cop couldnt have found this yeah i said the empty apartment made a clicking noise one of those settlingbuilding homey sounds that would have been familiar to the victim murphys tone became lighter so what are we looking at here some kind of religious wacko salem witch trials aficionado the inquisitor reborn and he uses magic to leave a message i asked wackos can be hypocrites she frowned how did the message get there did a practitioner have to do it i shook my head after they killed her they probably just dipped their finger in the water in the chalice used it to write on the wall water dried up but a residue of energy remained she frowned from water blessed water from the cup on her shrine i said think of it as holy water its imbued with positive energy the same way murphy squinted at me and then at the wall holy i thought magic was just all about energy and math and equations and things like electricity or thermodynamics not everyone thinks that i said i nodded at the altar the victim was a wiccan murphy frowned a witch she was also a witch i said not every wiccan has the innate strength to be a practitioner for most of them theres very little actual power involved in their rites and ceremonies then why do them dearly beloved we are gathered here to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony i shrugged every faith has its ceremonies murph this was about a conflict of religion then murphy said i shrugged its sort of difficult for sincere wiccans to conflict with other religions wicca itself is really fluid there are some basic tenets that ninetynine percent of all wiccans follow but at its core the faith is all about individual freedom wiccans believe that as long as you arent hurting anyone else by doing it you should be free to act and worship in whatever way youd like so everyones beliefs are a little bit different individualized murphy who was more or less catholic frowned seems to me that christianity has a few things to say about forgiveness and tolerance and treating others the way youd like to be treated uhhuh i said then came the crusades the inquisition which is my point murphy said regardless of what i think about islam or wicca or any other religion the fact is that its a group of people every faith has its ceremonies and since its made up of people every faith also has its assholes you only need one side to start a fight i agreed kkk quotes a lot of scripture so do a lot of reactionary religious organizations a lot of times they take it out of context i gestured at the wall like this i dunno suffer not a witch to live seems fairly clear out of context but clear i said keep in mind that this appears in the same book of the bible that approves the death sentence for a child who curses his parents owners of oxen who injure someone through the owners negligence anybody who works or kindles a fire on sunday and anyone who has sex with an animal murphy snorted also keep in mind that the original text was written thousands of years ago in hebrew the actual word that they used in that verse describes someone who casts spells that do harm to others there was a distinction in that culture between harmful and beneficial magic by the time we got to the middle ages the general attitude within the faith was that anyone who practiced any kind of magic was automatically evil there was no distinction between white and black magic and when the verse came over to english king james had a thing about witches so harmful caster of spells just got translated to witch put that way it sounds like maybe someone took it out of context murphy said but youd get arguments from all kinds of people that the bible has got to be perfect that god would not permit such errors to be made in the holy word i thought god gave everyone free will i said which presumablyand evidentlyincludes the freedom to be incorrect when translating one language into another stop making me think murphy said im believing over here i grinned see this is why im not religious i couldnt possibly keep my mouth shut long enough to get along with everyone else i thought it was because youd never respect any religion that would have you that too i said neither one of us during this conversation looked back toward the body in the living room an uncomfortable silence fell the floorboards creaked murder murphy said finally staring at the wall maybe someone on a holy mission murder i said too soon to make any assumptions what made you call me that altar she said the inconsistencies about the victim no one is going to buy magic writing on a wall as evidence i know she said officially shes going down as a suicide which means the ball is in my court i said i talked to stallings she said im taking a couple of days of personal leave starting tomorrow im in cool i frowned suddenly and got a sick little feeling in my stomach this isnt the only suicide is it right now im on the job murphy said that isnt something i could share with you the way someone like butters might right i said with no warning whatsoever murphy moved spinning in a blur of motion that swept her leg out in a scything ankleheight arc behind her there was a thump of impact and the sound of something heavy hitting the floor murphyher eyes closedsprang onto something unseen and her hands moved in a couple of small quick circles fingers grasping then murphy grunted set her arms and twisted her shoulders a little there was a young womans highpitched gasp of pain and abruptly underneath murphy there was a girl murphy had her pinned on her stomach on the floor one arm twisted behind her wrist bent at a painful angle the girl was in her late teens she wore combat boots black fatigue pants and a tight cutoff grey tshirt she was tall most of a foot taller than murphy and built like a brick house her hair had been cut into a short spiky style and dyed peroxide white a tattoo on her neck vanished under her shirt reappeared for a bit on her bared stomach and continued beneath the pants she had multiple earrings a nose ring an eyebrow ring and a silver stud through that spot right under her lower lip on the hand murphy had twisted up behind her back she wore a bracelet of dark little glass beads harry murphy said in that tone of voice that while polite and patient demanded an explanation i sighed murph you remember my apprentice molly carpenter murphy leaned to one side and looked at her profile oh sure she said i didnt recognize her without the pinkandblue hair also she wasnt invisible last time she gave me a look asking if i should let her up i gave murphy a wink and squatted down on the carpet next to the girl i gave her my best scowl i told you to wait at the apartment and practice your focus oh come on molly said its impossible and boring as hell practice makes perfect kid ive been practicing my ass off molly protested i know fifty times as much as i did last year and if you keep up the pace for another six or seven years i said you mightyou might be ready to go it alone until then youre the apprentice im the teacher and you do what i tell you but i can help you not from a jail cell i pointed out youre trespassing on a crime scene murphy told her oh please molly said both scorn and protest in her voice in case it slipped by molly has authority issues it was probably the worst thing she could have said right murphy said she produced cuffs from her jacket pocket and slapped them on mollys pinned wrist you have the right to remain silent mollys eyes widened and she stared up at me what harry if you choose to give up that right murphy continued chanting it with the steady pace of ritual anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law i shrugged sorry kid this is real life look your juvenile record is sealed and youll be tried as an adult first offense i doubt youll do much more than murph murphy took a break from the miranda chant thirty to sixty days maybe then she resumed there see no big deal see you in a month or three mollys face got pale but but oh i added beat someone up on the first day supposed to save you a lot of trouble murphy dragged molly to her feet her hands now cuffed do you understand your rights as i have conveyed them to you mollys mouth fell open she looked from murphy to me her expression shocked or i said you might apologize iim sorry harry she said i sighed not to me kid it isnt my crime scene but molly swallowed and looked at murphy i was justsstanding there you wearing gloves murphy asked no shoes yes touch anything um molly swallowed the door just pushed it a little and that chinese vase shes planted her spearmint in the one with a crack in it which means murphy said that if i can show that this is a murder a full forensic sweep could pick up your fingerprints the imprint of your shoes and as brittle as your hairdo is possibly genetic traces if any of it broke off since you arent one of the investigating officers or police consultants that evidence would place you at the scene of the crime and could implicate you in a murder investigation molly shook her head but you just said it would be called a suic even if it is you dont know proper procedure the way harry does and your presence here might contaminate the scene and obscure evidence about the actual killer making the murderer even more difficult to find before he strikes again molly just stared at her thats why there are laws about civilians and crime scenes this isnt a game miss carpenter murphy said her voice cool but not angry mistakes here could cost lives do you understand me molly glanced from murphy to me and back and her shoulders sagged i didnt mean to im sorry i said in a gentle voice apologies wont give life back to the dead molly you still havent learned to consider consequences and you cant afford that not anymore molly flinched a little and nodded i trust that this will never happen again murphy said no maam murphy looked skeptically at molly and back to me she means well i said she just wanted to help molly gave me a grateful glance murphys tone softened as she took the cuffs off dont we all molly rubbed at her wrists wincing um sergeant how did you know i was there floorboards creaking when no one was standing on them i said your deodorant murphy said your tongue stud clicked against your teeth once i said i felt some air move a few minutes ago murphy said didnt feel like a draft molly swallowed and her face turned pink oh but we didnt see you did we murph murphy shook her head not even a little a little humiliation and ego deflation now and then is good for apprentices mine sighed miserably well i said youre here might as well tag along i nodded to murphy and headed for the door where are we going molly asked both bored medtechs blinked and stared as molly followed me out of the apartment murphy came out behind us and waved them in to carry the body out to see a friend of mine i said you like polka chapter three i hadnt been back to the forensic institute on west harrison since that mess with necromancersrus nearly two years before it wasnt an unpleasantlooking place despite the fact that it was the repository for former human beings awaiting examination it was in a little corporate park very clean with green lawns and neat bushes and freshpainted lines on the spaces in the parking lots the buildings themselves were quietly unassuming functional and tidy it was one of those places that show up a lot in my nightmares it wasnt like id ever been a fan of viewing corpses but a man i knew had been caught in the magical cross fire and wound up an animated supercorpse who had nearly torn my car apart with his bare hands i hadnt come back since then i had better things to do than revisit scenes like that but once i was there and parked and heading for the doors it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be and i went in without hesitation this was mollys first visit at my request she had ditched much of the facial jewelry and wore an old cubs baseball hat over her peroxide locks even so she didnt exactly cut a respectable businesslike figure but i was content with damage control of course my outfit barely qualified for business casual and the heavy leather coat in the toowarm weather probably gave me a distinctive aura of eccentricity or at least it would have if i made more money the guard sitting at the desk where phil had been murdered was expecting me but not molly and he told me she would have to wait i said id wait too until butters verified her the guard looked sullen about being forced to expend the enormous effort it took to punch an intercom number he growled into the phone grunted a few times then thumped a switch and the security door buzzed molly and i went on through there are several examination rooms at the morgue but its never hard to figure out which one butters is inside you just listen for the polka i homed in on a steady oompah oompah of a tuba until i could pick up the strains of clarinet and accordion skirling along with it exam room three i rapped briefly on the door and opened it without actually stepping inside waldo butters was bent over his desk squinting at his computers screen while his butt and legs shuffled back and forth in time to the polka music he muttered something to himself nodded and hit the space bar on his keyboard with one elbow in time with his tapping heels without looking up at me hey harry i blinked is that bohemian rhapsody yankovic mans a freaking genius he replied give me a sec to power down before you come all the way in no problem i told him youve worked with him before molly asked quietly uhhuh i said hes clued butters waited until his printer started rattling then shut down the computer and walked to the printer to pick up a couple of pages and staple them together then he dropped the pages onto a small stack of them and bound them with a large rubber band okay that should do it he turned to face me with a grin butters was an odd little duck he wasnt much taller than murphy and she probably had more muscle than he did his shock of black hair resembled nothing so much as an explosion in a steel wool factory he was all knees and elbows especially in the surgical greens he was wearing his face was lean and angular his nose beaky and his eyes were bright behind the prescription glasses harry he said offering his hand long time no see hows the hand i traded grips with him butters had long wiry fingers very precise and not at all weak he wasnt anyones idea of dangerous but the little guy had guts and brains only three months or so and not too bad i held my gloved left hand up and wiggled all the fingers my ring and pinkie fingers moved with little trembles and twitches but by god they moved when i told them to the flesh of my left hand had practically melted in an unanticipated conflagration during a battle with a scourge of vampires the doctors had been shocked that they didnt have to amputate but told me id never use it again butters had helped me work out a regimen of physical therapy and my fingers were mostly functional though my hand still looked pretty horriblebut even that had begun to change at least a little the ugly little lumps of scar tissue and flesh had begun to fade and my hand looked considerably less like a melted wax model than it had before the nails had grown back in too good butters said good you still playing guitar i hold it it makes noise might be a little generous to call it playing i gestured to molly waldo butters this is molly carpenter my apprentice apprentice eh butters extended an amiable hand pleased to meetcha he said so does he turn you into squirrels and fishes and stuff like in the sword in the stone molly sighed i wish i keep trying to get him to show me how to change form but he wont i promised your parents i wouldnt let you melt yourself into a pile of goo i told her butters i assume someoneand i wont name any namestold you id be dropping by yowsa the little me said nodding he held up a finger went to the door and locked it before turning to lean his back against it look dresden i have to be careful what kind of information i share right it comes with the job sure so you didnt hear it from me i looked at molly who said that groovy butters said he walked back over to me and offered me the packet of papers names and addresses of the deceased he said i frowned and flipped through them columns of text much of it technical ugly photographs the victims officially theyre the deceased his mouth tightened but yeah im pretty sure theyre victims why he opened his mouth closed it again and frowned you ever see something out of the corner of your eye but when you look at it theres nothing there or at least it doesnt look like what you thought it was sure same thing here he said most of these folks show classic obvious suicides there are just a few little details wrong you know no i said enlighten me take that top one he said pauline moskowitz thirtynine mother of two husband two dogs she disappears on a friday night and opens up her wrists in a hotel bathtub around three am saturday morning i read over it am i reading this right she was on antidepressants uhhuh butters said but nothing extreme and shed been on them and stable for eight years never showed suicidal tendencies before either i looked at the ugly picture of a very ordinarylooking woman lying naked and dead in a tub of cloudy liquid so whats got your scalpel in a knot the cuts butters said she used a box knife it was in the tub with her she severed tendons in both wrists so so butters said once shed cut the tendons on one wrist shed have had very little controlled movement with the fingers in that hand so whatd she do to cut them both use two box knives at the same time wheres the other knife maybe she held it with her teeth i said maybe ill close my eyes and throw a rock out over the lake and it will land in a boat butters said its technically possible but it isnt really likely the second wound almost certainly wouldnt be as deep or as clean ive seen em look like someone was cutting up a block of parmesan into slivers these two cuts are almost identical i guess its not conclusive though i said not officially ive been hearing that a lot today i frowned whats brioche think at the mention of his boss butters grimaced occams razor to use his own spectacularly insensitive yet ironic phrasing theyre suicides end of story but your guess is that someone else was holding the knife the little mes face turned bleak and he nodded without speaking good enough for me i said what about the body today cant say until i look butters said he gave me a shrewd glance but you think its another murder i know it is i replied but im the only one until murphys off the clock right butters sighed i flipped past mrs moskowitzs pages to the next set of ugly pictures also a woman the pages named her maria casselli maria had been twentythree when she washed down thirty valium with a bottle of drain cleaner another hotel room i noted quietly molly glanced over my shoulder at the printout of the photo at the scene she turned pale and took several steps away from me yeah butters said concerned eyes on my apprentice its a little unusual most suicides are at home they usually go somewhere else only if they need to jump off a bridge or drive their car into a lake or something ms casselli had a family i said husband her younger sister living with her yeah butters said you can guess what brioche had to say she walked in on her hubby and baby sister decided to end it all uhhuh uh molly said i think outside butters provided unlocking the door first door on the right molly hurried from the room down to the bathroom butters had directed her to jesus harry butters said kids a little young for this i held up the picture of marias body lot of that going around shes actually a wizard like you someday i said if she survives i read over the next two profiles both of women in their twenties both apparent suicides in hotel rooms both of them with housemates of one sort or another the last profile was different i read over it and glanced up at butters whats with this one fits the same general profile butters said women dead in hotel rooms i frowned down at the papers wheres the cause of death thats the thing butters said i couldnt find one i lifted both eyebrows at him he spread his hands harry i know my trade i like figuring this stuff out and i havent got the foggiest why the woman is dead every test i ran came up negative every theory i put together fell apart medically speaking shes in good shape its like her whole system just got the switch turned off everything at once never seen anything like it jessica blanche i checked the profiles nineteen and pretty or at least prettyish hard to tell with dead girls butters said but yeah that was my take but not a suicide like i said dead and in hotel rooms then whats the connection to the other deaths little things butters said like she had a purse with id in it but no clothes meaning someone had to have taken them away i rolled up the papers into a tube and thumped them against my leg thoughtfully the door opened and molly came back in wiping at her mouth with a paper towel this girl still here butters lifted his eyebrows yeah miss blanche why i think maybe molly can help molly blinked and looked up at me um what i doubt its going to be pleasant molly i told her but you might be able to read something off of a dead girl molly asked quietly youre the one who wanted to come along i said she frowned facing me and then took a deep breath yes um yes i was i mean yes i will try will you i asked you sure wont be fun but if it gets us more information it could save someones life i watched her for a moment until her expression set in determination and she met my eyes she straightened and nodded once yes all right i said get yourself set for it butters we need to give her a few minutes alone can we go get miss blanche um butters said whats this going to entail exactly nothing much ill explain it on the way he chewed on his lip for a moment and then nodded once this way he led me down the hall to the storage room it was another exam room like the one wed just been in but it also featured a wall of bodysized refrigerated storage units like morgues are supposed to have this was the room wed been in when a necromancer and a gaggle of zombies had put a bullet through the head of butterss capacity to ignore the world of the supernatural butters got out a gurney consulted a record sheet on a clipboard and wheeled it over to the fridges i dont like to come in here anymore not since phil me either i said he nodded here get that side i didnt want to i am a wizard sure but corpses are inherently icky even if they arent animated and trying to kill you but i tried to pretend we were sliding a heavy load of groceries onto a cart and helped him draw a body resting upon a metal tray and covered in a heavy cloth onto the gurney so he said what is she going to do look into its eyes i said he gave me a somewhat skeptical look trying to see the last thing impressed on her retinas or something you know thats pretty much mythical right other impressions get left on a body i said final thoughts sometimes emotions sensations i shook my head technically those kinds of impressions can get left on almost any kind of inanimate object youve heard of object reading right thats for real he asked yeah but its an easy sort of thing to contaminate and it can be tricky as helland entirely apart from that its extremely difficult to do oh butters said but you think there might be something left on the corpse maybe that sounds really useful potentially so how come you dont do it all the time he asked its delicate i said when it comes to magic im not much for delicate he frowned and we started rolling the gurney but your only halftrained apprentice is the wizarding business isnt standardized i said any given wizard will have an affinity for different kinds of magic due to their natural talents personalities experiences each has different strengths what are yours he asked finding things following things blowing things up mostly i said im good at those redirecting energy sending energy out into the world to resonate with the energy of what im trying to find moving energy around or redirecting it or storing it up to use later aha he said none of which is delicate ive practiced enough to handle a lot of different kinds of delicate magic i said but its the difference between me strumming power chords on a guitar and me playing a complex classical spanish piece nutters absorbed that and nodded and the kid plays spanish guitar close enough shes not as strong as me but shes got a gift for the more subtle magic especially mental and emotional stuff its what got her in so much trouble with i bit my tongue and stopped in midsentence it wasnt my place to discuss mollys violations of the white councils laws of magic with others she would have enough trouble getting past the horrible acts shed committed in innocence without me painting her as a psycho monsterintraining butters watched my face for a few seconds then nodded and let it pass what do you think shell find no clue i said thats why we look could you do this he said i mean if you had to ive tried it i hedged but im bad about projecting things onto the object and i can barely ever get something intelligible out of it you said it might not be pleasant for her butters said why because if somethings there and she can sense it she gets to experience it first person like shes living it herself butters let out a low whistle oh yeah i guess that could be bad we got back to the other room and i peered in before opening the door molly was sitting on the floor with her eyes closed her legs folded lotusstyle her head tilted slightly up her hands rested on her thighs the tips of her thumbs pressed lightly against the tips of her middle fingers quietly i murmured no noise until shes finished okay butters nodded i opened the door as silently as i could we brought the gurney into the room left it in front of molly and then at my beckon butters and i went to the far wall and settled in to wait it took molly better than twenty minutes to focus her mind for the comparatively simple spell focus of intention of will is integral to any use of magic id drawn myself up to focus power so often and for so long that i only had to actually make a conscious effort to do it when a spell was particularly complex dangerous or when i thought it wise to be slow and cautious most of the time it took me less than a second to gather up my willwhich is critical in any situation where speed is a factor drooling abominations and angry vampires dont give you twenty minutes to get a punch ready molly though she was learning quickly had a long damned way to go when she finally opened her eyes they were distant unfocused she rose to her feet with slow careful movements and drifted over to the gurney with the corpse she pulled the sheet down revealing the dead girls face then molly leaned down her expression still distant and murmured quietly beneath her breath as she opened the corpses eyelids she got something almost instantly her eyes flew open wide and she let out a short gasp her breath rasped in and out frantically several times before her eyes rolled back up into her head she stood frozen and rigid for a pair of quivering seconds and then her breath escaped in a low rough cry and her knees buckled she did not fall to the floor so much as melt down onto it then she lay there breathing hard and letting out a continuous stream of guttural whimpers her breathing continued fast and hard her eyes unfocused her body rippled with several slow undulating motions that drew the eye to her hips and breasts then she slowly went limp her panting gradually easing though little unmistakably pleased sounds slithered from her lips on every exhalation i blinked at her well i hadnt been expecting that butters gulped audibly then he said uh did she just do what i think she just did i pursed my lips um maybe what just happened she um i coughed she got something she got something all right butters muttered he sighed i havent gotten anything like that in about two years for me it had been more like four i hear you i said more emphatically than i meant to is she underage he asked legally speaking no okay i dont feel quite so nabokovian then he raked his fingers back through his hair what do we do now i tried to look professional and unfazed we wait for her to recover uhhuh he looked at molly and sighed i need to get out more me and you both man butters is there any way you could get her some water or something sure he said you nah right back butters covered up the corpse and slipped out i went over to the girl and hunkered down by her hey grasshopper can you hear me it took her longer than it should have to answer like when youre on the phone with someone halfway around the world yes i i hear you you okay oh god she sighed smiling yes i muttered under my breath rubbed at the incipient headache beginning between my eyes and thought dark thoughts dammit all every time id opened myself up to some kind of horrible psychic shock in the name of investigation id gotten another nightmare added to my collection her first time up to bat and the grasshopper got what had she gotten i want you to tell me what you sensed right away sometimes the details fade out like when you forget parts of a dream right she murmured in a sleepysounding drawl details she molly shook her head she felt good really really good i gathered that much i said what else molly kept shaking her head slowly nothing else just that it was all sensation ecstasy she frowned a little as if struggling to order her thoughts as if the rest of her senses had been blinded by it somehow i dont think there was anything else not sight nor sound nor thought nor memory nothing she didnt even know it when she died think about it i said quietly absolutely anything you can remember could be important butters came back in just then carrying a bottle of water beaded with drops of condensation he tossed it to me and i passed the cold drink to molly here i told her drink up thanks she opened the bottle turned on her side and started guzzling it without even sitting up the pose did a lot to make her clothing look tighter butters stared for a second then sighed and quite evidently forced himself to go over to his desk and start sharpening pencils so what do we know looks like she died happy i said did you run a toxicology check on her yeah some residual thc but she could have gotten that from the contact high at a concert otherwise she was clean damn i said can you think of anything else that would do that to a victim nothing pharmacological butters said maybe if someone ran a wire into the pleasure centers of her brain and kept stimulating them but uh theres no evidence of openskull surgery i would have noticed something like that uhhuh i said so it must be something from the spooky side butters said could be i consulted my packet again what did she do no one knew butters said no one seemed to know anything about her no one came to claim the body we couldnt find any relations its why shes still here no local address either i said no just the one on an indiana drivers license but it deadended not much else in her purse and the killer took her clothes apparently butters said but why i shrugged must have been something on them he didnt want found i pursed my lips or something on them he didnt want me to find molly abruptly sat up straight harry i remember something yeah sensation she said resting one hand over her belly button it was like i dont know like hearing twenty different bands playing at the same time only tactile but there was a prickling sort of sensation over her stomach like one of those medical pinwheel things a wartenberg pinwheel butters supplied eh i said like the one i use to test the nerves on your hand harry butters supplied oh ow right i frowned at molly how the hell do you know what one of those feels like molly gave me a lazy wicked smile this is one of those things you dont want me to explain butters let out a delicate cough they are sometimes used recreationally harry my cheeks felt warm ah right butters you got a felttip marker he got one out of his desk and tossed it to me i passed it to molly show me where she nodded lay back down on her back and pulled her shirt up from her stomach then she closed her eyes took the lid off the marker and traced it slowly over the skin of her abdomen her eyebrows furrowed in concentration when she was finished the black ink spelled out clear large letters ex exodus again ladies and gentlemen i said quietly we have a serial killer chapter four molly said little on the way back she just leaned against the window with halfclosed eyes probably basking in the afterglow molly i told her in my gentlest voice heroin feels good too ask rosy and nelson the little smile of pleasure faded into blankness and she stared at me for a while by degrees her expression changed to a frown of consideration and then to a nauseated grimace it killed her she said finally it killed her i mean it felt so good but it wasnt i nodded she never knew it she never had a chance molly looked queasy for a minute it was a vampire right from the white court i mean they use sex to feed on life energy right thats one of the things it could be i said quietly there are plenty of demonic creatures in the nevernever that groove on the succubus routine though and she was killed in a hotel she said where there was no threshold to protect her from a demon very good grasshopper i said once you consider that the other victims werent done white court style it means that either there is more than one killer or the same one is varying his techniques its too early for anything but wild guesses she frowned what are you going to do next i thought about it for a minute ive got to figure out what all of the killers victims have in common if anything theyre dead molly offered i smiled a little besides that okay she said so what do you do i nodded to the papers butters had given me now resting on the dashboard i start there see what i can extrapolate from the data ive got then i look people up and ask questions what do i do she asked that depends how many beads can you move i asked her she glowered at me for a minute then she unbound the bracelet of dark beads from her left wrist and held it up the beads all slipped down to the bottom of the bracelet leaving three or four inches of bare cord molly focused on the bracelet a device id created to help her practice focusing her mind and stilling her thoughts focus and stillness are important when youre slinging magic around its a primal force of creation and it responds to your thoughts and emotionswhether you want it to or not if your thoughts get fragmented or muddled or if you arent paying complete attention to what youre doing the magic can respond in any number of unpredictable and dangerous ways molly was still learning about it she had some real talent dont get me wrong but what she lacked was not ability but judgment thats what id been trying to teach her over the past year or soto use her power responsibly cautiously and with respect for the dangers the art could present if she didnt get a more solid head on her shoulders her talent with magic was going to get her killedprobably taking me with her molly was a warlock shed used magic to tinker with the minds of two of her friends in an effort to free them from drug addiction but her motives had been mixed and the results were moderately horrific one of the kids still hadnt recovered enough to function on his own the other had pulled through but was still facing a lot of problems normally the white council of wizards kills you for breaking one of the laws of magic practically the only time they didnt was when a wizard of the council offered to take responsibility for the warlocks future conduct until they could satisfy the council that their intentions were good their ways mended if they could fine if not the warlock died so did the wizard who had taken responsibility for him id been a warlock hell plenty of the council wondered if i still was a ticking bomb getting ready to blow when molly had been bound and hooded and dragged before the council for trial id stepped in i had to sometimes i regretted the hell out of that decision once youve felt the power of dark magic it could be awfully hard to resist using it again and mollys errors tended to run in that direction the kid was good at heart but she was just so damned young shed grown up in a strict household shed gone insane with freedom the minute she ran away and got out on her own she was back home now but she was still trying to find the balance and selfdiscipline shed need to survive in the wizarding business teaching her to throw a gout of fire at a target really wasnt terribly difficult the hard part was teaching her why to do it why not to do it and when she should or should not do it molly saw magic as the best solution to any given problem it wasnt and she had to learn that to that end id made her the bracelet she stared at it for a long minute and one of the beads slid up the string and stopped when it touched her finger a moment later the second bead joined the first the third quivered for several seconds before it moved the fourth took even longer the fifth bead jumped and twitched for several moments before molly let out her breath in a snarl and the others once more succumbed to gravity four of thirteen i noted as i pulled into a driveway not bad but you arent ready yet she glared at the bracelet and rubbed at her forehead for a moment i got six last night keep working i said its about focus stillness and clarity what does that mean molly demanded in exasperation that you have more work to do she sighed and got out of the car glancing up at her familys home it was a gorgeous place white picket fence and everything somehow preserving a suburban appearance despite the city all around us you arent explaining it very well maybe i said or maybe you arent learning it very well she gave me a glower and what might have been a hot answer came to her lipsbut she shut them and shook her head in irritation im sorry for putting up that veil and trying to follow you no disrespect intended none taken ive been where you are i dont expect you to be perfect all the time kid she smiled a little what happened today happened i said its done besides it worked out i dont know if i could have read anything at all from that victim the way you did today she looked hopeful yeah i nodded what you found might be a big help you did good thanks she practically glowed once or twice after a compliment shed literally glowed but wed gotten that under control within a month or two she gave me a smile that made her look even younger than she was and then pelted up the front steps and into the house that left me there alone with pages and pages of dead women i wanted to know more about them almost as much as i wanted to shove my manly parts into a radioactive wood chipper i sighed i had to get closer to this but i could at least do it with a drink in my hand so i went to mcanallys macs puband make no mistake it was a pub not a barwas one of those few places in chicago frequented almost entirely by the supernatural scene it didnt have a sign outside i had to walk down a flight of stairs to get to the unmarked front door inside its all low ceilings a crooked bar and irregularly spaced handcarved wooden columns mac manages to keep electricity moving through the bar despite all the magical types wandering throughpartly because its rare for anything but a fullblown wizard like me to cause the inevitable failure of any nearby technology and partly because he does a ton of preventive maintenance he still didnt bother with electric lightsit costs too much to keep replacing bulbsbut he was able to keep a bunch of ceiling fans whirling and maintain a functional telephone on the wall beside the door was a wooden sign that stated simply accorded neutral ground that meant that mac had declared the place a nonpartisan location according to the terms set up by the unseelie accordssort of the geneva convention of the supernatural world it meant that any member of the signatory nations was free to enter peaceably and remain unmolested by any other member the neutral ground had to be respected by all parties who were obligated to take outside any fight that might begin and respect the pubs neutral status oaths and the rights and obligations of hospitality were very nearly a force of nature in the supernatural world it meant that in chicago there was always a placeto set up a meeting with a reasonable expectation of a civilized outcome all the same it also meant that you might find yourself in bad company when you went to macs place i always sit with my back to a smokestained wall it was late afternoon and the place was busier than it should have been of the thirteen tables only two were open and i took the one farther away from the rest of the room tossing the papers and my coat on it i went to the bar suppressing an instinct to duck every time i walked under one of the toolowfortoweringwizards ceiling fans i nodded to mac hes a spare man a little taller than average his head shaved bald he could be anywhere between thirty and fifty he wore jeans a white shirt and a white apron and despite the fact that his woodfueled grill was up and running there wasnt a spot or stain anywhere on his clothes mac i said beer me mac slid over a dark brown bottle of his home brew i opened it chugged it and passed him a twenty with the empty keep em coming mac let out a grunt of surprise and his eyebrows went up dont ask i told him he folded his arms and nodded keys i glared at him for a second but i was halfhearted about it i tossed the keys to the blue beetle onto the bar mac gave me another beer and i went to the table drinking on the way by the time id circled the carved column shaped like one enormous ugly giant except for the carved figures of faerie knights attacking its ankles and sat down at my table the beer was mostly gone i dont usually go through them like that i should have been more cautious but i really really didnt want to dig into that material sober i figured that if my brain was mushy enough maybe all the bad i was about to drag through it wouldnt leave as deep an impression i settled down and read through the information butters had given me on the dead women pausing every so often for more beer i read the words but there was an odd sense of blankness inside i read them i understood them but they somehow didnt seem relevant vanishing like pebbles dropped in a wellthere was a little ripple then nothing i thought i recognized two of the victims though not by name id probably seen them around maybe even there at mcanallys i didnt recognize the others but it wasnt like i knew every face in the community i stopped reading for a few minutes and drank some more i didnt want to keep going i didnt want to see any of this i didnt want to get involved id seen more than enough of people being hurt and killed id seen too many dead women i wanted to burn the papers walk out the door and just keep walking instead i went back to reading by the time i finished i had found no obvious connection between the victims i was emptying my fifth bottle and it was dark outside the bar had grown quiet i looked up to see that except for mac i had the place entirely to myself that was odd macs place isnt usually packed but its busy in the evening i couldnt remember the last time id seen it empty around dinnertime mac came over to me with another bottle putting it down just as i finished the previous he glanced from the fresh bottle to all the empties standing in a row i use up my twenty i asked him he nodded i grunted got out my wallet and put another twenty on the table he frowned at it then at me i know i said i dont usually drink this much he snorted quietly mac isnt big on verbalization i waved a hand vaguely at the papers hate seeing women get hurt i should hate seeing anyone get hurt but its worse with women or kids i glared down at the paperwork then around at the nowempty bar adding two and two get another i told him sit down macs eyebrows went up then he went over to the bar got himself a beer and came over to sit down with me he casually opened both bottles with a deft twist of his hand and no bottle opener mac is a professional he pushed my bottle over to me and lifted his own i nodded at him we clinked bottles and drank so i said quietly what gives mac set his beer down and surveyed the empty pub i know i said whered everyone go away mac said if scrooge had hoarded words instead of money mac would have made him look like monty hall mac didnt use rhetorical phrasing away i said away from me you mean he nodded theyre scared why grey cloak i exhaled slowly id been a warden of the white council for nearly two years wardens were the armed forces of the white council men and women who were accustomed to violence and conflict normally wardens existed to police wizards to make sure that they didnt use their power against the rest of humanity in violation of the laws of magic things werent normal for years the council had been engaged in a war against the vampire courts most of the wardens had been killed in battle and theyd gotten desperate for new wizards to take up the grey cloak of their officedesperate enough to ask me to join them despite my checkered past plenty of people in the world had talent of one kind or another very few had the kind of power and talent it took to be recognized as a member of the white council for the others contact with the councils wardens was mostly limited to one of them showing up to deliver a warning about any potential abuse of magic but when anyone broke the laws of magic the wardens appeared to apprehend try convict and probably execute wardens were scary even to someone like me who is more or less in their weight class for the minor talents like most of the crowd at macs place the wardens occupied a position somewhere between avenging angel and bogeyman apparently they had begun to see me in the latter role which was going to be a problem in my hunt for the exodusquoting killer the victims were probably members of the local supernatural community but a lot of wiccans can be ticklish about talking about their beliefs or identifying their fellow believers as members of the faith part of it is a basic respect for personal freedom and privacy endemic to the faith part of it is a kind of theologically hereditary caution both of those factors were going to make it hard to get anyone to talk to me if people thought the wardens were a part of the killings theyd shut me out faster than you can say burn the witch theres no reason for anyone to be afraid i said these women are officially suicides i mean if murphys instincts hadnt picked up on something we wouldnt even know there was a killer loose mac sipped his beer in silence unless i said some other factor i dont know about made it obvious to everyone in our crowd that the victims werent suicides mac put his beer down theyre linked i said quietly the victims theres a connection between them that the police files dont show the magic folks know it thats why theyre scared mac frowned at the beer then he looked over at the neutral ground sign by the door i know i said quietly you dont want to get involved but someone out there is killing women theyre leaving calling cards for me specifically whoever is doing it is going to keep on doing it until i find them mac did not move i kept the quiet pressure on him a lot of people come in here they eat and drink and they talk you stand over there running the grill and pouring drinks and you might as well be invisible but i know you hear a lot more than most people realize mac i figure you know something that might help me he gazed at me for a moment his expression unreadable then he asked is it you i almost barked out a bit of laughter until i realized that he was serious it took me a minute to get my head around that one since i had gone into business in chicago i had spent a lot of time trying to help the supernatural community i did exorcisms here and there helped with ghost problems taught young and outofcontrol talents enough discipline to restrain themselves ive done other things too smaller not necessarily directly involving magic giving advice on how to handle problems dealing with friendly but inhuman beings that mingled with magically aware mortals helping parents to deal with the fact that their kid was suddenly able to set the cat on fire and otherwise trying to help despite all of that the same folks id tried to help were afraid of me even mac i guess i couldnt blame them i wasnt as accessible as i used to be what with the war and my new warden duties and teaching my apprentice practically the only times i had appeared in public things had gotten messy and people had died i sometimes forgot how scary the supernatural could be i lived in a state of relative power im not under any illusions that i can take out anything that messes with me but i am not a pansy and with the right planning and leverage i can be a threat to even awfully powerful beings those folks couldnt they were the havenots of the supernatural world and they didnt have the options that my power gave me and after all i was supposed to be the one protecting folks from supernatural threats if they truly believed that the women had been murdered then either i was cruel enough to do the deed or uncaring andor incompetent enough to allow it to happen either way it didnt paint a flattering picture of me add in the growing sense of fear and it was understandable but it still hurt its not me i said quietly mac studied my features for a moment then nodded needed to hear it sure i said i dont know who is behind it but i give you my word that when i catch up to whoever is doing this im going to take him down regardless of who he is or who he works for my word mac he took another sip of beer stalling i reached out and started flipping through the pages one by one reviewing the horrible photos mac saw them too he let out a breath barely tinged with a throaty growl and leaned back in his chair away from the images i put my last beer on the table and spread my hands help me mac please mac stared down at his bottle for a moment then he looked at his sign again then he reached out and took the top sheet of paper from the stack he flipped it over produced a pencil from his apron pocket and wrote on the page before passing it back to me it read anna ash ordo lebes four pm tomorrow whats this i asked him he picked up his bottle and rose a start chapter five ordo lebes murphy said she took the lid off her coffee and blew some steam away from its surface my latin is a little rusty thats because you arent a master of arcane lore like me she rolled her eyes right lebes means a large cooking pot i told her i tried to adjust the passenger seat of her car but couldnt manage to make it comfortable saturn coupes were not meant for people my height translates out to the order of the large cooking pot or maybe order of the cauldron murphy suggested since it sounds so much less silly and has a more witchy connotation and all well i said i suppose murphy snorted at me master of the arcane lore i learned latin through a correspondence course okay we should have taken my car the interior of a volkswagen beetle is smaller than this one but i know where it all is i said trying to untangle my right foot from where it had gotten wedged by the cars frame do all wizards whine this much murphy sipped her coffee you just want to be the one driving i think you have control issues control issues control issues she said youre the one who wouldnt find the womans address unless i let you drive and im the one with issues with me its less an issue and more a fact of lifeshe said calmly besides that clown car of yours doesnt exactly blend in which is what youre supposed to do on a stakeout i glowered out the front window of her car and looked up at the apartment building where one anna ash was presumably hosting a meeting of the order of the large cooking poer uh cauldron murphy had found a spot on the street which made me wonder if she didnt have some kind of magical talent after all only some kind of precognitive esp could have gotten us a parking space on the street in the shadow of a building with both of us in sight of the apartment buildings entrance what time is it i asked five minutes ago it was three oclock murphy said i cant be certain but i theorize that it must now be about threeohfive i folded my arms i dont usually do stakeouts i thought it might be a nice change of pace for you all that knocking down of doors and burning down of buildings must get tiring i dont always knock down doors i said sometimes its a wall but this way we get a chance to see whos going into the building we might learn something i let out a suspicious grunt learn something huh itll only hurt for a minute murphy sipped at her coffee and nodded at a woman walking toward the apartment building she wore a simple sundress with a mans white cotton buttondown shirt worn open atop it she was in her late thirties maybe with pepperandsalt hair worn in a bun she wore sandals and sunglasses how about her yeah i said recognize her seen her at bock ordered books a few times the woman entered the building at a brisk purposeful pace murphy and i went back to waiting over the next fortyfive minutes four other women arrived i recognized two of them murphy checked her watcha pocket watch with actual clockwork and not a microchip or battery to be found almost four she said half a dozen at most looks that way i agreed and you didnt see any obvious bad guys the wacky thing about those bad guys is that you cant count on them to be obvious they forget to wax their mustaches and goatees leave their horns at home send their black hats to the dry cleaners theyre funny like that murphy gave me a direct and lessthanamused look should we go on up give it another five minutes no force in the known universe can make a gang of folks naming their organization in latin do much of anything on time if theyre all there by four well know theres some kind of black magic involved murphy snorted and we waited for a few minutes more so she said filling time hows the war going she paused for a beat and said god what a question slowly i said since our little visit to arctis tor and the beating the vampires took afterward things have been pretty quiet i went out to new mexico this spring why helping luccio train baby wardens i said youve got to get way out away from civilization when youre teaching group fire magic so we spent about two days turning thirty acres of sand and scrub into glass then a couple of the red courts ghouls showed up and killed two kids murphy turned her blue eyes to me waiting i felt my jaw tighten thinking back on it it wouldnt do those two kids any good going over it again so i pretended i didnt realize she was giving me a chance to talk about it there havent been any more big actions though just smalltime stuff the merlins trying to get the vamps to the table to negotiate a peace doesnt sound like you think much of the idea murphy noted the red king is still in power i said the war was his idea to begin with if he goes for a treaty now its only going to be so that the vamps can lick their wounds get their numbers up again and come back for the sequel kill them all she asked let god sort them out chapter six i dont like this murphy said helen beckitt has got plenty of reasons to dislike you i snorted who doesnt im serious harry the elevator doors closed and we started up the building was old and the elevator wasnt the fastest in the world murphy shook her head if what you said about people beginning to fear you is true then theres got to be a reason for it maybe someone is telling stories and you like helen for that she already shot you and that didnt work maybe she figured it was time to get nasty sticks and stones and smallcaliber bullets may break my bones i said words will never et cetera its awfully coincidental to find her here shes a con harry and she wound up in jail because of you i cant imagine that shes making nice with the local magic community for the camaraderie i didnt think cops knew about big words like camaraderie murph are you sure youre a real policeperson she gave me an exasperated glance do you ever stop joking around i mutter offcolor limericks in my sleep just promise me that youll watch your back murphy said there once was a girl from nantucket i said her mouth was as big as a bucket murphy flipped both her hands palms up in a gesture of frustrated surrender dammit dresden i lifted an eyebrow you seem worried about me there are women up there she said you dont always think very clearly where women are concerned so you think i should watch my back yes i turned to her and looked down at her and said more quietly golly murph why did you think i wanted you along she looked up and smiled at me the corners of her eyes wrinkling though her voice remained tart i figured you wanted someone along who could notice things more subtle than a flashing neon sign oh come on i said it doesnt have to be flashing the elevator doors opened and i took the lead down the hall to anna ashs apartmentand stepped into a tingling curtain of delicate energy four or five feet shy of the door i drew up sharply and murphy had to put a hand against my back to keep from bumping into me what is it she asked i held up my left hand though my maimed hand was still mostly numb to conventional stimuli it had never had any trouble sensing the subtle patterns of organized magical energy i spread out my fingers as much as i could trying to touch the largest possible area as i closed my eyes and focused on my wizards senses its a ward i said quietly like on your apartment she asked its not as strong i said waving my hand slowly over it and its a little cruder ive got bricks and razor wire this is more like aluminum siding and chicken wire but it has a decent kick fire i think i squinted up and down the hall huh i dont think theres enough there to kill outright but it would hurt like hell and a fire would set off the buildings alarms murphy added make people start running out summon the authorities uhhuh i said discouraging your average prowler supernatural or not its not meant to kill i stepped back and nodded to murphy go ahead and knock she gave me an arch look thats a joke right if this ward isnt done right it could react with my aura and go off cant you just take it apart whoever did this was worried enough to invest a lot of time and effort to make this home safer i said kinda rude to tear it up murphy tilted her head for a second and then she got it and youll scare them if you just walk through it like it wasnt there yeah i said quietly theyre frightened murph ive got to be gentle or they wont give me anything that can help them murphy nodded and knocked on the door she rapped three times and the doorknob was already turning on the third rap a small prettily plump woman opened the door she was even shorter than murphy midforties maybe with blond hair and rosy cherubic cheeks that looked used to smiling she wore a lavender dress and carried a small dog maybe a yorkshire terrier in her arms she smiled at murphy and said of course sergeant murphy i know who you are maybe half a second after the woman started speaking murphy said hello my name is sergeant murphy and im a detective with the cpd murphy blinked for a second and fell silent oh the woman said im sorry i forget sometimes she made an airy little gesture with one hand such a scatterbrain i started to introduce myself but before i got my mouth open the little woman said of course we all know who you are mister dresden she put her fingers to her mouth they were shaking a little oh i forgot again excuse me im abby pleased to meet you abby i said quietly and extended my hand relaxed palm down to the little yorkie the dog sniffed at my hand quivering with eagerness as he did and his tail started wagging heya little dog toto abby said and before i could respond said exactly a classic if it isnt broken why fix it she nodded to me and said excuse me ill let our host speak to you i was just closest to the door she shut the door on us certainly i said to the door murphy turned to me weird i shrugged at least the dog liked me she knew what we were going to say before we said it harry i noticed that is she telepathic or something i shook my head not in the way youre thinking she doesnt exactly hide what shes doing and if she was poking around in peoples heads the council would have done something a long time ago then how did she know what we were about to say my guess is that shes prescient i said she can see the future probably only a second or two and she probably doesnt have a lot of voluntary control over it murphy made a thoughtful noise could be handy in some ways i said but the future isnt written in stone murphy frowned like what if id decided to tell her my name was karrin murphy instead of sergeant at the last second yeah shed have been wrong people like her can sense a sort of a cloud of possible futures we were in a fairly predictable situation here even without bringing any magical talents into it basic social interaction so it looked like she saw exactly what was coming but she didnt she got to judge what was most probable and it wasnt hard to guess correctly in this particular instance thats why she seemed so distracted murphy said thought fully yeah she was keeping track of what was happening what was likely to happen deciding what wasnt likely to happen all in a window of a few seconds i shook my head its a lot worse if they can see any farther than a second or two murphy frowned why because the farther you can see the more possibilities exist i said think of a chess game a beginning player is doing well if he can see four or five moves into the game ten moves in holds an exponentially greater number of possible configurations the board could assume master players can sometimes see even further than thatand when you start dealing with computers the numbers are even bigger its difficult to even imagine the scope of it and thats in a closed simple environment murphy said nodding the chess game there are far more possibilities in the real world the biggest game i shook my head its a dangerous talent to have it can leave you subject to instabilities of one kind or another as side effects doctors almost always diagnose folks like abby with epilepsy alzheimers or one of a number of personality disorders i got five bucks that says that medical bracelet on her wrist says shes epilepticand that the dog can sense seizures coming and warn her i didnt see the bracelet murphy admitted no bet while we stood there talking quietly for maybe five minutes a discussion took place inside the apartment low voices came through the door in tense muffled tones that eventually cut off when a single voice louder than the rest overrode the others a moment later the door opened the first woman wed seen enter the apartment faced me she had a dark complexion dark eyes short dark straight hair that made me think she might have had some native americans in the family a generation or three back she was maybe five foot four late thirties she had a serious kind of face with faint pensive lines between her brows and from the way she stood blocking the doorway with solidly planted feet i got the impression that she could be a bulldog when necessary no one here has broken any of the laws warden she said in a quiet firm voice gosh thats a relief i said anna ash she narrowed her eyes and nodded im harry dresden i said she pursed her lips and gave me a speculative look are you kidding i know who you are i dont make it a habit to assume that everyone i meet knows who i am i said implying apology in my tone this is karrin murphy chicago pd anna nodded to murphy and asked in a neutral polite tone may i see your identification ms murphy murphy already had her badge on its leather backing in hand and she passed it to anna her photo identification was on the reverse side of the badge under a transparent plastic cover anna looked at the badge and the photo and compared it to murphy she passed it back almost reluctantly and then turned to me what do you want to talk i said about what the ordo lebes i said and whats happened to several practitioners lately her voice remained polite on the surface but i could hear bitter undertones im sure you know much more about it than us not especially i said thats what im trying to correct she shook her head suspicion written plainly on her face im not an idiot the wardens keep track of everything everyone knows that i sighed yeah but i forgot to take my george orwellshaped multivitamins along with my breakfast bowl of big brother os this morning i was hoping you could just talk to me for a little while the way you would with a human being she eyed me a bit warily lots of people react to my jokes like that why should i because i want to help you of course youd say that she said how do i know you mean it ms ash murphy put in quietly hes on the level were here to help if we can anna chewed on her lip for a minute looking back and forth between us and then glancing at the room behind her finally she faced me and said appearances can be deceiving i have no way of knowing if you are whoand whatyou say you are i prefer to err on the side of caution never hurts to be cautious i agreed but youre edging toward paranoid ms ash she began to shut the door this is my home and im not inviting you inside groovy i said and stepped over the threshold and into the apartment nudging her gently aside before she could close the door as i did i felt the pressure of the threshold an aura of protective magical energy that surrounds any home the threshold put up a faintly detectable resistance as my own aura of power met itand could not cross it if anna the homes owner had invited me in the threshold would have parted like a curtain she hadnt and as a result if i wanted to come inside id have to leave much of my power at the door if i had to work any forces while i was in there id be crippled practically to the point of total impotence i turned to see anna staring at me in blank surprise she was aware of what i had just done there i told her if i was of the spirit world i couldnt cross your threshold if i had planned on hurting someone in here would i have disarmed myself stars and stones would i have shown up with a cop to witness me doing it murphy took her cue from me and entered the same way i anna said at a loss how how did you know the ward wouldnt go off in your face judgment call i told her youre a cautious person and there are kids in this building i dont think youd have slapped up something that went boom whenever anyone stepped through the doorway she took a deep breath and then nodded you wouldnt have liked what happened if youd tried to force the door though i believe you i told her and i did ms ash im not here to threaten or harm anyone i cant make you talk to me if you want me to go right now ill go i promised her but for your own safety please let me talk to you first a few minutes thats all i ask anna came abbys voice i think you should hear them out yes said another womans voice quiet and low i agree and i know something of him if he gives you his word he means it thinking on it i hadnt ever really heard helen beckitts voice before unless you counted moans but its quiet solidity and lack of inflection went perfectly with her quasilifeless eyes i traded an uneasy glance with murphy then looked back to anna ms ash i asked her give me your word swear it on your power thats serious at least among wizards in my league promises have power one doesnt swear by ones magical talent and break the oath lightlyto do so would be to reduce ones own strength in the art i didnt hesitate to answer i swear to you upon my power to abide as a guest under your hospitality to bring no harm to you or yours nor to deny my aid if they would suffer thereby she let out a short quick breath and nodded very well i promise to behave as a host with all the obligations that apply and call me anna please she pronounced her name with the old world emphasis ahnah she beckoned with one hand and led us into the apartment i trust you will not take it amiss if i do not make a round of introductions understandable a full name given from ones own lips could provide a wizard or talented sorcerer with a channel a reference point that could be used to target any number of harmful even lethal spells much like fresh blood nail clippings or locks of hair could be used for the same it was all but impossible to give away your full name accidentally in a conversation but it had happened and if someone in the know thought a wizard might be pointing a spell their way they got real careful real fast when it came to speaking their own name no problem i told her annas apartment was nicer than most and evidently had received almost a complete refurbishing in the past year or three she had windows with a reasonably good view and her furnishings were predominantly of wood and of excellent quality five women sat around the living area abby sat in a wooden rocking chair holding her brighteyed little yorkie in her lap helen beckitt stood by a window staring listlessly out at the city two anna lifted a hand in a gesture beseeching helen for silence at least two more reliable witnesses have reported that the last time they saw some of the folk who had disappeared they were in the company of the greycloaked man several others have reported sightings of the beautiful darkhaired man instead i shook my head and you thought the guy in the cloak was me how many tall greycloaked men move in our circles in chicago sir priscilla said her voice frosty you can get grey corduroy for three dollars a yard at a surplus fabric store i told her tall men arent exactly unheard of in a city of eight million either priscilla narrowed her eyes who was it then abby tittered which made toto wag his tail i pursed my lips in a moment of thought im pretty sure it wasnt murphy helen beckitt snorted out a breath through her nose this isnt a joking matter priscilla snapped oh sorry given that i only found out about a grey cloak sighting about two seconds ago i had assumed the question was facetious i turned to face anna it wasnt me and it wasnt a warden of the councilor at least it damned well better not have been a warden of the council and if it was anna asked quietly i folded my arms ill make sure he never hurts anyone ever again murphy stepped forward and said excuse me you said that three members of the order had died what were their names please maria anna said her words spaced with the slow deliberate beat of a funeral march janine pauline i saw where murphy was going what about jessica blanche she asked anna frowned for a moment and then shook her head i dont think ive heard the name so shes not in the order murphy said and shes not in the ah community not to my knowledge anna replied she looked around the room does anyone here know her silence i traded a glance with murphy some of these things are not like the others some of these things are kind of the same she responded somewhere to start at least i said someones watch started beeping and the girl on the couch beside priscilla sat up suddenly she was young maybe even still in her teens with the rich smokecolored skin of regions of eastern india she had heavylidded brown eyes and wore a bandanna tied over her straight glossy black hair she was dressed in a lavender ballet leotard with creamcolored tights covering long legs and she had the muscled athletic build of a serious dancer she wore a mans watch that looked huge against her fineboned wrist she turned it off and then glanced up at anna fidgeting ten minutes anna frowned and nodded at her she started toward the door a gracious hostess politely walking us out is there anything else we can do for you warden ms murphy in the investigating business when someone starts trying to rush you out in order to conceal some kind of information from you it is what we professionals call a clue gee i said brightly what happens in ten minutes anna stopped her polite smile fading we have answered your questions as best we could you gave me your word warden to abide by my hospitality not to abuse it answering me may be for your own good i replied thats your opinion she said in my opinion it is no business of yours i sighed and nodded acquiescence i handed her a business card theres my number in case you change your mind thank you anna said politely murphy and i left and were silent all the way down in the elevator i scowled up a storm on the way and brooded it had never solved any of my problems in the past but theres always a first time chapter seven there was no time to do anything even if id been crouched tense and holding defensive magic ready to go i wouldnt have beaten the explosion to the punch it was instant and violent and did not at all care whether i was on my guard or not something that felt vaguely like an enormous feather pillow swung by the incredible hulk slammed into my chest it lifted me up off the ground and dumped me on the sidewalk several feet later my shoulder clipped a mailbox as i went by it and then i had a good steady view of the clear summer sky above me as i lay on my back and ached id lived which was always a good start in this kind of situation it couldnt have been a very big explosion then it had to have been more incendiary than concussive a big old rolling ball of flame that would have shattered windows and burned things and set things on fire and pushed a whole lot of air out of the way along with one harry dresden wizard slightly used i sat up and peered at the rolling cloud of black smoke and red flame where murphys saturn was which bore out my supposition pretty well i squinted to one side and saw murphy sitting slowly back up she had a short bleeding cut on her upper lip she looked pale and shaken i couldnt help it i started laughing like a drunk well i said under the circumstances im forced to conclude that you were right i am a control freak and you were one hundred percent right to be the one driving the car thank you murph she gave me a slow hard stare drew in a deep breath and said through clenched teeth no problem i grinned at her and slumped back down onto my back you okay she dabbed at the blood on her lip with one hand think so you clipped my shoulder on a mailbox i said it hurts a little not a lot maybe i could take an aspirin just one not a whole dose or anything she sighed my god youre a whiner dresden we sat there quietly for a minute while sirens began in the distance and came closer bomb you think murphy said in that tone people use when they dont know what else to say yeah i said i was grounding some extra energy out when it went off it must have hexed up the bombs timer or receiver set it off early unless it was intended as a warning shot she said i grunted whose bomb you think i havent annoyed anyone new lately murphy said neither have i youve annoyed a lot more people than me in toto in toto i said who talks like that besides car bombs arent really within within the uh idiom murphy asked with what might have been a very slight british accent idiom i declared in my best john cleese impersonation the idiom of the entities ive ticked off and youre really turning me on with the monty python reference youre pathetic harry her smile faded but a car bomb is well within the idiom of excons she said mrs beckitt was inside with us the whole time remember and mr beckitt murphy asked oh i said ah think hes out by now i think weve got some things to find out she said youd better go i should im not on the clock remember murphy said its my car simpler if theres only one person answering all the questions right i said and pushed myself up which end do you want ill take our odd corpse out and the beckitts she said i offered her a hand up she took it which meant more to the two of us than it would to anyone looking on and you i sighed ill talk to my brother im sure hes not involved murphy said quietly but but he knows the incubus business i said which wasnt what murphy had been about to say it might have drawn an anger response out of me but rationally speaking i couldnt blame her for her suspicion either she was a cop shed spent her entire adult life dealing with the most treacherous and dishonest portions of the human condition speaking logically she was right to suspect and question until more information presented itself peoples lives were at stake but thomas was my brother my blood logic and rationality had little to do with it the first emergency unit a patrolling police car rounded the corner a couple of blocks away fire trucks werent far behind time to go murphy said quietly ill see what i can find out i told her and walked away i took the el back to my neighborhood on high alert watching for anyone who might be following lying in wait or otherwise planning malicious deeds involving me i didnt see anyone doing any of those things on the el or as i walked to my apartment in the basement of an old boardinghouse once there i walked down a sunken concrete staircase to my front doorone of those nifty allmetal security doorsand with a muttered word and an effort of will i disarmed the wards that protected my home then i used a key to open its conventional locks and slipped inside mister promptly hurtled into my shins with a shoulder block of greeting the big grey cat weighed about thirty pounds and the impact actually rocked me back enough to let my shoulder blades bump against the door i reached down and gave his ears a quick rub mister purred walking in circles around one of my legs then sidled away and hopped up onto a bookshelf to resume the important business of napping away a summer afternoon in wait for the cool of evening an enormous mound of shaggy greyandblack fur appeared from the shadows in the little linoleumfloored alcove that passed for my kitchen it walked over to me yawning as it came its tail wagging in relaxed greeting i hunkered down as my dog sat and thrust his head toward me and i vigorously scratched his ears and chin and the thick ruff of fur over his neck with both hands mouse all quiet on the home front boy his tail wagged some more jaw dropping open to expose a lethal array of very white teeth and his tongue lolled out in a doggy grin oh i forgot the mail i said you mind getting it mouse promptly rose and i opened the door he padded out in total silence mouse moves lightly for a rhinoceros i crossed my floor of mismatched carpets and rugs to slump into the easy chair by the old fireplace i picked up my phone and dialed thomass number no answer i glared at the phone for a minute and because i wasnt sure what else to do i tried it again no one answered what were the odds i chewed on my lip for a minute and began to worry about my brother mouse returned a moment laterlong enough to have gone out to the designated dogfriendly little area in the houses yard he had several bits of mail held gently in his mouth and he dropped them carefully onto the surface of the old wooden coffee table in front of my sofa then he went over to the door and leaned a shoulder against it it hadnt been installed quite right and it was a real pain in the ass to open and once it was open it was a pain in the ass to close mouse shoved at the door with a little snort of familiar effort and it swung to then he came back over to settle down by me thanks boy i grabbed the mail scratched his ears again and flicked to life several candles on the end table next to the recliner with a muttered spell bills i reported to him going through the mail more bills junk mail another best buy catalog jesus those people wont give up larry fowlers new lawyer i put the unopened envelope against my forehead and closed my eyes hes threatening me with another variation on the same lawsuit i opened the letter and skimmed it then tossed it on the floor its as if im psychic i opened the drawer in the end table felt about with my fingertips and withdrew a single silver metallic key the only one on a ring marked with an oval of blue plastic that sported my business cards logo harry dresden wizard paranormal investigations consulting advice reasonable rates i looked at the key thomas had given it to me in case i should need to show up at his place in an emergency he had a key to my place too even after hed moved out there had been a tacit understanding between us the keys were there in case one or the other of us needed help they had not been given so that one or the other of us could go snooping uninvited around the other ones home and life though i suspected that thomas had looked in on my place a few times hoping to figure out how the place managed to get so clean hed never caught my housekeeping brownies at work and he never would theyre pros the only drawback to having faerie housekeepers is that you cant tell people about them if you do theyre gone and no i dont know why the faces of the dead women drifted through my thoughts and i sighed and closed my fingers around the key okay boy i said time to go visit thomas mouse rose up expectantly his tags jingling his tail thrashing energetically mouse liked going for rides in the car he trotted over to the door pulled his lead down from where it hung on the doorknob and brought it over to me hang on i told him i need the arsenal i hate it when bad business goes down in summer i put on my torturously warm leather duster i figured i could take death from heat prostration to whole new levels given the potential presence of further firebombs and that could land me a spot in the guinness book of world records maybe even a darwin award see there thats called positive thinking i put on my new and improved shield bracelet too and slipped three silver rings onto the fingers of my right hand i snagged my blasting rod clipped mouses lead on took up my staff and tromped on out to the car i told mouse to stay back while i approached the blue beetle my battered oftenrepaired mismatched volkswagen bug i looked all around it then lay down to check the vehicles undercarriage i looked at the trunk and under the hood next i even examined it for traces of hostile magic i didnt find anything that resembled a bomb or looked dangerous unless you counted the halfeaten taco bell burrito that had somehow gotten tossed into the trunk about six months ago i opened the door whistled for mouse and off we went to invade my brothers privacy i hadnt actually visited thomass place before and i was a little taken aback when i got there i had assumed that the street address was to one of the new buildings in cabrini green where urban renewal had been shoved down the throat of the former slum by the powers that belargely because it bordered on the gold coast the most expensive section of town and the secondhighestincome neighborhood in the world the neighborhood around the green had become slowly more tolerable and the newer apartment buildings that had replaced the old were fairly nice but thomass apartment wasnt in one of those buildings he was across the street living in the gold coast when mouse and i got to the right apartment building twilight was fading fast and i felt underdressed the doormans shoes were nicer than any i owned i opened the outer door with thomass key and marched to the elevators mouse walking smartly at heel the doorman watched me and i spotted two security cameras between the front door and the elevator security would have a pretty good idea who was a resident and who wasntand an extremely tall and gangly man in a black coat with nearly two hundred pounds of dog with him wouldnt be something they forgot so i tried to stall them with body language walking the walk of the impatient and confident in the hopes that it would make the security guys hesitate either it worked or the buildings security people were getting paid too much no one challenged me and i took the elevator to the sixteenth floor and walked down the hall to thomass apartment i unlocked the door gave it a couple of knocks and then opened it without waiting i slipped in with mouse and found the light switch beside the door before i closed it thomass apartment was well chic the door opened onto a living room bigger than my entire apartmentwhich granted will never cause anxiety to agoraphobics the walls were painted a deep crimson and the carpeting was a rich charcoal grey the furniture all matched from the sofas to the chairs to the entertainment centers all of it done in stainless steel and black and a little more art deco than i would have preferred he had a tv too big ever to fit into the beetle and a dvd player and surround sound and racks of dvds and cds one of the newer video game systems rested neatly on a shelf all its wires squared away and organized two movie posters decorated the walls the wizard of oz and the pirates of penzance the one with kevin kline as the pirate king well it was good to see that my brother was doing well for himself though i had to wonder what he was doing that pulled down the kind of money this place would require the kitchen was like the living rooma lot of the same stainless steel and black in the appliances though the walls had been painted white as was the expensive tile floor everything was pristine no dirty dishes no halfopen cupboards no food stains no papers lying about every single horizontal surface in the place was empty and sanitized i checked the cupboards the dishes stood in neat stacks perfectly fitted to their storage in the cupboard none of which made sense thomas had a lot of positive qualities but my brother was a fairly shameless slob i get it now hes dead i said aloud to mouse my brother is dead and hes been replaced with some kind of obsessivecompulsive evil clone i checked the fridge i couldnt help it its one of those things you do when youre snooping through someones house it was empty except for one of those boxes of wine and about fifty bottles of thomass favorite beer one of macs microbrewed ales mac would have killed thomas for keeping it cold well he would have scowled in disapproval anyway for mac that was tantamount to a homicidal reaction in other people i checked the freezer it was packed wall to wall with tv meals in neat stacks there were three different meals stacked up in alternating order there was room for maybe nine or ten more and i presumed the others eaten thomas probably went shopping only every couple of months that was more like himbeer food cooked by pushing one button on a microwave no dishes needed and the drawer nearest the freezer yielded up a container of plastic forks and knives eat discard no cooking or cleaning necessary i looked around at the rest of the kitchen then at the fridge and freezer then i went down the little hall that led to two bedrooms and a bath and snorted in triumph the bathroom was in total disarray with toothbrushes and various grooming supplies tossed here and there apparently at random a couple of empty beer bottles sat out the floor was carpeted with discarded clothing several halfused rolls of toilet paper sat around with an empty cardboard tube still on the dispenser i checked in the first bedroom it too was more thomass style there was a kingsized bed with no head or foot only the metal frame to support it it had white sheets several pillows in white cases and a big dark blue comforter on top all of them were disheveled the closet door stood open and more clothes lay around on the floor two laundry baskets of fresh neatly folded and ironed clothing mostly empty sat on a dresser with three of its drawers slightly open there was a bookshelf haphazardly saturated with fiction of every description and a clock radio a pair of swords one of them an old us cavalry saber the other a more musketeerlooking weapon were leaned against the wall where theyd be more or less within reach of anyone in the bed i went back to the hall and shook my head at the rest of the apartment its a disguise i told mouse the front of the apartment he wants it to give a certain impression he makes sure no one gets to see the rest mouse tilted his head and looked at me maybe i should just leave him a note the phone rang and i about jumped out of my skin after i made sure i wasnt having a cardiac episode i padded back out to the living room debating whether or not to answer it i decided not to it was probably building security calling to check up on the stranger who had walked in with a pet woolly mammoth if i answered and thomas wasnt here they might get suspicious more suspicious if i let them eat answering machine theyd still be uncertain i waited the answering machine beeped and my brothers recorded voice said you know the drill it beeped again a womans voice poured out of the answering machine like warm honey thomas she said she had a polyglot of a european accent and pronounced his name toemoss accent on the second syllable thomas she continued it is alessandra and i am desperate for you please i need to see you tonight i know that there are others that there are so many others but i cant stand it anymore and i must have you her tone lowered thick with sensuality there is no one no one else who can do for me what you do do not disappoint me i beg you she left her number and her voice made it sound like foreplay by the time she hung up i had begun to feel uncomfortably voyeuristic for listening i sighed and told mouse i so need to get laid at least now i knew what thomas had been feeding his hunger alessandra and so many others must be supplying him i felt ambiguous about that he could feed the demonic portion of his nature on many different victims effectively spreading out the damage he inflicted upon them in a bid to avoid fatally overfeeding upon any one of them even so it meant that there were a number of lives who had been tainted by his embrace women who had become addicted to the sensation of being fed uponwho were now under his influence subject to his control it was power of a sort and power tends to corrupt wielding such authority over others would provide a great many temptations and thomas had been distant of late very distant i took a deep breath and said dont get carried away harry hes your brother innocent until proven guilty right right i replied to myself i decided to leave thomas a note i didnt have any paper handy the stylishly sterile kitchen and living room yielded nonenor did the bedroom i shook my head muttering about people who couldnt organize their way out of a paper bag and checked in the second bedroom i flicked on the light and my heart stopped the room looked like the office of rambos accountant there was a desk and computer against one wall tables lined two of the other walls one of them was dedicated to the neatly organized disassembly of a pair of weaponssubmachine guns i didnt recognize right away i did however recognize the kit for homeconverting the weapons from legal semiautomatics to fully illegal automatics a second table looked like a workbench with the necessary tools to modify weapons and customassemble ammunition it would not be difficult to create explosive devices such as pipe bombs with what he had there if the heavy storage containers under the table contained as i suspected explosive compounds a nasty thought went through my mind they could just as easily be used to create incendiaries one wall was covered with corkboard there were papers tacked up on it maps photographs i walked over to the photos with heavy reluctant feet there were photos of dead women i recognized them all the victims the photos were those instamatic kind they were a little grainy the images lit by the harsh glare of a flashbulb but they covered many of the same angles as the police photos there was one difference though the police photos had all been neatly indexed with small placards with large printed numbers appearing in each shot accompanied by a meticulous written diagram recording their relative positions and what they showed locking the scene down for future reference thomass photos did not have any such placards which meant that they could only have been taken before the police got there holy shit what was my brother thinking leaving all of this stuff sitting out here like this anyone who came by with an only slightly biased point of view would come to the conclusion that he had been at all of those sites before the police that he was a killer i mean i was his brother and even i thought that it looked damned peculiar hells bells i sighed to mouse can this day get any worse a heavy confident hand delivered a short series of knocks to the apartments door security called a mans voice here with chicago police open the door please sir chapter eight i had only a few seconds to think if security had called in a cop they were thinking i might be trouble if i came off as something suspicious theyd probably take a look around as a matter of course if that happened and they found what was in my brothers war room id be buying us both more kinds of trouble than i could count i needed a lie a really good really believable lie i shut the door to thomass war room and bedroom and stared around the immaculate stylish tracklit living room trying to think of one i stared at dorothy the tin man the scarecrow and the cowardly lion looking for inspiration nothing the pirate king with his white shirt manfully open to his waist didnt give me any ideas either and then it hit me thomas had already established the lie hed used it before no lessand it was just his style of camouflage too all i had to do was play up to it i cant believe im about to do this i told mouse then i set my coat and staff aside took a deep breath flounced to the door opened it and demanded he sent you didnt he dont try to lie to me a patrol copgod she looked youngregarded me with a polite bored expression um sir thomas i snarled pronouncing it the same way as the woman on the answering machine hes not man enough to have come to meet me himself is he he sent his bully boys to do it for him the cop let out a longsuffering breath sir please lets stay calm here she turned to the buildings security guy a nervouslooking balding man in his forties now according to building security you arent a known resident but youve entered with a key its standard procedure for them to ask a few questions questions i said it was hard not to lisp so hard but that might have been too much i settled for saying everything in my murphy impersonation voice why dont you start with why he hasnt called me hmm after giving me his spare key ask him why he hasnt come to visit the baby i pointed an accusatory finger at mouse ask him what excuse he has this time the cop looked as if she had a headache she blinked at me once lifted a hand to her mouth coughed and stepped aside gesturing to the security guy he blinked a few times sir the security man said um its just that mr raith hasnt actually listed with building security any one hes given access to his apartment hed better not have i said i have given him years years and i will not be cast aside like last seasons shoes i shook my head and told the young cop in an aside voice never date a beautiful man it isnt worth what you have to put up with sir the security man said im sorry to um intrude but part of what our residents pay for is security may i see your key please i cant believe that he never even i trailed off into a mutter got the key out of my coat pocket and showed it to him the security guy took it squinted at it and checked a number on its back against a list on his clipboard this is one of the residents original keys he confirmed thats right thomas gave it to me i said i see the security man said um would you mind if i saw some photo id sir ill put a copy in our file so this wont um happen again i was going to kill my brother later of course not sir i assured him trying to appear mollified and reluctantly willing to be gracious i got out my wallet and handed him my drivers license the cop glanced at it as it went by ill be right back he told me and hustled toward the elevator sorry about this the cop told me they get paid to be a little paranoid not your fault officer i told her she regarded me thoughtfully for a moment so you and the owner are uh were something i sighed you can never get the pretty ones to come out and say exactly can you not generally no she said her tone of voice stayed steady her expression mild but i knew a poker face when i saw one do you mind if i ask what youre doing here i had to be careful the young cop wasnt dumb she thought she smelled a rat i gestured forlornly at the dog we were living together in a tiny little place we got a dog and didnt know he was going to get so big thomas was feeling crowded so he moved into his own place and i shrugged and tried to look like murphy did when talking about her exes we were supposed to switch off every month but he always had some excuse he didnt want the dog slobbering around his little neatfreak world i gestured at the apartment the cop looked around and nodded politely nice place but she hadnt been convinced not completely i saw her putting a few thoughts together formulating more questions mouse pulled it out of the fire for me he padded over to the door looked up at the cop good lord hes huge the cop said she leaned slightly away from him oh hes a big softie isnt he i crooned to him and ruffled his ears mouse gave her a big doggy grin sat and offered her one of his paws she laughed and shook she let mouse sniff the back of her hand and then scratched his ears herself you know dogs i said im in training for one of the k units she confirmed he likes you i said thats unusual hes usually a great big chicken she smiled oh i think dogs can tell when someone likes them theyre smarter about that kind of thing than people give them credit for god knows that seems to be smarter than i can ever manage i sighed what kind of dogs do they use at the k units oh it varies a great deal she said and started in on talking about candidates for police dogs i kept her going with a couple of questions and a lot of interested nodding and mouse demonstrated his ability to sit and lie down and roll over by the time the security guy and his apologetic expression got back mouse was sprawled on his back paws waving languidly in the air while the cop scratched his tummy and told me a pretty good dog story about her own childhood and an encounter with a prowler sir he said handing my key and license back and trying not to look like he was carefully not touching me i apologize for the inconvenience but as you are not a resident here it is standard procedure for visitors to check in with the security personnel at the entrance when entering or leaving the building this is just typical of him i said forgetting something like this i probably should have called ahead and made sure hed told you im sorry he said i hate to inconvenience you but until we do have that written authorization from mr raith that he wishes you to have full access i need to ask you to leave i know its just paperwork but im afraid theres no way around it i sighed typical just typical and i understand youre just doing your job sir let me go to the bathroom and ill be right down perfectly all right he told me officer the cop stood up from mouse and gave me a lingering look then she nodded and the pair of them headed back down the hall i let mouse back in then closed the door most of the way and listened narrowing the focus of my attention until nothing existed but sound and silence are you sure the cop asked the security guy oh absolutely he said toemoss he said emphasizing the pronunciation is as queer as a threedollar bill he have any other men here once or twice the man said this tall one is new but he does have one of the original keys he could have stolen it the cop said an nbasized gay burglar who works with a dog the security guy replied well make sure hes not stealing the fridge when he comes out if raith is missing anything well point him right at this guy weve got him on video eyewitnesses putting him in the apartment a copy of his drivers license for crying out loud if theyre in a relationship the cop said how come this raith guy never cleared his boyfriend you know how queers are the way they sleep around the security guy said he was just covering his ass so to speak the cop said security guy missed the irony in her tone and let out a smug chuckle like i said well watch him do that the cop said i dont like it but if youre sure i dont want a jilted queen making a big scene no one wants that heavens no the cop said her tone flat i eased the door shut and said to mouse thank god for bigotry mouse tilted his head at me bigots see something they expect and then they stop thinking about what is in front of them i told him its probably how they got to be bigots in the first place mouse looked unenlightened and undisturbed by it weve only got a couple of minutes if i want them to stay complacent i said quietly i looked around the apartment for a minute no note i said not necessary now i went back to the war room turned on the light and stared at the huge corkboard wall with its maps notes pictures and diagrams there was no time to make sense of it i closed my eyes for a moment lowered certain mental defenses id held in place for a considerable while and cast a thought into the vaults of my mind take a memo then i stepped up to the wall and scanned my eyes over it not really stopping to take in any information i caught glimpses of each photo and piece of paper it took me maybe a minute then i turned the lights back out gathered my things and left i breezed out of the elevators stopping at the security guys desk he nodded at me and waved me out and mouse and i departed the building secure in our heterosexuality then i went back to my car and headed home to seek counsel from a fallen angel chapter nine i picked up some burgers four for me and four for mouse and went home i got onion rings too but mouse didnt get any because my classfour hazmat suit was at the cleaners mister of course got an onion ring because he has seniority he ate some batted the rest around the kitchen floor for a minute then mrowled to be let outside for his evening ramble by the time id eaten it was after ten and i was entertaining thoughts of putting off more investigation until after a full nights sleep pulling allnighters was getting to be more difficult than it had been when i was twenty and full of what my old mentor ebenezar mccoy would term vinegar staying awake wasnt the issue if anything it was far easier to ignore fatigue and maintain concentration these days recovering from it was a different story i didnt bounce back from sleep deprivation quite as quickly as i used to and a missed nights sleep tended to make me grouchy for a couple of days while i got caught up too my body was still recovering from way too many injuries suffered in previous cases if id been a normal human being id probably be walking around with a collection of scars residual pain and stiff joints like an nfl lineman at the tail end of an injuryplagued career or a boxer who had been hit too many times but i wasnt normal whatever it is that allows me to use magic also gives me a greatly enhanced life spanand an ability to eventually recover from injuries that would in a normal person be permanently disabling that didnt really help me much on an immediate daytoday basis but given what my bodys gone through im just as glad that i could get better with enough work and enough time losing a hand is bad for anyone living for three or four centuries with one hand would in the words of my generation blow goats sleep would be nice but thomas might need my help id get plenty of sleep when i was dead i glanced at my maimed hand then picked up my old acoustic guitar and sat down on the sofa i flicked some candles to life and concentrating on my left hand began to practice simple scales first then a few other exercises to warm up then some quiet play my hand was nowhere close to one hundred percent but it was a lot better than it had been and i had finally drilled enough basics into my fingers to allow me to play a little mouse lifted his head and looked at me he let out a very quiet sigh then he heaved himself to his feet from where hed been sleeping and padded into my bedroom he nudged the door shut with his nose everybodys a critic okay lash i said and kept playing lets talk lash said a quiet womans voice do i merit an affectionate nickname now one minute there was no one sitting in the recliner facing the sofa the next a woman sat there poof just like magic she was tall six feet or so and built like an athlete generally when she appeared to me she appeared as a healthylooking young woman with girlnextdoor good looks dressed in a white grecoroman tunic that fell to midthigh plain leather sandals had covered her feet their thongs wrapping up around her calves her hair color had changed occasionally but the outfit had remained a constant given the fact that youre a fallen angel literally older than time and capable of thought and action i cant really comprehend whereas to you i am a mere mortal with a teeny bit more power than most i thought of it more as a thinly veiled bit of insolence i smiled at her lash she tilted her head back and laughed to all appearances genuinely amused from you it is perhaps not as insulting as it might be from another mortal and after all i am not in fact that being i am only her shadow her emissary a figment of your own perception and a guest within your mind guests get invited i said youre more like a vacuum cleaner salesman who managed to talk his way inside for a demonstration and just wont leave touche my host she admitted though i would like to think i have been both more helpful and infinitely more courteous than such an individual granted i said it doesnt change anything about being unwelcome then rid yourself of me take up the coin and i will rejoin the rest of myself whole again you will be well rid of me i snorted yeah up until big sister gets into my head turns me into her psychotic boy toy and i wind up a monster like the rest of the denarians lasciel the fallen angel whose full being was currently bound in an old roman denarius in my basement held up a mollifying hand have i not given you sufficient space have i not done as you asked remained silent and still when is the last time i have intruded the last time we spoke my host i hit a bad chord grimaced and muted it out then i started over new mexico and that wasnt by choice of course it was she said it is always your choice i shook my head i dont speak ghoul as far as i know no one does none of you have ever lived in ancient sumeria lasciel said i ignored her i had to have answers from the ghoul to get those kids back there was no time for anything else you were a last resort and tonight she asked am i a last resort tonight the next couple of chords came out hard and loud its thomas she folded her hands in her lap and regarded one of the nearby candles ah yes she said more quietly you care for him a great deal hes my blood i said allow me to rephrase the observation you care for him to an irrational degree she tilted her head and studied me why i spoke in a slower voice hes my blood i understand your words but they dont mean anything they wouldnt i said not to you she frowned at that and looked at me her expression mildly disturbed i see no i said you dont you cant her expression became remote and blank her gaze returning to the candle do not be too sure my host i too had brothers and sisters once upon a time i stared at her for a second god she sounded sincere she isnt harry i told myself shes a liar shes running a con on you to convince you to like her or at least trust her from there it would be a short commute to the recruiters office of the legion of doom i reminded myself very firmly that what the fallen angel offered meknowledge power companionshipwould come at too high a price it was foolish of me to keep falling back on her help even though what she had done for me had undoubtedly saved both my life and that of many others i reminded myself that too much dependence upon her would be a very very bad thing but she still looked sad i concentrated on my music for a moment it was hard not to experience the occasional fit of empathy for her the trick was to make sure that i never forgot her true goalseduction corruption the subversion of my free will the only way to prevent that was to be sure to guard my decisions and actions with detached reason rather than letting my emotions get the better of me if that happened it would be easy to play right into the true lasciels hands hell itd probably be fun i shook off that thought and lumbered through every breath you take by the police and an acoustic version of i will survive id put together myself after i finished that i tried to go through a little piece id written that was supposed to sound like classic spanish guitar while giving me a little exercise therapy on the mostly numb fingers of my left hand id played it a thousand times and while i had improved it was still something painful to listen to except this time this time i realized halfway in i was playing flawlessly i was playing faster than my usual tempo throwing in a few licks vibrato some nifty transitional phrasesand it sounded good like santana good i finished the song and then looked up at lasciel she was watching me steadily illusion i asked her she gave a small shake of her head i was merely helping i cant write original music anymore i havent made any music in ages i just helped the music you heard in your thoughts get out through your fingers i circumvented some of the damaged nerves it was all you otherwise my host which was just about the coolest thing lascield ever done for me dont get me wrong the survivaloriented things were superbut this was playing guitar she had helped me to create something of beauty and it satisfied an urge in me so deepset and vital that i had never really realized what it was somehow i knew without a hint of a doubt that i would never be able to play that well on my own ever again could evil true capitale evil do such a thing help create something whole and lovely and precious careful harry careful this isnt helping either of us i said quietly thank you but im learning it myself ill get there on my own i set the guitar down on its little stand besides theres work to be done she nodded once very well this is regarding thomass apartment and its contents yes i said can you show them to me lasciel lifted a hand and the wall opposite the fireplace changed technically it hadnt actually changed but lasciel who existed only as an entity of thought hanging around in my head was able to create illusions of startling even daunting clarity even if i was the only one who could perceive them she could sense the physical world through meand she carried aeons of knowledge and experience her memory and eye for detail were almost entirely flawless so she created the illusion of the wall of thomass war room and put it over my own wall it was even lit the same way as in my brothers apartment every detail i knew entirely faithful to what had seen earlier that night i padded over to the wall and started checking it out more thoroughly my brothers handwriting was all but unreadable which made the notes hed scribbled of dubious value in terms of actually enlightening me as to what was going on my host lasciel began i held up a hand for silence not yet let me look at it unprejudiced first then you tell me what you think as you wish i went over the stuff there for an hour or so frowning i had to go check a calendar a couple of times i got out a notebook and scribbled things down as i worked them out all right i said quietly settling back down on the sofa thomas was following several people the dead women and at least a dozen more in different parts of the city he had a running surveillance on them i think he probably hired a private detective or two to cover some of the observationkeeping tabs on where people were going figuring out the recurring events in their schedules i held up the notebook these are the names of the folks he wasi shruggedstalking i suppose my guess is that the other people on this list are among the missing folk the ladies of the ordo lebes told us about think you thomas preyed upon them lasciel asked i started to deny it instantly and firmly but stopped reason judgment rational thought he could have i said quietly but my instincts say it isnt him why would it not be lasciel asked me upon what do you base your reasoning upon thomas i said it isnt him to engage in wholesaled murder and abduction no way maybe he fell off the incubus wagon sure but he wouldnt inflict any more harm than he had to it isnt his way not his way by choice lasciel said though i feel i must point out that i cut her off waving a hand i know his sister could have gotten involved she already ate lord raiths free will she could have monkeyed around with thomass mind too and if not lara then there are plenty of others who might have done it thomas could be doing these things against his will hell he might not even remember hes doing them or he might be acting of his own volition he has another point of weakness lasciel said eh lara raith holds justine a point i hadnt yet considered justine was my brothers well i dont know if theres a word for what she was to him but he loved her and she him it wasnt their fault that she was slightly insane and he was a life forcedevouring creature of the night theyd been willing to give up their lives for each other in the midst of a crisis and the love confirmed by doing so had rendered justine deadly to my brother poisonous to him love is like that to the white court an intolerable agony to them the way holy water is to other breeds someone touched by pure and honest love cannot be fed uponwhich had more or less put an end to thomass ability to be near justine it was probably just as well that last time theyd been together had all but killed justine the last time id seen her shed been a wasted frail whitehaired thing barely capable of stringing sentences together it had torn my brother apart to see what he had done to her to my knowledge he hadnt even tried to be a part of her life again i couldnt blame him lara watched over justine now though she could not feed upon the girl any more than thomas could but lara could cut her throat if it came to that my brother might very well be capable of some unpleasant things in the interests of protecting justine strike that he was capable of anything where the girl was concerned means motive opportunity the equation of murder was balanced i looked back at the illusory wall where the pictures maps and notes grouped together in a broad band near the top then descended into fewer notes on the next strip down and so on forming a vague vshape at the top of the v rested a single square yellow sticky note that note read in a heavy hand ordo lebes find them dammit thomas i murmured quietly i addressed lasciel get rid of it lasciel nodded and the illusion disappeared there is something else you should know my host i eyed her whats that it may concern your safety and the course of your investigation may i show you the word no came strongly to mind but i was already in for a penny so to speak lasciels wealth of intelligence and experience made her an extremely capable adviser briefly she nodded rose and suddenly i was standing in anna ashs apartment as i had been that afternoon my host lasciel said remember you how many women you observed entering the building i frowned sure as many as half a dozen had the right look though anyone who arrived before murphy and i got there could have already been inside precisely lasciel said here she waved a hand and an image of me appeared in the apartments entry murphy at my side anna ash lasciel said she nodded toward me and annas image appeared facing me can you describe the others in attendance helen beckitt i said looking leaner and more weathered than the last time i saw her beckitts image appeared where she had been standing by the window i pointed at the wooden rocking chair abby and toto were there the plump blond woman and her dog appeared i rubbed at my forehead uh two on the sofa and one on the love seat three shadowy forms appeared in the named places i pointed at the sofa the pretty one in the dance leotard the one worried about time she appeared i pointed at the shadowed figure next to her bitter suspicious priscilla who was not being polite the shadowy figure became priscillas image and there you go i said lasciel shook her head waved her hand and the people images all vanished all except the shadowy figure sitting on the love seat i blinked what can you remember about this one lasciel asked me i racked my brain its usually good for this kind of thing nothing i said after a moment not one damned detail nothing i added two and two together and got trouble someone was under a veil someone good enough to make it subtle hard to tell it was there at all not invisible so much as extremely boring and unremarkable in your favor lasciel said i should point out that you had crossed the threshold uninvited and thus were deprived of much of your power in such a circumstance it would be most difficult for you to sense a veil at all much less to pierce it i nodded frowning at the shadowy figure it was deliberate i said anna goaded me into walking over the threshold on purpose she was hiding miss mystery from me entirely possible lasciel concurred or or they didnt know someone was there either i said and if thats the case i tossed the notebook aside with a growl and rose what are you doing she asked i got my staff and coat and got mouse ready to go if the mystery guest was news to the ordo shes right in among them and they could be in danger if the ordo knew about her then they played me and lied to me i ripped open the door with more than my usual effort either way im going over there to straighten some things out chapter ten i swept the beetle for bombs again and got the impression that i was going to get heartily sick of the chore fast it was clean and off we went i parked illegally on a street about a block from anna ashs apartment and walked the rest of the way in i rang buzzers more or less at random until someone buzzed me in and headed back up the stairs to annas apartment this time though i went in armed for bear as i rode up in the elevator i got out my jar of unguent a dark brown concoction that stained the skin for a couple of days i dabbed a finger in it and smeared it lightly onto my eyelids and at the base of my eyes it was an ointment originally intended to counter faerie glamour allowing those who had it to see through illusion to reality it wasnt quite right for seeing through a veil wrought with mortal magic but it should be strong enough to show me something of whatever the veil was hiding i should be able to glimpse any motion and that would at least give me an idea of which way to face if things got dicey i brought mouse for a reason too besides being a small moun tain of loyal muscle and ferocious fangs mouse could sense bad guys and dark magic when they were nearby i had yet to encounter the creature that could sneak by mouse unobserved but just in case today was the day i had the unguent as a backup plan i got off the elevator and the hairs on the back of my neck immediately rose up mouse lifted his head sharply looking back and forth down the hall hed felt what i had a fine cloud of magic hung over the entire floor i touched it carefully and found a suggestion of sleepone of the classics really this one wasnt heavy as such things go id seen one sleep spell that flattened an entire ward of cook county hospital id used another to protect murphys sanity and it had kept her out for nearly two days this one wasnt like that it was light barely noticeable and not at all threatening it was delicate and fine enough to filter into homes even through their thresholdsmost of which were weak enough apartments never seemed to have as much defense as a real discrete home if those other spells had been sleeping medication this one would have been a glass of warm milk someone wanted the residents of the floor to be insensible enough not to notice something but not so out as to be endangered should there be an emergency like the building catching fire and burning down dont look at me like that its a lot likelier than youd think anyway the suggestion was another finely crafted spell delicate precise subtle much like the earlier veil lasciel had spotted whoever or whatever was crafting these workings was a pro i made sure my shield bracelet was ready to go and marched up to annas door i could sense the ward there still active so i thumped my staff on the floor immediately in front of the door ms ash i called it wasnt like i was going to wake anyone up its harry dresden we need to talk there was silence i repeated myself i heard a sound that of someone striving to move silently a scuff or a creak so faint that i wasnt sure it had been real i checked mouse his ears were pricked up swiveled forward hed heard it too someone flushed a toilet on the floor above us i heard a door open and close a faint sound also on another floor there was no further sound from anna ashs apartment i didnt like where this was going at all stand back buddy i told mouse he did backing away in that clumsy reverse waddlewalk dogs do i turned to the ward it was like the little pigs straw house it wouldnt last more than a second or two against a big bad wolf and ill huff and ill puff i muttered i drew up my will took the staff in both hands and pressed one end slowly toward the door solvos i murmured solvos solvos as the staff touched the door i sent a gentle surge of will coursing down through its length it passed through the wood visibly the carved runes in it briefly illuminated from within by pale blue light my will hit annas door and scattered out in a cloud of pinprick sparkles of white light as my power unbound the patterns of the ward and reduced them to mere anarchy anna i called again ms ash no answer i tried the doorknob it was unlocked that cant be good i told mouse here we go i quietly opened the door giving it a gentle push so that it would swing wide and let me see inside the darkened apartment at which point the trap sprang for traps to work though they need to catch their target off guard i had my new and improved shield bracelet ready when greenish light flashed in the dark apartment and rushed swiftly toward me i lifted my left hand bound around my wrist was a chain made of braided strands of several metals silver predominant the metal shields that hung from the bracelet had in its previous incarnation been solid silver as well they had been replaced with shields of silver iron copper nickel and brass the new shield wasnt like the old one the old one had provided an intangible barrier meant to deflect solid matter and kinetic energy it hadnt been made to stop for example heat thats how my left hand got roasted practically down to the bones it had been of only limited use against other forms of magic or energy if there hadnt been a war on and if i hadnt been spending so much time drilling molly in the fundamentalsand therefore getting in all kinds of extra practice myselfi would never have considered attempting to create such a complex focus it was far more complicated than almost anything id done before five years ago it would have been beyond me completely more to the point five years ago i wouldnt have been as experienced or as strongly motivated but that was then and this was now the shield that formed in front of me was not the familiar translucent partdome of pale blue light instead it flared into place in a blurring swirl of colors that solidified in an instant into a curving rampart of silver energy the new shield was far more thorough than the old not only would it stop everything the old one had but it would provide shelter against heat cold electricityeven sound and light if i needed it to it had also been designed to turn aside a fairly broad spectrum of supernatural energies it was this last that was important at the moment a globe of green lightning sizzled over the apartments threshold and abruptly expanded buzzing arcs of verdant electricity interconnected in a diamond pattern like the weave of a fishermans net the spell fell on my shield and the meeting of energies yielded a torrent of angry yellow sparks that rebounded from the shield scattering over the hall the doorway and bouncing back into the apartment i dropped the shield as i brandished my staff sent a savage torrent of power down my arm and snarled forzare unseen force lashed through the doorwayand splashed against the apartments threshold most of the spells power struck that barrier grounded out and was dissipated what amounted to less than a percent of the power i had cast out actually made it through the doorway as i had known it would instead of delivering a surge of energy strong enough to flip over a car i delivered only a blow strong enough to knock an adult from her feet i heard a womans voice let out a surprised grunt at the impact and heavy objects clattered to the floor mouse i shouted the big dog bounded forward through the doorway and i went in right behind him once again the apartments threshold stripped away my power leaving me all but utterly unable to wield magic which is why id brought my revolver with me tucked into a duster pocket i had it in my left hand as i came through the door and hit the main light switch with my right elbow bellowing i have not had a very good day mouse had someone pinned on the ground and kept them there by virtue of simply sitting on them two hundred pounds of mouse is an awfully effective restraint and though he had his teeth bared he wasnt actively struggling or making any noise to my right anna ash stood frozen like a rabbit in a spotlight and my gun tracked to her immediately dont move i warned her i dont have any magic at the moment and that always make me really really ready to pull the trigger oh god she said her voice a rough whisper she licked her lips visibly trembling okay she said okay ddont hurt me please you dont have to do this i told her to walk over to mouse and his prisoner once she was standing where i could watch both of them at once i could relax a little and though i did not lower the gun i took my finger off the trigger do what what youve done to the others anna said her voice thread you dont have to do this not to anyone the others i demanded i probably sounded at least half as disgusted as i felt you think i came here to kill you she blinked at me a few times then she said you came here broke down my door and pointed a gun at me what am i supposed to think i did not break down your door it was unlocked you tore apart my ward because i thought you might be in trouble you twit i hollered i thought the killer might be here already a woman let out a couple of choking gasps after a moment i realized that it was the person mouse had pinned down letting out breathless laughter i lowered the gun and put it away for crying out loud you thought the killer was coming for you so you laid a trap for him well no anna said now looking somewhat confused again i mean i didnt do it the ordo we hired a private investigator to look into it it was her idea to trap the killer when he came here a private investigator i looked over at the other woman and said mouse my dog tail waving gently backed off right away and trotted over to stand beside me the woman hed been holding down sat up she was palenot the sickly pallor of no time in the sun but the color of the living healthy skin of a tree beneath the outer bark her lean face was intensely attractivemore intriguing than beautiful with wide intelligent eyes set over an expressive generous mouth she had a slim build all long legs and long arms and wore a simple pair of jeans along with a black aerosmith tshirt and brown leather birkenstocks she propped herself up on her elbows a tendril of wheatcolored hair falling to almost insolently conceal one eye and gave me a wry smile hello harry she dabbed her fingers at a little bloody spot on her lower lip and winced though there was still amusement in her voice is that a new staff or are you just happy to see me and after my heart had skipped a couple of beats i blinked and said in a very quiet voice to the first woman id ever everythinged hello elaine chapter eleven i sat on the love seat while anna ash made coffee mouse ever hopeful to cadge a snack followed anna into the kitchen and sat there giving her his most pathetic starvingdoggy body language and wagging his tail we sat down together with coffee like civilized people a few minutes later ms ash i said taking my cup anna please i nodded to her anna first i wish to apologize for frightening you it wasnt my intention she sipped her coffee frowning at me and then nodded i suppose i can understand your motivations thank you i said im sorry i blew up your ward ill be glad to replace it for you we put a lot of hours in on that thing anna sighed i mean i know it wasnt expert work we i asked the ordo she said we worked together to protect every ones home community project sort of a barn raising i said she nodded thats the idea she bit her lip but there were more of us when we did that for just a second the capable exterior wavered and anna looked very tired and very frightened i felt a little pang inside at the sight real fright isnt like the movies real fear is an ugly quiet relentless thing its a kind of pain and i hated seeing it on annas face i found elaine watching me her eyes thoughtful she sat on the sofa leaning forward so that her elbows rested on her spread knees she held her cup in one hand at a slight negligent angle on anyone else it would have looked masculine on elaine it only looked relaxed strong and confident he truly meant you no harm anna she said turning to our host hes got this psychosis about charging to the rescue i always thought it gave him a certain hapless charm i think we should focus on the future for the time being i said i think we need to pool our information and try to work together on this anna and elaine exchanged a long look anna glanced at me again and asked elaine are you sure elaine gave a single firm nod he isnt the one trying to hurt you im sure now sure now i said is that why you veiled yourself when i was here earlier elaines fine eyebrows lifted you didnt sense it when you were here how did you know i shrugged maybe a little bird told me do you really think im capable of something like that no elaine said but i had to be sure you know me better than that i said unable to keep a little heat out of my voice i trust you elaine said without a trace of apology in her tone but it might not have been you harry it could have been an impostor or you could have been acting under some form of coercion peoples lives were at stake i had to know i wanted to snarl back at her that if she so much as thought i might be the killer she didnt know me at all if thats how it was going to be i might as well get up and walk right out of the apartment before and then i sighed ah sweet bird of irony you were obviously expecting the killer to show up i said to anna the sleeping spell the ambush what made you think he might be coming me elaine said and what made you think that she gave me a dazzling innocent smile and imitated my tone and inflection maybe a little bird told me i snorted annas eyes suddenly widened you two were together she turned to elaine thats how you know him it was a long time ago i said elaine winked at me but you never really forget your first you never forget your first train wreck either train wrecks are exciting fun even elaine said she kept smiling though her eyes turned a little sad right up until the very last part i felt half a smile tug up one side of my mouth true i said but id appreciate it if you wouldnt try to dodge questions by throwing up a smoke screen of nostalgia elaine took a long sip of coffee and shrugged a shoulder ill show you mine if youll show me yours i folded my arms frowning sixty seconds ago you said that you trusted me she arched an eyebrow trust is a twoway street harry i leaned back took another sip of coffee and said maybe youre right i put it together after the fact when i was making notes of our conversation i couldnt remember noticing anything about the woman on the love seat which doesnt happen to me so i figured it must have been a veil and came over here because it was possible that whoever was under it was a threat to the ordo elaine pursed her lips frowning for a moment i see your turn she nodded ive been working out of la taking a lot of cases referred my waylike this one and chicago isnt the first city where this has happened i blinked at her what san diego san jose austin and seattle over the past year members of a number of small organizations like the ordo lebes have been systematically stalked and murdered most of them have appeared to be suicides counting chicago the killers taken thirtysix victims thirtysix i ran my thumb over the handle of the coffee cup frowning i havent heard a word about this nothing a year elaine nodded harry ive got to know is it possible that the wardens are involved no i said my tone firm no way because theyre such easygoing tolerant people she asked no because i know ramirez the regional commander for most of those cities he wouldnt be a part of something like that i shook my head besides weve got a manpower shortage the wardens are stretched pretty thin and theres no reason for them to go around killing people youre sure about ramirez elaine said can you say the same about every warden why because elaine said in every single one of those cities a man in a grey cloak was seen with at least two of the victims uhoh i put the coffee cup down on an end table and folded my arms thinking it wasnt general knowledge but someone on the council was leaking information to the vamps on a regular and devastating basis the traitor still had not been caught even worse i had seen evidence that there was another organization at work behind the scenes manipulating events on a scale large enough to indicate a powerful wellfunded and frighteningly capable groupand that at least some of them were wizards i had dubbed them the black council because it was obvious and id been keeping my ear to the ground for indications of their presence and look i found one which explains why i hadnt heard anything about it i said if everyone thinks the wardens are responsible theres not a prayer theyd draw attention to themselves by reporting what was happening and asking for help or call in a gumshoe who happens to be a warden himself elaine nodded right i started getting called in about a month after i got my own license and opened my business i grunted howd they know to call you she smiled im in the book under wizards i snorted i knew you were copying my test answers all those years if it aint broke dont fix it she pulled a strand of hair back behind one ear an old and familiar gesture that brought with it a pang of remembered desire and a dozen little memories most of the business has come in on referral though because i do good work in any case one fact about the killers victims was almost always the same people who lived alone or were isolated and i anna said quietly am the last living member of the ordo who lives alone or were isolated these other cities i said did the killer leave anything behind messages taunts like what elaine asked bible verses i said left in traces something only one of us would recognize she shook her head no nothing like that or if there was i never found it i exhaled slowly so far two of the deaths here have had messages left behind your friend janine and a woman named jessica blanche elaine frowned i gathered from what you said earlier it doesnt make any sense yes it does i said we just dont know why i frowned could any of the other deaths be attributed to the white court elaine frowned and rose she took her coffee cup to the kitchen and came back a pensive frown on her brow i cant be certain they havent i suppose i certainly havent seen anything to suggest it why excuse me anna said her voice quiet and unsure white court the white court of vampires i clarified theres more than one kind she asked yeah i said the red court are the ones the white council is fighting now theyre these batmonster things that can look human drink blood the white court are more like people theyre psychic parasites they seduce their victims and feed on human life energy elaine nodded but why did you ask me about them harry i took a deep breath i found something to suggest that jessica blanche may have died as the result of being fed upon by some kind of sexual predator elaine stared at me for a moment and then said the patterns been broken somethings changed i nodded theres something else involved in the equation or someone or someone i said she frowned theres one place to start looking jessica blanche i said without warning mouse came to his feet facing the door to the apartment and let out a bubbling basso growl i rose acutely conscious of the fact that my power was still interdicted by the apartments threshold and that i didnt have enough magic to spell my way out of a paper bag the lights went out mouse continued to growl oh god anna said whats happening i clenched my teeth and closed my eyes waiting for them to adjust to the sudden darkness when a very slight acrid scent tickled my nose you smell that i asked elaines voice was steady calm smell what smoke i said weve got to get out of here i think the buildings on fire chapter twelve light i said almost before i was finished saying the word elaine murmured quietly and the pentacle amulet she wore nearly a twin to mine began to glow with a greenwhite light she held it overhead by its silver chain by its light i crossed to the door and felt it like those cartoons when i was little said you were supposed to do it felt like a door no fire in the hall i said fire stairs elaine said theyre not far anna said mouse continued staring at the door growling in a low and steady rumble the smoke smell had thickened somethings waiting for us in the hall what anna said elaine looked from mouse to me and bit her lip window my heart was skipping along too fast i dont like fire i dont like getting burned it hurts and its ugly might be able to handle the fall i said forcing myself to breathe slowly evenly but theres a building full of people here and none of the alarms or sprinklers have gone off someone must have hexed them weve got to warn the residents mouses head whipped around and he stared intently at me for a second then he trotted in a little circle shook his head made a couple of chuffing sounds and started doing something i hadnt heard him do since he was a puppy small enough to fit in my duster pocket he barked loud steady woof woof woof with the mechanical regularity of a metronome now saying he was barking might give you the general shape of things but it doesnt convey the scale everyone in chicago knows what a stormwarning siren sounds like theyre spread liberally through the midwestern states that comprise tornado alley they make your usual warning siren sound but i had an apartment about thirty yards from one of them once upon a time and take it from me that sound is a whole different thing when youre next to it it isnt an ululating wail when youre that close to the source its a tangible flood a solid living sonic cascade that rattles your brain against your skull mouses bark was like thatbut on several levels every time he barked i swear to you several of my muscles tightened and twitched as if hit with a miniature jolt of adrenaline i couldnt have slept through half as much racket even without the odd little jabs of energy that hit me like separate charges of electricity with each bark it was deafening in the little apartment nearly as loud as gunfire he let out twelve painfully loud barks and then stopped my ears rang in the sudden silence that followed within seconds i began to hear thumping sounds on the floor above me bare feet swinging out of beds and landing hard on the floor almost in unison like something youd expect in a training barracks someone shouted in the apartment neighboring annas other dogs started barking children started crying doors started slamming open mouse sat down again his head tilting this way and that ears twitching at each new noise hells bells harry elaine breathed her eyes wide is that where did you get a real temple dog uh a place kind of like this now that you mention it i gave mouses ears a quick ruffling and said good dog mouse wagged his tail at me and grinned at the praise i opened the door with the hand that wasnt holding a gun and took a quick look around in the hall flashlights were bobbing and sweeping from several places each one producing a visible beam in the thickening pall of smoke people were screaming fire fire get everybody out the hallway was in chaos i couldnt see if anyone out there looked like a lurking menace but odds were good that if i couldnt see them they wouldnt see me either in all the milling confusion of hundreds of people fleeing the building anna where are the fire stairs um where everyones running anna said to the right right i said okay heres the plan we follow all the other flammable people out of the building before we burn to death whoever did this is going to be waiting for us outside elaine warned not a very private place for a murder anymore i said but well be careful me and mouse first anna you right behind us elaine cover our backside shields she asked me yeah can you do your half she arched an eyebrow at me right i said what was i thinking i took mouses lead in one hand glanced at my staff and then said were working on the honor system here mouse calmly opened his mouth and held on to his own lead i picked up my staff in my right hand kept the gun in the other and slipped it into my dusters pocket to conceal the weapon anna keep your hand on my shoulder i felt her grab on to the mantle of my duster good mouse mouse and i hit the hallway with anna right on my heels we fled im not too manly to admit it we scampered retreated vamoosed amscrayed burning buildings are freaking terrifying and i should know this was the first time id been in one quite this occupied though and i expected more panic than i sensed around us maybe it was the way mouse had woken everyone i saw no one stumbling along the way they would if they had been suddenly roused from deep sleep everyone was bright eyed and bushy tailed metaphorically speaking and while they were clearly afraid the fear was aiding the evacuation not hindering it the smoke got thicker as we went down one flight of stairs then another it started getting hard to breathe and i was choking on it as we descended i began to panic its the smoke that kills most people long before the fire ever gets to them but there seemed little to do but press on then we were through the smoke the fire had begun three floors below annas apartment and the fire door to that floor was simply missing from its hinges black smoke rolled thickly out of the hall beyond it we had made it down through the smoke but there were four floors above ours and the smoke was being drawn up the stairs like they were an enormous chimney the people still above us would be blinded by it unable to breathe and god only knew what would happen to them elaine i choked out got it she called back coughingand then she was beside the doorway black smoke trying to envelop her she extended her right hand in a gesture that somehow managed to be imperious and the smoke abruptly vanished well not exactly there was a faint shimmer of light over the open doorway and on the other side of it the smoke roiled and billowed as if pressing up against glass the acoustics of the stairway altered the chewing roar of fire suddenly muted the sound of footsteps and panting people becoming louder elaine examined the field over the doorway for a moment nodded once and turned to catch up with us her manner brisk and businesslike you need to stay to let anyone through i asked her mouse leaned against my legs clearly afraid and eager to leave the building she held up a hand to silence me after a moment she said no permeable to the living concentrating we have a minute maybe two permeable holy moly i could never have managed that on the fly but then elaine always was more skilled than me when it came to the complex stuff right i said i took her hand plopped it down on annas shoulder and said move come on after that it was nothing but stairs bobbing flashlights echoing voices and footsteps i run not because its good for me even though it is but because i want to be able to run whenever somethings chasing me it did me a limited amount of good given that i was spending half of my time coughing on the stillpresent smoke but i at least had enough presence of mind to keep an eye on anna and the distracted elaine as well as making sure that i didnt trip over mouse or get trampled from behind when we got to the second floor i prepped my shield and called over my shoulder elaine she let out a gasping breath her head bowing forward she wavered and clutched at the stairs handrail anna moved at once to support her and keep her moving there was a crashing roaring sound above us and cries of fright came down the stairs move move i told them elaine be ready to shield she nodded once and twisted a simple silver ring on her left forefinger around revealing a kiteshaped shield device not unlike one of my own charms we went down the last flight of stairs and hit the door to the street outside it was not dark though the streetlight beside the building was out the others on the street worked just fine added to that was the fire from the burning apartment it wasnt blinding or anything since you could see it only through windows and whenever one of those was open or broken it tended to billow black smoke i could see clearly though people came hustling out of the building all coughing someone outside the buildingor with a cell phonemust have called in the fire because an impressive number of emergency vehicle sirens were drawing nigh the escapees filed across the street for the most part getting to what seemed a safe distance and turning back to look at their homes they were in various states of dishabille including one rather generously appointed young lady wearing a set of red satin sheets and dangling a pair of sixinch heels from one hand the young man with her with a red silk bathrobe belted kiltlike around his waist looked understandably frustrated i noticed only because as a professional investigator i have trained myself to be a keen observer thats why as i looked around the rest of the crowd to see if red satin sheets and spike heels were becoming a new fad and if maybe i should have some on hand just in case i saw the tall man in the grey cloak he was shadowed by the headlights of fire trucks coming down the street toward us but i saw the sway of the grey cloak as if hed sensed my attention he turned i got nothing useful out of his silhouette for identifying him i guess the greycloaked man didnt know that he froze for a full second facing me and then turned and sprinted around the corner mouse i snapped stay with anna then i took off after grey cloak chapter thirteen thoughtlessly running headlong after someone alone at night in chicago is not generally a bright idea this is stupid i panted to myself harry you jackass this is how you keep getting yourself into trouble grey cloak moved with the long almost floating stride of an athlete running the mile and turned into an alley where the shadows grew thicker and where we would be out of sight of any of the cops or emergency response people i had to think about this i needed to figure out what he was doing okay so im grey cloak i want to gack anna ash so i start a fireno wait so i use one of the incendiary devices like the one in murphys saturn put it on a kitchen timer a couple of floors below annas place cut the buildings power phones and alarms and set the whole shebang on fire boom then i wait outside annas door for her to emerge in a panic so that i can murder her leave and let the evidence burn in the subsequent inferno now it all looks like an accident only i dont expect anna to have a pair of worldclass wizards on hand and i sure as hell never saw mouse coming the dog barks and all of a sudden the hall is full of people who can witness the murder and theres no way to make it look accidental someone is almost certain to contact the authorities and send in the whirling lights within a few moments and there goes my whole evening no use trying to complete a subtle hit now so what do i do i dont want attention thats for sure or i wouldnt be trying so hard to make this murder look like an accident im cautious smart and patient or i wouldnt have gotten away with it in four other cities i do what a smart predator does when a stalk goes sour i bug out ive got a car nearby a getaway vehicle grey cloak reached the end of the alley and turned left with me about twenty feet behind him then he rounded a corner and sprinted into a parking garage i did not follow him see since im such a competent and methodical killer i assume the worstthat anyone in pursuit will display just as much intelligence and resourcefulness so what i do is pull the chase into the parking garage where theres lots of angles that will break line of sightbut my getaway car isnt parked there theres no way im going to wait around to pay the attendant and smashing my way out would attract the attention im trying to avoid the plan is to lose a pursuer in the ample shadows ramps doorways and parked cars in the maze of the garage and go to my car once ive given him the slip i kept sprinting down the street and rounded a corner then i stopped crouched and ready to continue running the far side of the garage had no parking places nor did the alley so grey cloaks car had to be either on the street in front of the garage or on the street along its side from that corner i could watch both i hunkered down beside a city trash can and hoped that i was as clever as i seemed to think i was i was pretty sure it would have been at best stupid and at worst lethal to pursue grey cloak into the dark of the parking garage i might have one hell of a punch but i was as fragile as the next person and cornering grey cloak might draw out the savagery of desperation if i slipped up and he got too close to me he might drop me like a pair of dirty socks always assuming of course that he wasnt an actual warden in which case he might well hit me with lightning or fire or any number of other nasty attacks of choice that was a thought i found more than a little comfortable really id spent most of my adult life living in fear of the councils wardens theyd been my persecutors my personal furies and despite the fact that id become one i felt an almost childish glee in the notion that a warden might be my bad guy it would give me a perfect opportunity to lay out some longdeserved payback with perfect justification unless of course it was a warden doing it under orders once upon a time id have told you that the white council was made up of basically decent people who valued human life now i knew better the council broke the laws when it saw fit to do so it executed children who in their ignorance violated those same laws the war too had made the council desperate more willing to take chances and make hard decisions that amounted to other people getting killed while the councils bony collective ass stayed as covered as possible it didnt seem reasonable to think that a legitimate warden could have sunk to such measures or that captain luccio the wardens commander would condone itbut ive gotten used to being disappointed in the honor and sincerity of the council in general and the wardens in particular for that matter i probably shouldnt expect too much rationality out of grey cloak either my scenario to predict his behavior was plausible rational but a rational person wouldnt be going around murdering people and making it look like suicide would he i was probably wasting my time a shadowy figure vaulted from the roof of the parking garage and dropped six stories to the ground landing on the sidewalk in a crouch grey cloak was still for a second maybe listening and then rose and began to walk quickly but calmly toward the street and the cars parked along it i blinked son of a gun i guess sometimes logic does work i clenched my teeth gripped my staff and rose to confront grey cloak and blow him straight to hell and stopped if grey cloak truly was part of the black council working to undermine the white council and generally do whatever largescale badness they intended to do blowing him to hell might not be the smart thing to do the black council had been if you will pardon the phrasing a phantom menace i was sure that they were up to no good and their methods thus far seemed to indicate that they had no inhibitions about the ending of innocent livesreinforced by grey cloaks willingness to burn a building full of people to death to cover up the murder of a single target it fit their pattern shadowy nebulous leaving no direct obvious evidence of who they were or what they wanted if they existed at all that is so far they were just a theory then again grey cloaks getaway car had been just a theory too this could be a chance to gain badly needed intelligence on the black council knowledge is the ultimate weapon it always has been i could let grey cloak go and tail him to see what i could learn before i brought the hammer down maybe hed lead me to something vital something as critical as enigma had been to the allies in wwii on the other hand maybe hed lead me back to nothing no covert organization worth its salt would allow an operative into the field without planning for the contingency of said operative being compromised hell even if grey cloak volunteered everything he knew there would almost certainly be cutouts in place all of which assumed he really was part of the black council a big assumption and when you assume you make an ass out of you and umption if i didnt stop him while i had the chance grey cloak would strike again more people would die yeah harry and how many more people will die if the black council keeps rising to power dammit my gut told me to drop grey cloak right now the faces from police photos flickered through my thoughts and in my imagination the slain women stood beside me behind me their glassy dead eyes intent upon their killer and their desire to be avenged i longed with an almost apocalyptic passion to step into the open and lay waste to this murdering asshole but reason told me otherwise reason told me to slow down think and consider how to do the most good for the most people hadnt i been telling myself only hours ago that reason had to guide my actions my decisions if i was to keep control of myself it was hard it was really really hard but i fought off the adrenaline and lust for a fight and hunkered back down thinking furiously while grey cloak got into a green sedan started it and pulled out onto the street i crouched between two parked cars and waited out of sight until grey cloak drove by me i pointed the end of my staff at the cars back panel gathered my will and whispered forzare raw force lanced out focused into the tiniest area i could envision and struck the car with a little pop no louder than that produced by stray bits of gravel tossed up against the vehicles undercarriage the car went by without slowing and i got the license number as it left once it was gone i murmured tractis keeping my will focused on the staff and drew it back until i could rise into the light of a street lamp and peer at the end of the length of oak a fleck of green paint half the size of a dime had adhered to the end of the staff i licked my fingertip and pressed it to the paint lifting it off the staff i had a small box of waterproof matches in one pocket of the duster i opened it with one hand dumped the matches and then carefully placed the fleck of paint inside gotcha i muttered grey cloak in all probability would ditch the car before long so i didnt have much time if he slipped away any further harm he caused would be on my own head i refused to let that happen i put the closed matchbox into in my pocket turned and ran back toward elaine and anna by the time i got there the block was lit nearly daylightbright with the roaring flames from the apartment building and a steadily increasing number of flashing emergency lights i found elaine anna and mouse and walked toward them harry elaine said relief on her face hey you get him not yet i said got some followup work to do you have somewhere safe my room at the hotel should be safe enough i dont think anyone here knows who i am the amber inn right take anna there ill call you no anna said firmly i glanced at the burning building and squinted at anna i guess youd rather have a quiet night at home huh id rather make sure the rest of the ordo is all right she said what if the killer decides to go after one of them elaine i said expecting her support elaine shrugged im working for her harry i muttered a quiet curse under my breath and shook my head fine get them all and fort up ill call you by morning elaine nodded come on mouse i said i took his lead and we headed for homeand little chicago chapter fourteen when we got back to my apartment mouse shambled straight to the plastic punch bowl that holds his kibble he ate it with a steady famished determination until it was all gone then he emptied his water bowl went to his usual nap spot and slumped to the floor without even turning in a circle first he was asleep almost before he stopped moving i stopped by him to ruffle his ears and check his nose which was wet and cold like it was supposed to be his tail twitched faintly at my touch but he was clearly exhausted whatever it was about those barks that had impossibly roused an entire building all at once must have taken something out of him i took my duster off draped it over him and let him sleep i called toemosss place once again but got only his answering machine so i grabbed my heavy flannel robefor warmth since the lab was far enough underground to always be chillypulled up the throw rug that covers the door in the living room floor and stumped down the folding stair steps flicking candles to life with a gesture and a whisper of will as i went my lab had always been a little crowded but it had become more so since i had begun teaching molly the lab was a rectangular concrete box simple wire shelves covered three walls stacked up high with books and containers of various ingredients i would use like the thick sealed lead box that contained an ounce and a half of depleted uranium filings and loaded down with various objects of arcane significance like the bleached human skull that occupied its own shelf along with several paperback romance novels or professional curiosity like the collection of vampire fangs the wardens in the united states me and ramirez mostly had gathered in the course of several skirmishes over the past year at the far end on the open wall i had managed to shoehorn a tiny desk and chair into the lab molly did some of her studying there kept her journal learned power calculations and had several books id told her to read wed begun working on some basic potions and the beakers and burners occupied most of the surface of her desk which was just as well considering the stains that got left on it during her first potion meltdown set into the concrete floor beside the desk was a simple ring of silver i used as a summoning circle the table in the middle of the room had once been my work area no longer now it was wholly occupied by little chicago little chicago was a scale model of chicago itself or at least of the heart of the town which id expanded from its original design to include everything within about four miles of burnham harbor every building every street every tree was represented by a custommade scale model of pewter each contained a tiny piece of the reality it representedbark chipped from trees tiny pieces of asphalt gouged from the streets flakes of brick broken from the buildings with a hammer the model would let me use my magic in new and interesting ways and should enable me to find out a lot more about grey cloak than i would have been able to do in the past or it might blow up you know one of the two i was still a young wizard and little chicago was a complex toy containing an enormous amount of magical energy i had to work hard to keep it uptodate matched to the real chicago or it wouldnt function correctlyie it would fail possibly in a spectacular fashion releasing all that energy in the relatively cramped confines of the lab would most likely render me extra crispy it was an elaborate and expensive tool and i never would have so much as considered creating it if i didnt have an expert consultant i took the matchbox from my pocket and set it on the edge of the table glanced up at the skull on its shelf and said bob up and at em the skull quivered a little on its wooden shelf and tiny nebulous orange lights appeared in its empty eyes there was a sound like a human yawn and then the skull turned slightly toward me and asked whats up boss evils afoot well sure bob said because it refuses to learn the metric system otherwise itd be up to a meter by now youre in a mood i noted im excited i get to meet the cookie now right i gave the skull a very firm look she is not a cookie neither is she a biscuit a poptart sweettart apple tart or any other kind of pastry she is my apprentice whatever bob said i get to meet her now yeah no i said firmly oh bob said his tone as disappointed and petulant as a sixyearold child who has just been told that it is bedtime why not because she still hasnt got a very good idea of how to handle power wisely i said i could help her bob said she could do a lot more if i was helping exactly i said youre under the radar until i say otherwise do not draw attention to yourself do not reveal any of your nature to her when mollys around youre an inanimate knickknack until i say otherwise hmph bob said at this rate im never gonna get to see her naked in time i snorted in time for what in time to behold her in her full springy nubile youthful glory by the time you let me talk to her shell have started to droop im almost certain youll survive the trauma i said life is about more than just survival harry true i said theres also work bob rolled his eyelights in the skulls empty sockets brother youre keeping her cloistered and working me like a dog too thats not fair i started getting out the stuff id need to fire up little chicago dog right something odd happened tonight i told bob about mouse and his barking what do you know about temple dogs more than you bob said but not much most of what i got is collected hearsay and folklore any of it likely true a bit he said there are a few points of confluence where multiple sources agree hit me well theyre not entirely mortal bob said theyre the scions of a celestial being called a foo dog and a mortal canine theyre very intelligent very loyal tough and can seriously kick ass if they need to do it but mostly theyre sentinels they keep an eye out for dark spirits or dark energy guard the people or places theyre supposed to guard and alert others to the presence of danger explains why ancient mai made those temple dog statues to assist the wardens in maintaining security i suppose i got out a shorthandled duster made of a rowan wand and a bundle of owl feathers and began to carefully clean the dust from the model city what about the barking thing their bark has some kind of spiritual power bob said a lot of stories say that they can make themselves be heard from fifty or sixty miles away it isnt just a physical thing either it carries over into the nevernever and can be heard clearly by noncorporeal entities it startles them drives most of them awayand if any of them stick around mouse could take his teeth to them even though theyre spirits i figure that this alarmclock bark he did was a part of that protective power alerting others to danger i grunted superdog but not bulletproof they can be killed just like anything else there was a thought i wondered if i could find someone to make mouse a kevlar vest okay bob i said get it fired up and give it a onceover right boss i hope you will note that i am doing this without once complaining how unfair it is that youve seen the cupcake nekkid and i havent so noted i picked up the skull and set it down on the sheet of translucent rubbery blue plastic that represented lake michigan check it out while i get my spell face on the skull spun around to face the city while i settled down on the floor legs crossed hands resting lightly on my knees and closed my eyes focusing on drawing my thoughts to stillness my heart to a slow slow beat i breathed slowly deeply systematically walling out worries emotions everything but purpose one time when wed been discussing martial arts murphy told me that eventually no one can teach you anything more about them once you reach that state of knowledge the only way to keep learning and increasing your own skill is to teach what you know to others thats why she teaches a childrens class and a rapedefense course every spring and fall at one of her neighborhoods community centers it sounded kind of flakyzen to me at the time but hells bells shed been right once upon a time it would have taken me an hour if not more to attain the proper frame of mind in the course of teaching molly to meditate though i had found myself going over the basics again for the first time in years and understanding them with a deeper and richer perspective than id had when i was her age id been getting almost as much insight and new understanding of my knowledge from teaching molly as shed been learning from me it took me ten minutes twelve at the most to prepare my thoughts and will by the time i stood up again there was nothing left in the whole world but me little chicago and my need to find a murderer bob i whispered everythings nominal were in the green captain he said affecting a scottish accent i nodded without speaking then i drew in my will and the skulls eyelights dwindled to the size of pinpricks so did all the candles newborn black shadows began stretching between the pewter buildings overlaying the model streets the temperature in the lab dropped another degree or two as i pulled in energy from all around me and my skin flushed as my body temperature went up a couple of degrees when i slowly exhaled my heated breath formed vapor that drifted around my nose and mouth i moved slowly precisely and picked up the matchbox then i opened it and exposed the fleck of paint inside and leaned over to carefully place the paint down on the tiny model of my apartment building i stood over the table my hand touching the paint and the map and released my will with a repeated murmur of reperios invenios i felt my senses blur for a moment and then little chicago rushed toward me its buildings growing until i stood upon the street outside the now lifesized pewter replica of my apartment building i took a moment to look around it looked like chicago flickers of motion surrounded me faint outlines of leaves stirred in the pewter trees ghostly images of the realworld leaves on the trees of the actual chicago faint lights emanated from blank pewter windowpanes ghostly cars whispered by on the streets i could hear the muted sounds of the city catch the barest hints of scents on the air unnervingly i could look up and see myself my actual physical body towering over the model city like godzillas hyperthyroid cousin the sky over little chicago held twinkling lightsthe dim glows of the labs candles and bobs eyelights all too large to be stars the way the sun is supposed to look from the outer planets i held up the matchbox my will surging down my arm it touched on the little flake of paint which erupted into viridian light and rose into the air above my hand hovered for a moment and then streaked off to the north like a miniature comet maybe you got away with this crap in other towns grey cloak i muttered but chicagos mine my own flesh dissolved into flickering silver light and i felt myself rush after the energy of the seeking spell streaking through the ghostly images of chicagos nightlife in the model all around me one more insubstantial shade among thousands the seeking spell came to rest a block and a half south of goudy square park a little slice of green the city managed to squeeze in amidst a bunch of architecture the brilliant mote of light settled onto a ghostly image of a moving car and the image suddenly became solid and visible gotcha i growled under my breath and drifted close to the car hovering right over its rear bumper and focused on the driver the ghost image remained hazy dammit my magic had latched onto the car and it wasnt going to be easy to get a better look at the driver than i already had i might be able to pour more energy into the spell attain greater clarity but i wanted to save that as a last resort too much could cause the whole thing to blowand it would certainly leave me too exhausted to maintain the connection better to hover now and listen sound would be easier to pick up resonating against the car against the surrounding city i had modeled for the spell the car stopped a stones throw from the park its a bifurcated little place simultaneously trying to contain a designer garden and a childrens playground and every time id look at it it seemed to me that the kids were winning good for them nobody who is four or six or eight years old needs to feel conflicted about their play area impeding the italian renaissance sensibilities of a landscape artist heck i was probably at least that mature and i was pretty sure i didnt need it either i focused on the spell and the sounds of the city night came to life around me growing in volume rising from a distant ghostly murmur to simple ambience as if id been standing there traffic sounds a distant siren the almost subliminal sound of wheels rushing by on the highway a mile off the cricketlike chirrup of a car alarm to me it was the orchestra tuning and warming up before the overture footsteps swift and confident coming closer the curtain was going up the passenger door of the green car opened and a second shadowy figure joined the first the door closed harder than it needed to are you insane the passenger asked meeting here whats wrong with here grey cloak asked his voice was a light tenor though it sounded distant hazy like a partially obscured radio transmission an accent something from eastern europe maybe it was hard to make out the particulars its a bloody upperclass wasp neighborhood the passenger snarled his voice was deeper similarly obscured and bore no trace of foreign accent he sounded like a newscaster standard midwestern american theres private security here police if anyone raises any kind of alarm its going to attract a great deal of attention in short order grey cloak let out a low laugh which is why we are safe its late at night all the little dears are sleeping the sleep of the fat and happy no one is awake to see us here the other said something rude there was a flicker of light in the passenger seat and it took me a second to work out that hed just lit a cigarette well no no the passenger said no kine no wizard what do you mean no both grey cloak said his tone turned cold you told me he was afraid of fire he is the passenger said you should see his fucking hand i felt my left hand clench tight and the crackle of popping knuckles in my very real laboratory drifted through the magical simulation of the city grey cloaks head whipped around what the passenger asked did you hear that hear what something grey cloak said i felt myself holding my breath willing my fingers to unclench the passenger looked around for a moment then snorted youre nervous about him thats all you missed him and youre nervous not nervous grey cloak said understandably cautious he has more resources and more versatility than your people realize its quite possible that hes keeping track of me in some way i doubt that it would take a subtle worker of the art to manage that he isnt one no grey cloak asked he managed to sense the fire before it could cut him off to somehow waken the entire building from sound sleep all at the same time and to track me after i departed the passenger tensed you came here with him behind you no i lost him before he could do so but that does not preclude the use of more subtle means to engage in pursuit hes a thug the passenger said plain and simple his talents make him good at destruction and little else hes a beast to be prodded and directed there was silence for a moment it amazes me grey cloak said then that an idiot such as you survived crossing the wizard once aha interesting the passenger at least was someone id seen before hed walked away from it too most of the individuals id faced hadnt done thatwhich bothered me a hell of a lot at timesbut even so thered been more than a couple and the passenger could be any number of them that did narrow it down considerably from the several billion possibilities id had a moment before though and i felt something of a chill at grey cloaks words he was more aware of his surroundings than anyone running on five simple senses should be and he was a thinker thats never a good quality in an enemy a smart foe doesnt have to be stronger than you doesnt have to be faster and doesnt even really have to be there to be a lethal threat hell if that car bomb hadnt been set off early hed have cooked murphy and me both and i would have died without even knowing he existed to be honest im surprised the wizard lived the night the passenger said it doesnt matter either way if wed killed him we could have claimed credit for his demise and it would have served our purpose now we let him rampage over the skavis and it does nothing but help unless grey cloak said sourly he happens to rampage over us as well they were both quiet for a moment then the passenger said at least one thing is accomplished hes interested in stopping the culling oh yes grey cloak said youve gotten his attention the question of course is whether or not he will be as cooperative as you seem to believe with a gathering of female wizardlings at risk oh yes he wont be able to help himself now that he knows what the skavis is up to dresden will be falling all over himself to protect them aha the skavis and they were maneuvering me to kick his ass finally something useful will he strike at the kine soon grey cloak asked referring to the skavis i presumed not yet it isnt his style hell wait a day or two before moving again he wants them to suffer waiting for him mmmm grey cloak said i normally think the skaviss tastes repulsive but in this particular instance i suspect his might intersect with my own anticipation makes them taste sweeter oh of course by all means the passenger said sourly throw away everything we might achieve in order to indulge your sweet tooth grey cloak let out a low chuckle alas not yet i hardly think the circle would react well to such a course speaking of which how does your own endeavor fare less than well the passenger said he isnt talking to me did you really expect him to the passenger shrugged he is family but thats of no matter ill find them in time whether he cooperates or not for your sake i hope so grey cloak said the circle has asked me for a progress report the passenger shifted uneasily have they what are you going to tell them the truth you cant be serious on the contrary grey cloak said they react badly to incompetence the passenger said and murderously to deception the passenger took another long drag on his cigarette and cursed again then he said no help for it then there is no need to soil yourself we are not yet past our deadline and they do not destroy tools that may still be of use the passenger let out a nasty laugh theyre hard but fair theyre hard grey cloak replied if necessary the passenger said we can remove him we have the resources for it i could always i believe it premature unless he proves more threatening than he has been thus far grey cloak said i expect the circle would agree when do i meet them the passenger asked facetoface that is not my decision i am a liaison nothing more he shrugged but should this project proceed i suspect they will desire an interview ill succeed the passenger said darkly he cant have taken them far then i suggest you get moving grey cloak said before the skavis beats you to the prize beats us the passenger said i could hear a faint smile touch grey cloaks voice of course there was a smoldering silence and then the passenger shoved the door open exited the car and left without a further word grey cloak watched him until hed vanished into the night then he got out of the car insubstantial i willed myself forward into the vehicle and looked the steering column had been cracked open the vehicle hotwired i was torn for a second which of the two to follow the passenger was trying to get information out of someone that could mean that he had a prisoner somewhere he was interrogating on the other hand it could just as likely mean that no matter how many drinks he poured he couldnt get an informant to open up on a given topic i also knew that he had confronted me before at some pointwhich was a great deal more than i knew about grey cloak he was something very different he had tried to kill me a couple of times already and was apparently responsible for at least some of the recent deaths he was smart and was connected to some kind of shady group called the circle could this be the reality of my heretofore theoretical black council he was walking away from the car now my spells anchor and growing rapidly hazier as he walked away if i didnt pursue him closely hed vanish into the vastness of the city whoever the passenger had been i had apparently sent him running once already if id done it once i could do it again grey cloak then i pressed in close to grey cloak focusing to keep the spell clearly fixed and followed him he walked several blocks turned down a sharp alley and then descended a flight of stairs that ended at a boardedover doorway to what must have originally been a basement apartment like my own he glanced around tugged down a chain that looked like it had rusted flat to the wall beside the door and opened it disappearing within crap if this place had a threshold on it id never be able to follow him inside id just bang my metaphysical head against the doorway like a bird hitting a windshield never mind that if it had the proper kinds of wards they could conceivably disintegrate my spiritual self or at least inflict some fairly horrible psychic damage i could wind up on the floor of my lab drooling transformed from professional wizard into unemployed vegetable screw it you dont do a job like mine by running away at any hint of danger i steeled myself and willed myself forward following grey cloak chapter fifteen no threshold which was good no wards which was even better grey cloak hadnt entered a living areahed entered undertown chicago is an old cityat least by american standards it has been standing in one form or another since the french and indian war before the united states even existed being as chicago is basically one giant swamp from a strictly geographic point of view buildings tended to slowly settle into the earth over years and years the old wooden streets did the same and new streets had to be built atop them in successive layers wherever the ground isnt slowmotion mud theres solid rock tunnels and cave systems riddle the area the manhattan project had been housed briefly in such tunnels before it got relocated to the middle of nowhere someone in the government had shown unaccountably good judgment in considering the notion that developing a freaking nuclear weapon smack in the middle of americas secondlargest city qualified as a bad idea all of that had left behind an enormous labyrinth of passages caves halfcollapsed old buildings and crumbling tunnels seemingly ready to come thundering down at any moment it was dark human beings rarely went there and as a result undertown had become a home shelter and hiding place to all kinds of nasty thingsthings no mortal not even a wizard had ever seen some of those things in turn had expanded some of the tunnels and caves establishing jealously protected territories that never saw the face of the sun never heard the whisper of wind its dark close cold and intensely creepy down there the fact that it was inhabited by things that had no love for mankind and potential radioactivity to boot didnt do much to boost its tourism industry grey cloak paced swiftly through a crack in the back wall of the building and into undertowns tunnels he grew even more indistinct as he did i had to stay closer to him and it cost me an increasingly greater effort of will to do so little chicago hadnt accurately modeled undertown partly because there were no maps to be had of the place and because taking samples to incorporate into the model would have been an act just shy of active suicide mostly though it hadnt happened because i had never considered doing so through the translucent veil of earth and stone and brick i could still see the real me standing over the city my hand was still held out but my fingers were trembling and sweat beaded my forehead odd that i couldnt feel the strain on my body from here i hadnt anticipated that it was entirely possible that i might have continued on without ever realizing what the effort was costing me it could kill my physical body leaving me i dont know what it might kill me outright it might kill my body while stranding my mind here it might bind my awareness into place like some sort of pathetic ghost get tough dresden you didnt take up this career to run at the first hint of fatigue i kept goingbut all the same i looked up to check on myself as often as i could grey cloak was not long in reaching his goal he found a narrow cleft in a rock wall slipped inside it and then pressed his hands and feet against either wall on the inside of the cleft and climbed up it with rapid precision eight or nine feet up it opened into a room with three walls of brick and one of eartha partially collapsed basement i assumed there were a few creature comforts in itan inflatable mattress and sleeping bag a lantern a miniature barbecue next to a heavy paper bag of charcoal and several cardboard boxes that contained supplies grey cloak slipped a heavy grate over the hole hed just climbed up and weighted it down with several stones the size of cinder blocks then he opened a box unwrapped a pair of those mealreplacement bars that people use to punish themselves when they think theyre overweight ate them and emptied a plastic bottle of water critical information there glad i was risking my metaphysical neck to pick up vital clues like this i checked up over my shoulder my face had gone white and ran with sweat i expected grey cloak to turn in but instead he turned the lantern down low opened a second box withdrew a plaque the size of a dinner plate and laid it down on the floor it was a simple wooden base inset with a ring of some reddish metal probably copper grey cloak pressed a fingernail against one of his gums and when he withdrew it his fingertip glistened with blood that looked far more solid and real than the person it had come from he touched it to the circle and began a low chant i did not recognize a faint mist swirled up within the copper circle and through the spell i could see the raw magic forming itself into a pattern a vortex that vanished beneath the plaque a second later the mist resolved itself into a figure in miniature a vaguely humanoid shape wearing a heavy cloak and cowl that hid any possible details of appearance except that id seen him beforeor at least someone who dressed exactly like him the last time id seen cowl hed been caught in the unbelievably savage backlash of an enormous powersummoning spell called a darkhallow it would have been impossible for the man to have survived that spell there was no way no way in hell that hed lived through it this couldnt be the same person could it surely it had to be someone else the ringwraith look was hardly uncommon among those who fancied themselves dark wizards of one kind or another after all it could just as easily be someone else entirely someone not at all connected to cowl or my theoretical black council on the other hand cowl had been the person whose actions had tipped me off to the possibility of the black council to begin with could he have been a part of the circle that grey cloak had mentioned after all i dropped a freaking car onto cowls head and hed hardly blinked at it if hed been that well protected could he have survived the wild energies of the disintegrating darkhallow worse what if he hadnt what if he was one of a set of people just as crazy and dangerous as he had been i started feeling even more nervous my lord grey cloak said bowing his head he left it that way there was a long moment of silence before cowl spoke then he said you have failed i have not yet succeeded grey cloak replied with polite disagreement the curtain has not fallen and the fool with you still ignorant my lord i can preserve or dispose of him as you see fit grey cloak took a deep breath and said he has gotten the wizard involved there is some sort of vendetta between them it would seem the little mist figure made a hissing sound the fool there is not enough profit in dresdens death to jeopardize the operation he did not consult me on the matter my lord grey cloak said with another bow of his head had he done so i would have dissuaded him and what followed i attempted to remove him along with the last of the culling dresden interfered yes cowl hissed this changes matters what precautions have you taken i was not followed in flesh my lord of that i am certain cowl held up a miniature hand for silence a gesture that looked somehow stiff and pained then his hood panned around the room the figures gaze met mine and hit me like a literal physical blow a swift jab in the chest he is there cowl snarled the misty figure turned to face me and lifted both hands an odd cold pressure hit me like a wave and pushed me back several feet before i could gather up my will and exert pressure in return coming to a stop several feet away from grey cloak and cowl cowls hands clenched into claws insolent child i will rip your mind asunder i snarled at him and planted my insubstantial feet bring it darth bathrobe cowl screamed at me he spoke a word that resonated in my head and thundered through the hazy confines of grey cloaks hideaway though i had braced myself to gather my will and pit it against his his next strike hammered into me like a freight train i could no more have resisted it than i could have stopped an ocean tide and i felt it throwing me back and away in that last second before i was banished i reached out with all the strength i had left focusing on grey cloak pouring everything i had into the spell to grant me a clear view of his face i got it for the barest instant the face of a man in his midthirties tall and lean and wolfish and then there was a geyser of scarlet pain as if someone had seized both halves of my skull and torn it into two pieces darkness followed chapter sixteen i woke up with someone shaking my shoulder and someone else holding the back of my head against a running band saw harry molly said she was speaking through some kind of megaphone pressed directly against the side of my head evidently while pounding my skull with the pointy end of a claw hammer hey boss can you hear me ow i said what happened ow i repeated annoyed as if it should have been explanation enough molly let out an exasperated worried sound do i need to take you to the hospital no i croaked aspirin some water and stop screaming im barely whispering she said and got up her combat boots slammed down on the floor in great godzillasized rolls of thunder as she went up the stair steps bob i said as soon as she was gone what happened im not sure bob said keeping his voice down either shes been working out or else shes started using some kind of cosmetics on her arms she still had some baby fat when she got the tattoos and thats always bound to make any kind of changes more noticeable and not her i growled images of genuine mayhem floating through my agonized brain me oh bob said something hit the model hard there was an energy surge boom the psychic backlash lit up your mental fusebox how bad hard to say how many fingers am i holding up i sighed how bad is little chicago bob oh youve got to be more specific with this stuff harry could be worse a week to fix at most i grunted everythings too loud and bright i tested my arms and legs it hurt to move them an odd and stretchy kind of pain but they moved what happened exactly you got lucky is what something you met out there threw a big blast of psychic energy at you but it had to come at you through your threshold and the model the threshold weakened it and little chicago shorted out when the blast hit or or what i asked or you wouldnt have that headache bob said then his eyelights winked out mollys boots clumped back down the stairs she set down on the table a couple of fresh candles shed brought took a deep breath closed her eyes for a moment and then very carefully used the same spell i did to light them the light speared into my brain and hurt a lot i flinched and threw my arm across my face sorry she said i wasnt thinking i couldnt even see you down here and next time just shove some pencils into my eyes i muttered a minute later sorry harry she said the aspirin i held out a hand she pressed a bottle of aspirin into it and then pressed a cold glass into my other hand i opened the aspirin with my teeth dumped several into my mouth and chugged them down with the water exhausted from this monumental effort i lay on the floor and felt somewhat sorry for myself until after several more mercilessly regular minutes the painkiller started kicking in molly i said were we supposed to have a lesson today no she said but sergeant murphy called our house looking for you she said you werent answering the phone i thought i should come over and check on you i grunted good call any trouble getting through the wards no not this time good i opened my eyes slowly until they started getting used to the glare of the candles mouse mouse probably needs you to let him out i heard a thumping sound and squinted up the stairs mouse was crouched at the top somehow managing to look concerned im fine you big pansy i said go on molly started up the staircase and then froze staring back down at little chicago i squinted at her then rose and squinted at the table there was a hole melted in the metal table not far from the spot where grey cloak had entered undertown one of the buildings was half slagged the pewter melted into a messy runnel that coursed down the hole in the table like dribbled wax there was a layer of black soot over everything within several inches of the hole in the table if the table hadnt taken the magical blow it would have been my head with the hole burned in it that had been part of the purpose in creating little chicagoas a tool and a safety measure for working that kind of magic all the same it was a sobering thing to see i swallowed cowl it had been cowl id heard the hatred and venom in his voice the familiarityand the overwhelming power of his magic had been unmistakable hed survived the darkhallow he was working with this circle who were almost certainly the black council and there was some kind of larger mischief afoot in chicago than i had suspected oh yeah this whole situation was definitely starting to make me nervous i turned back to molly and said like i said this thing is dangerous grasshopper so no playing with it until i say so got it molly swallowed got it go on take care of mouse do me a favor and call murphys cell phone ask her to come here do you need me to help you today she asked like go with you and stuff i looked at her then at the table then back at her just asking molly said defensively and hurried on up the stairs by the time id gotten a shower shaved and climbed into fresh clothes i felt almost human though i still had a whale of a headache murphy arrived shortly after what the hell happened to you she said by way of greeting took a psychic head butt from cowl i said murphy greeted mouse scratching him under the chin with both hands whats a cowl i grunted right forgot when i met cowl you were in hawaii with your boy toy murph gave me a smug smile kincaid isnt a boy toy hes a man toy definitely a man toy molly lying on the floor with her feet up on the wall while she read dropped her book onto her face she fumbled it back into her hands and then tried to appear uninterested in the conversation it would have been more convincing if she werent holding the book upside down long story short i told her cowl is a wizard human murphy asked pretty sure but ive never seen his face all i know about him is that hes stronger than me hes better than me i stood up to him in a fair fight and got lucky enough to survive it murphy frowned then howd you beat him i stopped fighting fair and bumped his elbow while he was handling supernatural high explosives boom i figured he was dead murphy sat down in one of my easy chairs frowning okay she said better give me the whole thing i rubbed at my aching head and started from where id left murphy yesterday up until the end of my confrontation with cowl i left out some of the details about elaine and everything about the circle that was information too dangerous to spread around hell i wish i didnt know about it myself skavis murphy mused aloud ive heard that somewhere before its one of the greater houses of the white court i said nodding raith skavis and malvora are the big three right murphy said psychic vampires raith feed on lust malvora on fear how about these skavis pain i said or despair depending on how you translate some of the texts the council has on them and suicide murphy said is the ultimate expression of despair with a mind like that i said you could be a detective we were quiet for a minute before murphy said let me see if ive got this right this skavis is in town according to your ex the private investigator anna ash hired hes killed women in four other cities and hes doing it again herefour so far and annas meant to be number five yeah i said meanwhile this grey cloak who works for cowl is in town doing more or less the same thing but you dont think hes here to help the skavis whoever he is but you do think hes working against the killer along with this passenger whoever he is you think those two left the clues you found on the bodies to pull you into an investigation and take out the skavis even better i said i think i know who passenger was who murphy asked beckitt i said it makes sense hes got his wife on the inside as an information source hes gone up against me before and walked away and i cost him years of his life and a lucrative share of a criminal empire hes got plenty of reasons not to like me thats who grey cloak the malvora was talking to whoa grey cloak the malvora howd you get that because i said he talked about sharing some tastes with the skavis when it came to letting the prey anticipate what was coming before the kill the malvora do it so that their prey will feel more fear the skavis do it so that theyll be more tired be more ready to give in to despair murphy nodded lips pursed and the white court loves manipulating everything indirectly using others to do their dirty work for them like using me to wipe out his skavis competition i said which makes sense because malvora and skavis are rivals right i said and im fairly confident in my guess just like im fairly confident that beckitt must be our passenger thats a sound theory dresden murphy said thank you i know but beckitt died almost seven years ago he was killed in prison i figure beckitt must have made a deal with the malvora and i blinked he what died murphy said there was a riot three prisoners were killed several injured he was one of them as near as anyone can tell he was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time a prisoner was wrestling for a guards gun it discharged and killed beckitt instantly um i said frowning i hate it when the real world ignores a perfectly logical rational assumption he faked it she shook her head i looked into it and i talked to the guard there was an autopsy an identification of the body from his family a funeral the whole nine yards hes dead harry well dammit i said and rubbed at my headache he made sense thats life murphy said so this hideyhole you found long gone by now i said might be worth going anyway if you take krypto here with you she leaned down and planted a kiss on top of mouses head my dog gets more play than me sheesh maybe grey cloak the theoretical malvora left a good scent behind worth a shot i guess i said but im pretty sure hes going to be thorough enough to remove that too who goes around removing their scent from places murphy asked vampires they can track that way just like mouse oh right murphy sighed another burned building not i began not his fault molly said not your fault murphy said i know but its going to look awfully odd my car gets firebombed a building less than a block away gets firebombed a few hours later i grunted same device what do you think same device murphy nodded im sure it will be its going to take them time to figure it out though were you seen me and about a million other people i said thats something at least but a lot of people are going to be asking questions before long the sooner we get this thing put to bed the better i grimaced i shouldnt have gone for the subtle maneuver last night i should have smashed him to paste right there i dont have any way to find him now and hes aware that were looking yeah but grey cloak isnt our first problem murphy said hes a sideshow the skavis is the real killer right yeah i said quietly right and weve got no clue who or where he is murphy frowned but hes a vampire right i mean you can tell if someones a vampire cant you it isnt so simple with the white court i said they hide themselves a lot better than any other breed i had no idea what thomas was when i met him and you remember talking to darby crane yeah did you get vampire off him mostly i got player murphy said but you knew he was really madrigal raith i guessed i corrected her probably because i unconsciously recognized the family resemblance to lord raith thats why i stopped you from touching him there was no magical tipoff about it i frowned hell i wouldnt be shocked if they had some kind of ability to cloud their preys judgment when inari raith tried to feed on me even though i was in their freaking house even though i knew she was a baby succubus and in my room it never really occurred to me that she might be dangerous to me until it was too late just like that never occurred to me about crane murphy said so the skavis he could be anyone im pretty sure hes not me i said im almost as sure hes not you are you sure youre a professional investigator i sometimes wonder what about thomas murphy asked hes more of a hired thug than a shamus murphy glared it drew a little bit of a smile from me but it faded quickly in the light of reality i left messages nothing yet thats not what i meant either murphy said quietly could he still be involved could he have been the passenger he wasnt again she held up a hand harry is it possible look we know the killer is a skavis we know what grey cloak thinks murphy corrected roe but youre forgetting something what that at least one of those women was killed in the throes of supernatural passion not amidst fear not amidst despair i scowled at her is it physically possible harry possible thats all im asking i suppose i said quietly but thomas isnt grey cloaks partner what if i couldnt finish the sentence what if your passenger has him murphy asked what if the endeavor hes talking about is pressing thomas for some kind of information i grimaced thomas should have been in touch by now weve got a little time grey cloak thought it would be another day or so before the skavis moved again right yeah so far you think hes been smart about most things maybe hes smart about that too we can hope i said what did you find about jessica blanche still working on it ive got feelers out but ill need to follow up with some legwork i blew out a breath and i need to get in touch with elaine and the ordo maybe i can get helen beckitt to talk and i can make some calls to other wardens maybe someones heard something about recent white court activities murphy rose sounds like we have a plan if we repeat it often enough maybe well even believe it i said lets go chapter seventeen ramirezs contact number went to a restaurant his family ran in eastern los angeles i left a message with someone whose english sounded like a second or third language it took ramirez only about ten minutes to call me back white court my fellow warden said cant think as ive heard anything about them lately harry how about a professional wizard investigator i asked him works out of los angeles elaine mallory he asked tall pretty smart and nearly as charming as myself thats the one i said what do you know about her far as i know shes straight he said moved to town five or six years ago college in san diego and working for an investigative agency out here shes got a decent grounding in thaumaturgy from somewhere but when i ran her through the standard tests she didnt score quite high enough to be considered for council membership he was quiet for a second before saying in a tone of forced cheer unless we keep on losing people to the vamps in which case i guess we might lower our standards uhhuh i said but you think she knows what shes doing well ramirez drawled i hinted that she might want to advertise as something other than a wizard eventually if we get the time to look away from the war some hidebound dinosaur might take exception to someone claiming the title i snorted dont call me a dinosaur it isnt fair to the dinosaurs what did a dinosaur ever do to you other than give me a ride right next to this big skinny lunatic mallorys not stupid and shes done people some good out here ramirez said lost kids especially couple of exorcisms i wouldnt have had time to handle maybe she can be of some help to you though ive got one reservation about her whats that i asked her taste in men i keep asking her out and shes turned me down about a dozen times now shocking i said i know ramirez replied makes me wonder how smart she could really be why i gave him the brief on what i knew about the murders and on what elaine had told me about the other cities someones framing the wardens he said looks that way sow seeds of distrust and all that five cities bastards he paused to say something off the phone and then told me hang on im pulling the file on recent white court reports i waited a few more minutes then he came back and said according to what weve heard out on this end the white king has met with emissaries from the council under a flag of truce and declared a temporary ceasefire hes agreed to approach the reds about sitting down to negotiate an end to the war ive met him i said kissinger he aint gandhi neither yeah sorta makes you wonder what hes getting out of the war ending dont it i grunted theres not a lot of love lost between the reds and the whites a ceasefire wont cost him anything his people dont get involved in the messy stuff anyway ramirez let out a thoughtful hum the way you tell it looks like maybe not everybody in the white court agrees with his take on the war theyre pretty factional triumvirate of major houses raith happens to be on top right now if raith is pushing for peace it would be consistent for the other major houses to oppose it gotta love those vampires so arbitrarily contrary say that five times fast i said he did flawlessly rolling the rs as he went see there he said thats why the ladies love me its not love carlos its pity as long as the pants come off he said cheerfully then his voice turned more sober dresden ive been meaning to call you just wanted to see how you were doing you know since new mexico im good i told him im fine uhhuh ramirez said he sounded skeptical listen i said forget new mexico ive forgotten it we need to move on focus on whats in front of us right now sure he said without conviction you want to fill in the captain or should i go ahead will do he said you need any backup out there why i asked you got nothing to pay attention to where you are he sighed yeah well all the same if the whites are trying to shut down the peace talks i could pry a few of the boys loose to come help you boot some head except i dont yet know whose head it is or how to boot it i said i know but if you need help its here thanks watch your ass dresden he said id tell you to do the same but you probably gaze at your own ass in admiration all the time anyway with an ass like mine who wouldnt ramirez said vaya con dios happy trails i hung up the phone and leaned back in the chair rubbing at my stillaching head i closed my eyes and tried to think for a minute i thought about how much my head hurt which was nonproductive harry molly asked me hmmm can i ask you something sure um she was quiet for a moment as though thinking about her words before she spoke that got my attention im just wondering why you were asking warden rodriguez about elaine mallory i closed my eyes and tried thinking again i mean sergeant murphy said she was your ex but you asked about her as if you didnt know her i mumbled something so i figure that means that you do know her and you wanted to know what warden rodriguez knew about her without him knowing that you already knew her she took a deep breath and said youre keeping secrets from the wardens i sighed for years kid years and years but im under the doom of damocles and that means you are too this is the kind of thing that could make them decide to invoke it so um why are you doing it does it matter i asked well she said her tone cautiously diffident since i could get beheaded over this just as much as you can it matters to me and i think that maybe i deserve to know i started to growl at her that she didnt i stopped myself because she had a point dammit regardless of how inconvenient i thought it she did have an undeniable right to ask me about it i was an orphan i told her a little while after my magic came to me i got adopted by a man named dumorne hes the one who gave me most of my training he adopted elaine too we grew up together each others first love molly set her book aside and sat up listening to me dumorne was a warlock himself black wizard as bad as they come he planned on training us up to be his personal enforcers trained strong wizards under mental compulsion to be loyal to him he nailed elaine with it i got suspicious and fought him i killed him molly blinked but the first law exactly i said thats how i wound up living under the doom of damocles myself ebenezar mccoy mentored me saved my life the way you did for me she said quietly yeah i squinted at the empty fireplace justin burned and i thought elaine did too turned out years later that she had survived and was in hiding and she never told you molly demanded what a bitch i gave the apprentice a lopsided smile the last time shed seen me i had been busy murdering the only thing like a real parent shed ever had and had apparently tried to kill her too it isnt a simple situation molly but i still dont get why you lied about her because i had a bad time of it coming out from under dumornes corpse the way i did if the wardens knew that shed been there too and fled the council rather than coming out to them i shrugged looks like shes managed to convince ramirez that she doesnt have enough power to be considered for the council but she does molly asked shes nearly as strong as i am i said quietly makes up for it in grace im not sure what would happen if the wardens learned dumorne had a second apprentice but there would be trouble im not going to make that choice for her in case i havent told you this before molly said the wardens are a fine bunch of assholes present company excluded there isnt any easy way to do their job i said before amending our job like i said kid nothings simple i pushed myself slowly to my feet and found my keys and mouses lead come on i told her ill drop you off at your place where are you going to talk to the ordo i said annas got them all holed up with elaine why dont you just call them this is a sneak attack i said i dont want to warn helen beckitt that im on the way shes got an angle in this im sure of it its easier to get people to talk if you get them off balance molly frowned at me you sure you dont need my help i paused to glance at her then at the bead bracelet on her wrist she clenched her jaw took off the bracelet and held it up with defiant determination staring at the beads three minutes and two beads later she gave it up gasping and sweating at the effort she looked bitterly frustrated and disappointed nothings simple i told her quietly and put the bracelet back on her wrist for her and nothing much is easy either be patient give it time easy for you to say she said and stomped out to the car leading mouse she was wrong of course it wasnt easy what i really wanted to do was get down a little food and go to bed until my head felt better that wasnt an option for me whoever the skavis was and whatever he was up to there wasnt a lot of time to figure it out and stop him before he added another victim to his tally chapter eighteen the amber inn is a rarity in downtown chicago a reasonably priced hotel it isnt large or particularly fancy and it wasnt designed by an architect with three names no one infamous has owned it lived in it or been machinegunned to death there thus stripped of anything like a good excuse to stick it to the customer one neednt schedule a visit to a loan officer in tandem with making a reservation even though the amber inn is fairly central to chicago it was the kind of place i always tried to pick on the occasions my work had taken me to another town for a clients business my job in cases like that is investigating not checking out fourstar hotels the most important thing was to be close to where i would be working and that i not run up an unmanageable bill ive heard that some private investigators make it a point to stay somewhere nice at the clients expense but it always seemed unprofessional to me and a bad way to conduct business in the long term it stood to reason that elaine would have chosen it for similar reasons i didnt ask after her at the desk i didnt need to i just told mouse find em mouse sniffed the air and we started walking down halls like we owned the place thats always important the confidence it keeps people from getting suspicious about why youre stalking around the building and even when it doesnt deter them it makes them respond more cautiously mouse finally stopped at a door and i extended my hand half closing my eyes feeling for magic there was a ward over the door it wasnt terribly fancy or solidit couldnt be without a threshold to use as a foundationbut it was exceedingly well crafted and i was sure it was elaines work the spell looked like it would release only a tiny bit of energy probably a pulse of light or some kind of audible sound that would alert her to company i debated for a moment making a big bad wolf entrance and decided against it it wouldnt be terribly polite to elaine and the only person i wanted to scare was helen beckitt assuming she was there besides which tipped off by her alarm and wary about a murderer elaine might well send a lightning bolt through the doorway before she had a chance to see who was there i knocked nothing changed but my instincts warned me that someone was on the other side of the doornot magic just the sudden absence of the simple solitary feel one gets when standing alone in an empty house i sensed a little stirring of the magic in the ward then the door rattled and swung open revealing elaine standing on the other side one corner of her mouth tilted up in amusement oh i get it i said not a ward a peephole sometimes a girls got to improvise she said you look awful long night it must have been i thought you were going to call i was in the neighborhood she pursed her lips in speculation were you i saw the wheels turning in her head for a moment and then she nodded once and lowered her voice which one beckitt i murmured back shes here i nodded and she opened the door the rest of the way at the same time i stepped through it she slipped to one side as i walked briskly into the room it was clean plain a kind of minisuite with a queen bed a couch and a coffee table priscilla sat on the couch in a pea green turtleneck and a scratchylooking wool skirt and scowled at me in disapproval of dickensian proportion abby and toto occupied the floor where toto was engaged in mortal combat with a white athletic sock he had pulled partway from the foot of his plump little owner who sat looking distracted and distant anna sat on the edge of the bed dark eyes tired bloodshot and serious while helen stood by the window again holding the curtain aside just enough to gaze out toto promptly abandoned the field of battle upon spying mouse and walked in a little nervous circle within a couple of inches of abbys lap mouse went over to trade sniffs with the little dog and promptly settled down to begin grooming toto with long licks ladies i said then after a brief pause added mrs beckitt she didnt look at me she just smiled and stared out the window yes mister dresden what do you know i asked her i beg your pardon she said you know something about this and you arent talking spill i cant imagine what you mean she said anna ash rose and frowned mister dresden surely you arent accusing helen of being involved in this business im pretty sure i am i said do they know about the first time we met helen have you told them that drew looks from everyone in the room helen abby said after a moment what is he talking about go ahead mister dresden helen said very faint very dry amusement giving her monotone a little life i wouldnt dream of cheating you of the satisfaction of looking down at one less righteous than yourself what is she talking about priscilla demanded she glared at me probably with her mind already made up as to what she was going to think of me regardless of what i said its nice to know that some things in life are consistent because beckitt was disappointing me here her associates didnt know about her past by revealing it i was probably about to destroy whatever life shed built for herself since she regained her freedomsomething that would be a terrible injury to most people in her circumstances shed lost her daughter years ago lost her husband shortly after had been sent to prison and permanently stained with the guilt of her crimes i had expected her to attempt to evade me to protest her innocence or accuse me of lying failing that i thought the next most likely reaction would be for her to panic and flee or else panic and shut her mouth entirely depending on how badly she thought i was about to screw up her life it was even possible that she might produce a weapon and attempt to murder me instead she just stood there apparently unafraid a quiet little smile hovering on her lips unruffled like some nascent saint before the man who was about to martyr her none of which added up i hate it when things dont add up but now that id forced the confrontation here in front of the rest of the ordo id destroy any credibility i had if i backed out which is what the whole mess was about someone attempting to destroy the councils credibility i backed off on the aggression and tried to make myself sound polite and compassionate yet serious did any of you know that ms beckitt is a felon priscillas eyes grew wide behind her glasses she looked from me to helen to anna helen continued watching out the window that same little smile in place anna was the first to speak no she said frowning she hasnt told us that beckitt might as well have been deaf for all the reaction she showed she was a part of a cult headed up by a sorcerer i had to take down several years ago i said i delivered it flat without emphasis she participated in ritual magic that created a drug that hurt a lot of people and helped out with other rites that murdered the sorcerers criminal rivals there was a shocked silence bbbut abby stammered but thats the first law the first law helen is that true not quite helen said he didnt mention that the specific rituals used were sexual in nature she touched her tongue to her upper lip strike that depraved and indiscriminately sexual in nature priscilla stared at helen for gods sake helen why beckitt looked away from the window for the first time since id arrived and the emptiness in her eyes was replaced with an impossibly remote cold fury her voice lowered to a murmur as hard as a sheet of glacial ice i had reason to do so i didnt meet that frozen gaze i didnt want to see what was behind it youve got a record mrs beckitt youve helped in supernatural murders before maybe youre doing it again she shrugged her expression becoming lifeless again and maybe im not are you i said she went back to staring out the window whats the point in answering warden its obvious that youve already tried and convicted me if i tell you i am involved you will believe me guilty if i tell you i am not involved you will believe me guilty the only thing i can do is deny you your precious moral justification she lifted a hand to her lips and pantomimed turning a key and throwing it away silence fell anna got up and walked to beckitt anna put a hand on her shoulder and tugged gently until the other woman turned around dont answer anna said quietly theres no need for it as far as im concerned and i priscilla said of course you arent involved abby said beckitt looked around the room at each of them in turn her mouth quivered for an instant and her eyes glistened she blinked them several times but a single tear escaped and coursed over her cheekbone she nodded to the ordo once and turned back to the window instinct told me that this was not the reaction of a guilty womanand no one could put on an act that good beckitt wasnt involved i was sure of itnow dammit detectives are supposed to learn things all id done so far was to unlearn them and the clock kept right on ticking priscilla turned to me her eyes narrowed is there anything else of which youd like to accuse us any other presumptuous bigotry youd care to share she built her glare back up into the terawatt range just for me it made me feel special look i said im trying to help you oh priscilla said scorn in her voice is that why all those people have been disappearing in the company of a man fitting your description i started to answer but she cut me off not that i expect you to tell us the truth unless it serves whatever purpose you truly have in mind i carefully did not lose my temper and barbecue her stupid face right then and there angels weep when someone so perceptive warmhearted and loving turns cynical priscilla harry elaine sighed beside me i glanced at her she met my eyes for a moment and though her lips didnt move i heard her voice quite distinctly god knows she makes a fine target of herself but shooting off your mouth isnt helping i blinked at her a couple of times and then smiled a little the communion spell between us was an old one but once upon a time wed used it every day school had been boring as hell and it beat passing notes it had also been handy when wed been staying up past curfew and didnt want dumorne to know we were awake i put a gentle effort of will behind words and sent them to elaine god id forgotten all about this i havent done it since i was sixteen elaine showed me her smilethe swift rare one the one where her mouth widened and white teeth gleamed and her eyes took on golden highlights neither have i her expression sobered as she glanced at priscilla then back to me be gentle harry theyre hurting i frowned at her what she shook her head look around you i did going more slowly this time my focus on confronting beckitt had prevented me from noticing what else was going on the room was thick with tension and something heavy and bitter grief then i saw what wasnt there wheres the little brunette her name priscilla almost snarled was olivia i arched a brow and glanced at elaine was when we called her last night she was all right she told me when we arrived to pick her up there was no answer at her door and no one in her apartment then how do you know elaine folded her arms her expression neutral there are several security cameras around the building and outside one of them showed her leaving with a very pale darkhaired man i grunted howd you get to the security footage elaine gave me a smile that bared a gratuitous number of teeth i said pretty please i nodded getting it you can get more with a kind word and wellapplied kinetomancy than with just a kind word the security guard was a smug little twit she said bruises fade she produced a couple of sheets of printer paper bearing grainy blackandwhite images indeed i recognized olivia and her dancers leotard even from behind which was a good angle for her there was a man walking next to her he looked to be maybe a tiny bit shy of six feet had dark glossy shoulderlength black hair and was dressed in jeans and a black tee i could see his profile in one of the pictures his head turned toward olivia it was my brother it was thomas chapter nineteen are you sure anna ash asked elaine wouldnt we be better off at one of our apartments theyre all warded elaine shook her head firmly the killer knows where you each live he doesnt know about this place stay here stay quiet stay together our killer hasnt attacked anyone who wasnt alone and my dog will let you know if theres anything you need to worry about i added hell probably sit on anyone who tries to mess with you but if he does a lassie act at you and wants you to leave go with himeveryone stay together and get somewhere public mouse nudged his head under annas hand and wagged his tail toto dutifully followed mouse walking around annas ankles looking up at her until she petted him too that got a smile out of her at least if we leave how will we get in touch with you ill find you just like you found the killer priscilla spat i ignored her with lofty dignity elaine didnt she stepped up to priscilla and loomed over her you ungrateful insufferable venomous little twit shut your mouth this man is trying to protect you just like i am i will thank you to keep a civil tongue in your head while we do our job priscillas face flushed we arent paying you to insult or demean us you arent paying me enough to get me to tolerate your rudeness either elaine said keep it up and you wont have to worry about my bill in fact i suspect that in short order youll stop worrying about absolutely everything is that a threat priscilla snapped elaine put a fist on her hip its a fact bitch anna stepped in priscilla please you arent the one paying her i am we need her shes the professional if she thinks its smart to cooperate with mister dresden thats what were going to do and were going to treat them with professional respect if you cant manage courtesy try silence priscilla narrowed her eyes at anna then folded her arms and looked away in capitulation elaine nodded at anna and said im not sure how long well be gone ill get word to you as soon as i have a better idea thank you miss mallory after a beat she hurried to add and thank you mister dresden stay together i said and elaine and i left we walked together to the parking lot and on the way elaine said tell me youve gotten a new car we rounded a corner and there was the beetle in all its battlescarred glory i like this one i told her and opened the door for her you redid the interior she said as i got in and started the car demons ate the old one elaine began to laugh but then blinked at me youre being literal uhhuh fungus demons right down to the metal good god you live a glamorous life she said elaine i said i thought you told me you were going to lie low until you were ready to come out to the council the friendly teasing expression on her face faded into neutrality is this relevant right now yeah i said if were going after him together yes it is i need to know she frowned at me and then shrugged i had to do something there were people all around me getting hurt being used living scared so i borrowed a page from your book and you lied to the warden who came to check up on you you say that like youve always told the wardens everything elaine i began she shook her head harry i know you i trust you but i dont trust the council and i doubt i ever will i certainly did not care to be impressed into service as a brandnew foot soldier to fight their war with the vampireswhich i would have been if i had put my full effort into ramirezs tests we looked at each other for a moment and i said please ill go with you ill support you before the council she put one of her warm soft hands over mine and spoke in a quiet firm voice no harry i wont allow those men to direct the course of my life i wont allow them to choose if i will or will not liveor choose how i sighed you could do so much good i thought thats what i was doing here she pointed out helping people doing good she had a point the wardens would freak out if you went to them now anyway i said and revealed that youd been hiding your talents from them yes she said they would dammit i said we could use your help i dont doubt it she said her eyes hardened and her voice went suddenly cold but i will not be used not by anyone never again i blinked and turned to her she lifted her chin slightly green eyes bright with unfallen tears no harry i turned my hand under hers and we intertwined our fingers with the careless ease of an old habit elaine im sorry i didnt mean to push i hadnt realized she blinked several times and looked away from me no im the one who should be sorry im going all neurotic on you here i dont mean to be she stared out the window at the city after you killed dumorne i spent a year having a nightmare the same one every single night i was sure that it was true that he was still alive that he was coming for me he wasnt i told her i know she said i saw him die just as you did but i was so afraid she shook her head i ran to the summer court because of it i ran harry i couldnt face it is that what youre doing going public i asked facing your past i have to she said her voice growing firmer it scares the crap out of me all the time and over the years ive had problems with crowds with enclosed spaces with heights with wideopen spaces night terrors panic attacks paranoia god sometimes it seems like theres nothing i havent had a phobia about what elaine had described was about what i would have expected from someone whose mind had been invaded by an outside will magic can get you into someones head but if you decide to start redecorating to your tastes there is no way to avoid inflicting damage to their psyche depending upon several factors someone who has been put under that kind of control can be left twitchy and erratic at bestand at worst totally catatonic or completely dysfunctional and there was the utterly normal element of emotional pain to consider too elaine had in the course of a single evening lost absolutely everything she loved her boyfriend her adopted father her home losing a home means a lot more to an orphan than it does to most other people im in a position to know like me elaine had spent most of her childhood bouncing around from one foster home to another one staterun orphanage to another like me being given a real home a real house a real father figure had been a desperate dream come true it had been a terrible loss to me and justin hadnt gotten any hooks into my head for elaine that series of events had been infinitely more painful infinitely more frightening i let fear control one part of my life elaine said and it took root and started growing i had to get involved harry i have to use what i know to change things if i dont then all ill ever be is dumornes tool his terrified little weapon i will not allow anyone to take control of my life away from me i cant she shrugged and i cant stand by and do nothing either i threw the tests i dont regret it i sure as hell am not going to apologize for itnot to you or to anyone i grunted well she asked i think i get it i said are you willing to work with me then i squeezed her hand a little of course the tension in her shoulders eased and she squeezed my hand back my turn she said your turn she nodded you recognized the killer when you looked at the photo what i said no i didnt she rolled her eyes come on harry its me i sighed yeah well who is he she asked thomas raith i said white court how do you know him hes not many people knew that thomas was my brother it was safer for both of us to keep that information limited hes a friend someone i trust trust elaine said quietly i notice you use the present tense thomas isnt hurting anyone i said hes a vampire harry he hurts someone every time he feeds hed been doing quite a bit of that lately i know thomas i maintained he isnt the killer elaine frowned treachery hurts harry believe me i know nothing has proved thomas is behind these killings i said it could be someone else or something else masquerading as him it isnt as if there arent plenty of shapeshifting things around that could do it little bit of a reach though elaine said she nodded at the photos where id set them on the dashboard the simplest explanation is usually the correct one sooner or later i said ill have a case where everything is simple but i dont think this one is it elaine exhaled slowly studying my face you care about him no point in denying that yeah he trusts you in return yeah then why hasnt he explained himself to you she asked why hasnt he gotten in touch with you i dont know but i know hes not a killer she nodded slowly but there he is with olivia yeah then i think you should agree with me that we need to find him yeah can you yep all right then she said and put on her seat belt well find him well talk to him ill try to keep an open mind she looked at me but if it turns out to be him harry hes got to be stoppedand i expect you to help me if it turns out to be him i said hed want me to chapter twenty ive been working as a detective in chicago for a while now and theres one thing you do a lot more than almost anything else you find things that get lost id first designed my tracking spell to catch up to the house keys i kept losing when i was about fourteen id used it a few thousand times now sometimes it had helped me find things i really didnt want mostly it helped me get into trouble this time i was fairly sure it would do both i could have used my blood to trace thomass probably but i could use my silver pentacle amulet too my mother had given me the one i habitually wore and shed given one to thomas too i knew that he wore it just as habitually as i wore mine and unless someone had taken it away from him hed be wearing it now so i revved up the spell hung the amulet from the rearview mirror of the blue beetle and headed out onto the chicago streets i kept an eye on my amulet which leaned slightly drawn as if by a light magnetic field toward thomass amulet that wasnt a perfect way to track something downthe spell had no concern for streets and traffic flow for examplebut id been finding things like this for a good while and i piloted the beetle through the maze of buildings and oneway streets that make up the fair city elaine watched me in silence the whole while i knew that she was wondering what i had used to lock on to our apparent abductormurderer she didnt push though she just settled down and trusted me when i finally parked the car and got out i brought my amulet with me and stared grimly at the necklace which continued to lean steadily to the east toward the burnham harbor piers that stretched out over lake michigan an entire cove had been built into the lakeshore and decked out with an array of docks for dozens and dozens of small commercial boats pleasure craft and yachts boats i muttered why did it have to be boats whats wrong with boats elaine asked i havent had a good time on boats i said in fact i havent had a good time this close to the lake in general it smells like dead fish and motor oil elaine noted you never did like my cologne i got my staff out of the car you need a big stick elaine smiled sweetly at me and drew out a heavy chain from her purse she held both ends in one fist leaving a doubled length of heavy metal links about two feet long each of the links glittered with veins of what might have been copper forming sinuous text youre a prisoner to tradition big guy you should learn to be a little more flexible careful if you tell me youve got bracelets and a magic lariat in there i may lose control of my sexual impulses elaine snorted you cant lose what youve never had she glanced up at me like the new shield by the way yeah sexy huh complex she replied balanced strong sophisticated im not sure i could have made a focus for something like that it took real skill harry i felt myself actually blush absurdly pleased by the compliment well it isnt perfect it takes a lot more juice than the old shield did but i figured getting tired faster is far preferable to getting dead fester seems reasonable she said and squinted at the docks can you tell which boat it is not yet but once you get two or three hundred yards over the water that spell would have grounded out so we know its one of these at the docks elaine nodded you want to lead yeah we should be able to run it down fairly fast stay about ten or fifteen feet back from me elaine frowned why any closer than that and wed be a dandy target someone could take us both out with one burst from a machine gun her face got a little pale i thought you trusted him i do i said but i dont know who might be there with him and youve learned this kind of thing on the job machine guns i felt my left hand twitch actually i learned it with flamethrowers but it applies to machine guns too she took a deep breath green eyes flickering over the docks and ships i see after you then i readied my shield bracelet got a good grip on my staff and wrapped my amulets chain around the first two fingers of my right hand holding it up and out a little so that the amulet could dangle and indicate direction i stepped out onto the docks and followed the spell toward the outermost row of moored boats i was acutely conscious of elaines light steady footsteps behind me and the little slapping sighs of water hitting hulls the summer sky was overcast with lead and occasional thunder rumbled through the air the docks werent nearly as crowded as they could be but there were a couple of dozen people around walking to and from boats working on decks getting ready to cast off or else just now securing their lines i was the only one wearing a big leather coat and got a few odd looks the amulet led me to the last slip of the dock farthest from shore the boat moored there was a big one at least for those docks and looked like it might have been a stunt double for the boat in jaws it was old battered its white paint smudged to a faded peeling grey the planks of its hull often patched the windows on the wheelhouse were obscured with dust and greasy smudges it needed to be sandblasted and repaintedexcept for the lettering on its stern which had apparently been added only recently in heavy black paint water beetle i walked ten feet away and rechecked the amulets indication triangulating the water beetle was the right boat hey i called out er uh ahoy thomas silence met my hail i checked over my shoulder elaine had moved away to where she could see the little ships entire deck while still standing a good twenty feet down the dock from me what was the military term for that establishing a cross fire maybe it was creating a defilade the point being though that if anything came gibbering up out of the boats hold wed tear it up between us before you could say boogityboo of course if anyone on the boat had hostile intent and an ounce of brains theyd probably realize that too thomas i shouted again its harry dresden if someone on that boat meant me harm the smart thing to do would be to stay quiet and tempt me out onto the boat itself that would minimize my chances of avoiding an attack and give them their best shot at taking me out in a hurrywhich is just about the only reliable way to do it when youre dealing with wizards give one of us time to catch our breath and we can be a real handful okay i said to elaine not taking my eyes off the boat im going aboard is that smart no i glanced at her for a second you got a better idea no she admitted cover me cover you elaine shook her head but she let one end of the chain slip loose from her hand and caught it in the other she took a grip on it leaving a couple of feet hanging from her left hand little flickers of light played along itsubtle enough that i doubted anyone would notice if they werent looking for it i thought i was here on a job now it turns out im half of a buddycop movie uhhuh i said im the zany yet lovable one youre the brainy conservative what if i want to be the zany one then you can hop out there on the boat stop throwing the regulations out the window she said as if reciting a hastily memorized grocery list were supposed to catch the maniacs not become them dont do anything crazy because ive only got two and a half seconds to go until i retire thats the spirit i said and hopped from the dock to the deck of the water beetle i crouched ready for trouble but nothing came hurtling at me one of the boats down the dock started up an engine that could not possibly have passed any kind of emissions test including one for noise even so though i heard a thumping sound come from below the deck i froze but there was no further sound beyond the nearby rumbling engine which from the smell of it was burning a lot of oil i tried to move silently pacing around the wheelhouse it was a tight squeeze between the deckhouse and the rail as i sidled by to peer around the corner and down a short flight of stairs that led into the ships cabin hold i was aware of a presence nothing specific really beyond a sudden intuitive certainty that someone was down there and aware of me in return i could probably dance around listening and lurking in hopes of finding some other indication of who was belowbut not for long people would notice me crouching and taking cover on the ships deck for no apparent reason some of them would ignore it hell most of them would ignore it but inevitably one of them would think it odd enough to give the cops a ring screw it i said i made sure my duster was covering my back brought my shield up before me and stepped quickly down the stairs and into the hold i had maybe half a second of warning when someone came swinging down the stairs behind mehe must have been lying flat and out of sight atop the wheelhouse i started to turn but two heels hit my right shoulder blade in a doublelegged kick and propelled me forcefully down into the hold the duster was hell on wheels for stopping claws and bullets but it did me less good against the blunt impact of the kick it hurt i threw up the shield in front of me as i fell and cut it again in an instant since impacting a rigid plane of force would be much like slamming myself into a brick wall the fluttering energy of the shield slowed me enough to control my fall and turn it into a roll i came to my knees facing the stairway as thomas came hurtling down it with mayhem evidently in mind he crouched on the stairs with one of those crooked knives the gurkhas use clutched in one fist and a doublebarreled shotgun with maybe six inches of barrel left to it in the other and pointed directly at my head my brother was a little bit shy of six feet tall slim and made out of whipcord and steel cable his eyes were alight with fury in his pale face faded from their usual thundercloud grey to an angry metallic silver that meant that he was drawing upon his power as a vampire his shoulderlength dark hair was bound back under a red bandanna and his do still looked more stylish than mine thomas i snarled ow what is wrong with you you get one chance to surrender asshole drop the spells and face the wall thomas stop being a dick i dont need this right now thomas sneered give it up its a good act but i know you arent harry dresden theres no way the real dresden would have come here with a woman like that instead of his dog i blinked at him and dropped my shield now what the hell is that supposed to mean i glared at him and added in a lower tone hells bells if you werent my brother id paste you thomas lowered the shotgun his expression startled harry a shadow moved behind thomas wait i screamed a length of heavy chain whipped around his throat there was a flash of greenish light and a crackling explosion almost as loud as a gunshot thomas jerked into an agonized arch and was flung free of the chain to come hurtling into me for the second time in sixty seconds i got hit with my brothers full weight and slammed to the floor my nose filled with the sharp scent of ozone and burned hair harry called elaines voice high and loud harry i said to wait i wheezed she came hustling down the stairs and over to me did he hurt you not until you threw him on me i snapped which wasnt true but being repeatedly bashed about makes me grumpy i touched a finger to my throbbing lip and it came away wet with blood ow elaine said sorry i thought you were in trouble i shook my head to clear it and glanced at thomas his eyes were open and he looked startled he was breathing but his arms and legs lay limp his lips moved a little i leaned over and asked him what ow he whispered i sat up a little relieved if he was able to complain he couldnt have been too bad off what was that i asked elaine taser stored electricity yes how do you refill it thunderstorm or i just plug it into any wall socket cool i said maybe i should get one of those thomass head moved and one of his legs twitched and began to stir elaine whirled on him at once her chain held taut between her hands and little flashes of light began flickering through the decorative metal embedded into the links easy there i said firmly back off we came here to talk remember harry we should at least restrain him he isnt going to hurt us i said would you listen to yourself for a second she said her voice sharpening harry despite heavy evidence to the contrary youre telling me that you like and trust a creature whose specialty lies in subverting the minds of his victims thats the way they all talk about a white court vampire and you know it that isnt whats happened here i said they say that too elaine insisted im not saying any of this is your fault harry but if this thing has gotten to you somehow this is exactly how youd be responding to it hes not a thing i snarled his name is thomas thomas took in a deep breath and then managed to say in a very feeble voice its all right you can come out now the forward wall of the cabin creaked and suddenly shifted swinging out on a concealed hinge to reveal a small area behind it not quite as large as a typical walkin closet there were several women and two or three very small children huddled in that cramped space and they emerged into the cabin warily one of them was olivia the dancer there thomas said quietly he turned his head to elaine there they are and theyre fine check them out for yourself i stood up my joints creaking and studied the women olivia i said warden she said quietly are you all right she smiled except for a muscle cramp i got in there its a little crowded elaine looked from the women to thomas and back did he hurt you olivia blinked no she said no of course not he was taking us to shelter shelter i asked harry elaine said these are some of the women who have gone missing i digested that for a second and then turned to thomas what the hell is wrong with you why didnt you tell me what was going on he shook his head his expression still a little bleary reasons didnt want you involved in this well im involved now i said so how about you tell me whats going on you were at my apartment thomas said you saw my guest room wall yeah they were being hunted i had to figure out who was after them why i got it at least well enough to be able to figure out who they were planning to kill it became a race between us he glanced at the women and children i got everyone i could out of harms way and brought them here he tried to move his head and winced nnngh there are another dozen at a cabin on an island about twenty miles north of here a safe house i mused you were taking them to a safe house yeah elaine just stared at the women for a long moment then at thomas olivia she asked is he telling the truth aas far as i know the girl answered hes been a perfect gentleman im pretty sure nobody but me caught it but at her words thomass eyes flashed with a cold and furious hunger he may have treated the women gently and politely but i knew that there was a part of him that hadnt wanted to he closed his eyes tightly and started taking deep breaths i recognized the ritual he used to control his darker nature and said nothing of it elaine talked quietly with olivia who began making introductions i leaned against a wallunless maybe since we were on a ship it was a bulkheadand rubbed my finger at a spot between my eyebrows where a headache was coming on the damned oily smoke smell from the nearby ships sputtering engine wasnt helping matters any either and my head snapped up and i flung myself up the stairs and onto the deck that big ugly boat had been moved from its mooringsand now floated directly beside the water beetle blocking it from the open waters of the lake its engine was pouring out so much blueblack oil smoke that it could not have been anything but deliberate a choking haze had already enveloped the water beetle and i couldnt see beyond the next row of docks a figure hurtled from the deck of the boat to land in a tigerish crouch on the little area of open deck at the rear of the water beetle even as i watched its features those of an unremarkable man in his midthirties began to change his jaws elongated face extending into something of a muzzle and his forearms lengthened the nails extending into dirtylooking talons he faced me shoulders distorting into hunched knots of powerful muscle bared his teeth and let out a shrieking roar a ghoul a tough dangerous opponent but not impossible to beat then more figures appeared on the deck of the other ship half veiled by the thick smoke their limbs crackled and contorted and a dozen more ghouls opened their mouths in earsplitting echo of the first thomas i shouted half choking on the smoke weve got a problem thirteen ghouls flung themselves directly at me jaws gaping and slavering talons reaching eyes gleaming with feral bloodlust and rage fucking boats chapter twentyone i have in general not had fun during my service as a warden of the white council i have taken no enjoyment whatsoever in becoming a soldier in the war with the vampire courts doing battle with the forces of i was going to say evil but im increasingly unsure exactly where everyone around me falls on the jedisith index doing battle with the forces of things trying to kill me or my friends or people who cant protect themselves is not a rowdy summer adventure movie its a nightmare everything is violence and confusion fear and rage pain and exhilaration it all happens fast and theres never time to think never any way to be sure of anything its awful reallybut i do have to admit that theres been one positive thing about the situation ive gotten in a lot of extra practice at combat wizardry and ever since new mexico i had absolutely no reservations about ripping ghouls apart with it the nearest ghoul was the closest threat but not the greatest opportunity still if i didnt lay the smack down on him in a hurry hed rip my head off or at least tie me up long enough for his buddies to mob me ordinarily id have let him eat a blast of telekinetic force from the little silver ring i wore on my right hand the one that stored up a little energy every time i moved my arm and which was useless after being employed i couldnt do that because id replaced the single silver ring with three circles of silver fused into a single band each with the same potential energy as the original silver ring oh and i had one of the new bands on every finger of my right hand i raised my staff in my fist baring the rings to the ghoul and as i triggered the first ring snarled see ya raw force lashed out at the ghoul flung him off the end of the water beetle and slammed him against the front of the ship blocking us in with enough force to break his back there was a rippling crack the ghouls battle cry turned into an agonized scream and he vanished into the cold waters of lake michigan the first of his buddies was already in the air boarding the water beetle just as the first had i waited a half second timing the arc of his jump and before his feet touched down i hit him just as i had the first one this time the ghoul flew back into a pair of its buddies already in the air behind him and dropped all three of them into the drink ghouls five and six were female about which i did not care in the least and i swatted them into the lake with two more blasts so far so good but then four of them all leaped togetherprobably by chance rather than designand i knocked down only two of them the other two hit the deck of the water beetle and flung themselves at me claws extended no time for any tricks i whirled my staff planted the back end against the wheelhouse wall and aimed the other at the nearest ghouls teeth it hit the ghoul with the tremendous power provided by his own supernatural strength and speed shattered bits of yellow fangs showered the deck as the ghoul rebounded the second ghoul leaped straight over his buddy and got a really nice view of the barrel of the revolver id pulled from my dusters pocket with my left hand the hand cannon roared snapping the ghouls head back and it slammed into me my back hit the wheelhouse hard enough to knock the breath from me but the ghoul fell to the deck writhing and screaming madly i put two more shots into the ghouls head from two feet away and emptied the revolver into the skull of the one id stunned with my staff watery brownish blood splattered the deck by then three more ghouls were on the deck and i heard thunking sounds of impact over the side of the ship as two of the ghouls id knocked into the water sank their claws into the water beetles planks and began swarming over the sides i hit the nearest ghoul with another blast from one of my rings sending it flying into its companions but it bought me only enough time to raise my shield into a shimmering quarterdome of silver light two ghouls slammed against it claws raking and bounced off then the ghouls coming up the sides of the ship gained the deck behind the edge of my shield and hit me from the side claws raked at me i felt a hot pain on my chin and then heavy impacts as the talons struck my duster they couldnt pierce it but hit with considerable force a sensation like being jabbed hard in the side with the rounded ends of multiple broom handles i went down and kicked at a knee it snapped crackled and popped drawing a scream of rage from the ghoul but its companion landed on me forcing me to throw my left arm across my throat to keep him from ripping it out my shield flickered and fell and the other ghouls let out howls of hungry glee a womans voice let out a ringing defiant shout there was a roar of light and sound a flash of scything solid green light and the ghoul atop me jerked as its head simply vanished from its shoulders spraying foulsmelling brown blood everywhere i shoved the stilltwitching body off me and gained my feet even as elaine stepped past me she whirled that chain of hers over her head snarling aerios something that looked like a miniature tornado illuminated from within by green light and laid on its side formed in the air in front of her the baby twister immediately began moving so much air so quickly that i had to lean away from the spells powerful suction the far end of the spell blew forth air in a shrieking column of wind so strong that as it played back and forth over the back end of the ship it scattered ghouls like bits of popcorn in a blower it also had the effect of ripping the thick choking smoke away from the stairway leading belowdecks and i hadnt even realized how dizzy i had begun to feel i cant hold this for long elaine shouted the ghouls began trying to get around the spell more of them climbing the sides after being thrown into the lake again i couldnt try whipping up a firenot with all these fine wooden boats and docks and brimming fuel containers and resident boaters around so i had to make do with using my staffnot using magic either thats the beauty of having a big heavy stick with you anytime you need to do it youve got a handy headcracking weapon ready to go the ghouls tried climbing up the sides of the ship but i started playing whackamole as their heads or clawed hands appeared over the side thomas i cried weve got to get out of here i could barely see anything through the smoke but i could make out the shapes of some of the ghouls clambering up onto the dockcutting us off from the shore get the boat loose elaine shouted the ghouls smoking vessel actually cruised into the rear of the water beetle the impact forcing me to grab at the wheelhouse to keep my feetand to stagger the other way a second later as the water beetle smashed into the dock not a chance hes too close down thomas shouted and i felt his hand shove down hard on my shoulder i ducked and saw the blued steel of his sawedoff shotgun as it went past my face the thing roared the sound painfully loud and i was pretty sure i wouldnt hear anything out of that ear for a while the blast caught the ghoul that had somehow sneaked up onto the top of the wheelhouse and had been about to leap down onto my shoulders ow i shouted to thomas thank you harry elaine shouted her voice higher now desperate i looked past her and saw that her pet cyclone was slowing down several of the ghouls had managed to dig their claws into the deck and hang on rather than being blasted off the end of the ship this is bad this is bad this is bad thomas said i know that i shouted at him a glance over my shoulder showed me olivias pale face on the stairs and the other women and children behind her well never get them out of here on foot theyve got the docks cut off thomas took a quick glance around the ship and said we cant cast off either harry elaine gasped the light began to fade from her spell the howl of wind dropping the ugly heavy smoke beginning to creep back in ghouls are hard to kill id done for two of them elaine for a third but the others had mostly just been made angrier by getting repeatedly slammed in the kisser with blasts of force followed by tumbles into the cold lake cold lake aha a plan take this i shouted and shoved my staff at thomas buy me a few seconds i spun to olivia and said everyone get ready to follow me close olivia relayed that to the women behind her while i hurriedly jerked loose the knots that secured my blasting rod to the inside of my duster i whipped out the blasting rod and looked out over the side of the ship farthest from shore there was nothing but thirty feet of water then the vague shape of the next row of docks thomas saw the blasting rod and swore under his breath but he whirled my staff with grace and stylethe way he does pretty much everythingthen leaped past elaines fading spell and began battering ghouls its hard for me to remember sometimes that thomas isnt human no matter that he looks it and is my brother to boot other times like this one i get forcibly reminded about his true nature ghouls are strong and disgustingly quick emphasis on disgusting thomas though drawing upon his darker nature made them look like the faceless throngs of extras in an arnold schwarzenegger movie he moved like smoke among them the heavy oak of my staff spinning striking snapping out straight and whirling away driven at the attackers with superhuman power i wanted to fight beside him but that wouldnt get us away from this ambush which was our only real chance of survival so instead of rushing to his aid i gripped my blasting rod focused my will and began to summon up every scrap of energy i could bring to bear this spell was going to take a hell of a lot of juice but if it worked wed be clear i reminded myself of that as i stood frozen my eyes half closed while my brother fought for our lives thomas outclassed any single ghoul he was up against but though he could cause them horrible pain a bludgeoning tool was not a good weapon for actually killing them he would have had to shatter several vertebrae or break open a skull to put one of them down had he stopped to take the focus he would need to finish off a single ghoul hed temporarily disabled the rest would have swarmed him he knew it they knew it too they fought with the mindlessly efficient instinct of the pack certain that they could in a few moments wear down their prey check that it wouldnt even take that long once that smoke rolled in again wed last only a minute or three breathing hard in exertion and fear as we all were the gunfire and shrieking would have prompted a dozen calls to the authorities as well i was sure i would be hearing sirens any minute assuming the ear my brother had left intact was pointed that way it was at that point that i realized something else someone was still on the boat pinning the water beetle against the dock someone who had brought the ghouls over who had been lying in wait near thomas ghouls are hell on wheels for violence but they dont tend to plan things out very well without outside direction they certainly do not bother operating under a smoke screen so whoever was driving the other boat probably wasnt a ghoul grey cloak maybe or his homey passenger thats when i realized something else we didnt have even those couple of minutes it would take for the smoke to strangle us once the mortal authorities started arriving whoever was in charge of the ghouls was sure to goad them into a more coordinated rush and that would be that a ghouls flailing claw ripped through thomass jeans and tore into his calf he lost his balance for a second caught it again and kept fighting as if nothing had happenedbut blood a little too pale to be human dribbled steadily to the water beetles deck i clenched my teeth as the power rose in me the hairs on my arms stood up straight and there was a kind of buzzing pressure against the insides of my eardrums my muscles were tensing almost to the point of convulsing in a fullbody charley horse stars swam in my vision as i raised the blasting rod harry elaine gasped dont be a fool youll kill us all i heard her but i was too far gone into the spell to respond it had to work i mean it had worked once before in theory it should work again if i could just get it to be a little bit bigger i lifted my face and the blasting rod to the sky opened my throat and in a stentorian bellow shouted fuego fire exploded from the tip of the blasting rod a column of whitehot flame as thick as my hips it surged up into the smoke burning it away as it went rising into a fiery fountain a good twenty stories high all magic obeys certain principles and many of them apply across the whole spectrum of reality scientific arcane or otherwise as far as casting spells is concerned the most important is the principle of conservation of energy energy cannot simply be created if one wants a twentystory column of fire hot enough to vaporize tengauge steel the energy of all that fire has to come from somewhere most of my spells use my own personal energy what is most simply described as sheer force of will energy for such things can also come from other sources outside of the wizards personal power this spell for example had been drawn from the heat energy absorbed by the waters of lake michigan the fire roared up with a thunderous detonation of suddenly expanding air and the shock wave from it startled everyone into dead silence the lake let out a sudden directionless crackling snarl in the space of a heartbeat the water between where i stood and the next dock froze over a sudden sheet of hard white ice i sagged with fatigue channeling so much energy through myself was an act that invited trauma and exhaustion and a sudden weakness in my limbs made me stagger go i shouted to olivia over the ice run for the next dock women and children first kill them shouted a mans voice from the general direction of the attacking ship the ghouls howled and leaped forward enraged to see prey making good their escape i leaned on the rail and watched olivia and company flee they hurried over the ice slipping here and there crackling protests of the ice sounded under their feet spiderweb fractures began to spread slowly but surely i gritted my teeth even though lake michigan is a coldwater lake this was high summer and even in the limited space i had frozen there was an enormous amount of water that had to be chilled imagine how much fire it takes to heat a teakettle to boiling and remember that it works both ways you have to take heat away from the kettles water if you want to freeze it now multiply that much energy by about a berjillion because thats the amount of water i was trying to freeze olivia and the women and children made it to the far dock and fled in a very welladvised and appropriate state of panic harry elaine said her chain lashed out and struck a ghoul that had slipped by thomas theyre clear i cried go go go thomas we is skedaddling i stood up and readied my shield bracelet come on elaine told me grabbing my arm i shook my head im the heaviest i told her i go last elaine blinked at me opened her mouth to protest then went very pale and nodded once she vaulted the rail and ran for the docks thomas i screamed down thomas hit the deck without so much as looking over his shoulder and the ghouls closed in i triggered the rest of the kinetic rings all of them at once ghouls tumbled and flew but id bought us only a little time thomas turned and leaped over the side i checked and saw that elaine had reached the other dock thomas bounded over the ice like something from one of those japanese martial arts cartoons leaped and actually turned a flip in the air before landing on his feet i didnt want to come down too hard on the ice but i didnt want to wait around until a ghoul ate me either i did my best to minimize the impact and started hurrying across ice crackled on my second step a sudden deep crack snapped open beneath my rearmost foot holy crap maybe id underestimated the energy involved maybe it had been two berjillion teakettles i took the next step and felt the ice groaning under my feet more cracks appeared it was only twenty feet but the next dock suddenly looked miles away behind me i heard ghouls charging throwing themselves recklessly onto the ice once they saw my turned back this is bad this is bad this is bad i babbled to myself behind me the ice suddenly screeched and one of the ghouls vanished into the water with a scream of protest more cracks even thicker began to race out ahead of me harry thomas screamed pointing over my shoulder i turned my head and saw madrigal raith standing on the deck of the water beetle not more than ten feet away he gave me a delighted smile then he lifted a heavy assault rifle to his shoulder and opened fire chapter twentytwo i screamed in order to summon up my primal reserves and to intimidate madrigal into missing me and definitely not because i was terrified while i unleashed my sonic initiative i also crouched down to take cover to the untrained eye it probably looked like i was just cowering and pulling my duster up to cover my head but it was actually part of a cunning master plan designed to let me survive the next three or four seconds madrigal raith was thomass cousin and built along the same lines slim darkhaired pale and handsome though not on thomass scale unfortunately he was just as deceptively strong and swift as thomas was and if he could shoot half as well there was no way he would miss me not at that range and he didnt the spellwork id laid over my duster had stood me in good stead on more than one occasion it had stopped claws and talons and fangs and saved me from being torn apart by broken glass it had reduced the impact of various and sundry blunt objects and generally preserved my life in the face of a great deal of potentially grievous bodily harm but i hadnt designed the coat to stand up to this there is an enormous amount of difference between the weapons and ammunition employed by your average chicago thug and militarygrade weaponry military rounds fully jacketed in metal would not smash and deform as easily as bullets of simple lead they were heavier rounds moving a lot faster than youd get with civilian small arms and they kept their weight focused behind an armorpiercing tip all of which meant that while military rounds didnt tend to fracture on impact and inflict horribly complicated damage on the human body they did tend to smash their way through just about anything that got in their way personal body armor advanced as it is is of very limited use against welldirected militarygrade fireparticularly when exposed from ten feet away the shots hit me not in a string of separate impacts the way i had thought it would be but in one awful roar of noise and pressure and pain everything spun around i was flung over the fracturing ice my body rolling the sun found a hole in the smoke and glared down into my eyes i felt a horrible nauseated wave of sensation flood over me and the glare of light in my eyes became hellish agony i felt suddenly weak and exhausted and even though i knew there was something i should have been doing i couldnt remember what it was if only the damned light wouldnt keep burning my eyes like that it wouldnt be so bad out here i growled to ramirez i held up a hand to shield my eyes from the blazing new mexico sun every morning its like someone sticking needles in my eyes ramirez dressed in surplus military bdu pants a loose white cotton shirt a khaki bush hat folded up on one side wraparound sunglasses and his usual cocky grin shook his head for gods sake harry why didnt you bring sunglasses i dont like glasses i said things on my eyes they bug me do they bug you as much as going blind ramirez asked i lowered my hand as my eyes finished adjusting and squinting hard made it possible to bear the glare shut up carlos whos a grumpy wizard in the morning carlos asked in that tone of voice one usually reserves for favorite dogs get a couple more years on you and that many beers that late at night will leave you with a headache too punk i growled a couple of curses under my breath then shook my head and composed myself as oughtto be expected of a master wizardwhich is to say i subtracted the complaining and was left with only the grumpy scowl whos up ramirez took a small notebook from his pocket and flipped it open the terrible twosome he replied the trailman twins youre kidding theyre twelve years old sixteen ramirez contradicted me twelve sixteen i said theyre babies ramirezs smile faded they dont have time to be babies man theyve got a gift for evocation and we need them sixteen i muttered hells bells all right lets get some breakfast first ramirez and i marched to breakfast the site captain luccio had chosen for teaching trainee wardens evocation had once been a boomtown built up around a vein of copper that trickled out after a year or so of mining it was pretty high up in the mountains and though we were less than a hundred miles northwest of albuquerque we might as well have been camped out on the surface of the moon the only indications of humanity for ten or twelve miles in any direction were ourselves and the tumbledown remains of the town and the mine upslope from it ramirez and i had lobbied to christen the place camp kaboom given that it was a boomtown and we were teaching magic that generally involved plenty of booms of its own but luccio had overridden us one of the kids had heard us though and by the end of the second day there camp kaboom had been named despite the disapproval of the establishment the fortyodd kids had their tents pitched within the stone walls of a church someone had built in an effort to bring a little more stability to the general havoc of boomtowns in the old west luccio had pitched her tent with them but ramirez me and two other young wardens who were helping her teach had set up our tents on the remains of what had once been a saloon a brothel or both wed taught kids all day and evening and once it had gotten cold and the trainees were asleep we played poker and drank beer and if i got enough in me i would even play a little guitar ramirez and his cronies got up every morning just as bright eyed and bushy tailed as if theyd had a full nights sleep the cocky little bastards breakfast was dished up and served by the trainees every morning built around several portable grills and several folded tables situated near a well that still held cool water if you worked the weatherbeaten pump long enough breakfast was little more than a bowl of cereal but part of the little more was coffee so i was surviving without killing anyoneif only because i took breakfast alone giving the grumpy time to fade before exposing myself to anyone else i collected my cereal an apple and a big cup of the holy mocha walked a ways and settled down on a rock in the blinding light of morning in desert mountains captain luccio sat down beside me good morning she said luccio was a wizard of the white council a couple of centuries old and one of its more dangerous members she didnt look like that she looked like a girl not even as old as ramirez with long curling brown locks a sweetly pretty face and killer dimples when id met her shed been a lean leatheryskinned matron with iron grey hair but a black wizard called the corpsetaker had suckered her in a duel corpsetaker then in luccios current body had let luccio run her throughand then corpsetaker had worked her trademark magic and switched their minds into the opposite bodies id figured it out before corpsetaker had time enough to abuse luccios credibility but once id put a bullet through corpsetakers head there hadnt been any way for luccio to get her original body back so shed been stuck in the young cute one instead because of me she had also ceased taking to the field in actual combat passing that off to her second in command morgan while she ran the boot camp to train new wardens in how to kill things without getting killed first good morning i replied mail came for you yesterday she said and produced a letter from a pocket i took it scanned the envelope and opened it hmmm who is it from she asked her tone was that of one passing the time in polite conversation warden yoshimo i said i had a few questions for her about her family tree see if she was related to a man i knew is she luccio asked distantly i said reading on interesting at luccios polite noise of inquiry i said my friend was a descendent of sho tai im afraid i dont know who that is luccio said he was the last king of okinawa i said and frowned thinking it over i bet it means something means something i glanced at captain luccio and shook my head sorry its a side project of mine something im curious about i shook my head folded up the letter from yoshimo and tucked it into the pocket of my jeans it isnt relevant to teaching apprentices combat magic and i should have my head in the game not on side projects ah luccio said and did not press for further details dresden theres something ive been meaning to talk to you about i grunted interrogatively she lifted her eyebrows have you never wondered why you did not receive a blade the wardens toted silver swords with them whenever there was a fight at hand i had seen them unravel complex powerful magic at the will of their wielders which is one hell of an advantage when taking on anything using magic as a weapon oh i said and sipped some coffee actually i hadnt really wondered i assumed you didnt trust me she frowned at me i see she said no that is not the case if i did not trust you i would certainly not allow you to continue wearing the cloak is there anything i could do to make you not trust me then i asked cause i dont want to wear the cloak no offense none taken she said but we need you and the cloak stays on damn she smiled briefly the expression had entirely too much weight and subtlety for a face so young the fact of the matter is that the swords the wardens have used in your lifetime must be tailored specifically to each individual warden they were also all articles of my creationand i am no longer capable of creating them i frowned and imbibed more coffee because i gestured at her vaguely she nodded this body did not possess the same potential the same aptitudes for magic as my own returning to my former level of ability will be problematical and will happen no time soon she shrugged her expression neutral but i had a feeling she was covering a lot of frustration and bitterness until someone else manages to adapt my design to their own talents or until i have retrained myself im afraid that no more such blades will be issued i chewed some cereal sipped some coffee and said it must be hard on you the new body a big change after so long in the first one she blinked at me eyes briefly wide with surprise i yes it has been are you doing okay she looked thoughtfully at her cereal for a moment headaches she said quietly memories that arent mine i think they belong to the original owner of this body they come mostly in dreams its hard to sleep she sighed and of course it had been a hundred and forty years since id put up with either sexual desire or a monthly cycle i swallowed cereal carefully instead of choking it sounds ah awkward and unpleasant very she said her voice quiet then her cheeks turned faintly pink mostly thank you for asking then she took a deep breath exhaled briskly and rose all businesslike again in any case i felt i owed you an explanation you didnt i said but thank y automatic weapons fire ripped the dewspangled morning luccio was moving at a full sprint before id gotten my ass up off the rock i wasnt slow ive been in enough scrapes that i dont freeze at the unexpected appearance of violence and death captain luccio however had been in a lot more scrapes than that and was faster and better than me as we ran there was the continued chatter of weapons fire screams and then a couple of awfully loud explosions and an inhuman scream i caught up to the captain of the wardens as we came into sight of the breakfast area and i let her take the lead im pigheadedly chivalrous not stupid the breakfast area was in a shambles folding tables had been knocked over blood and breakfast cereal lay scattered on the rocky ground i could see two kids on the ground one screaming one simply doubled over in a fetal position shaking others were lying flat faces in the dirt maybe thirty yards away in the ruins of what had been a blacksmiths shop the only remaining brick wall was missing an enormous circle of stonesimply gone probably in one of those weird silent green blasts ramirez favored i could see the barrel of a heavy weapon of some kind lying on the ground neatly severed about a foot behind its tip whoever had been holding it was likely gone with the bricks of the wall ramirezs head appeared at the hole in the wall he had dark brown fluid spattering one side of his face captain get down bullets hissed down making whistling whipping sounds as they kicked up dirt a foot to luccios right and the report of the shots reached us half a second later luccio didnt waver or slow she threw her right hand out fingers spread i couldnt see what shed done but the air between us and the slope of the mountain above suddenly went watery with haze where she shouted ive got two wounded ghouls here ramirez shouted at least two more upslope maybe a hundred and twenty meters as he spoke one of the other wardens rolled around the end of the broken wall pointed his staff upslope and spat out a vicioussounding word there was a low hum a sudden flash and a bluewhite bolt of lightning snarled up the side of the mountain in the general direction of the shots it struck a boulder with a roar and shattered it to gravel the sight bizarre through the haze luccio had conjured watch it ramirez screamed they took two of our kids the other warden shot him a horrified look and then dove for cover as more gunfire spat down the mountain he let out a short clenchtoothed scream and grabbed at his leg and one of the kids not far from him gasped clutching at her cheek dammit snarled luccio she slid to a stop and raised her other hand and the haze in the air became a rippling blur of moving color that made the entire mountainside look like some enormous desertthemed lava lamp shots began to ring out singly as the attacker fired randomly into the haze each one made trainees cringe and gasp trainees stay down luccio trumpeted stay still be quiet do not give your position away by sound or movement bullets struck the ground near her feet again as she spoke drawing the fire to herself but she didnt flinch though her face had already broken out in a sweat with the strain of holding up the broad obscurement spell dresden she said between gritted teeth only one of those things is keeping fire on us hes pinning us down while the other escapes with hostages we must protect the trainees foremost and we cant help the wounded while were still taking fire you hold the haze and keep them hidden i said drawing a shot and a puff of dirt of my own i sidestepped judiciously shooters mine she nodded but her eyes showed something of wounded pride as she said hurry i cant hold it for long i nodded to her and looked up the mountainsideand then i shook my head and drew up my sight at once my vision cut through luccios bewildering haze as though it had never existed i could see the mountainside in perfect detaileven as it was in turn partially veiled by the vision my sight granted me which showed me all the living magic in the world around us all the traces of magic that had lingered before including dozens of imprints made in the past few days and hundreds of ghostly glimpses of particularly strong emotional images that had sunk into the area during its heyday i could see where the girl who now lay shuddering with a bullet in her had tried to call up raw fire for the first time near a scorch mark upslope i could see where a grizzled man desperately addicted to opium and desperately broke had shot himself more than a century ago and where by night his shade still lingered leaving fresh imprints behind and i could see the little coiling cloud of darkness that formed the inhuman energy of the attacking ghoul running hot on the emotions of battle i marked the ghouls location lowered my sight and took off at a dead sprint bounding up the slope and bouncing back and forth in a wavering line its damned hard to hit a target like that even one growing steadily closer and even with luccios haze to cover me i didnt want to get shot if i could possibly avoid it it was hard going uphill rough terrain but it hadnt had time to get hot yet and i practiced running regularlythough admittedly i did it to give me the option of running away from bad guys more ably not toward them more shots rang out but none of them seemed to come near i kept my eyes locked on the spot on the slope where the ghoul lay shooting probably behind cover i couldnt see a thing through the haze but as soon as it began to clear i would present the ghoul with a clear target either as i came through or when luccios power faltered and the spell fell i had to get closer i didnt have my blasting rod or staff with me and without them to help me focus my magic the range and accuracy of any spell i could throw at the ghoul would be drastically reduced thats why i had to get closer before i took my shot i couldnt hold a shield against bullets and attack at the same timeand the ghoul had to be taken out id get only one shot and if i missed id be an easy target i ran and watched and began to gather the power to throw at the ghoul the haze abruptly cleared as i bounded over a patch of scrub growth the ghoul crouched behind a rock maybe twenty yards upslope his face only barely distended as he held mostly to his human shape while employing the human weapona freaking kalashnikov thank god the weapon was tough and serviceable but it wasnt exactly a sharpshooters tool if hed been toting something more precise he probably could have inflicted a lot more damage than he had i was over to one side and the ghoul was squinting hard down the rifles sights so that i was only a flicker of motion in the periphery of his focus it took him a second to recognize the threat and whip the weapon toward me i had time and i threw out my hand and my will and snarled fuego fire bellowed forth from my right handnot in a narrow beam a jet of tightly focused energy but in a roaring flood spilling out from my fingertips like water from a garden sprayer a lot of it way more than i had intended the fire got the ghoul all rightand the ground for twenty feet around him in every directionmore on the uphill side of him the roar of flame gave way to a hideous shriek and then a steady chewy silence shrouded by black smoke a low breeze a herald of the days oncoming heat nudged the smoke away for a moment the ghoul now in its true form lay outstretched on the scorched earth it had been burned down to little more than an appallingly blackened skeleton though one leg retained enough muscle matter to continue twitching and thrashingeven then the creature was not wholly dead it didnt surprise me in my experience ghouls hadnt done much that wasnt disgusting there was no reason to expect them to die cleanly either once i was sure it wasnt getting back up i scanned the mountainside looking for any other sign of movement but found nothing then i turned and hurried back down the slope to the encampment luccio was fully engaged in treating the wounded three had been hit by gunfire and several others including one of the other adult wardens had been wounded by shards of shattered rock or splinters thrown from the folding tables and chairs ramirez came hurrying up to me and said you get him his eyes trailed past me to the enormous area blackened with smoke and half a dozen patches of brush still on fire and he said yeah i guess you kind of did kind of i agreed you said they had two of our kids he nodded once his face grim the terrible twosome they were heading up the slope to find a spot above the camp for the lesson wanted to show off i expect sixteen i muttered jesus ramirez grimaced i was yelling at them to come back when the ghouls hopped up out of the bush and brought them down and the three assholes who had sneaked into the old smithy opened up how are you at following tracks i asked him thought they taught that boy scout stuff to all you anglos i grew up in la i blew out a breath thinking fast luccios busy shell call in help for the wounded that leaves you and me to go get the twins fucking right we will ramirez said how you got prisoners the two i didnt blast yeah well ask them think theyll rat out their buddy if they think itll save their lives i asked in a heartbeat maybe less weasels ramirez muttered they are what they are man i said theres no use in hating them for it just be glad we can use it to advantage lets go chapter twentythree the ghouls lay covered in greywhite dust as fine as baby powderthe remains of the wall ramirez had blasted their companion his weapon and the right arm and leg of one of the captive ghouls the wounded ghoul body shifted into its natural form under the stress of injury lay panting and choking spitting out dust the second ghoul still looked mostly human and was dressed in a ragged old set of sandcolored robes that looked like something out of lawrence of arabia another kalashnikov lay several feet away behind bill meyers the young warden now standing over them with a doublebarreled tengauge shotgun pointed at the unwounded one of the pair careful meyers said he had the rural drawl that seems largely common to any town west of the mississippi located more than an hour or so from a major city though he was himself a texan i aint searched them and they dont pear to understand english what ramirez said thats stupid who bothers to sneak ghouls into the country as covert muscle if they cant pass as locals someone who doesnt have to worry about customs or border guards or witnesses or cops i said quietly someone who takes them through the nevernever straight here from wherever the hell they came from i glanced back at ramirez how else do you think they got past the outer wards and sentries and right up to the camp ramirez grunted i thought we had those approaches warded too nevernevers a tricksy kind of place i said tough to know it all somebody was sneakier than us vampires ramirez asked i very carefully said nothing about a black council who else would it be ramirez said something to them in spanish shoot meyers drawled you think i didnt try that already hey i said i stepped closer to the unwounded ghoul and nudged him with one foot what language do you speak the notquitehumanlooking man shot a quick furtive glance at me and then at his companion he sputtered something quick and liquidsounding his companion snarled something back through its muzzle and fangs that sounded vaguely similar seconds were ticking by and we had a pair of kids in the hands of one of these things i directed my thoughts inward to the corner of my brain where lasciels shadow lived and asked you get any of that lasciels presence promptly responded the first asked the second if he understood anything we were saying the second replied that he hadnt and you were probably deciding which one of us would kill them i need to talk to them i said can you translate for me there was a sudden sense of someone standing close to mean almost tangible physical sensation of someone slim and feminine pressed against my back arms casually around my waist soft breath and lips moving near my ear it was odd but not at all unpleasant i caught myself enjoying it and firmly reminded myself of the danger of allowing the demon to do that with your permission you need only speak to them in english my host lasciel said i will translate it between mind and mouth and they will hear their tongue from your lips i so did not need any image involving their tongues and my lips i responded lasciel let out a delighted laugh that bubbled through my mind and i was smiling a little when i faced the ghoul and said okay asshole ive got two kids missing and the only chance you have of getting out of this alive is if i get them back do you understand me both ghouls looked up at me surprise evident even on the inhuman ones face i got a similar look from ramirez and meyers do you understand me i asked the ghouls quietly yes stammered the wounded ghoul apparently in english ramirezs dark heavy eyebrows tried to climb up under his bush hat i had to remind myself that this was not very cool i was using a dangerous tool that would one day turn on me no matter how savvy and tough it made me look in front of the other wardens kids harry focus on the kids why did you take those children i demanded of the ghoul they must have wandered too close to murzheks position the mostly human ghoul said we did not come here for hostages this was to be a raid we were to hit you then fade away fade to where the ghouls froze and looked at each other i drew back one of my hiking boots and kicked the mostly human ghoul in the face he let out a highpitched squealnot a snarl of rage and pain but a sound a dog makes when its trying to submit beneath an attacker where i demanded our lives hissed the wounded ghoul promise us our lives and freedom great one give us your word of truth you gave up your freedom the moment you spilled our blood i snarled but if i get the kids back you keep your life i said my word is given the ghouls looked at each other and then the more human of the pair said the deep caves above this dwelling the first deep shaft from the light of the sun in the stones near it is a way to the realm of shadows i shot a thought toward my interpreter does he mean the nevernever a region of it yes my host remain here i told them do not move make no attempt to escape at the first sign of disobedience or treachery you will die great one both of them said and began pressing their faces into the grey dust and the sandy rocky soil beneath great one theyve been taken to the mine i told ramirez we go there i turned to the other warden meyers theyve surrendered dont take your eyes off them for a second and if they twitch funny kill them otherwise leave them be right he said let me get some of the trainees in here ill go with yall theyre trainees ramirez said his tone hard youre the warden meyers blinked at him but then let out a gusty exhalation and nodded all right watch your ass los come on i said to ramirez and the two of us ducked out of the ruins and ran for our tent we recovered our gear from itstaves ramirezs silver sword and grey cape my revolver and blasting rod and duster then i took off up the hill at the fastest pace i thought i could hold ramirez was built like an athlete but he was more naturally inclined to sprints and bursts of strength he probably lifted weights at the expense of doing as much running as i did he was blowing pretty hard by the time wed gotten halfway to the mine and he was fifty yards behind me by the time i got there my own lungs were tight and heaving i could feel the beginnings of a good hard puking revving up in my belly and my legs felt like someone had poured a gallon of isopropyl over them and ignited it but there wasnt time to waste on recovering from the effort the ghouls hadnt been there to take prisoners this one might be smart enough to have kept the kids alive to use as hostages but id never found ghouls to be particularly brilliant and the one unwavering constant id observed among them was an inability to restrain their appetites for any length of time i banged my staff hurriedly against the earth calling up my will and reinforcing it with hellfire a mystical source of energy lasciels presence gave me the ability to utilize i was already tired enough from my clumsy fire spell earlier and all the running that i didnt have much choice but to draw on the brimstonescented energy and hope for the best the runes in my staff blazed into light and with a little effort of will i increased the effect until the smoldering scarlet glow spilled out in a wide circle around me the entrance to the mine was choked with brush low and not ten feet in one of the supports had collapsed all but closing the place off from the outside i had to slide in sideways and once i was in the dim light from the entrance and the scarlet glow pouring from my staff were the only illumination i hurried forward knowing ramirez would be coming soon but not willing to wait for him the air turned cold within a dozen strides and my panting breaths formed into tiny clouds as they left my mouth the tunnel widened and then sloped sharply downhill i kept my left side against the wall my right hand holding forth my staff both to provide me enough light to see and to make sure i had the weapon ready to interpose itself between me and anything that should come slobbering out of the shadows a tunnel opened on my left and as i went by it i heard a snarling hiss come drifting and echoing from far down its length i turned and hurried down it coming upon an old track built into the floor where ore carts would have trundled back and forth carrying out the ore from where it was brought up a shaft from lower in the mine the sounds grew louder as i continued a broader variety of the same snarling hisses and maybe a very soft whimper i probably should have been cagey at that point i probably should have gone still doused my light and sneaked up to see what i could find out about things i considered a nice cautious recon for maybe a quarter of second screw that there were kids in danger i went through the remains of a wooden partition at a full charge the ghoul wholly inhuman and wearing the same sandcolored robes the others had been had his back to me and was clawing at a section of rough tunnel wall with both hands they were dark with his own blood and a couple of his claws had broken he was uttering snarls between desperate gasps and lasciel was evidently still on the job betrayed the ghoul snarled betrayed reckoning oh yes balance of the scales let me in everything slowed down thoughts burning through my mind at tremendous speed i saw everything clearly what was in front of me what was in my peripheral vision and everything seemed as bright and organized as a third graders desk on the first day of school the trailman twins were fraternal not identical terry the brother was a couple of inches shorter than his nominally younger sister but he stuck so far out of his shirt and pants that he had seemed well on the way to reversing that situation hed never get to his body was on the floor of the cave his face covered in a mask of blood and torn flesh the ghoul had ripped open his throat hed also gotten the femoral artery on terrys thigh the kids mouth was open and i could see the ghouls disgusting blood clinging to terrys teeth his knuckles were ripped open too the kid had died fighting two feet farther on was the source of his motivation tina trailman lay on the stone staring upward with glazed eyes she was naked from the waist down her throat and trapezius muscles were mostly gone ripped away as were her modest breasts the quadriceps muscle of her right leg was gone the skin around it showing the roughly torn gouges of ghoul fangs there was blood everywhere a sticky pool forming around her i saw her shudder a little a tiny sound escaped her unmoving form she was dead alreadyi knew that ive seen it more than once her heart was still laboring but whatever time she had left was a mere formality my vision went red with rage or maybe that was the hellfire i called upon still more of the dark energy in midleap staff gripped in both hands and rammed the tip into the small of the ghouls back as i snarled fuego the blow with all my weight and power and speed behind it probably broke a couple of the ghouls vertebrae all by itself the fire spell came rushing out at the same time filling the tunnel with thunder and light tremendous heat blossomed before me rushed into the ghoul and tore him in half at the waist the same thermal bloom washed into the stone wall behind the creature and rebounded i got an arm up to shield my face and i dropped the staff so that i could draw my hands into my dusters sleeves i managed to keep much skin from being directly exposed but it hurt like hell all the same i remembered that later at the time i didnt give a flying fuck i kicked the ghouls wildly thrashing lower body into the black ness of the mine shaft then i turned to the upper half the ghouls blood wasnt red so he burned black and brown like a burger that fell into the barbecue just as it was finished cooking he thrashed and screamed and somehow managed to flip himself onto his back he held up his arms fingers spread in desperation and cried mercy great one mercy sixteen years old jesus christ i stared down for a second i didnt want to kill the ghoul that wasnt nearly enough to cover the debt of its sins i wanted to rip it to pieces i wanted to eat its heart i wanted to pin it to the floor and push my thumbs through its beady eyes and all the way into its brain i wanted to tear it apart with my fingernails and my teeth and spit mouthfuls of its own pustuled flesh into its face as it died in slow and terrible agony the quality of mercy was not harry i called up the hellfire again and with a snarl cast out the simple spell i use to light candles backed by hellfire directed by my fury it lashed out at the ghoul plunged beneath its skin and there it set fat and nerves and sinews alight they burned burned using the ghoul for tallow and the thing went mad with the pain i reached down to the ghoul caught him by the remains of his robes and hauled him up to my eye level ignoring the little runnels of flame that occasionally licked up from the inferno beneath the ghouls skin i stared into its face then forced it to look at the bodies then i turned it back to me and my voice came out in a snarl so inhuman that i barely understood it myself never i told it never again then i threw it down the shaft it burst into open flame a second later the rush of its fall feeding the fires in its flesh i watched it plummet heard it wailing in terror and pain then far below it struck something the flame flowered and brightened for a second then it began to slowly die away i couldnt make out any details of the ghoul but nothing moved i looked up in time to see ramirez come through the ruins of the wooden partition he stared at me for a second where i stood over the mine shaft dark smoke rising from the surface of my duster red light shining up from far below the stench of brimstone heavy in the air ramirez is rarely at a loss for words he stared for a moment then his eyes tracked over to the dead kids his breath escaped him in a short hard jerk his shoulders sagged he dropped to one knee turning his head away from the sight di or i picked up my staff and started walking back to the camp ramirez caught up with me a few paces later dresden he said i ignored him harry sixteen carlos i said sixteen it had them for less than eight minutes harry wait what the hell was i thinking i snarled stepping out into the sunlight staff and blasting rod and most of my gear in the damned tent were at war there was security in place ramirez said weve been here for two days there was no way you could know this was coming were wardens carlos were supposed to protect people i could have done more to be ready he got in front of me and planted his feet i stopped and narrowed my eyes at him youre right he said this is a war bad things happen to people even if no one makes any mistakes i dont remember consciously doing it but the runes of my staff began to burn with hellfire again carlos i said quietly get out of my way he ground his teeth but his eyes flickered away from me he didnt actually turn but when i brushed past him he didnt try to stop me at the camp i caught one brief glimpse of luccio as she helped carry a wounded trainee on a stretcher she stepped into a glowing line of light in the air an opened way to the nevernever and vanished reinforcements had arrived there were wardens with medical kits stretchers the works trying to stabilize the wounded and get them to better help the trainees looked shocked numb staring around themand at two silent shapes lying close together over to one side covered from their heads to their knees by an unzipped sleeping bag i stormed into the smithy and snarled forzare putting all my rage and will into a lashing column of force directed at the captured ghouls the spell blew the remaining wall of the smithy and the two ghouls fifty feet through the air and onto a relatively flat area of the street i walked after them i didnt hurry in fact i picked up a jug of orange juice off one of the breakfast tables and drank some of it as i went the mountainside was completely silent once i reached them another blast opened up a sixfoot crater in the sandy earth i kicked the mostly human ghoul into it and with several more such blasts collapsed the crater in on him burying him to the neck then i called fire and melted the sand around the ghouls exposed head into a sheet of glass it screamed and screamed which did not matter to me in the least the sheer heat of the molten sand burned away its features its eyes its lips and tongue even as the trauma forced the ghoul into its true form i upended the jug of juice some of it splashed on the ghouls head some of it sizzled on the narrow band of glass around it i walked calmly pouring orange juice on the ground in a steady line until ten feet later i reached the enormous nest of fire ants one of the trainees had stumbled into on our first day at camp kaboom presently the first scouts started following the trail back to the ghoul i turned on the second ghoul it cringed away from me holding completely still the only sound was the raw whisperscreams of the other ghoul im not going to kill you i told the ghoul in a very quiet voice you get to carry word to your kind i thrust the end of my staff against its chest and stared down wisps of sulfurous smoke trickled down the length of the wooden shaft and over the maimed ghoul tell them this i leaned closer never again tell them that never again or hell itself will not hide you from me the ghoul groveled great one great one i roared again and started kicking the ghoul as hard as i could i kept it up until it floundered away from me heading for the open desert with only one leg and one arm the movements freakish and terrified i watched until the maimed ghoul was gone by then the ants had found his buddy i stood over it for a time and beheld what i had wrought without looking away i felt ramirezs presence behind me dios he whispered i said nothing moments later ramirez said what happened to not hating them things change ramirez didnt move and his voice was so low i could barely hear it how many lessons will it take the kids to learn this one do you think the rage came swarming up again battle is one thing ramirez said this is something else look at them i suddenly felt the weight of dozens and dozens of eyes upon me i turned to find the trainees all pale shocked and silent staring at me they looked terrified i fought the frustration and anger back down ramirez was right of course he was right dammit i drew my gun and executed the ghoul dios ramirez breathed he stared at me for a moment never seen you like this i started feeling the minor burns the sun began turning camp kaboom into a giant cookie sheet that would sear away anything soft like what cold he said finally thats the only way to serve it up i said cold cold cold i came back to myself no more new mexico dark cold so cold that it burned chest tight i was in the water my chest hurt i managed to look up sun shone down on fractured ice about eight inches thick it came back to me the battle aboard the water beetle the ghouls the lake the ice had broken and i had fallen through i couldnt see far and when the ghoul came through the water swimming like a crocodile its arms flat against its sides it was close enough to touch it spotted me at the same time and turned away never again i reached out and grabbed on to the back of the jeans the ghoul still wore it panicked swimming fast and dived down into the cold and dark trying to scare me into letting go i was aware that i had to breathe and that i was already beginning to black out i dismissed it as unimportant this ghoul was never going to hurt anyone else ever again if i had to die to make sure of it everything started going dark and then there was another pale shape in the water thomas this time shirtless holding that crooked knife in his teeth he closed on the ghoul which writhed and twisted with such fear and desperation that it tore my weakening fingers lose from their grip i drifted felt something cold wrap my right wrist felt light coming closer painfully bright and then my face was out of the frozen water and i sucked in a weak gasp of air i felt a slender arm slip under my chin and then i was being pulled through the water elaine id recognize the touch of her skin to mine anywhere we broke the surface and she let out a gasp then started pulling me toward the dock with the help of olivia and the other women elaine managed to get me up out of the lake i fell to my side and lay there shivering violently gasping down all the air i could the world slowly began to return to its usual shape but i was too tired to do anything about it i dont know how much time went by but the sirens were close by the time thomas appeared and hauled himself out of the water go thomas said can he walk is he shot no elaine said it might be shock i dont know i think he hit his head on something we cant stay here thomas said i felt him pick me up and sling me over a shoulder he did it as gently as such a thing can be done right elaine said come on everyone keep up and dont get separated i felt motion my head hurt a lot i gotcha thomas said to me as he started walking its cool harry he murmured theyre safe we got everyone clear i gotcha my brothers word was good enough for me i closed my eyes and stopped trying to keep track of things chapter twentyfour the touch of very warm very gentle fingers woke me my head hurt even more than it had after cowl had finished ringing my bells the night before if such a thing was possible i didnt want to regain consciousness if it meant rising into that but those soft warm fingers touched me steady and exquisitely feminine and the pain began to fade that had the effect it always did when the pain was gone its simple lack was a nearly narcotic pleasure of its own it was more than that too there is a primal reassurance in being touched in knowing that someone else someone close to you wants to be touching you there is a bonedeep security that goes with the brush of a human hand a silent reflexlevel affirmation that someone is near that someone cares it seemed that lately i had barely been touched at all dammit lash i mumbled i told you to stop doing that the fingers stiffened for a second and elaine said what was that harry i blinked and opened my eyes i was lying on a bed in dim hotel room the ceiling tiles were old and water stained the furniture was similarly simple cheap battered by long and careless use and little maintenance elaine sat at the head of the bed with her legs crossed my head lay comfortably upon her calves as it had so many times before my legs hung off the end of the bed also as they had often done before a long time ago in a house i barely remembered except in dreams am i hurting you harry elaine pressed i couldnt see her expression without craning my neck and that seemed a bad idea but she sounded concerned no i said no just waking up groggy sorry ah she said who is lash no one i especially want to discuss all right she said there was nothing but gentle assent in her tone then just lie back for a few moments more and let me finish your friend the vampire said that theyd be watching the hospitals what are you doing i asked her reiki she replied laying on of hands i said that stuff works the principles are sound she said and i felt something silky brush over my forehead her hair i recognized it by touch and smell she had bowed her head in concentration her voice became distracted i was able to combine them with some basic principles for moving energy i havent found a way to handle critical trauma or to manage infections but its surprisingly effective in handling bruises sprains and bumps on the head no kidding the headache was already gone completely the tightness in my head and neck was fading as well as were the twinges in my upper back and shoulders and a beautiful woman was touching me elaine was touching me i wouldnt have done anything to stop her if id had a thousand paper cuts and shed soaked her hands in lemon juice we simply stayed like that for a time once in while she moved her hands palms running down lightly over my cheeks neck chest her hands would move in slow repetitive stroking motions barely touching my skin id lost my shirt at some point all of those aches and pains of exertion and combat faded away leaving only a happy cloud of endorphins behind her hands were warm slow infinitely patient and infinitely confident it felt amazing i drifted on the sensations utterly content all right she said quietly an unknown amount of time later how does that feel incredible i said i could hear the smile in her voice you always say that when im done touching you not my fault if its always true i replied flatterer she said and her fingers gently slapped one of my shoulders let me up ape what if i dont want to i drawled men i pay you the least bit of attention and you go completely paleolithic on me ugh i replied and slowly sat up expecting a surge of discomfort and nausea as the blood rushed around my head there wasnt any i frowned and ran my fingers lightly over my scalp there was a lump on the side of my skull that should have felt like hell instead it was only a little tender ive been thumped on the melon before i know the residue of a hard blow this felt like a bad one only after id had about a week to recover how long have i been down eight hours maybe elaine asked she rose from the bed and stretched it was every bit as intriguing and pleasant to watch as i remembered i sort of lose track when im focused on something i remember i murmured elaine froze in place and her green eyes glittered in the dimness as she met my gaze in a kind of relaxed insolent silence then a little smile touched her lips i suppose you would my heart lurched and sped up and i started getting ideas none of which could be properly pursued at the moment i saw elaine reach the same conclusion at about the same time i did she lowered her arms smiled again and said excuse me ive been sitting there a while then she paced into the bathroom i went to the hotels window and opened the cheap blinds a tiny bit we were somewhere on the south side dusk was on the city the streetlights already flickering into life one by one as the shadows crept out from beneath the buildings and oozed slowly up the light poles i checked around but saw no shark fins circling no vultures wheeling overhead and no obvious ghouls or vampires lurking nearby just waiting to pounce that didnt mean they werent there though i went to the door and touched it lightly with my left hand elaine had spun another ward over the door a subtle solid crafting that would release enough kinetic energy to throw anyone who tried to open it a good ten or twelve feet away it was perfect for a quick exit if you were expecting trouble and ready for it when it arrived just wait for the bad guy to get bitchslapped into the parking lot then dash out the door and run off before he regained his feet i heard elaine come out of the bathroom behind me what happened i asked what do you remember madrigal opened up with that assault rifle flash of light then i was in the water elaine came to stand next to me and also glanced out her hand brushed mine when she lowered it from the blinds and without even thinking about it i twined my fingers in hers it was an achingly familiar sensation and another pang of halfremembered days long gone made my chest ache for a second elaine shivered a little and closed her eyes her fingers tightened very slightly on mine we thought hed killed you she said you started to crouch down and there were bullets shattering the ice all around you you went into the water and the vampire madrigal did you say his name was he ordered the ghouls in after you i sent olivia and the others to the shore and thomas and i went into the water to find you who hit me in the head i asked elaine shrugged either a bullet hit your coat after you crouched down and then bounced off your thick skull without penetrating or you slammed it against some of the shattered ice as you went under a bullet might have bounced off my head thanks to the intervening fabric of my spellcovered coat that was a sobering sort of thing to hear even for me thank you i said for getting me out elaine arched an eyebrow then gave me a little roll of her eyes and said i was bored and didnt have anything better to do i figured i said thomas hes all right he had a car near the docks i drove that clown car of yours and we shoehorned everyone into them and got away clean with any luck madrigal had a tougher time avoiding the cops than we did nah i said with total conviction too easy he got away wheres thomas standing watch outside he said elaine frowned he looked very pale he refused to stay in the room with his refugees or me for that matter i grunted thomas had really put on his supervamp cape back at the harbor under ordinary circumstances he was surprisingly strong for a man of his size and build but even unusually strong men dont go toetotoe with ghouls armed with nothing but a big stick and come away clean thomas could make himself strongera lot strongerbut not forever the demon knit to my brothers soul could make him into a virtual godling but it also increased his hunger for the life force of mortals burning away whatever he had stored up in exchange for the improved performance after that fight thomas had to be hungry so hungry that he didnt trust himself in a room with anyone he considered well edible which in our escape party had been everyone but me and the kids he must have been hurting what about the ordo i asked her quietly i didnt want to go until i could be certain that i wouldnt lead anyone back to them i called them every couple of hours to make sure they were all right i should check in with them again she turned to the phone before she finished the sentence and dialed a number i waited she was silent after a moment she hung up the phone again no answer i said quietly no she said she turned to the dresser gathered up her length of chain and threaded it through the loops of her jeans like a belt fastening it with a slightly curved piece of dark wood bound with several bands of colored leather which she slipped through two links i opened the door and stuck my head out into the twilight looking around i didnt see thomas anywhere so i let out a sharp loud whistle waved an arm around a little and ducked back inside closing the door again it didnt take long for thomass footsteps to reach the door harry elaine said mildly alarmed the ward i held up a forefinger in a onesecond kind of gesture then folded my arms stared at the door and waited the doorknob twitched there was a heavy thud a gasp of surprise and a loud clatter of empty trash cans i opened the door and found my brother flat on his back in the parking lot amidst a moderate amount of spilled garbage he stared up at the sky for a moment let out a longsuffering sigh and then sat up scowling at me oh sorry about that i said with all the sincerity of a threeyearold claiming he didnt steal that cookie all over his face maybe i should have told you about a potentially dangerous situation huh i mean that would have been polite of me to warn you right and sensible and intelligent and respectful and i get it i get it he growled he got up and made a doomed effort to brush various bits of unsavory matter off his clothes jesus christ harry there are days when you can be a total prick whereas you can apparently be a complete moron for weeks at a time elaine stepped up beside me and said i love to see a good testosteroneladen alphamale dominance struggle as much as the next womanbut dont you think it would be smarter to do it where half of the city cant see us i scowled at elaine but she had a point i stepped out the door and offered thomas my hand he glowered at me then deliberately ran his hand through some of the muck and held it out to me without wiping it off i rolled my eyes and pulled him to his feet and then the three of us went back into the room thomas leaned his back against the door folded his arms and kept his eyes on the floor while i went to the sink and washed off my hands my coat hung on one of the wire hangers on the bar beside it as did my shirt my staff rested in a corner by the light switch and my other gear was on the counter i dried off my hands and started suiting up okay thomas i said seriously whats up with the secrecy you should have contacted me i couldnt he said why not i promised someone i wouldnt i frowned at that tugging the stilldamn black leather glove onto my disfigured left hand and tried to think thomas and i were brothers he took that every bit as seriously as i didbut he took his promises seriously too if hed made the promise he had a good reason to do so how much can you tell me elaine gave me a sharp glance ive already said more than i should have thomas said dont be an idiot weve obviously got a common enemy here thomas grimaced gave me a hesitant glance and then said weve got several i traded a glance with elaine who glanced at thomas shrugged and suggested bruises fade no i said if he isnt talking he has a good reason for it beating him up wont change that then we should stop wasting time here elaine said quietly thomas looked back and forth between us whats wrong weve lost contact with the women elaine is protecting i said dammit thomas pushed his hand buck through his hair that means i fastened the clasp on the new shield bracelet what look you already know madrigal is around thomas said and that hes always sucking up to house malvora i said i frowned for the love of god hes the passenger hes the one working with grey cloak the malvora i didnt say that thomas said quickly you didnt have to i growled he didnt just happen to show up for some payback while this other stuff was going on and it all fits passenger was talking to grey cloak about having the resources to take me out he obviously decided to take a whack at it with a bunch of ghouls and a machine gun sounds reasonable thomas said you already know that theres a skavis around yes time to do some math then harry madrigal and grey cloak the malvora i murmured the genocidal odd couple neither of which is a skavis elaine drew in a sharp breath and said at the same time i was thinking it it means that we arent talking about one killer i completed the thought were talking about three of them grey cloak malvora passenger madrigal and serial killer skavis i frowned at thomas wait are you saying that my brothers expression became strained im not saying anything he replied those are all things you already know elaine frowned youre trying to maintain deniability she said why so i can deny telling you anything obviously thomas snarled his eyes suddenly flickering several shades of grey lighter as he stared at elaine elaine drew in a sharp breath then she narrowed her eyes a little unfastened the clasp on her chain and said stop it vampire now thomass lips pulled back from his teeth but he jerked his face away from her and closed his eyes i stepped between them as i shrugged into my leather duster elaine back off the enemy of my enemy okay i dont like it elaine said you know what he is harry how do you know you can trust him ive worked with him before i said hes different how a lot of vampires feel remorse about their victims it doesnt stop them from killing over and over its what they are ive gazed him i said quietly hes trying to rise above the killer inside him elaines brows knit into a frown at those words and she gave me a slow and reluctant nod arent we all she murmured im still not comfortable with the notion of him near my clients and we need to get moving go ahead thomas said i didnt look at my brother but i said you need to eat maybe later thomas said i cant leave the women and children unguarded i grabbed a pad of cheap paper with the hotels logo and found a pencil in one of my pockets i wrote a number on it and passed it to thomas call murphy you wont be able to protect anyone if youre too weak and you might kill one of them if you lose control of the hunger thomass jaw tightened with frustration but he took the offered piece of paper from my hand only a little more roughly than necessary elaine studied him as she walked to the door with me then she said to him youre different from most of them arent you probably just more deluded thomas replied good luck harry yeah i said feeling awkward look after this is done we have to talk theres nothing to talk about my brother said we left and i closed the door behind us we took the blue beetle back to the amber inn and went to elaines room the lights were off the room was empty there was a terrible sewer smell in the air dammit elaine whispered she suddenly sagged and leaned against the doorway i stepped past her and turned on the light in the bathroom anna ashs corpse stood in the shower body stiff leaning away from the showerhead but held in place by the electrical cord of a hair dryer tied in a knot about the showerhead and another around her neck there hadnt been room enough for her to suspend herself with her feet off the floor ugly purpleblack ligature marks showed on her neck around the cord it was obviously a suicide it obviously wasnt we were too late chapter twentyfive weve got to call the cops on this one i said quietly to elaine no she replied theyll want to question us it will take hours theyll want to question us a lot longer if someone else finds the body and they have to come looking for us and while were cooperating with the authorities what happens to abby helen and priscilla she stared at me for that matter what happens to mouse that was a thought id been trying to avoid if mouse was alive and capable there was no way hed let any of the women be harmed if someone had killed anna when mouse was near it could have happened only over his dead body but there was no sign of him that could mean a lot of things at worst it meant that he had been utterly disintegrated by whatever had come for the women not only was that assumption depressing as hell it also didnt get me anywhere a bad guy who could simply disintegrate anything that got in the way sure wouldnt be pussyfooting around the way these white court yahoos had been mouse wasnt here there was no mess no sign of a struggle and believe you me that dog can put up a struggle as the vets found out when they misfiled his paperwork they tried to neuter him instead of vaccinating him and getting his shoulder xrayed where hed bounced off of a moving minivan i was lucky they were willing to let me pay the property damage and leave it at that it had to mean something else maybe my dog had left with the others and anna had remained behind or gone back for something she forgot or maybe mouse had played on everyones expectation that he was just a dog hed shown me that he was capable of that kind of subterfuge before and it had been one of the first things that tipped me off to his distinctly superiortocanine intellect what if mouse had played along and stayed close to the others why would he do that though because mouse knew i could find him unless the bad guys carried him off to the nevernever itself or put him behind a set of wards specifically designed to block such magic my tracking spell could find him anywhere that was the path to take even if mouse didnt know anything was wrong he would have stayed with any members of the ordo that he could and i had taken to planning ahead a little more than i used to do i could use my shield bracelet to target the single small shield charm id hung from his collar for just such an emergency me and foghorn leghorn can you find the dog elaine asked yeah but we should try calling their homes before we go elaine frowned you told them to stay here or somewhere public odds are pretty good that theyre scared and when youre scared you want to go home elaine finished if theyre there itll be the quickest way to get in touch if not it hasnt cost us more than a minute or two elaine nodded anna had all the numbers in a notebook in her purse we turned up the purse after a brief search but the notebook wasnt in it there wasnt anything for it but to make sure that anna hadnt slipped it into a pocket before she died i checked and tried not to leave any prints almost as hard as i tried not to look at her dead purpling face or glazed eyes it hadnt been a clean death and even though anna hadnt been gone long enough to start decomposition the smell was formidable i tried to ignore it it was harder to ignore her face the skin had the stiff waxy look that dead bodies get worse there was a distinct and unquantifiable quality of absence anna ash had been very much alivefierce of will protective determined i know plenty of wizards without the force of personality she had shed been the one thinking and acting when all of those around her were frightened that takes a rare kind of courage none of which meant anything since despite my efforts the killer had taken her anyway i shook my head and stepped away from the corpse having turned up no notebook her willingness to face danger on behalf of her friends couldnt be allowed to vanish silently into the past if some of those she sought to protect were still alive then her own sacrifice and death could still mean something i could be bitter about her death later i would be doing a grave disservice to the woman if i let it do anything but make me more motivated to stop the killers before they had finished their work i came facetoface with elaine who stood in the doorway staring at annas body there was no expression on her face absolutely none tears though had reddened her eyes and streaked over her cheeks and down her nose some women are pretty when they cry elaine gets all blotchy and runnynosed and it brought out the dark tired circles beneath her eyes it didnt look pretty it just looked like pain she spoke and her voice came out rough and quavering i told her i would protect her sometimes you try i said quietly sometimes thats all you do try thats how the game works game she said the single word was caustic enough to melt holes in the floor has it ever happened to you someone who came to you for help was killed i nodded couple of times first time was kim delaney a girl i had trained to keep her talent under control maybe a little stronger than the women in the ordo but not much she got involved in bad business over her head i thought i could warn her off that she would listen to me i should have known better what happened i tilted my head back at the body behind me without actually looking something ate her i go to her grave sometimes why to bring her some flowers and sweep off the leaves to remind me of the stakes i play for to remind me that nobody wins them all and after elaine asked me quietly she hadnt looked away from the corpse not for a second what did you do to the thing that killed her it was a complicated answer but it wasnt what elaine needed to hear right then i killed it she nodded again when we catch up to the skavis i want it i put a hand on her shoulder and said very gently it wont make you feel any better she shook her head thats not why i want to do it it was my job ive got to finish my job i owe her that much i didnt think elaine herself thought the statement was untrue but id gone through this kind of thing before and it can unbalance your tires pretty damned quick there was no point though in trying to discuss it with her rationally reason had left the building youll get him i said quietly ill help she let out one little broken cawing sob and pressed against my chest i held her warm and slender and felt the terrible remorse and frustration and grief that coursed through her i pressed my presence against her and tightened my arms around her and felt her body shaking with silent sobs more than anything at that moment i wished i could make her torment go away i couldnt being a wizard gives you more power than most but it doesnt change your heart were all human were all of us equally naked before the jaws of pain chapter twentysix not a full minute later i could feel elaine beginning the struggle to get her breathing under control dumornes methods of teaching us to discipline our emotions had not been gentle but they worked before another minute went by elaines breathing had steadied and she leaned her head against my collarbone for a moment a silent gesture of gratitude then she straightened and i lowered my arms she bowed her head toward annas corpse an almost formal gesture of respect or farewell when she turned around i was waiting for her with a damp cool washcloth i said quietly hold still and gently wiped her face clean you have to uphold the gumshoe image cant go out blotchy people will think were not hardboiled very important to be hardboiled she watched me as i cleaned her face and talked and her eyes looked huge a very small smile touched them through the sadness im glad youre here to tell me these things she said her voice steady again before it slipped into a bourbontainted lockjawed humphrey bogart impersonation now stop flapping your gums and start walking my tracking spell led us to an apartment building this is abbys building elaine said as i pulled over the only close place to park was in front of a hydrant i doubted any industrious civil servants would be handing out tickets this late but even if they were it would be cheap compared to what a long walk in the dark could cost me which apartment i asked ninth floor elaine replied she shut the door of the beetle a little harder than she had to it occurs to me i said that if i was a bad guy and wanted to off a couple of intrepid hardboiled wizards i might be hanging around watching someplace like this it occurs to me elaine said her voice crisp that he would be exceptionally foolish to make the attempt we walked together quickly elaine was tall enough to keep up with me without taking the occasional skipping step shed slipped half a dozen coppery bracelets over each wrist all of them slender all of them hanging more heavily than they should have faint glints of golden energy played among them and looked like little more than the glitter of light on metalexcept that you could see them better when the bracelets were in deep shadows by silent agreement we skipped the elevators i had my shield bracelet ready to go and my staff was quivering with leashed energy that made it wave and wobble incongruously to its weight and motion as i moved that much readied magic could have unfortunate consequences on electrical equipment like elevator control panels the doors to the stairs opened only from the other side but i conjured a quick spell to shove against the pressure bar on the far side using my staff and it swung open we slipped into the stairway anyone waiting for us above would be watching the elevator first anyone chasing after us would have a hard time with the locked doors and would make noise on the open concrete stairs i checked my gun with my left hand safe in the pocket of my duster magic is groovy but when it comes to dealing out death regular mortal knowhow can be just as impressive nine floors up was enough to make me breathe hard though not as hard as i once would have a faint ghost of a headache came along with the elevated heart rate hells bells i must have been hurt a lot worse than i thought back at the harbor elaine looked a little strained herself if shed really smoothed away that much of an injury she had more skill than shed told me she did that kind of healing isnt a matter of trivial effort either she might be more fragile than she appeared i opened the fire door on abbys floor and let elaine take the lead she went down the center of the hallway in total silence her hands slightly outstretched and i got the sense that she was somehow perfectly aware of everything around hermore so than human senses would account for the bracelets on her wrists glittered more brightly superior awareness as a defense then instead of my own more direct approach of meeting power with power and stopping things cold just her style but neither hyperawareness nor irresistible force was called for elaine reached a door and raised a hand to knock just before it fell the door opened and a strainedlooking abby gave us a quick nod good a little early thats good come in yes come in i started forward but elaine held up one hand to halt me her eyes distracted let me check another woman inside two dogs she glanced at me and lowered her hand one of them is your dog mouse i called the floor shook a little and the big dark grey dog nudged rather delicately past abby and came to greet me shoving his head into my stomach until i went down on one knee and got a sloppy kiss or two on the face i slapped his shoulders roughly a few times because im supremely manly and did not tear up a little to see that he was all right and still attached to his collar good to see you too furface toto trotted out behind mouse like a tiny tugboat escorting an enormous barge and gave a suspicious growl then he pattered over to me and sniffed me sneezed several times and evidently found me acceptable underneath the smell of lake water he hurried back over to abby gave me one more growl to make sure id learned my lesson and bounced around her feet until she picked him up the plump little blonde settled the dog in her arms and faced me with concern what happened i mean the two of you left and what happened where did you go is olivia lets go inside i said rising i traded a look with elaine and we all went into abbys apartment mouse never left actual physical contact with me his shoulders pressing steadily lightly against my leg i was the last through the door and closed it behind me abbys place was a modest hectic little apartment segregated into neatly compartmentalized areas she had a desk with a typewriter a table with an old sewing machine a chair beside a music stand with a violin unless maybe it was a viola resting on it a reading niche with an armchair and overloaded shelves of romance novels and what looked something like a shrine dedicated to ancestor worship only in reverse where the saints were all children with round cheeks and blond ringlets priscilla was there seated in the comfortable chair in the reading niche looking haggard and much subdued there was a cup of tea sitting on the little table beside the reading chair but it had apparently gone cold without ever having been touched she looked up at me her eyes heavy and dull olivias all right i said quietly abby brightened a second before i started speaking drawing in a sharp little breath the little dog in her arms caught her mood at once and began wagging his tail at me yes a sometime associate of mine the man in the pictures has been taking women who were in danger of being a target of the killers out of the city he learned olivia was in danger and urged her to leave with him when he took several women to a safe house priscilla stared at me hard for a long moment then she said what else elaine spoke her voice quiet and unflinching annas dead back at the hotel room an apparent suicide abby let out a little gagging sound she sat down very quickly in the chair by the violin toto let out small distressed sounds whwhat abby asked priscilla shuddered and bowed her head oh oh no oh anna i need to know ladies i said quietly why didnt you do as we instructed why did you leave the hotel it abby began tears overflowed her cheeks it was was she said priscilla said in a quiet dull voice said that she had to leave that she had to go to work son of a bitch i knew it elaine was half a beat behind me who hhelen abby sobbed it was helen chapter twentyseven i stood there fuming while elaine coaxed the rest of the story out of abby and priscilla it was only an hour or so after you left abby told elaine helen got a call on her cell phone cell phone i perked up she had one that worked she doesnt have a lot of talent that way abby said none of us do really even my cell phone works most of the time i grunted means she wasnt hiding a bigger talent then thats worth something harry elaine said quietly it was a rebuke please go on abby i zipped my mouth shut she got a call and she went into the bathroom to talk i couldnt hear what she said but when she came out she said she had to go to work that she was leaving i lifted my eyebrows thats quite a job if shes risking exposure to a killer to show up for the shift thats what i said priscilla said her voice even more bitter if such a thing was possible it was stupid i never even thought to be suspicious of it anna argued with her abby went on but helen refused to stay so anna wanted us all to take her there together helen wouldnt have any of it of course priscilla said at the time i thought she might just be ashamed of us seeing her working some nothing little job at a fastfood restaurant or something we never really knew what she did abby said her tone numb and apologetic she never wanted to talk about it we always assumed it was an issue of pride she petted the little dog in her arms idly she said something about keeping us separate from the rest of her life in any case anna put her into a cab and made her promise to keep in touch with us calling in on the phone until she was safely around other people you just let her walk i broke in shes a sister of the ordo priscilla said not a criminal to be distrusted and watched in point of fact i said she is a criminal to be distrusted and watched ask her freaking parole officer elaine frowned at me dammit harry this isnt helping i muttered under my breath folded my arms again and crouched down to give mouses ears and neck a good scratching maybe it would help me keep my mouth shut theres a first time for everything helen called me about twenty minutes later priscilla said she said that she had been followed from the hotel that our location had become known that we had to leave we did just as you told us helen said that she would meet us here i told you to head for somewhere public i began snarling harry elaine said her voice sharp i subsided again there was a moment of awkward silence um so we went abby said but when we got there helen wasnt around no priscilla said hugging her arms under her breasts looking cold and miserable even in the turtleneck she called again begged us to come to her apartment i stayed here with the dogs abby said toto looked up at her as she said it tilting his head and wagging his little tail once anna and i picked her up priscilla continued we headed back herebut helen looked awful shed run out of insulin and hadnt been able to go get it with all the trouble anna dropped me off and took her to the pharmacy that was the last we saw of her abby fretted her lip and said to priscilla it wasnt your fault priscilla shrugged shed never said anything about diabetes before i should have known better i should have seen not your fault abby insisted compassion in her voice we believed in her we all did but she was pulling our strings the whole time the killer was right here among us she shook her head we should have listened to you warden dresden we should have priscilla said quietly if we had anna would be alive right now i couldnt think of any response to that well i had plenty of them but they all were some variation on a theme of i told you so i felt no need to pour salt into fresh wounds so i kept my mouth shut besides i was processing what abby and priscilla had told us elaine traded a look with me do you think helen is the skavis weve heard about i shrugged i doubt it but technically its possible white court vamps can pass for human easily if they want then why doubt it because that little creep madrigal called the skavis he i said helen isnt a he a shill elaine asked looks like abby looked back and forth between us eexcuse me but what is a shill someone who works with a criminal while pretending to have nothing to do with him i said he helps the bad guy while pretending to be your buddy and making suggestions suggesting that you leave a safe hiding place and split up the group for example silence toto let out a quiet distressed whine i cant believe this priscilla said pressing her fingertips against her cheekbones and closing her eyes but weve known her for years abby said her expression as unhappy and confused as a lost childs how could she lie to us like that for so long i winced i dont like seeing anyone in pain but its worse when a woman is suffering thats probably chauvinistic of me and i dont give a damn if it is all right i said weve still got a lot more questions than answers but at least we know where to start the barbecue elaine nodded get these two to safety then track down helen safety i said thomas yes i glanced at abby and priscilla ladies were leaving where priscilla asked i had expected a protest or sneering sarcasm or at least pure contrary bitchiness her voice though was quietly frightened where are we going to olivia i told her and five or six of the other women my associate is protecting do they need anything abby asked they have several kids with them i said mostly toddlers ill pack some food and cereal abby said before id even finished talking priscilla just sat sunken in her chair and hunched in on herself abby dumped half of her cupboard into a great big suitcase with those skatewheel rollers on the bottom zipped it shut and clipped what looked like a little plastic birdcage onto the suitcase she gestured at toto and the little dog jumped up into the birdcage turned around three times and lay down with a happy little doggy smile very well abby said mouse looked at toto then he looked at me youve got to be kidding i told him id have to clip a railroad car to the suitcase and hire the hulk to move it around youre young and healthy you walk mouse looked at totos regal doggy palanquin and sighed then he took point as we went back down to the car which had been ticketed despite the lateness of the hour i stuck the ticket in my pocket think positive harry at least they didnt tow it getting everyone into the beetle was an adventure but we managed it and returned to the shabby little southside motel maybe twenty seconds after we parked murphys harleydavidson motorcycle rumbled out of an alley across the street where she must have been keeping an eye on the front of the motel from a spot where she could see the windows and doors to both rooms thomas had rented she was wearing jeans a black tank top and a loose black mans shirt that had the sleeves rolled up about twenty times and draped over her like a trench coat while it hid the shoulder rig that held a glock in one holster a sig in the other her hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail and the badge she usually wore on a chain around her neck in these sorts of situations was conspicuous by its absence she waited with a slightly bemused air while everyone scrambled out of the beetle elaine got them moving toward the rooms hurrying to get them out of sight no clown car jokes i told murphy not one i wasnt going to say anything murphy said jesus harry what happened to you you heard anything about the harbor today oh murphy said mouse came over to greet her and she shook hands with him gravely thomas wasnt really forthcoming with explanations he lit out of here in a hurry he was hungry i said murphy frowned yeah so he said is he going to hurt anyone i considered and then shook my head ordinarily id say he wouldnt now im not sure it would really go against his character to do something like that but hes been acting out of character through this whole mess murphy folded her arms mess is right you want to tell me whats going on i gave murphy the short version of what wed learned since id seen her last jesus mary and joseph murphy said then it was beckitt looks like she was shilling for the skavis whoever he is and grey cloak and that wussy cousin of thomass added in a few killings of their own to get my attention that isnt exactly in the best interests of the skavis if he was trying to avoid it i know so so theyre all vampires right murphy shrugged i figured theyd be working together theyre white court they live for backstabbing they like doing it through catspaws they probably figured i would find out about the killings move in and wipe out the skavis for them then theyd congratulate themselves on how clever they were murphy nodded so now that youve got your clients safely tucked away what comes next more wiping out than they counted on i said im going to find beckitt and ask her nicely not to kill anyone else and to point me to the skavis then ill have a polite conversation with him then ill settle up with grey cloak and passenger madrigal how do you find beckitt um i said im sure ill figure out something this entire mess is still way too nebulous for me yeah murphy said all these killings it still doesnt make any sense it makes sense i said we just dont know how yet i grimaced were missing something maybe not murphy said i arched an eyebrow at her remember our odd corpse out jessica blanche i said the one molly saw right murphy said i found out more about her she some kind of cultist or something or something murphy said according to a friend in vice she was an employee of the velvet room the velvet room i thought i burned that placuh that is i thought some asyetunidentified perpetrator burned that place to the ground its reopened murphy said under new management click now some pieces were falling into place marcone i asked marcone gentleman johnnie marcone was the biggest scariest gangster in a city famous for its gangsters once the old famiglias had fallen to internal bickering marcone had done an impression of alexander the great and carved out one of the largest criminal empires in the worldassuming you didnt count governments chicagos violent crime rate had dropped as much because of marcones draconian rule of the citys rackets as because of the dedication of the citys police force the criminal economy had more than doubled and marcones power continued to steadily grow he was a smart tough dangerous manand he was absolutely fearless that is a deadly combination and i avoided crossing paths with him whenever i could the way things were shaping up though this time i couldnt you happen to know where the new velvet room is i asked murphy she gave me a look right right sorry i blew out a breath seems like it might be a good idea to speak to some of the girls coworkers ill bet theyll be willing to do a little talking to avoid trouble with the law she showed me her teeth in a fierce grin they just might and if not marcone might be willing to talk to you marcone doesnt like me i said and its mutual marcone doesnt like anybody murphy replied but he respects you like that says much for me murphy shrugged maybe maybe not marcones scum but hes no fool and he does what he says hell do ill talk to elaine once shes got everyone settled i said get her to stay here with mouse and keep an eye on things murphy nodded elaine huh the ex yeah the one working against you last time she was in town yeah you trust her i looked down at murphy for a minute then up at the hotel room i want to she exhaled slowly i have a feeling things are going to get hairy you need someone whos got your back got that i said holding up my fist you murphy rapped her knuckles gently against mine and snorted youre going syrupy on me dredsen if it rains ill melt i agreed its to be expected she said what with how youre gay and all now im wh i blinked oh thomass apartment hells bells you cops got a fast grapevine yeah rawlins heard it at the coffee machine and he just had to call me up and tell me all about you and your boyfriend being in a fight he asked me if he should get you the sound track to les miserables or phantom of the opera for christmas this year varetti and farrel got a deal on track lighting from malones brotherinlaw dont you people have lives i said at her continued smile i asked warily what are you getting me she grinned blue eyes sparkling stallings and i found an autographed picture of julie newmar on ebay you guys are never going to let go of this one are you i sighed were cops murphy said of course not we shared a smile that faded a moment later both of us turned to watch the street alert for any unwanted company we were silent for a while cars went by city sounds of engine and horn a car alarm a block over dark shadows where the streetlights didnt touch distant sirens rotating attentiongetting spotlights lancing up to the dark summer night from the front of a theater hells bells i said after a time marcone yeah murphy said it changes things marcone was involved matters had just become a great deal more dangerous chapter twentyeight the new velvet room looked nothing like the old velvet room a health club i asked murphy youve got to be kidding me murphy goosed her harley right up next to the beetle there had been only one parking space open but there was room for both of our rides in it more or less it wasnt like i was worried about collecting a few more dents and dings in addition to the dozens already there its progressive murphy said you can get in shape generate testosterone and find an outlet for it all under one roof i shook my head a modest sign on the second floor over a row of smaller shops proclaimed executive priority health it lacked the wideopen welllit windows of most health clubs and apparently occupied the whole of the second floor wait a minute i said isnt that the hotel where tommy tomm got murdered mmmm murphy said nodding the madison a corporation that has absolutely no visible connection to john marcone recently bought it and is renovating it you have to admit it was a little overdone i said it looked like the set of a burlesque show about an opium lords harem murphy said and now it is one i said but it wont look like it murphy said they call that progress i said think this bunch will give us any trouble theyll be polite marcone is the kind of guy who apologizes for the necessity just before his minions put a bullet in you murphy nodded shed rearranged her gun rig and put on a kevlar vest before we left the baggy mans shirt was now buttoned up over it like i said polite seriously i said think anything will start up depends how big a beehive were about to kick she replied i blew out a breath right lets find out we went inside the doors opened onto a foyer which was closed away from what had been the hotels lobby by a security door and a panel of buzzers the buzzers on the lowest row were labeled with the names of the shops on the first floor none of the others were marked murphy flipped open her notepad checked a page and then punched a button in the middle of the top row she held it down for a moment then released it executive priority said a young womans voice through a speaker beside the panel this is bonnie how may i help you id like to speak with your manager please murphy said im very sorry maam came the reply the management is only in the office during normal business hours but i would be happy to leave a message for you no murphy replied calmly i know that ms demeter is in i will speak to her please im very sorry maam came bonnies rather prim reply but you are not a member of the club and you are on private property i must ask you to leave immediately or i will inform building security of the problem and call the authorities well that should be fun i said go ahead and call the cops murphy snorted im sure theyd love to have an excuse to come stomping around i bonnie said floundering clearly she hadnt been trained to deal with this kind of response or maybe she just wasnt all that bright to begin with i made a kind of doyoumind gesture at murphy she shook her head and leaned to one side so i could get closer to the intercom look bonnie i said we arent here for trouble we just need to talk to your boss if she likes she can come talk over the intercom otherwise i will come up there and talk to her in person theres only one relevant issue here would you rather be reasonable and polite or would you rather replace a bunch of doors walls and goons um well just go tell your boss bonnie its not your fault that we didnt fall for the businesshoursonly line let her decide what to do so you dont get in any trouble after a slight pause bonnie realized the professional value in passing the buck very well sir may i ask who this is im with sergeant karrin murphy chicago pd i said my name is harry dresden oh bonnie said oh mister dresden please excuse me i didnt know it was you sir i blinked at the intercom youre the last of our platinum club members to pay a visit sir by all means sir please accept my apologies ill have someone meet you and your guest at the elevator with your membership packet ill notify ms demeter at once the door buzzed clicked and opened murphy gave me a steady look whats that all about dont ask me i told her im gay now we went in the first floor of the building looked like a miniature shopping mall its walls completely lined with small shops that sold computer parts books video games candles bath stuff jewelry and clothes in a number of styles all the shops were closed their steel curtains drawn down a row of small lights on either side of a strip of red carpet came to life illuminating the way to the main bank of elevators one of the elevators stood open and waiting we got in and i hit the button for the second floor it began moving at once if there is a welcoming committee from the lollipop guild waiting for us when these doors open im leaving this is surreal i noticed that too murphy said ms demeter i said think its a pseudonym one corner of murphys mouth quirked up i think well find all kinds of nongenuine modifications around here the elevator stopped and the door opened three women were waiting outside of it they were all dressed in well workout clothes wasnt quite accurate their outfits looked something like the ones the waitresses at hooters wear only tight none of them could have been much over drinking age and all of them had clearly passed some kind of intense qualification process certifying them to wear outfits like that they were pretty too a blonde a brunette and a redhead and they had nice smiles welcome sir the redhead said may i take your coat and and stick thats the closest ive come to being propositioned in years i sighed but no ill hang onto them for now very good sir the blonde held a round silver tray with two fluted glasses of orangey liquid she beamed at us the reflection of light from her teeth could have left scars on my retinas mimosa sir maam murphy stared at all three of them with a blank expression then without a word she took one of the drinks tossed it off and put the glass back on the tray with a dark mutter none for me i said im driving the blonde stepped back and the brunettewhose shirt bore a stencil of the word bonnie came forward carrying a customized black leather gym bag that probably cost as much as murphys kevlar vest bonnie handed me the bag and then offered me a manila folder and a big mustardcolored envelope these are complimentary of course sir for all of our platinum members there are several outfits for exercise on the inside a set of athletic shoes in your size a pda to help you track your progress and some basic toiletries she tapped the envelope here is a copy of your membership papers as well as your membership card and your security access code if this was a trap it was working i tried to juggle all of my gear and the comp items too if i suddenly had to walk anywhere while doing it id probably trip and break my neck uh i said thank you bonnie of course sir she chirped if you would please come with me ill show you to ms demeters office that would be lovely i said the bag had a strap on it i managed to get it over one shoulder then folded the paperwork and stuffed it into one of my coats roomy pockets bonnie waited for me to get settled before taking my arm in a perfectly confident and familiar fashion and guiding me forward she smelled nice something like honeysuckle and she had a friendly smile on her mouth her hands though felt cold and nervous guided by bonnie and her clammy hands we walked through the building past a long open space filled with various exercise machines weights wealthylooking men and attractive young women bonnie started prattling about how new the machines were and how the latest techniques and theories in fitness training were in use and how platinum club members would each have their own personal fitness trainer assigned to them each and every visit and of course our inhouse spa offers any number of other services ah i said like massages mud baths pedicures that kind of thing yes sir and sex bonnies smile didnt falter for a second although it looked a little incongruous with her wary sideways glance at murphy she didnt answer the question she stopped at an open doorway here we are she said smiling if there is anything i can do for you just pick up the phone on ms demeters desk and ill answer right away thanks bonnie i said you are welcome sir do you need a tip or anything unnecessary sir she gave me another smile and a nod and hurried away i watched her go down the hall lips pursed thoughtfully and decided that bonnie was eminently qualified to hurry away we get left all alone here i asked murphy does this smell like a trap to you theres one hell of a lot of bait she replied glancing around and then into the office but the fire stairs are right across the hall and theres a fire escape just outside the office window to say nothing of the fact that there are a dozen customers within a few yards who could hardly help but notice anything noisy yeah but how many of them do you think would testify in court about what they heard or saw while they were at a ritzy brothel murphy shook her head rawlins knows im here if anything happens theyll turn the place inside out marcone knows that how come you all havent done it already i mean this is illegal right sure it is murphy said and very tidy in operations like this one the women involved are generally willing employees and generally very well paid theyre required to have regular medical examinations theres a low incidence of drug use and almost never any attempts to control them through addiction or terror victimless crime murphy shrugged cops never have as many resources as they need in general they dont waste them on an operation like this one vice personnel are needed badly in plenty of other places where there is a lot more at stake i grunted the fact that its obviously a club for the stupidly wealthy doesnt make it any easier to bring the hammer down no it doesnt murphy said too many people with too much influence in the city government have their reputations to protect the place makes money hand over fist and as long as they dont flaunt their business cops tolerate whats going on except for the occasional token gesture marcone isnt going to jeopardize that by killing us here when he can just as easily have it done tomorrow in a less incriminating location depending on the size of the beehive i said depending on that murphy agreed we might as well sit down we went into the office it looked like any number of executive offices id seen before somber understated and expensive we sat down in comfortable leather chairs murphy kept an eye on the doorway i watched the window we waited twenty minutes later footsteps approached a large man came through the door he was built like a bulldozer made out of slabs of raw workingman muscle thick bones and heavy sinews he had a neck as thick as murphys waist short red hair and beady eyes under a heavy brow his expression looked like it had been permanently locked into place a few seconds after someone had kicked his puppy through a plateglass window hendricks i greeted marcones primary enforcer with convivial cheer sup beady eyes settled on me for a second hendricks made a growling sound in his throat checked the rest of the room and said over his shoulder clear marcone came in he wore a gunmetal grey armani suit with italian leather shoes and his shirt was open one button at the throat he was an inch or two above average height and had looked like an extremely fit fortyyearold ever since i had known him his haircut was perfect his grooming immaculate and his eyes were the color of worn dollar bills he nodded pleasantly and walked around the large mahogany desk to sit down wow i said ms demeter you look almost exactly like this criminal scumbag i met once marcone rested his elbows on the desk made a steeple out of his fingers and regarded me with a cool and unruffled smile and good evening to you too mister dresden its somehow reassuring to see that time has not eroded your sophomoric sensibilities his eyes flicked to murphy sergeant murphy pressed her lips together and nodded once her eyes narrowed hendricks loomed in the doorway arms folded eyes steady on murphy wheres amazon gard i asked him you lose the consultant ms gard he said emphasizing the ms is on assignment elsewhere at the moment and our working relationship is quite secure and maybe she wouldnt much care for this particular branch of your business i suggested he showed me his teeth i see you got your membership package im fighting not to gush at you with gratitude i told him but its oh so hard his upturned mouth and glittering white teeth did not resemble a smile actually all of my places of business have instructions to so treat you should you arrive i raised my eyebrows you cant seriously be trying to buy me hardly i am under no illusions about your fondness for myself and my business i regard it as a preventive measure in my judgment my buildings are considerably less likely to burn to the ground during one of your visits if you are disoriented from being treated like a sultan i do after all recall the fate of the last velvet room murphy snorted without taking her wary eyes from marcone hes got a point dresden that was one time i muttered something in one of the envelopes dug at me through my duster pocket and i reached down to take it out hendricks may have been big but he was not slow he had a gun out before my fingers had closed on the envelope murphy went for her gun hand darting beneath the baggy shirt marcones voice cracked like a whip stop everyone we all did it a reflexive response to the complete authority in his tone there are reasons marcone runs things in chicago marcone hadnt moved hell he hadnt blinked mister hendricks he said i appreciate your zeal but if the wizard wished to harm me hed hardly need to draw a concealed weapon to do it if you please hendricks let out another rumbling growl and put the gun away thank you marcone turned to me i trust you will forgive mister hendrickss sensitivity as my bodyguard he is all too aware that whenever you get involved in my business dresden matters tend to become a great deal more dangerous i scowled at them both and drew the folded materials from my duster pocket tossing them down beside the discarded gym bag no harm no foul right murph murphy remained motionless for a long moment hand under her shirtlong enough to make a point that no one was ordering her to do it then she returned her hand to her lap thank you marcone said now shall we tilt at one another a few more times or just skip to the point of your visit dresden i want information about one of the women who worked here marcone blinked once and said go on her name was jessica blanche her body was found a few days ago the me couldnt find a cause of death i did ive got more bodies i think the killings are related i need to find the link between jessica and the other victims so i can figure out what the hell is going on and put a stop to it that information is specific marcone said my knowledge of operations here is merely general my manager will be more familiar with such things than i ms demeter i take it yes she should be here momentarily or sooner said a womans voice i turned to the doorway a woman walked through it dressed in a somber black skirt suit a white blouse black pumps pearls she walked calmly across the office to stand behind marcone her left hand coming to rest on his right shoulder well dresden helen beckitt murmured it took you long enough chapter twentynine i stared momentarily silent marcones teeth showed again i dont believe it is polite to gloat helen murmured to him if you knew the man you would realize what a rare moment this is he replied im savoring it murphy glanced from helen to me and back harry shhh i said holding up a hand i closed my eyes for a second chasing furiously down dozens of twisty lanes of demented logic and motivation trying to fit each of them to the facts the facts man just the facts fact one male operatives of house skavis and house malvora had been engaging in murders that attempted to frame the wardens as the perpetrators fact two house raith their nominal superior led by the white king sort of had pursued a policy of armistice with the white council fact three that dippy twit madrigal jumped into the deal on malvoras side pitching in a murder or two of his own evidently to attract my attention fact four thomas though aware of the lethal intentions of his fellow white court vampires had shared nothing of it with me fact five the victims had been women of magical talent universally fact six vampires live for a long long time fact seven in a whole graveyard full of the corpses of minorleague practitioners one normal pretty young girl named jessica blanche had been killed her only connection to the others was helen beckitt fact eight helen beckitt worked for marcone fact nine i dont like marcone i dont trust him i dont believe him any further than i can kick him ive never hidden the fact marcone knows it son of a bitch i whispered shaking my head things went from bad to worse when marcone showed up and i naturally figured that the dangerometer had peaked i was wrong really really wrong i needed one question answered to be sure what was going on even though i was fairly sure what the answer would bethe only problem was figuring out whether or not the answer would be an honest one i could not afford to get it wrong helen i said quietly if its all right with you id like to speak to you alone a small smile graced her mouth she took a deep breath and let it out with a slow satisfied exhalation you neednt if you do not wish to do so marcone said i do not react well when others threaten or harm my employees dresden is aware of that no helen said its all right i glanced aside murph she didnt look overjoyed but she nodded once and said ill be right outside thanks murphy departed under hendrickss beady gaze marcone rose as well and left without glancing at me hendricks went last shutting the door behind him helen ran a fingertip lightly over the pearls on her necklace and settled into the chair behind the desk she looked quite comfortable and confident there very well i took a seat in one of the chairs facing the desk and shook my head jessica blanche worked for you i said jessie helens dead eyes flickered momentarily down to her folded hands yes she lived near me actually i gave her a ride to work several days each week which must have been when madrigal had seen them togetherout in public presumably not in their professional clothes and the moron had just assumed that miss blanche was another member of the ordo from there it wouldnt have been hard for him to ease up to the girl snare her with the incubus comehither and take her off to a hotel room for a little fun and an ecstatic death you and marcone i said thats one i cant figure i thought you hated him hell you were trafficking with the powers of darkness helping to create an addictive drughelping the shadowman kill people to get back at him hate she said and love are not so very different things both are focused upon another both are intense both are passionate and theres not much difference between kiss and kill if you only look at the letters i shrugged but here you are working for marcone as a madam i am a convicted felon mister dresden she replied i used to handle accounts with a total value in the hundreds of millions of dollars i was ill suited to work as a waitress in a diner nickel in the pen didnt do much for your resume huh or references she replied she shook her head my reasons for being here are none of your business dresden and have nothing to do with the matter at hand ask your questions or get out after you parted company with the other members of the ordo tonight i said did you place a phone call to them again she said quietly we are at an impasse exactly as we were before it doesnt matter what i say given that you are clearly unwilling to believe me did you call them i asked she stared steadily her eyes so dull and empty that it made her elegant black outfit look like funerary wear i couldnt tell if it would be more suitable for mournersor for the deceased then her eyes narrowed and she nodded ah you want me to look you in the eyes the term is overdramatic but i believe it is referred to as a soulgaze yeah i said i hadnt realized it was a truth detector it isnt i said but it will tell me what sort of person you are i know what sort of person i am she replied i am a functional borderline psychopath i am heartless calculating empty and can muster very little in the way of empathy for my fellow human beings but then you cant take my word for it can you i just looked at her for a moment no i said then very quietly i dont think i can i have no intention of proving anything to you i will submit to no such invasion even if it means more of your friends in the ordo die there was the slightest hesitation before she answered i have been unable to protect them thus far despite all she trailed off and shook her head once confidence returned to her features and voice anna will watch over them i stared at her for a second and she regarded me coolly focused on a spot a bit over my eyebrows avoiding direct eye contact annas important to you i asked as much as anyone can be now she replied she was kind to me when she had no cause to be nothing to gain from it she is a worthy person i watched her closely ive done a lot of work as both a professional wizard and a professional investigator wizardry is awfully intriguing and useful but it doesnt necessarily teach you very much about other people its better at teaching you about yourself the investigating business though is all about people its all about talking to them asking questions and listening to them lie most of the things investigators get hired to handle involve a lot of people lying ive seen liars in every shape and size and style big lies little lies white lies stupid lies the worst lies are almost always silenceor else truth tainted with just enough deception to rot it to the core helen wasnt lying to me she might have been dangerous might have been willing to practice black magic to seek vengeance in the past might have been cold and distantbut she had not for one second tried to conceal any of it or denied anything that had happened oh god i said quietly you dont know she frowned at me for a momentthen her face became drawn and pale oh she closed her eyes and said oh anna you poor fool she opened them again a moment later she cleared her throat and asked when a few hours ago the hotel room suicide the others safe hidden and under guard i took a deep breath i have to be sure helen if you really do give a damn about them youll cooperate with me youll help me she nodded once her eyes distant then she said for them and met my eyes the phenomenon referred to as a soulgaze is a fairly mysterious thing no ones ever been able to get a really good grasp on exactly how it works the best descriptions of it have always been more poetical than anything else the eyes are the windows of the soul lock eyes with a wizard and the essence of who and what you are is laid bare it is perceived in different ways by every individual ramirez had once told me that he heard it as a kind of musical theme that accompanied the person he was gazing upon others looked on a soul in a series of frozen images my interpretation of a soulgaze was perhaps inevitably one of the most random and confusing id ever heard about i see the other person in symbol and metaphor sometimes in panorama and surround sound sometimes in misty translucence and haunting whispers whoever was gazed upon got a good look back whatever universal powers governed that kind of thing evidently decided that the souls windows dont come in an optional issue of oneway mirrored glass you saw them they saw you with the same kind of searing permanence for me meeting someones eyes is always risky every human being on earth knows what im talking about try it walk up to someone without speaking and look them in the eyes theres a certain amount of leeway for a second or two or three and then theres a distinct sensation of sudden contact of intimacy thats when regular folks normally cough and look away wizards though get the full ride of a soulgaze all things considered i shouldnt have been surprised that when helen met my eyes it got uncomfortably intimate before a second had passed and and i stood in chicago in one of the parks on lake michigan calumet maybe i couldnt see the skyline from where i was standing so it was hard to be sure what i could see was the beckitt family husband wife daughter a little girl maybe ten or eleven years old she looked like her mothera woman with smile lines at the corners of her eyes and a whitetoothed smile who very little resembled the helen beckitt i knew but all the same it was her theyd been on a family picnic the sun was setting on a summer evening golden sunset giving way to twilight as they walked back to the family car mother and father swung the little girl between them each holding one hand i didnt want to see what was about to happen i didnt have a choice in the matter a parking lot the sounds of a car roaring up muffled curses tight with fear and then a car swerved up off the road and gunfire roared from its passenger window screams some people threw themselves down most including the beckitts stared in shock more loud hammering sounds not ten feet away i looked over my shoulder to see a very very younglooking marcone he wasnt wearing a business suit he had on jeans and a black leather jacket his hair was longish a little mussed and he also sported a stubble of beard that gave him the kind of rakish look that would attract attention from the girls who fantasized about indulging with a bad boy his eyes were still greenbut they were the green of a summer hunters blind bright and intelligent and predatory but touched with more something humor maybe more life and he was skinnier not a lot skinnier or anything but it surprised me how much younger it and the other minor changes made him look marcone crouched next to another young man a nowdead thug id christened spike years ago spike had his pistol out and was hammering away at the moving car the barrel of his model colt tracked the vehicleand its course drew its muzzle into line with the beckitt family marcone snarled something and slapped the barrel of the gun away from the family spikes shot rang out wild and splashed into the lake there was a last rattle of fire from the moving car and it roared away marcone and spike piled into their own car and fled the scene spike was driving marcone was staring back over his shoulder they left the little girls broken body limp and spattered with scarlet behind them helen saw it first looking down to the hand that gripped her daughters she let out a cry as she turned to her child in the wake of the gunshots the silence was deafening i didnt want to see what was coming again i had no choice the girl wasnt unconscious there was a lot of blood her father screamed and knelt with helen trying to stop the bleeding he tore off his shirt pressing it to the childs midsection he babbled something to helen and ran for the nearest phone his white shirt soaked through as helen tried to hold it to the weakly struggling girl this was the worst part the child was in pain she cried out with it i expected her to sound horrible and inhuman but she didnt she sounded like every little kid who had ever suddenly found herself faced with her first experience of real nontrivial pain owie she said over and over her voice rough owie owie owie baby helen said the tears were blocking her vision im here im here mommy mommy mommy the girl said owie owie owie the little girl said that she said it over and over she said it for maybe sixty seconds then she went silent no helen said no no no she leaned down and felt her daughters throat then desperately pressed her ear to the girls chest no no no their voices i realized sounded almost identical they blazed with the same anguish the same disbelief i watched helen shatter rocking back and forth trying through blinding tears to apply cpr to the silent little form everything else became an unimportant blur ghostly figures of her husband cops paramedics dim little echoes of sirens and voices a church organ id known that the beckitts set out to tear marcone down out of revenge for what the warring gangsters had done to their daughterbut knowing the story was one thing seeing the soulsearing agony the little girls death had inflicted upon her helpless mother was something else and suddenly everything was bright and new again helen and her family were laughing again in a few moments they were walking again toward the parking lot and i could hear the engine of the car whose gunmen would miss marcone and kill the little girl as it approached i tore my eyes away from it fighting to end the soulgaze i could not go through that again could not remain locked in that horrible moment that had shaped what helen had become i came back to myself standing turned half away from helen leaning heavily on my staff with my head bowed there was a long moment of silence before helen said i didnt call anyone in the ordo dresden she hadnt now i was sure of it if helen hadnt led the ordo on a merry chase around town drawing them out into vulnerability for the skavis hunting them someone else had priscilla shed been the one receiving all the calls reporting all the conversations with helen that meant that shed been working with the killer drawing out anna and the others on his behalf isolating one of the women from the safety of the group so that he could take them alone and then i jerked my head up my eyes wide fact ten in the middle of a chicago summer priscilla none too pretty a woman had been wearing nothing but turtlenecks priscilla hadnt been working with the skavis priscilla was the skavis and i had left her holed up in safety with olivia and abby and all those women and children predators the white court were predators the skavis had to know that i was closing in and that it would not be long before i either caught up to helen and got the real story or else figured it out on my own fightorflight instincts must have come down on the former id been sent after helen on purpose the skavis had meant to send me haring off after her leaving him alone with all those targets no i hadnt left him alone with the women hed been tracking they were no threat to him the skavis had decided to fight he had isolated a target all right just as he had while hunting helpless womenone who would present a deadly danger to him should she ever learn his true identity one who would be distinctly vulnerable provided he could approach her while camouflaged oh god i heard myself say elaine chapter thirty murphy came out of the building about ten seconds after i did thomas answered his phone said he was on the way he sounded kind of out of it though i called both rooms but the call went straight to the hotels voice mail she reported slipping her cell phone away as she approached me does it do that by itself no you have to call the desk and ask for it dammit i said and tossed her my keys the skavis thought of that already drive murphy blinked at me but turned to the beetle at once why im going to try to reach elaine my way i said i hurried around my car to the passenger seat and jerked open the door get us there as fast as you can magic on the road wont that kill the car this car probably not i said i hope not i threw my staff in the backseat ow shrieked a voice murphys gun came out every bit as fast as i raised my blasting rod its tip glowing with a scarlet incandescence dont shoot dont shoot squeaked the voice considerably more panicked there was a flickering and then molly appeared in my backseat legs curled up against her chest her eyes wide her face very pale molly i shouted dammit what do you think youre doing i came to help i was good enough to track down your car wasnt i i told you to stay home because of the stupid bracelet she demanded that has got to be the lamest scam ever yoda never gave anybody a bracelet that i whirled in pure frustration and snarled fuego my raw anxiety and rage lashed from the tip of my blasting rod in a lance of blinding scarlet fire it blasted into a metal trash can in front of marcones building and well it would be bragging to say that it vaporized the trash can even i would have trouble with that it did however slag the thing into a shower of molten metal as it gouged a twofootdeep coffinlength furrow in the concrete of the sidewalk behind it chunks of heated concrete and globs of molten metal hit the buildings exterior cracking several thick panes of glass pocking stone walls and leaving several wooden planters on fire the concussion rattled every window within a hundred yards and shattered the casing of the nearest streetlight so that it cast out fractured illumination half a dozen car alarms went off i turned back to molly and found her staring at me with her mouth open until my shadow cast by the rising fires and crippled streetlight fell across her my voice came out in a growl i am not yoda i stripped the glove off my left hand and held it up my fingers spread it didnt look as horrific as it used to but it was plenty ugly enough to make an impression on a nineteenyearold girl this isnt a goddamn movie molly screw up here and you dont vanish and leave an empty cloak you dont get frozen in carbonite and you should damned well know that by now she looked shocked ill curse from time to time but i dont generally indulge in blasphemyat least not around michael or his family i dont think god is terribly threatened by my occasional slip of the tongue but i owe enough to michael to respect his wishes regarding that particular shade of profanity mostly hell the whole practice of invective was developed to add extra emphasis when the mere meaning of words alone just wasnt enough and i was feeling plenty emphatic snarling i cupped my left hand focused my ongoing anger and a sudden sphere of light and heat blossomed to life it wasnt bigabout the diameter of a dime but it was as bright as a tiny sun harry murphy said her voice was a little shaky we dont have time for this you think youre ready i told molly show me i blew on the sphere and it wafted out of my hand and glided smoothly into the open door of the beetle and toward mollys face whwhat she said stop it i said my voice cold if you can she swallowed and raised a hand i saw her try to control her breathing and focus her will her lips blurring over the steps id taught her the sphere drifted closer better hurry i added i did nothing to hide the anger or the taint of derision in my voice beads of sweat broke out on her skin the sphere slowed but it had not stopped its about twelve hundred degrees i added itll melt sand into glass it doesnt do much for skin either molly lifted her left hand and stammered out a word but her will fluttered and failed amounting to nothing more than a handful of sparks bad guys dont give you this much time i spat molly hissedgive the kid credit she didnt let herself screamand pressed herself as far as she could from the fire she threw up an arm to shield her eyes for a second i felt a mad impulse to let the fire continue for just a second more nothing teaches like a burned hand whispered a darker part of my self i should know but i closed my fingers willed the ending of the spell and the sphere vanished murphy standing across the car just stared at me molly lowered her hand her arm moving in frightened little jerks she sat there shivering and staring her tongue piercing rattled against her teeth i looked at both of them and then shook my head i got control of my rampaging temper then i leaned down and stuck my head in the car looking molly in the eyes we play for keeps kid i said quietly ive told you before magic isnt a solution to every problem you still arent listening mollys eyes frightened and angry filled with tears she turned her head away from me and said nothing she tried not to make any noise but its tough to keep a good poker face when a snarling madman nearly burns it off there wasnt any time to wastebut i gave the kid a few seconds of space while i tried to let my head cool off the door to marcones building opened hendricks came out marcone followed him a moment later he surveyed the damage then he glanced at me marcone shook his head took a cell phone from his suit pocket and went back inside while hendricks kept me pinned down with his beadyeyed scowl what id seen soulgazing helen beckitt was still glaringly fresh in my mindjust as it always would be marcone had looked a lot younger when he wore his hair longer less neat and dressed more casually or maybe hed just looked younger before hed seen helens daughter die the thought went utterly against the pressure of the rage inside me and i grabbed hold of myself while i had the chance i took a deep breath i wouldnt do anyone any good if i charged in full of outrage and absent of brains i took another deep breath and turned to find murphy on the move she walked around the car and faced me squarely all done murphy asked me her voice pitched low you want to smoke a turkey or set fire to a playground or anything you could terrorize a troop of cub scouts as an encore and after that i could tell you all about how to do your job maybe i said right after we bury the people who get killed because were standing here instead of moving she narrowed her eyes neither one of us met each others gaze or moved an inch it wasnt a long standoff but it was plenty hard not now she said but later well talk this isnt finished i nodded later we got in the beetle and murphy started it up and got moving ask you questions as we go i calculated distances in my head the communion spell with elaine had been created to reach over a couple of yards at the most it had mostly been used at ahem considerably shorter range than that i could extend the range i thought to most of a milemaybe it wasnt as simple as just pouring more power into the spell but it was fairly simple that gave me a couple of minutes to steady my breathing while murphy drove i could talk while that happened it would in fact help me keep my mind off my fear for elaine ah reason banisher of fearor at least provider of a place to stick my head in the sand go ahead i told her i paid no attention to molly giving the kid time to think over the lesson and to get herself together she didnt like anyone to see her when she was upset why do you think your ex is in danger murphy asked shouldnt this skavis just run off if it knows youre onto it if it was operating alone sure i said that would be the smart thing but it isnt running off its making a fight of it so what it has help it has rivals i said yeah grey cloak and madrigal raith murphy shook her head but what does that mean think in terms of predators i said one predator has just gotten its teeth into something good to eat scavengers murphy said theyre trying to take the prize from him yeah i said i think thats what theyre doing you mean elaine murphy said i shook my head no no more abstract the skavis is methodical its killing women of magical talent it doesnt have to do that to liveit can eat any human being then why those targets murphy asked exactly i said why them this isnt about food murph i think the skavis is making a play for power power molly blurted from the backseat i turned and gave her a glare that quelled her interest she sank back into the seat within the white court i said this entire mess start to finish is about a power struggle within the white court murph was silent for a second absorbing that then then this is a lot bigger than a few killings in a few towns if im right i said nodding yeah go on okay and remember as i go that white court vamps dont like their fights out in the open they arrange things they use catspaws they pull strings confrontation is for losers got it i nodded the white king is supporting peace talks between the council and the red courts i think the skavis is trying to prove a pointthat they dont need peace talks that they have us in a choke hold and all they have to do is hang on murphy frowned at me and then her eyes widened you told me once that magic is inherited mostly along family lines salic law i said mostly through female lines i got it from my mom murphy nodded her eyes going back to the road and they can start what thinning the herd i suppose from their point of view killing those that have the potential to produce more wizards yeah i said one skavis goes around to half a dozen cities in the most dangerousto themnation on the planet doing it at will i said he proves how easy it is he identifies and hunts down the best targets he plants all kinds of distrust for the council as he does it making the potential prey distrust the only people who could help them but what does he hope to accomplish murphy said this is just one guy exactly what he wants them to say i said look what just one vampire accomplished working alone look how easy it was raith is weak time to expand the operation now while the council is hurt and screw talking peace with them change the guard let house skavis take leadership and grey cloak and madrigal seeing that hes onto something good try to swoop in at the last minute shoulder the skavis aside and take credit for the plan in front of the whole court murphy finished yeah they sing the exact same tune only they substitute malvora for skavis i shook my head the hell of it is if madrigal hadnt had a personal beef with me i might not have gotten involved i made him look really bad when he tried to auction me on ebay and instead i fed his djinn to the scarecrow and made him run off like a girl like a what murphy bridled now is not the time to go all susie q anthony on me i said madrigals wounded pride makes him leave clues to try to sucker me into the show he figures grey cloak or our skavis killer will help him handle me except that they ran into another problem thomas murphy said her voice certain thomas i said snatching their targets out from under them hows he finding them same way they are i said hes a vampire he knows what resources they have and how they think so much so in fact that hes ruining the finale of the whole program for everyone involved murphy nodded getting it so madrigal gets a gang of ghouls and tries to take out his own cousin and finds you and elaine there too right i said hes already being a loser but its still a sucker punch and madrigal figures what the hell if he gets away with it he pulls off the plan and gets his mojo back from me i still dont get why thomas didnt say anything murphy said to you i mean i never figured him for that kind of secrecy thats what tipped me off to the whole thing i said there just arent many things which could make thomas do that i think he was counting on it to tip me off in fact murphy shook her head a phone call would have been easier not if hes being watched i said and not if hes made a promise watched murphy said by who someone who has more than one kind of leverage i said someone who is his family who is protecting the woman he loves and who has the kind of resources it takes to watch him and enough savvy to know if hes lying lara raith murphy said big sister is the one behind the peace movement i said everyone thinks its papa raith but hes just her puppet now except that there arent many people who know that if raiths authority is challenged openly by the skavis murphy said putting things together it exposes the fact that hes utterly powerless lara would have to fight openly and the white court vamp who is driven to that has already lost i said she cant maintain her control over the court if shes revealed as the power behind the throne not only does she not have the raw strength shed need to hold on to it but the very fact that she was revealed would make her an incompetent manipulator and therefore automatically unsuitable in the eyes of the rest of the white court murphy chewed on her lip if papa raith falls lara falls and if lara falls justine goes with her i said nodding she wouldnt be able to protect her for thomas anymore then why didnt she just have thomas go to you and ask for help murphy said she cant have it get out that she asked for help from the enemy team murph even among her own supporters that could be a disaster but remember that she knows how to pull strings maybe better than anyone operating right now she wouldnt be upset if i got involved and stomped all over agents of skavis and malvora murphy snorted so she forbids thomas from speaking to you about it shes too smart for that thomas gets stubborn about being given orders she gets him to promise to keep quiet but by doing that shes also done the one thing she knows will make him defiant to the spirit of the promise so hes made a promise and he cant come out and talk to me but he wants to get my attention ha murphy said so he gets around it he works sloppy deliberately he lets himself be seen repeatedly taking off with the women he was rounding up and leaves a big old honking wall o clues in his apartment for me knowing that when i get involved im going to get curious about why hes been seen with missing women and why hes not talking to me he cant talk to me about it but he leaves me a map i found my right foot tapping against an imaginary accelerator my left against a nonexistent clutch stop twitching murphy said the beetle jolted over some railroad tracks officially taking us to the wrong side im a better driver than you anyway i scowled because it was true so right now murphy said you think priscilla is shilling for the skavis agent no she is the skavis agent i thought you said it was a man murphy said strike you funny that priscilla wears turtlenecks in the middle of a hot summer murphy let out a word that should not be spoken before small children so if youre right hes going to clip elaine and all those moms kids too i said and anyone who gets in the way mouse molly said her voice worried this time i didnt yell her down i was worried about him too the skavis knows that mouse is special he saw the demonstration thats been the only thing keeping him from acting sooner than he did if the vampire started drawing upon his powers mouse would have sensed it and blown his cover so mouse is definitely going to be near the top of his list murphy nodded so whats the plan get us to the motel i said we were getting close enough that i could start trying the spell im going to try to reach elaine then what ive got no use for anything that does what this thing does i said do you her blue eyes glittered as the car zipped through the illumination of a lonely streetlamp no and as i recall you are on vacation right now and having fun fun fun she snarled then we wont worry too much about saving anything for later i said i turned my head and said molly the girls head whipped up almost audibly um what can you drive a stick she was silent for a second then jerked her head in a nod then when we get out i want you to get behind the wheel and keep the engine running i said if you see anyone else coming honk the horn if you see a tall woman in a turtleneck sprinting away i want you to drive the car over her i but but you wanted to help youre helping i turned back around do it her answer came back with the automatic speed of reflex yes sir what about grey cloak and madrigal murphy asked me even if we take out the skavis theyre waiting to jump in one thing at a time i said drive then i closed my eyes drew in my will and hoped that i could call out to elaineand that she would be alive to hear me chapter thirtyone i closed my eyes and blocked out my senses one by one the smell of the car and murphys deodorant went first at least molly had learned from experience and left off any overt fragrances when she tried to use the veil trick a second time sound went next the beetles old laboring engine the rattle of tires on bad spots of road and the rush of wind all faded away chicagos evening lights vanished from their irregular pressure on my closed eyelids the sour taste of fear in my mouth simply became not as i focused on the impromptu variation of the old familiar spell elaine i referred to the same base image i always had elaine in our first soulgaze an image of a woman of power grace and oceans of cool nerve superimposed over the blushing image of a schoolgirl naked for the first time with her first lover i had known what she would grow into even then that she would transform the gawky limbs and awkward carriage and blushing cheeks into confidence and poise and beauty and wisdom the wisdom maybe was still in process as evidenced by her choice of first lovers but even as an adult i was hardly in a position to cast stones as evidenced by my choice of pretty much everything what we hadnt known about back then was pain sure wed faced some things as children that a lot of kids dont sure justin had qualified for his junior de sade badge in his teaching methods for dealing with pain we still hadnt learned though that growing up is all about getting hurt and then getting over it you hurt you recover you move on odds are pretty good youre just going to get hurt again but each time you learn something each time you come out of it a little stronger and at some point you realize that there are more flavors of pain than coffee theres the little empty pain of leaving something behindgraduating taking the next step forward walking out of something familiar and safe into the unknown theres the big whirling pain of life upending all of your plans and expectations theres the sharp little pains of failure and the more obscure aches of successes that didnt give you what you thought they would there are the vicious stabbing pains of hopes being torn up the sweet little pains of finding others giving them your love and taking joy in their life as they grow and learn theres the steady pain of empathy that you shrug off so you can stand beside a wounded friend and help them bear their burdens and if youre very very lucky there are a very few blazing hot little pains you feel when you realize that you are standing in a moment of utter perfection an instant of triumph or happiness or mirth which at the same time cannot possibly lastand yet will remain with you for life everyone is down on pain because they forget something important about it pain is for the living only the dead dont feel it pain is a part of life sometimes its a big part and sometimes it isnt but either way its part of the big puzzle the deep music the great game pain does two things it teaches you tells you that youre alive then it passes away and leaves you changed it leaves you wiser sometimes sometimes it leaves you stronger either way pain leaves its mark and everything important that will ever happen to you in life is going to involve it in one degree or another adding pain to that image of elaine wasnt a process of imagining horrors fantasizing violence speculating upon suffering it was no different from an artist mixing in new color adding emphasis and depth to the image that while bright was not true to itself or to life so i took the girl i knew and added in the pains the woman i was reaching for had been forced to face shed stepped into a world shed left behind for more than a decade and found herself struggling to face life without relying upon anyone else shed always had me and justinand when wed gone away shed leaned upon a sidhe woman named aurora for help and support when that had vanished she had no onei had given my love to someone else justin had been dead for years shed been alone in a city different from everyone around struggling to survive and to build a life and a home so i added in all the pains id learned cooking blunders id had to eat anyway equipment and property constantly breaking down needing repairs and attention tax insanity and rushing around trying to hack a path through a jungle of numbers late bills unpleasant jobs that gave you horribly aching feet odd looks from people who didnt know you when something less than utterly normal happened the occasional night when the loneliness ached so badly that it made you weep the occasional gathering during which you wanted to escape to your empty apartment so badly you were willing to go out the bathroom window muscle pulls and aches you never had when you were younger the annoyance as the price of gas kept going up to some ridiculous degree the irritation with unruly neighbors brainless media personalities and various politicians who all seemed to fall on a spectrum somewhere between the extremes of crook and moron you know life and the image of her in my mind deepened sharpened took on personality theres no simple way to describe it but you know it when you see it and the great artists can do it can slip in the shades of meaning and thought and truth into something as simple as a girl named monas smile even if they cant tell you precisely how they managed it the image of elaine gained shadows flaws character and strength i didnt know the specifics of what shed been throughnot all of them anywaybut i knew enough and could make good guesses about plenty more that image in my mind drew me in as i focused on it just as i once had focused on that younger image of elaine unrealized i reached out with my thoughts and touched that image breathing gentle life into it as i whispered her true name freely given to me when we were young within the vaults of my mind elaine lilian mallory and the image came to life elaines face bowed forward her hair falling around it not quite hiding the expression of bonedeep weariness and despair elaine i whispered to her can you hear me her thoughts came to me in an echoing blur like when they want to confuse you at the movies and they muck around with a voiceover believe i could make a difference one person doesnt one person cant ever make a difference not in the real world god what arrogance and they paid for it i put more will into my thoughts elaine she glanced up for a moment looking dully around the room the image of her was filling in slowly she was in welllit room without many features most of it seemed to be white then her head bowed again trusting me to keep them safe i might as well pull the trigger myself too cowardly for that though i just sit here set things up so that i dont have to fail i dont have to try i dont have to worry about being nothing all i have to do is sit i didnt like the sound of that at all within the senseless vaults of my mind i screamed elaine she looked up again blinking her eyes slowly her mouth began moving in time with her audible thoughts dont know what i thought i could do one woman one woman who spent her whole life running away being broken i would have served them better to end it before i ever left rather than dragging them down with me her lips stopped moving but very faintly i heard her thoughts call harry and suddenly i could hear a difference in the other thoughts just sit she mumbled almost over now i wont be useless anymore just sit and wait and i wont have to hurt anymore wont fail anyone else it will all be over and i can rest it didnt sound like elaines voice there were subtle differences it sounded like someone doing an impersonation it was close but it wasnt her there were too many small inconsistencies then i got it that was the skavis whispering thoughts of despair and grief into her mind just as the raiths would whisper of lust and need she was under attack elaine lilian mallory i called and in my head my voice rumbled like thunder i am harry blackstone copperfield dresden and i bid thee hear me hear my voice elaine there was a shocked silence and then elaines thoughtvoice said more clearly harry and her lips moved and the notelaine voice said what the hell elaines eyes snapped to mine suddenly meeting them and the room around her clarified into crystalline relief she was in the bathroom of the hotel in the tub naked in the bath the air was thick with steam she was bleeding from a broad cut across one wrist the water was red her face was godawful pale but her eyes werent fogged over and hazed out not yet elaine i thundered you are under a psychic attack priscilla is the skavis elaines eyes widened someone slapped me hard on the face and screamed harry the world flew sideways and expanded in a rush of motion and sound as my denied senses came crashing back in upon me the beetle was sitting sideways across several parking spaces in the motels little lot both doors open and murphy gun in one hand had a hold of my duster with the other and was shaking me hard harry get up oh i said were here i stumbled out of the car getting my bearings behind me molly scrambled behind the wheel well murphy demanded did you get through i opened my mouth to answer but before i could every light in sight suddenly went dim i dont mean they went out they didnt they just dwindled the way a lanterns flame does if you close off the glass or i thought struck with a sudden impression the way a fire might dim if something nearby had just drawn the air away something big enough to dim nearby flame as it inhaled something big taking a deep breath and then a voice that rang with silvery rage rolled through the air kicking up a layer of dust from the ground in a broad wave in the wake of its passing as it rang out in an echoing clarion call fulminaris there was a flash of greenwhite light so bright that it came to my reawakened senses as a physical pain a roar of sound loud enough to drown out a spring break band and the entire front wall of the firstfloor hotel room wed rented earlier that day was blown off the freaking building and into the street i had my shield up overhead before the debris started raining down protecting murphy me the windshield of the beetle and the girl staring wideeyed through it i squinted through the flying bits of building and furniture and rock and a second later managed to spot a broken human form lying with its head in the street its feet still up on the curb priscillas turtleneck was on fire and her hair stood straight out and was blackened and burned off within three or four inches of her skull she ripped the turtleneck away in a kind of wobbly disoriented panicand revealed a bra and falsies those got ripped off too and what was left while slender and hairless was also obviously the upper torso of a very pale rather effeminatelooking man there was motion in the gaping maw of ruin that had been elaines hotel room and a woman appeared in it she was dressed in the cheap plastic curtain that had been hanging over the tub she had a thicklinked chain wrapped tightly around her left arm a couple of inches above her bloodied slashed wrist tied in an improvised tourniquet she was quite dry and her hair floated out and around her head crackling with little flashes of static electricity as she moved she slid herself slowly carefully across the debrisstrewn floor and she held a short length of carved wood that looked like nothing so much as an enormous thorn of some kind in her right hand its sharp tip pointing at the man in the parking lot tiny slivers of green lightning danced around its tip occasionally flickering out to touch upon nearby objects with snapping popping sounds as she passed elaine kept that deadly little wand pointed at the skavis eyes narrowed and said her voice rough and raw whos useless now bitch i just stared at elaine for a long minute then i traded a glance with murphy who looked just as startled and impressed as i felt murph i said i think i got through the skavis agent came to his feet and bounded at us quick as thinking i raised my staff and unleashed a burst of raw force he might be strong as hell but once off the ground with nothing to push against he was just mass times acceleration the blow from the staff swatted him out of the air to the concrete not far from the beetle i immediately used another blow to throw him back across the parking lot creating clear space around him thank you harry elaine said her rough voice prim then she lifted the wand and snapped fulminaris there was another blinding flash of light another crack of homemade thunder and a greenwhite globe of light enclosed the vampire there was a scream and then his limp form fell to the concrete one shoulder and most of his chest blackened it smelled disturbingly like burned bacon elaine lifted her chin eyes glittering she lowered the wand and as she did the lights came back up to full strength she nodded once then she slipped and staggered to one side watch him i barked to molly pointing at the fallen vampire murphy and i reached elaine at about the same time and we tried to catch her before she dropped we succeeded in easing her down to the debrislittered concrete jesus murphy said harry she needs a hospital theyll be watching the fuck em murphy said rising they can watch her through a wall of cops she stalked away drawing out her phone i bit my lip as elaine looked up at me and smiled faintly she spoke her words faintly slurred dammit every time i come to chicago ive got to get rescued embarrassing as hell at least it wasnt me that did the building this time i said she made a sound that might have been a laugh if shed had more energy behind it bastard had me dead to rights snuck it up on me i didnt realize thats how the old psychic whammy works i said quietly once you start thinking gee maybe that isnt me thinking about suicide it kind of falls apart wouldnt have happened if you hadnt warned me she said she met my eyes again thank you harry i smiled at her and checked her wrist this doesnt look good were gonna get you to a doctor okay she shook her head the upstairs room abby olivia the others make sure theyre all right i doubt theyve lost as much blood as you have i said murphy though was way ahead of me and was already on the stairs on the way up to the second level then down to check the room okay time to wrap this up i picked elaine up i made sure the shower curtain didnt fall off come on you can sit in the car until the emts get here maybe i can find something else to keep your arm tied off huh if you can find my purse she said her eyes closed now a little smile on her mouth you can use my golden lariat i turned to the car just as the horn started frantically beeping i whirled the skavis agent was moving again he got his knees underneath him dammit i said and rushed the car i got the passenger door open and dumped elaine inside even as the skavis rose to his feet murphy murphy called something i didnt hear very well the skavis turned toward me his face all contorted with burns on one side twisted up into a hideous grimace murphys gun began barking in a steady deliberate shooting rhythm sparks flew up from the concrete near his feet at least one shot hit the skavis making his upper body jerk i rose blasting rod in hand there was a roar more appropriate to a great cat than any dog and the sound of shattering glass from the second level mouse flew over the safety railing landed heavily on the ground and lunged at the skavis the dog wasnt six inches behind the skavis agent as it closed on me its one remaining arm raised up to well hit me but given how hard the blow was going to be i upgraded the verb to smite he was about to smite me thomas came out of nowhere with that cavalry saber of his and took off the skaviss smiting arm at the shoulder he let out a scream that didnt sound anything like human and tried to bite me i rolled out of his way helping him along with a stiff shove to his back mouse came down on top of him and that was that i eyed thomas as mouse made sure that the remarkably resilient vampire wasnt going to be getting up again for anything ever it had been a close call the skavis had timed his move just right another second give or take and hed have broken my neck well i told thomas my breathing still quick its about time better late than never thomas replied he glanced at the bleeding elaine licked his lips once and said she needs help its on the way murphy said response is slow here but give them a couple of minutes everyones okay up there harry thomas let out a breath of relief thank god which was odd coming from him all things considered i concurred with the sentiment though molly sat behind the wheel of the beetle breathing too quickly her eyes very wide she couldnt quite see mouse or his grisly chew toy from where she was sitting but she stared as if she could see right through the beetles hood to where my dog was finishing up his deadly ugly work so i asked thomas howd lara get you to promise not to talk my brother turned toward me and gave me a huge grin then he wiped it off his face and said in the tone of a radio announcer on prozac i dont know what youre talking about warden dresden he winked but hypothetlcally speaking she might have told me that justine was in danger and refused to divulge anything else until i promised to keep my mouth shut and you let her get away with that kind of crap i asked him thomas shrugged and said shes family molly suddenly lunged up out of the drivers seat of the beetle and was noisily sick seems a little fragile thomas said shes adjusting i replied madrigal and his malvora buddy are still out there yeah thomas said so so that means that this was just a warmup theyre still a threat i said theyve got enough bodies to lay the whole thing out to the white court and make people like the ordo look like a casino buffet if that happens it wont just be one skavis running around with a point to prove it will be a quiet campaign thousands of people will die thomas grunted yeah theres not a lot we can do about that though says who i replied he frowned at me and tilted his head thomas i said quietly by any chance is there a gathering of the white court anytime soon perhaps in relation to the proposed summit talks if there was a meeting of the most powerful hundred or so nobles of the court scheduled to meet at the family estate the day after tomorrow i couldnt tell you about it thomas said because i gave my sister my word your sister has guts i said and she sure as hell knows how to put on a show i glanced at the ruined hotel and dropped my hand to scratch mouses ears they were about the only part of him not stained with toopale blood of course ive been known to bring down the house once or twice myself thomas folded his arms waiting his smile was positively vulpine call lara i said pass her a message for me thomas narrowed his eyes what message i bared my teeth in an answering smile chapter thirtytwo murphy might not have been officially in charge of special investigations but i dont think that made much difference to many of the other detectives there she needed help and when she called they came end of story for them at least for murphy it was the beginning of the story she had to tell a lot of stories around police headquarters it was a part of her job oh no those reports of vampire attacks were the results of hysterical druginduced hallucinations troll it was a large and ugly man probably drunk or on drugs he got away investigation ongoing everyone buys it because thats what si gets paid to doexplain away the bogeyman murphy should be a novelist she writes so much fiction we had a big mess here but murph and her fellow cops in si would make it fit in the blanks terrorists were hot right now this report would probably have terrorists in it scared religious nuts and terrorists who set off incendiary devices at an apartment building and in her car and who also doubtless set the device that blew up an entire room at a cheap southside motel there werent any corpses to clean upjust one wounded woman who probably needed to see a shrink more than a jail cell i debated with myself over whether or not to suggest she add in a bit with a dog people love dogs you can never go wrong adding a dog to the story right mouse i asked him mouse looked unhappily up at me thomas had gotten the women and kids clear of the scene and handled what was left of the skavis agent while id gone to a car wash and cleaned his blood off of my dog with the sprayer mouses fur keeps out just about everything but when it finally gets wet it soaks up about fifty gallons and stays that way for a long time he doesnt like it and he was apparently feeling petulant about the entire process everybody loves a bit with a dog i said mouse exhaled steadily then shook his head once and laid it back down politely and definitely ignoring me i get no respect i sat on a hospital bench near the emergency room entrance with mouse pressed up against one of my legs as he lay on the floor just in case anyone wondered who he was with it had been a long night and despite elaines incredible hands my headache had begun to return i tried to decide whether cowls mental whammy or madrigal and his stupid assault rifle deserved more blame for that a brawny kid in a brown uniform shirt came up to me the way good security guys do in the midwestall friendly and nice until its time to not be nice the wit and wisdom of patrick swayze movies lives on sorry mister he said in a friendly tone one hand resting congenially on his nightstick no dogs allowed hospital rules i was tired if i dont take him out i said are you going to tonfa me to death he blinked at me what tonfa i said imagine all the meal that isnt getting ground so that you can do your job all the knives going unsharpened he smiled and i could see him classify me as drunk harmless he put out one hand in a comealong sort of gesture your nightstick there its called a tonfa it was originally a pin that held a millstone or a big round grinding stone in a smithy it got developed into an improvised weapon by people in southeast asia okinawa places like that where big friendly security types like yourself took away all the real weapons in the interest of public safety his smile faded a little okay buddy he put his hand on my shoulder mouse opened his eyes and lifted his head thats all he didnt growl at the brawny kid he didnt show his teeth like all the most dangerous people i know he didnt feel a need to make any displays he just sort of took noticewith extreme prejudice the security kid was smart enough to get the picture and took a quick step back his hand went from the nightstick to his radio even patrick swayze needed help sometimes murphy came walking up her badge hanging on a chain around her neck and said easy there big guy she traded a nod with the security kid and hooked a thumb back at me hes with us the dog is a handicapassist animal the kid lifted his eyebrows my mouth is partially paralyzed i said it makes it hard for me to read hes here to help me with the big words tell me if im supposed to push or pull on doors that kind of thing murphy gave me a gimlet glance and turned back to the guard see what i mean ill have him out of your hair in a minute the security guard glanced dubiously at me but nodded at murphy and said all right ill check back in a bit see if you need anything thanks murphy said her tone even the guard departed murphy sighed and sat down next to me her feet on the other side of mouse the dog gave her leg a fond nudge and settled back down again hell be back to see if you need help i told murphy in a serious voice a sweet little thing like you could get in trouble with a big crazy man like me mouse murphy said if i knock harry out and write insufferable wiseass on his head in permanent marker will you help him read it mouse glanced up at murphy and cocked his head speculatively then he sneezed and lay back down whyd you give him a hard time murphy asked me i nodded at a pay phone on the wall next to a drinking fountain and a vending machine waiting for a call ah murphy said wheres molly she was falling asleep on her feet rawlins took her home for me murphy grunted i said wed talk about her yeah i said what you did harry murphy shook her head she needed it i said she needed it the words were crisp i shrugged the kids got power she thinks that means she knows more than other people thats dangerous murphy frowned at me listening id been planning the little balloffacemeltysunshine thing for a while now i said i mean come on fire is hard to control i couldnt have done something like that without practicing it and you cant exactly use a nice slow dramatic facemelty fireball in a real fight can you maybe not murphy said i had a kind of facemelty thing come at me once and it made an impression i said molly got off to a bad start she took her magic and reshaped the stuff around her the people around her murph you cant do anything with magic that you dont believe in think about the significance of that for a minute when molly did what she did she believed that it was right that she was doing the right thing think about her parents think about how far theyre willing to go to do the right thing murphy did that her blue eyes intense her expression unreadable i have to keep knocking her on her ass i said if i dont if i let her recover her balance before she gets smart enough to figure out why she should be doing things instead of just how to do them or if she can do them shell start doing thei used air quotes right thing again shell break the laws again and theyll kill her and you murphy asked i shrugged thats a ways down my worry list and you think what you did is going to help prevent that she asked i hope it will i said im not sure what else to do in the end its up to the kid im just trying to give her enough time to get it together despite herself hells bells the girl has a thick skull murphy gave me a lopsided smile and shook her head i know i said i know pot kettle black i wasnt talking about the facemelty thing harry she said then not directly im talking about the stupid trash can im talking about the look on your face right before you made the fire go away im talking about what happened to that moviemonster thing in the hotel last year it was my turn to frown what murphy stopped for a minute evidently considering her words as carefully as a bomb technician considers wiring there are moments when i wonder if you are losing control of yourself youve always had a lot of anger in you harry but over the past few years its gotten worse a lot worse bullshit i snarled murphy arched an eyebrow and just looked at me i gritted my teeth and made myself ease back down into my previous slouch i took a deep breath and counted to ten then i said you think i have anger issues when you destroyed that trash canwhen you slagged it in a moment of pure frustration destroyed it inflicted thousands of dollars of damage on the city sidewalk the building behind it the shops inside all of which are in marcones building i snapped im sure the people who work the counter atshe consulted her little notepadthe spresso spress and run the registers at bathwurks probably dont know anything about marcone or care about him either they probably just go to work and try to pay their bills i frowned at her what both shops were hit by bits of concrete and molten metal theyll be closed for several weeks for repairs theyre insured i said i didnt sound like i believed it made a difference even to me people got hurt murphy said no ones face got melted but thats not the point you know the score harry you know the kind of damage you can do if you arent careful i didnt say anything its just like being a cop knowing martial arts i know that i can do some fairly awful things to people its my business to make sure that awful things dont happen to people im careful about how i use what power i have ill tell that to my dentist i said dont be petty harry she said her voice serious ive made mistakes admitted them apologized to you i cant change whats happened and youre a better man than that unless maybe i wasnt i felt ashamed for making the remark my point is murphy said quietly that you knew what kind of damage you could do but if what you say is true in the moment you used your magic you thought that what you were doing was right you thought it was okay to destroy something because you were angry even though it might hurt someone else who didnt deserve it i felt another surge of rage and and and holy crap murphy was right the sigil of angelic script the only unburned flesh on my left hand itched madly oh hell i said quietly pot kettle black all right all day long murph sat beside me not saying anything not accusing me of anything she just sat with me friends do that i put my right hand out palm up murphy closed her hand on mine for a moment her fingers warm and small and strong thanks i told her she squeezed tight for a moment then she got up and went to a vending machine she came back with a can of coke and a can of diet coke and handed me the nonvile one we popped open the cans together and drank hows the ex murphy asked gonna make it i said she lost a lot of blood but shes ab neg they stitched her shut and theyre topping off her tank shocks the worry right now the doc says its more than that though isnt it i nodded thomas said it might take her a few days to get back on her feet depending on how big a bite the skavis took which is sort of a relief murphy studied me for a minute frowning are you bothered that she i dunno she kind of stole your thunder there at the end i shook my head she doesnt need to steal it murph and even if she did i got plenty of thunder i felt myself smile got to admit ive never seen her throw a big punch like that before though pretty impressive murphy admitted i shrugged yeah but she had it under control nobody else got hurt building didnt even burn down murph gave me a sideways look like i said i grinned easily and started to riposte but the pay phone rang i hopped up as much as i was capable of hopping and answered it dresden john marcones voice was as cool and eloquent as ever you must think me insane you read the papers i had faxed to you as has my counsel at monoc marcone replied that doesnt mean i interrupted him purely because i knew how much it would annoy him look we both know youre going to do it and im too tired to dance i told him what do you want there was a moment of silence that might have been vaguely irritated being adolescent at someone like marcone is good for my morale say please marcone said i blinked what say please dresden he replied his tone smooth ask me i rolled my eyes give me a break we both know you need me dresden and im too tired to dance i could practically see the shark smile on his face say please i stewed for a sullen minute before i realized that doing so was probably building marcones morale and i couldnt have that fine i said please pretty please marcone prompted me some pyromaniacal madmans thoughts flooded my forebrain but i took a deep breath tasered my pride and said pretty please with a cherry on top fuck you i said and hung up on him i kicked the base of the vending machine and muttered a curse marcone was probably laughing his quiet mirthless little laugh jerk i rejoined murphy she looked at me i stayed silent she frowned a little but nodded at me and picked up where wed left off seriously what relieves you about elaine being off her feet she wont get involved in what comes next i said murphy fell quiet for a minute then she said you think the malvora are going to make their play for power in the white court yep if anyone points out what happened to mr skavis theyll claim he was trying to steal their thunder and that their operation was already complete in other words murphy said after a minute they won we did all that thrashing around trying to stop the skavis so that it wouldnt happen but its happening anyway depressing i said isnt it what does it mean murphy asked on the big scale i shrugged if theyre successful it will draw the white court out of a prosettlement stance throw their support back to the reds theyll declare open season on people like anna and well have several tens of thousands of disappearances and suicides over the next few years most of which will go unnoticed by the authorities murphy said quietly so many people disappear already whats a few thousand more spread out a statistic i said she was quiet for a minute then what if the vamps are quiet enough about it the war gets harder the council will have to spread our resources even thinner than they already are if something doesnt change i shrugged we lose now a couple of decades from now sometime we lose then what murphy asked if the council loses the war then the vampires will be able to do pretty much whatever they want i said theyll take control the red court will grab up all the spots in the world where theres already plenty of chaos and corruption and blood and misery theyll spread out from central america to africa the middle east all those places that used to be stalins stomping grounds and havent gotten a handle on things yet the bad parts of asia then theyll expand the franchise the white court will move in on all the places that regard themselves as civilized and enlightened and wisely do not believe in the supernatural i shrugged you guys will be on your own you guys murphy asked me people i said living people mouse pressed his head a little harder against my boot there was silence and i felt murphys stare come on karrin i said i winked at her and pushed myself wearily to my feet that isnt gonna happen while im still alive murphy rose with me you have a plan she stated i have a plan whats the plan harry i told her she looked at me for a second and then said youre crazy be positive murph you call it crazy i call it unpredictable she pursed her lips thoughtfully for a second and then said i cant go any higher than insane you in i asked her murphy looked insulted what kind of question is that youre right i said what was i thinking we left together chapter thirtythree i was up late making arrangements that would i hoped help me take out madrigal and his malvora buddy and put an end to the power struggle in the white court after which maybe i would try turning water to wine and walking on water though technically speaking i had done the latter yesterday after i was through scheming i dragged my tired self to bed and slept hard but not long too many dreams about all the things that could go wrong i was rummaging in my icebox looking for breakfast when lasciel manifested her image to me again the fallen angels manner was subdued and her voice had something in it i had rarely heard thereuncertainty do you really think its possible for her to change who your pupil of course lasciel said do you really think she can change do you think she can take control of herself the way you would have her do i turned from the fridge lasciel stood in front of my empty fireplace her arms folded frowning down at it she was wearing the usual white tonic though her hair seemed a little untidy i hadnt slept all that long or all that well maybe she hadnt either why do you ask i asked her she shrugged it only seems to me that she is already established in her patterns she disregards the wisdom of others in favor of her own flawed judgment she ignores their desires even their will and replaces them with her own she did that once i said quietly twice if you want to get technical it might have been one of her first major choices and she made a bad one but it doesnt mean that she has to keep on repeating it over and over there was silence as i assembled a turkey sandwich and a bowl of cheerios plus a can of cold coke the breakfast of champions i hoped so i said what do you think of the plan i think there is only a slightly greater chance of your enemies killing you than your allies my host you are a madman its the sort of thing that keeps life interesting i said a faint smile played on her lips i have known mortals for millennia my host few of them ever grew that bored you should have seen the kind of plans i came up with a couple of years before you showed up todays plan is genius and poetry compared to those there was no milk in the icebox and i wasnt pouring coke onto breakfast cereal that would just be odd i munched on the cheerios dry and washed each mouthful down with coke in a dignified fashion then i glanced at lasciel and said i changed there was silence for a moment broken only by the crunching of tasty rings of oats or baked wheat or something i just knew it was good for my heart and my cholesterol and for all the flowers and puppies and tiny children the box said so the fallen angel spoke after a time and her words came out quiet and poisonously bitter she has free will she has a choice that is what she is no she is what she does i said quietly she could choose to change her ways she could choose to take up black magic again i took a bite of sandwich or she could ignore the choice pretend it doesnt exist or pretend that she doesnt have a choice when in fact she does thats just another way of choosing lasciel gave me a very sharp look the shadows shifted on her face as if the room had grown darker we are not talking about me i sipped coke and said mildly i know that were talking about molly we are she said i have a purpose here a mission that has not changed she turned away from me the shadows around her growing darker her form blended into them i do not change speaking of i said a friend pointed out to me that i may have developed some anger issues over the last couple of years maybe influenced by oh who knows what the fallen angels shadow turned her head i could only tell because her lovely profile was slightly less black than the shadow around it i thought maybe you would know what i said tell me i told you once before my host the shadow said you are easier to talk to when you are asleep which was just chilling taken in that context everyone has that part of them that needs to be reined in its that little urge you sometimes feel to hop over the edge of a great height when youre looking out from a high building its the immediate spark of anger you feel when someone cuts you off and makes you want to run your car into that moron its the flash of fear in you when something surprises you at night leaving you quivering with your body primed to fight or flee call it the hind brain the subconscious whatever im not a shrink but its there and its real mine wore a lot of black even before lasciel showed up like i said chilling the fallen angel turned to depart on that note probably because it would have made a nicely scary exit line i extended my hand and with it my mind and barred her departure with an effort of simple will lasciel existed only in my thoughts after all my head i told her my rules we arent finished she turned to face me and her eyes suddenly glowed with orange and amber and scarlet flickers of hellfire it was the only nonblack thing about her see heres the thing i said my inner evil twin might have a lot of impulses id rather not indulgebut he isnt a stranger hes me yes he is full of anger full of the need for power full of hate she smiled and her teeth were white and quite pointy he just doesnt lie to himself about it i dont lie to myself i responded anger is just anger it isnt good it isnt bad it just is what you do with it is what matters its like anything else you can use it to build or to destroy you just have to make the choice constructive anger the demon said her voice dripping sarcasm also known as passion i said quietly passion has overthrown tyrants and freed prisoners and slaves passion has brought justice where there was savagery passion has created freedom where there was nothing but fear passion has helped souls rise from the ashes of their horrible lives and build something better stronger more beautiful lasciel narrowed her eyes in point of fact i said quietly that kind of thing really doesnt get done without passion anger is one of the things that can help build itif its controlled if you really believed that lasciel said youd not be having any angercontrol issues because im perfect i asked her and snorted a lot of men go a lifetime without ever figuring out how to control anger ive been doing it longer than some and better than some but i dont kid myself that im a saint i shrugged a lot of things i see make me angry its one of the reasons i decided to spend my life doing something about it because youre so noble she purred which dripped even more sarcasm at this rate i was going to need a mop because id rather use that anger to smash the things that hurt people than let it use me i said talk at my subconscious all you want but id be careful about trying to feed my inner hulk if i were you you might end up making me that much better a person once i beat it down who knows you might make me into a saint or as close to one as i could get anyway the demon just stared at me see heres the thing i said i know me and i just cant imagine you talking and talking to my evil twin like that without him ever saying anything back i dont think youre the only one doing any influencing here i dont think youre the same creature now that you were when you came she let out a cold little laugh such arrogance do you think you could change the eternal mortal i was brought to life by the word of the almighty himself for a purpose so complex and fundamental that you could not begin to comprehend it you are nothing mortal you are a flickering spark you will be here and be gone and in the aeons that come after when your very kind have dwindled and perished you will be but one of uncounted legions of those whom i have seduced and destroyed her eyes narrowed you cannot change me i nodded agreeably youre right i cant change lasciel but i couldnt prevent lasciel from walking out of the room either i eyed her hard and lowered my voice lady you aint lasciel i couldnt be sure but i thought i could see the darkened forms shoulders flinch youre an image of her i continued a copy a footprint but youve got to be at least as mutable as the material the impression was made upon as mutable as me and hey ive got newfound anger issues what have you got thats new you are delusional she said her voice was very quiet i disagree after all if you have managed to change meeven if it doesnt mean im suddenly going to turn into ted bundythen it seems to me that youd be at least as vulnerable in fact the way that sort of thing works you pretty much have to have changed yourself to do what youve done to me it will vanish when i am taken back into my whole self imprisoned within the coin lasciel said you the you who is talking to me right now will be gone in other words i said youll die a somewhat startled silence followed for an inhumanly brilliant spiritual entity you can really miss the freaking point i poked a finger at my own temple think maybe you dont have to be lasciel the shadow closed her eyes leaving only an occupied presencefilled darkness there was a long silence think about it i told her what if you do have a choice a life of your own to lead what if huh and you dont even try to choose i let that sink in for a while there was a sound from the far side of the room it was a very quiet very miserable little sound ive made sounds like that beforemostly when there was no one around to care the part of me that knew what it was to hurt could feel the fallen angels pain and it gouged out a neat little hole in me somehow it was a vaguely familiar feeling but not an entirely unpleasant one loneliness is a hard thing to handle i feel it sometimes when i do i want it to end sometimes when youre near someone when you touch them on some level that is deeper than the uselessly structured formality of casual civilized interaction theres a sense of satisfaction in it or at least there is for me it doesnt have to be someone particularly nice you dont have to like them you dont even have to want to work with them you might even want to punch them in the nose sometimes just making that connection is its own experience its own reward with marcone it was like that i didnt like the slippery bastard but i understood him his word was good i could trust himtrust him to be cold ferocious and dangerous sure but it was reassuring to know that there was something there to trust the connection had been made lasciels mere shadow was infinitely more dangerous to me than marcone but that didnt mean that i couldnt admire the creature for what it was while respecting the threat it posed to me it didnt mean i couldnt feel some kind of empathy for what had to be a horribly lonely way to exist lifes easier when you can write off others as monsters as demons as horrible threats that must be hated and feared the thing is you cant do that without becoming them just a little sure lasciels shadow might be determined to drag my immortal soul down to perdition but there was no point in hating her for it it wouldnt do anything but stain me that much darker im human and im going to stay that way so i felt a little bit bad for the creature whose purpose in the universe was to tempt me into darkness hell once id thought about it it was just about the only job id heard of that had to be even more isolated and frustrating than mine how many shadows like you have ever stayed in a host like me for longer than a few weeks huh longer than three years never lasciels shadow replied in a nearwhisper granted you are unusually stiffnecked for a mortal suicidally so in fact so i said ive held out this long suppose i do it the whole way suppose i never pick up the coin shadowyou never goes back to realyou whos to say that shadowyou cant find some kind of life for herself hellfire eyes narrowed at me but she did not reply lash i said quietly and relaxed my will releasing my hold on her just because you start out as one thing it doesnt mean you cant grow into something else silence then her voice came out a bare whisper your plan has too many variables and will likely result in our destruction should you wish my assistance in your madness my host you have only to call then the form was gone and lasciel was absent from my apartment technically she had never been there at all she was all in my head and technically she wasnt gone she was just off somewhere where i couldnt perceive her and i knew on a gut levelor maybe my darker self was telling methat shed heard me i was onto something i was sure of that either im one hell of a persuasive guy or im a freaking sucker get your head in the game harry i told myself defeat the whole damn white court now worry about taking on hell later i got back to work the clock ticked down steadily and there was nothing i could do but get ready and kill time waiting for nightfall and the fight that would follow chapter thirtyfour i let mister back in after his morning ramble which happened to fall between three and four pm that daymister has a complicated ramble schedule that changes on a basis so mystifying that i have never been able to predict itand took mouse out for a stroll to the area of the boardinghouses little backyard set aside for him tick tock tick tock i took a bit of sandpaper to my staff and cleaned off some gunk on the bottom and some soot along the haft i put on all my silver battle rings and took them to the heavy bag id hung in the corner half an hours worth of pounding on the bag wouldnt bring them all up to charge but something was better than nothing tick tock i showered after my workout i cleaned my gun and loaded it i pushed aside my coffee table and couch to lay out my coat on the floor and took the leather cleaner to it being careful not to disrupt the protective spells id scored in the hide with tattoo needles and black ink in short i did everything i could to avoid thinking about anna ashs corpse in that cheap clean little hotel room shower while the time crawled by tick tock at a quarter to six there was a rapping sound outside my door i checked out the peephole ramirez stood outside dressed in a big red basketballtype tank top black shorts and flipflops he had a big gym bag over one shoulder and carried his staff nearly as battlescarred as mine despite the difference in our ages in his right hand he rapped the end of the staff down on the concrete outside again instead of touching my door i took down the wards and opened the steel security door it didnt take me more than five or six hard pulls to get it to swing all the way open i thought you were going to get that fixed ramirez said to me he peered around the doorway before he eased forward through it where i knew the presence of all the warding spells would be buzzing against his senses like a locomotivesized electric razor even though they were temporarily deactivated jesus christ harry you beefed them up even more got to exercise the apprentices talent somehow ramirez gave me an affable leer ill bet dont even joke about that man i told him without any heat in the words ive known her since she was in pigtails ramirez opened his mouth paused then shrugged and said sorry no problem i said but since im not an old man whose sex drive has withered from lack of use dont get me wrong i like carlos but there are times when his mouth is running that i want to punch him in the head until all his teeth fall out ill be the first to admit that id sure as hell find some uses for her that girl is fine he frowned and glanced arounda little nervously i thought um mollys not here is she nope i said i didnt ask her on this operation oh he said his voice seemed to hold something of both approval and disappointment good hey there mouse my dog came over to greet ramirez with a gravely shaken paw and a wagging tail ramirez produced a little cloth sack and tossed it up to mister where he lay in his favored spot atop one of my bookcases mister immediately went ecstatic pinning the sack down with one paw and rubbing his whiskers all over it i disapprove of recreational drug use i told ramirez sternly he rolled his eyes okay dad but since we all know who really runs this houseramirez reached up to rub a finger behind one of misters earsill just keep on paying tribute lest i incur his nibss imperial displeasure i reached up to rub misters ears when ramirez was done so any questions were going to stomp into the middle of a big meeting of the white court call a couple of them murderers challenge them to a duel and kill them right in front of all of their friends and relatives right right i said it has the advantage of simplicity ramirez said his tone dry he put his bag on my coffee table and opened it drawing out a freaking desert eagle one of the most powerful semiautomatic sidearms in the world call them names and kill them what could possibly go wrong with that were officially in a ceasefire i said and as weve announced ourselves as parties arriving to deliver challenge theyd be in violation of the accords to kill us ramirez grunted checked the slide on the big handgun and slapped a magazine into it or we show up they kill us and then play like we left in good shape and vanished and oh dear what a shame and loss to all those hot young women that that madman harry dresden dragged goodlooking young ramirez down with him when he went i snorted no in the first place the council would find out what happened one way or another if any of them looked ramirez drawled ebenezar would i stated with perfect confidence how do you know ramirez asked i knew because my old mentor was the blackstaff of the council their completely illegal immoral unethical and secret assassin free to break the laws of magic whenever he deemed it fitsuch as the first law thou shalt not kill when duke ortega of the red court had challenged me to a formal duel and cheated ebenezar had taken it personally hed pulled an old soviet satellite down onto the vamps heads killing ortega and his whole crew but i couldnt tell carlos that i know the old man i said he would you know that ramirez said what if the whites dont we count on our second safety net king raith doesnt want to get his finely accoutred ass deposed our challenge is going to remove a couple of potential deposers hell want us to succeed after that i figure quid pro quo should be enough to get us out in one piece ramirez shook his head were doing the white king our enemy with whom we are at war a favor by stabilizing his grasp on the throne yeah why are we doing that again because it might give the council a chance to catch its breath at least if we can recover while raith hosts peace talks i narrowed my eyes and because those murdering sons of bitches have to pay for killing a lot of innocent people and this is the only way to get to them ramirez pulled three roundsided grenades from the pack and put them down next to the desert eagle i like that second one better its a fight i can get behind do we have any backup maybe i said he paused and blinked up at me maybe most of the wardens are in india i told him a bunch of old bad guys under some big daddy rakshasa started attacking some monasteries friendly to us while we were distracted with the vamps i checked and morgan and ebenezar have been hammering them for two days you me your guys and luccios trainees are the only wardens in north america right now no trainees ramirez grunted and my guys havent had their cloaks for a year yet they are not up for something like this yet half a dozen vamps in an alley sure but theres only the three of them i nodded keep this simple swagger in look confident kick ass you dealt with white court before not much they stay clear of our people on the coast theyre predators like the rest of them i said they react well to body language that tells them that you are not food theyve got some major mental influence skills so keep focused and make sure your head is clear ramirez produced a wellworn web belt of black nylon he clipped a holster to it and then fixed the grenades in place whats going to stop them from smashing us the second we win this duel thats one of the things i love about working with ramirez the possibility of losing the duel simply didnt enter into his calculations their nature i said they like to play civilized and do their wet work through catspaws they are not fond of direct methods and direct confrontation ramirez lifted his eyebrows drew a slender straight doubleedged blade of a type he called a willow sword from the bag and laid it on the table too the tassel on the hilt had been torn off by a zombie the night wed first fought together he had replaced it over the last few years with a little chain strung with fangs taken from red court vampires hed killed with it they rattled against one another and the steel and leather of the hilt i get it were the white kings catspaws i walked to the icebox bingo and we cant hang around as potential threats to his rebellious courtiers if he kills us outright after we help him out it would damage his credibility with his allies too ah ramirez said politicians i returned with two opened beers i gave one to him clinked my bottle against his and we said in unison fuck em and drank ramirez lowered the bottle squinted at it and said can we do this i snorted cant be any harder than halloween we had a dinosaur then ramirez said then he turned and pulled fatigue pants and a black offspring tshirt out of his bag he gave me an upanddown look of course we still do i kicked the coffee table into his shins he let out a yelp and hobbled off to change clothes in my bedroom snickering under his breath the whole way when he came back out the smile was gone we got suited up swords and guns and grey cloaks and staves and magical gewgaws left and right yeehaw one of these days i swear as long as im playing supernatural sheriff of chicago im getting myself some honesttogod spurs and a tengallon hat i got out a yellow legal pad and a pen and ramirez and i sat down over another beer the meeting is at the raith family estate north of town ive been in the house but only part of it heres what i remember i started sketching it out for ramirez who asked plenty of smart questions about both the house and exterior so that i had to go to a new page to map out what i knew of the grounds not sure where the vamps will be having their meeting but the duel is going to be in the deeps its a cave outside the house somewhere out here i circled an area of the map theres a nice deep chasm in them its a great place to dispose of bodies and no chance of being seen or heard very tidy ramirez noted especially if were the ones who need disposing of the doorknob twisted and began to open ramirez went for his gun and had it out almost as quickly as i had my blasting rod pointed at the door something slammed against it opening it five or six inches i flicked my gaze aside for a minute and then lowered the blasting rod i put a hand on ramirezs wrist and said easy tiger its a friendly ramirez glanced at me and lowered the gun while i watched mouse rise to his feet and pad toward the door tail wagging who is it he asked that backup we might be getting i said quietly the door banged open by inches and molly slipped inside shed ditched the gothwear almost entirely she didnt sport any of the usual piercingsnose rings are great fashion statements but in anything like a fight they just arent a good idea her clothing wasnt all ripped up either she wore heavy loose jeans and not slung so low on the hips that theyd threaten to fall off and trip her if she twitched her spine just right her combat boots had been divested of their brightly colored laces she wore a black shirt with a metallica logo on it and a web belt that bore a sheathed knife and the small firstaid kit id seen her mother carry into battle she wore a dark green baseball cap with her hair gathered into a tail and tucked up under it where it wouldnt provide an easy handle for anyone wanting to grab it molly didnt look up at us she greeted the big dog first kneeling to give him a hug then she rose facing me and looked up um hi harry hello warden ramirez molly i replied keeping my voice neutral is this the third or fourth time in the last two days ive told you to stay home only to have you ignore me i know she said looking down again but id like to talk to you im busy i know but i really need to talk to you sir please i exhaled slowly then i glanced aside at ramirez do me a favor gas up the beetle theres a station two blocks down the street carlos looked from me to molly and back then shrugged and said um sure yeah i took the keys from my pocket and tossed them carlos caught them with casual dexterity gave molly a polite nod and left shut the door i told her she did pressing her back against it and using her legs to push it cost her a couple of grunts of effort and a few ounces of dignity but she got it shut you can barely shut the door i said but you think youre ready to fight the white court she shook her head and started to speak i didnt let her again youre ignoring me again youre here when i told you to stay away yes she said but but you think im a frigging idiot too stupid to make these kinds of judgments on my own and you want to go with me anyway it isnt like that she said no i said thrusting out my chin belligerently how many beads can you move apprentice but i roared at her how many beads she flinched away from me her expression miserable then she lifted the bracelet and dangled it heavy black beads lining up at the bottom of the strand she faced it her blue eyes tired and haunted and bit her lip harry she asked softly she sounded very young yes i asked i spoke very gently why does it matter she asked me staring at the bead bracelet it matters if you want to go into this with me i said quietly she shook her head and blinked her eyes several times it didnt stop a tear from leaking out but thats just it i i dont want to go i dont want to see that she glanced aside at mouse and shuddered blood like that i dont remember what happened when you and mother saved me from arctis tor but i dont want to see more of that i dont want it to happen to me i dont want to hurt anyone i let out a low noncommittal sound then why are you here bbecause she said searching for words because i need to do it i know that what youre doing is necessary and its right and i know that youre doing it because youre the only one who can and i want to help you think youre strong enough to help i asked her she bit her lip again and met my eyes for just a second i think i think it doesnt matter how strong my magic is i know i dont i dont know how to do these things like you do the guns and the battles and she lifted her chin and seemed to gather herself a little but i know more than most you know some i admitted but you got to understand kid that wont mean much once things get nasty theres no time for thinking or second chances she nodded all i can promise you is that i wont leave you when you need me ill do whatever you think i can ill stay here and man the phone ill drive the car ill walk at the back and hold the flashlight whatever you want she met my eyes and her own hardened but i cant sit at home being safe i need to be a part of this i need to help there was a sudden sharp sound as the leather strand of her bracelet snapped of its own volition black beads flew upward with so much force that they rattled off the ceiling and went bouncing around the apartment for a good ten seconds mister still batting playfully at his gift sack of catnip paused to watch them ears flicking eyes alertly tracking their movement i went up to the girl who was staring at them mystified it was the vampire wasnt it i said seeing him die she blinked at me then at the scattered beads i i didnt just see it harry i felt it i cant explain it any better than that inside my head i felt it the same way i felt that poor girl but this was horrible yeah i said youre a sensitive its a tremendous talent but it has some drawbacks to it in this case though im glad you have it why she whispered i gestured at the scattered beads congratulations kid i told her quietly youre ready she blinked at me her head tilted what i took the nowempty leather strand and held it up between two fingers it wasnt about power molly it was never about power youve got plenty of that she shook her head but all those times the beads werent ever going to go up like i said power had nothing to do with it you didnt need that you needed brains i thumped a forefinger over one of her eyebrows you needed to open your eyes you needed to be truly aware of how dangerous things are you needed to understand your limitations and you needed to know why you should set out on something like this but all i said was that i was scared after what you got to experience thats smart kid i said im scared too every time something like this happens it scares me but being strong doesnt get you through being smart does ive beaten people and things who were stronger than i was because they didnt use their heads or because i used what i had better than they did it isnt about muscle kiddo magical or otherwise its about your attitude about your mind she nodded slowly and said about doing things for the right reasons you dont throw down like this just because youre strong enough to do it i said you do it because you dont have much choice you do it because its unacceptable to walk away and still live with yourself later she stared at me for a second and then her eyes widened otherwise youre using power for the sake of using power i nodded and power tends to corrupt it isnt hard to love using it molly youve got to go in with the right attitude or or the power starts using you she said shed heard the argument before but this was the first time she said the words slowly thoughtfully as if shed actually understood them instead of just parroting them back to me then she looked up thats why you do it why you help people youre using the power for someone other than yourself thats part of it i said yeah i feel sort of stupid theres a difference in knowing somethingi poked her head againand knowing it i touched the middle of her sternum see she nodded slowly then she took the strand back from me and put it back on her wrist there was just enough left to let her tie it again she held it up so that i could see and said so that ill remember i grinned at her and hugged her she hugged back did you get a lesson like this pretty much i said from this grumpy old scot on a farm in the ozarks when do i stop feeling like an idiot ill let you know when i do i said and she laughed we parted the hug and i met her eyes you still in yes she said simply then youll ride up with ramirez and me well stop outside the compound and youll stay with the car she nodded seriously what do i do keep your eyes and ears open stay alert for anything you might sense dont talk to anyone if anyone approaches you leave if you see a bunch of bad guys showing up start honking the horn and get out okay she said she looked a little pale i pulled a silver cylinder out of my pocket this is a hypersonic whistle mouse can hear it from a mile away if we get in trouble ill blow it and hell start barking about it hell face where we are try to get the car as close as you can ill have mouse with me she said and looked considerably relieved i nodded almost always better not to work alone what if what if i do something wrong i shrugged what if you do thats always possible molly but the only way never to do the wrong thing is never to do anything she finished bingo i put a hand on her shoulder look youre smart enough ive taught you everything i know about the white court keep your eyes open use your head your judgment if things get bad and i havent started blowing the whistle run like hell if it gets past ten pm and you havent heard from me do the same get home and tell your folks all right she said quietly she took a deep breath and let it out unsteadily this is scary and were doing it anyway i said that makes us brave right if we get away with it i said if we dont it just makes us stupid her eyes widened for a second and then she let out a fullthroated laugh ready i asked her ready sir good outside gravel crunched as ramirez returned with the beetle all right apprentice i said get mouses lead on him will you lets do it chapter thirtyfive chateau raith hadnt changed much since my last visit thats one of the good things about dealing with nighimmortals they tend to adjust badly to change and avoid it wherever possible it was a big place north of the city where the countryside rolls over a surprising variety of terrainflat stretches of rich land that used to be farms but are mostly big expensive properties now dozens of little rivers and big creeks have carved hills and valleys more steep than most people expect from the midwest the trees out in that area one of the older settlements in the united states can be absolutely huge and it would cost me five or six years worth of income to buy even a tiny house chateau raith is surrounded by a forest of those enormous ancient trees as if someone had managed to transplant a section of sherwood forest itself from britain you cant see a thing of the estate from any of the roads around it i knew it was at least a halfmile run through the trees before you got to the grounds which were enormous in their own right translation you werent getting away from the chateau on foot speed alone not if there were vampires there to run you down there was one new feature to the grounds the eightfoothigh stone wall was the same but it had been topped with a double helix of razor wire and lighting had been spaced along the outside of the wall i could see security cameras at regular intervals as well the old lord raith had disdained the more modern security precautions in favor of the protection of intense personal arrogance lara however seemed more willing to acknowledge threats to listen to her mortal security staff and to employ the countermeasures they suggested it would certainly help keep the mortal riffraff out and the council had plenty of mortal allies more important it said something about laras administration she found skilled subordinates and then listened to them she might not look as overwhelmingly confident as lord raith hadbut then lord raith wasnt running the show anymore either even if that wasnt public knowledge in the magical community i reflected that it was entirely possible that i might have done the council and the world something of a disservice by helping lara assume control lord raith had been proud and brittle i had the feeling that lara would prove to be far far more capable and far more dangerous as the de facto white king and here i was about to go to her aid again and help solidify her power even more stop here i told molly quietly the gates to the chateau were still a quarter mile down the road this is as close as you get right molly said and pulled the beetle overonto the far side of the road i noted with approval where anyone wanting to come to her would have to cross the open pavement to get there mouse i said stay here with molly and listen for us take care of her mouse looked unhappily at me from the backseat where hed sat with ramirez but leaned forward and dropped his shaggy chin onto my shoulder i gave him a quick hug and said in a gruff voice dont worry well be fine his tail thumped once against the backseat and then he shifted around to lay his head on mollys shoulder she immediately started scratching him reassuringly behind the ear though her own expression was far from comfortable i gave the girl half of a smile and then got out of the car summer twilight was fading fast and it was too hot to wear my duster i had it on anyway and i added the weight of the grey cloak of the wardens of the white council to the duster under all that i wore a white silk shirt and cargo pants of heavy black cotton plus my hiking boots hat i muttered spurs next time i swear ramirez slid out of the beetle grenades and gun and willow sword hanging from his belt and staff gripped in his right hand he paused to pull on a glove made out of heavy leather overlaid with a layer of slender steel plates each inscribed with pictoglyphs that looked aztec or olmec or something thats new i commented he winked at me and we checked our guns my revolver went back into my lefthand duster pocket his back into its sheath you sure you dont want a grenade or two he asked im not comfortable with hand grenades i said suit yourself he replied how about you molly he turned back to the car hand on one of his grenades the car was gone the engine was still idling audibly ramirez let out a whistle and waved his staff into the space it had occupied until it clinked against metal hey not a bad veil pretty damned good in fact shes got a gift i said mollys voice came from nearby thanks ramirez gave the approximate space where my apprentice sat a big grin and a gallant vaguely spanish little bow molly let out a suppressed giggle the cars engine cut out and she said go on ive got to keep compensating for the dust youre kicking up and its a pain eyes open i told her use your head you too molly said dont tell him to start new things now ramirez chided her youll just confuse him im getting dumber by the minute i confirmed ask anybody from the unseen car mouse snorted out a breath see i said and started walking toward the entrance to the estate ramirez kept up but only by taking a skipping step every several paces my legs are lots longer than his after a hundred yards or so he laughed all right you made your point i grunted and slowed marginally ramirez looked back over his shoulder think shell be all right tough to sneak up on mouse i said even if they realize shes there pretty a body like that and talent too ramirez stared back thoughtfully she seeing anyone not since she drilled holes in her last boyfriends psyche and drove him insane ramirez winced right we fell silent and walked up to the gates to the estate getting our game faces on along the way ramirezs natural expression was a cocksure smile but when things got hairy he went with a cool arrogant look that left his eyes focused on nothing and everything at the same time i really dont care what my game face looks like mine is all internal i kept annas face and her serious eyes in mind as i tromped up to the gothic gate made of simulated wrought iron but heavy enough to stop a charging suv i struck it three times with my staff and planted its end firmly onto the ground the gate buzzed and began to open of its own accord halfway through something near the hinges let out a whine and a puff of smoke and it stopped moving that you i asked him i took out the lock too he replied quietly and the cameras that can see the gate just in case ramirez doesnt have my raw power but he uses what he has well nice i told him didnt feel a thing his grin flickered by de nada im the best i stepped through the gate keeping a wary eye out the night was all but complete and the woods were lovely dark and deep tires whispered on pavement a light appeared in the trees ahead and resolved into headlights a fullfledged limousine a white rolls with silver accents swept down the drive to the gate and purred to a halt twenty feet in front of us ramirez muttered under his breath you want i should down big fella i said save ourselves the walk bah he said some of us are young and healthy the driver door opened and a man got out i recognized him as one of laras personal bodyguards he was a bit taller than average leanly muscled had a military haircut and sharp wary eyes he wore a sports jacket khakis and wasnt working to hide the shoulder rig he wore under the coat he took a look at us then past us at the gate and the fence then he took a small radio from his pocket and started speaking into it dresden he asked me yeah ramirez the one and only carlos told him youre armed he said heavily i replied he grimaced nodded and said get in the car please why i asked him oh so innocently ramirez gave me a sharp look but said nothing i was told to collect you the bodyguard said it isnt far to the house i said we can walk ms raith asked me to assure you that on behalf of her father you have her personal pledge of safe conduct as stipulated in the accords in that case i said ms raith can come tell me that her personal self im sure she will be happy to the bodyguard said at the house sir i folded my arms and said if shes too busy to move her pretty ass down here why dont you go ask her if we cant come back tomorrow instead there was a whirring sound and one of the back windows of the rolls slid down i couldnt see much of anyone inside but i heard a velvetsoft womans laugh saunter out of the night you see george i told you the bodyguard grimaced and looked around theyve done something to the gate its open youre exposed here maam if assassination was their intention the woman replied believe me when i say that dresden could already have done it and i feel confident that his companion mr ramirez could have managed the same ramirez stiffened a little and muttered between clenched teeth how does she know me aint many people ride zombie dinosaurs and make regional commander in the wardens before they turn twentyfive i replied betcha shes got files on most of the wardens still alive and some of the trainees agreed the womans voice george if you please the bodyguard gave us a flat measuring look and then opened the door of the car one hand resting quite openly on the butt of the pistol hanging under one arm the mistress of the white court stepped forth from the rollsroyce lara is difficult to describe id met her several times and each meeting had carried a similar impact a moment of stunned admiration and desire at her raw physical appeal that did not lessen with exposure there was no one feature about her that i could have pointed out as particularly gorgeous there was no one facet of her beauty that could be declared as utter perfection her appeal was something far greater than the sum of her parts and none of those were less than heavenly like thomas she had dark idly curling hair so glossy that the highlights were very nearly a shade of blue her skin was one creamy gently curving expanse of milk white perfection and if there were moles or birthmarks anywhere on her body i couldnt see them her dark pink lips were a little large for her narrowchinned face but they didnt detractthey only gave her a look of lush overindulgence of deliberate and wicked sensuality it was her eyes though that were the real killers they were large oblique orbs of arsenic grey highlighted with flecks of periwinkle blue more important they were very alive eyes alert aware of others shining with intelligence and humorso much so in fact that if you werent careful youd miss the smoldering demonic fires of sensuality in them of a steady predatory hunger beside me ramirez swallowed i knew only because i could hear it when lara makes an entrance no one looks away she wore a white silk business suit its skirt less than an inch too short to be considered dignified business wear the heels of her white shoes just a tiny bit too high for propriety it made it difficult not to stare at her legs a lot of women with her coloring couldnt pull off a white outfit but lara made it look like a goddesss toga she knew the effect she had when we looked at her and her mouth curled into a satisfied little smile she walked toward us slowly one leg crossing the other at a deliberate pace hips shifting slightly the motion was awfully pretty sheer sensual femininity gathered around her in a silent unseen thundercloud so thick that it could drown a man if he wasnt careful after all she had drowned her father in it hadnt she all is not gold that glitters and how well i knew it as delicious as she looked as pantsrendingly gorgeously as she moved she was capitald dangerous more she was a vampire a predator one who fed on human beings to continue her very existence despite our past cooperation i was still human and she was still something that ate humans if i acted like food there would be an enormous part of her that wouldnt care about politics or advantage it would just want to eat me so i did my best to look bored as she approached and offered me her hand palm down i took her cold smooth pretty deliciously softdammit harry ignore your penis before it gets you killed fingers in mine bent over them in a little formal bow and released them without kissing her hand if i had i wasnt sure i wouldnt take a few nibbles just to test out the texture as long as i was there as i rose she met my eyes for a dangerous second and said sure you dont want a taste harry a surge of raw lust that wasprobablynot my own flickered through my body i smiled at her gave her a little bow of my head and made a small effort of will the runes and sigils on my staff erupted into smoldering orange hellfire be polite lara it would be a shame to get cinders and ashes all over those shoes she tilted her head back and let out a bubbling throaty laugh then touched the side of my face with one hand subtle as always she replied she lowered her hand and ran her fingertips over the odd grey material of my wardens cloak youve developed an eclectic taste in fashion its the same color i said on both sides ah lara said and inclined her head slightly to me id hardly respect you otherwise i suppose still should you ever desire a new wardrobe she touched the fabric of my shirt lightly you would look marvelous in white silk said the spider to the fly i replied forget it she smiled again batted her lashes at me while my heart skipped a beat and then slid on to ramirez she offered him her hand you must be warden ramirez this is the part where i got nervous ramirez loved women ramirez never shut up about women well he never shut up about anything in general but hed go on and on about various conquests and feats of sexual athleticism and a virgin lara blurted lara blurted she turned her head to me grey eyes several shades paler than they had been and very wide really harry im not sure what to say is he a present i folded my arms and regarded lara steadily but said nothing this was ramirezs moment to make a first impression and if he didnt do it on his own lara would regard him as someone who couldnt protect himself it would probably mark him as a target lara turned to walk a slow circle around ramirez inspecting him the way you might a flashy new sports car she was of a height with him but taller in the heels and there was nothing but a languidly sensual confidence in the way she moved a handsome young bantam she murmured she trailed a finger across the line of his shoulders as she moved behind him strong young a hero of the white council ive heard she paused to touch a fingertip to the back of his hand and then shuddered and power too her eyes went a few shades brighter as she completed the tour my goodness ive recently fed and still perhaps youd care to ride with me back to the estate and let dresden walk i promise to entertain you until he arrives i knew the look on ramirezs face it was the look of a young man who wants nothing so badly as to discard the complex things in life like civilization social mores clothing and speech and see what happened next lara knew it too her eyes glittered brightly and her smile was serpentine and she pressed closer but ramirez apparently knew about glittery gold too i didnt know hed hidden a knife up his sleeve but it appeared in his hand an instant before its tip pressed into the bottom of laras throat i he said very quietly am not food and he met her eyes i hadnt seen a soulgaze from the outside before it surprised me how simple and brief it looked when one wasnt being shaken to the core by it both of them stared eyes widening and then shuddered lara took a small step back from ramirez her breathing slightly quickened i noticed because im a professional investigator she could have been concealing a weapon in that decolletage if you meant to dissuade me lara said a moment later you havent not you ramirez replied lowering the knife his voice was rough it wasnt to dissuade you wise she murmured for one so young i advise you young wizard not to hesitate so long to act should another approach you as i did a virgin is extremely attractive to our kind one such as you is rare these days give a less restrained member of the court an opportunity as you did me and theyll throw themselves on you in dozenswhich would reflect poorly on me she turned back to me and said wizards you have my pledge of safe conduct i inclined my head to her and said thank you then i will await your company in the car i nodded my head to her and lara walked back to her bodyguard who looked like he was fighting off a fit of apoplexy i turned and eyed ramirez he turned bright red virgin i asked him he turned more red carlos i asked shes lying he snapped shes evil shes really evil and lying i rubbed at my mouth to keep anyone from seeing me grin hey on nights like this you take your laughs where you can get them okay i said not important the hell it isnt he spat shes lying i mean im not im i nudged him with an elbow focus galahad weve got a job to do he exhaled with a growl right you saw what was inside her i asked he shuddered that pale thing her eyes she was getting more turned on and they kept looking more like its eyes yep i said its a tipoff to how close they are to starting to take a bite of you you handled it right you think so i couldnt resist jibing him just a little just think if youd messed it up i said as lara slid into the car one long perfect leg at a time youd be in the limo with lara ripping your clothes off right now ramirez looked at the car and swallowed um yeah close one ive met several of the white court i said laras probably the smartest shes the most civilized progressive adaptable shes definitely the most dangerous she didnt look that tough ramirez said but he was frowning in thought as he said it shes dangerous in a different way than most i said but i think her word is good it is ramirez said firmly i saw that much its one of the things that makes her dangerous i said and headed for the limo stay cool we walked over and i leaned down to see lara in the back of the limo seated on one of the dogcartstyle seats all poise and beauty and gorgeous grey eyes she smiled at me as i looked in and crooked a finger step into my limo said the spider to the fly and we did chapter thirtysix the limo rolled right past the enormous stone house that was the chateau proper it was bigger than a parking garage and covered with cornices and turrets and gargoyles like some kind of neomedieval castle were uh i noted not stopping at the house no lara said from the seat facing us even in the dark you could see the glow of her luminous skin the conclave is being held in the deeps her eyes glittered at me less walking for everyone that way i gave her a small smile and said i like the house the whole castlelook thing its always nice to know youre living somewhere that could withstand a besieging army of bohemian mercenaries if it had to or american wizards she replied smoothly i gave her what i hoped was a wolfish smile folded my arms and watched the house go by we turned down a little gravel lane and drove another mile or so before the car slowed and came to a stop bodyguard george got out and opened the door for lara whose thigh brushed against mine as she got out and whose perfume smelled good enough to scramble my brain for a good two or three seconds both i and ramirez sat still for a second that i said is an awfully lovely woman i thought i should let you know kid in case your inexperience had blinded you to the fact lying ramirez stated blushing evil i snickered and slid out of the car to follow laraand the three more bodyguards waiting for herinto the woods beside the gravel lane the last time id found the entrance to the deeps id been stumbling through the woods focused on a tracking spell and tripping over roots and hummocks in the oldgrowth forest this time there was a lighted path with a red carpet no less leading down between the trees the lights were all of soft blues and greens small lamps that upon a closer glance proved to be elegant little crystal cages containing tiny humanoid forms with wings faeries tiny pixies each surrounded by its own sphere of light trapped and miserable crouched in the cages between each cage knelt more prisonershumans bound by nothing more than a single strand of white silk about their throats tied to a peg driven into the earth in front of them they werent naked lara wouldnt have gone in for anything that overt instead they each wore a white silk kimono accented with strands of silver thread men and women arrayed in a variety of ages body types hair colors every single one of them beautiful their eyes lowered as they knelt quietly one of the young men sat shivering and was seemingly barely able to stay upright his long dark hair was marred with streaks of brittle white his eyes were unfocused and he seemed totally unaware of anyone around him his kimono was torn near the neck leaving a broad swath of muscled chest exposed there were raking nail marks deep enough to draw tiny trickles of blood all the way across one pectoral there were repeated teeth marks deep in the slope of muscle between neck and shoulder half a dozen sets of messy bruises and ugly little gashes there were more nail marks four sidebyside punctures rather than rakes on the other side of his neck he was also obviously even painfully aroused beneath the kimono lara paused beside him and rolled her eyes in irritation madeline yes maam said one of the bodyguards oh for hungers sake she sighed get him indoors before the conclave is over or shell finish him off on her way out yes maam he said turned aside and began speaking to nobody i spotted a wire running to an earpiece i kept walking down the long line of kneeling captives and trapped pixies and got angrier with every step theyre willing dresden lara said a few paces later all of them im sure they are i said now she laughed there is no shortage of mortals who long to kneel before another wizard there never has been we passed several more kneeling men and women who looked mussed and dazed though none so badly as the first we also walked past spaces where there was a peg and a strip of white clothbut no person kneeling within im sure they all knew that they might die by doing it i said she shrugged one shoulder it happens at these meetings guests have no need to dispose of a body since as hosts we are responsible for such necessities as a result many of our visitors make no effort to control themselves youre responsible all right i gripped my staff harder and kept my voice neutral what about the little folk they trespassed upon our land she replied her voice calm most would simply have killed them rather than pressing them into service yeah youre all heart where there is life there is hope dresden lara replied my fathers policies on such matters have changed of late death is gauche when it can be avoided alternative courses are far more profitable and agreeable to all involved it is for precisely that reason that my father seeks to help create a peace between your folk and mine i glanced aside at the shining eyes of a shorthaired redhead in her early thirties absolutely lovely her kimono still open from whatever had fed on her the tips of her small breasts taut as she panted the muscles of a lean stomach still trembling behind us the thralls stretched out into the darkness ahead of us they went on for a hundred yards or more so many of them i started to shudder but the faces of the women the skavis and his pretenders had murdered flickered through my mind and i fought it down like hell was i going to let lara see me look discomfited no matter how sick the display of the white courts seductive power made me feel the path went for another hundred yards through the woods and stopped at the mouth of a cave it wasnt large or sinister or dramatic it was simply a fissure in an almostflat stretch of ground at the base of a tree with the hypnotic sway of firelight dancing somewhere below there were guards outsideset back in the woods out of obvious sight i spotted a couple of deer stands occupied by dark shapes there were others standing silent sentinel i assumed that there would be more guards i could not see lara turned to us gentlemen she said if you will wait here for a moment i will send someone when the white king is ready to receive you i nodded once settled my staff on the ground and leaned on it a little saying nothing ramirez took his cue from me lara gave me a level look then she turned and descended into the deeps flawlessly graceful despite her high heels youve met her before ramirez noted quietly yeah where set of a porn movie she was acting he stared at me for a second then shrugged in acceptance and said what were you doing stuntman i replied uh he said id been hired by the producer to find out why people involved with the movie were being killed did you yeah so did you and she no i said you can tell from how im breathing and possessed of my own will i nodded toward the entrance of the cave where a shadow briefly darkened the firelight from below someones coming a young woman in an especially fine white kimono heavily embroidered with silver thread emerged from the fissure i thought she was blond for a second but that was because of the light as she approached us with slow quiet steps her hair turned blue then green passing through the light of the faerie lamps her hiplength hair was pure white she was lovely very nearly as much so as lara but there was none of the predatory sense of hunger in her that id come to associate with the white court she was slim and sweetly shaped and looked quite frail and vulnerable it took me a second to recognize her justine i asked she gave me a little smile it was oddly disconnected as if her dark eyes were focused on something other than what she smiled at and she never looked directly at me she spoke her words flecked with little pauses and emphasis on odd syllables as if she were speaking a foreign language in which she had merely technical proficiency its harry dresden hello harry you look dashing this evening justine i said accepting her hand as she offered it to me i bowed over it you look ambulatory she gave me a shy smile and spoke in a dreamy singsong im healing one day ill be all better and go back to my lord her fingers though tightened hard on mine as she spoke a quick and measured sequence to the rhythm of shave and a haircut i blinked for a second and then squeezed back on the beat for six bits im sure any man would be delighted to see you she blushed daintily and bowed to us so kind my lord would you accompany me please we did justine led us down into the fissure which proved to be a smoothwalled descent into the earth from there our way forward entered a torchlit tunnel its walls also polished smooth and from far below us came the music of echoing voices and sounds dancing through the stone being subtly changed and altered by the acoustics as they came up from below it was a long winding descent down though the tunnel was wide and the footing steady i remembered the nightmarish flight from the deeps the last time id been there while murphy and i dragged my halfdead half brother all the way up before wed been consumed in a storm of psychic slavery lara was whipping up to take control of her father and through him the white court it had been a close one justine stopped about twothirds of the way down at a spot that had been marked with a bit of chalk on the floor here she said in a quietbut not at all dreamyvoice we cant be overheard from here whats going on i demanded how are you walking around like this it doesnt matter right now justine said im better you arent crazy are you i demanded you nearly scratched my eyes out that one time she shook her head with a frustrated little motion medication it isnt look im all right for now i need you to listen to me fine i said lara wished me to tell you what to expect justine said dark eyes intent right now lord skavis is below calling for an end to any plans for negotiations with the council citing the work of his son as an illustration of the profit of continuing hostilities his son i said justine grimaced and nodded the agent you slew was the heir apparent of house skavis mouse might have been the one to do the actual killing but the accords regarded him as a mere weapon like a gun i was the one who had pulled the trigger who is in charge of malvora lady cesarina malvora justine said giving me a smile of approval whose son vittorio will be quite insulted by lord skaviss lies about all the hard work he and madrigal raith did i nodded when does lara want me to make my entrance she told me that you would know best justine said right i said take me to where i can hear them talking then thats going to be a problem justine said theyre speaking ancient etruscan i can follow enough of it to give you an idea what it isnt a problem i said is it i thought toward lasciels shadow naturally not my host came the ghostly reply groovy i thought thanks lash a startled second passed then she replied you are welcome just get me to where i can hear them i told justine this way she replied at once and hurried on down the passage stopping not twenty feet shy of the main cavern even so close i could see very little of the cavern beyondthough i could hear voices raised in speech that sounded strange and sibilant in my ears and english in my head the very heart of the matter a rolling basso voice orated that the mortal freaks and their ilk stand on the brink of destruction now is the time to tighten our grip and neuter the kine once and for all lord skavis i presumed a strong and lazily confident baritone answered the speaker and i recognized the voice of the remains of the creature who had killed my mother at once my dear skavis answered lord raith the white king i can hardly say that i find the notion of a neutered humanity entirely appealing there was a round of silvery laughter men and women alike it rippled through the air and brushed against me like an idly ardent lover i stood fast until it had gone by ramirez had to rest a hand on the wall to keep his balance justine swayed like a reed her eyes fluttering shut and then opening again skaviss deep voice resumed your personal amusements and preferences aside my king the freaks biggest weakness has always been the length of time it took them to develop their skills to the most formidable levels for the first time in history we have degraded or neutralized their many advantages altogether partly due to the fortunes of war and partly thanks to the resourcefulness of the kine in developing their arts in travel and communication the house of skavis has proven that we stand holding an unprecedented opportunity to crush the freaks and bring the kine under control at last only a fool would allow it to slip between his impotent fingers my king only a fool came a strident womans voice would make such a pathetic claim the crown raith interjected recognizes cesarina the lady malvora thank you my king lady malvora said while i cannot help but admire my lord skaviss audacity i fear that i have no choice but to cut short his attempt to steal glory not his own from the honorable house of malvora raiths voice remained amused this should be interesting by all means elaborate dear cesarina thank you my king my son vittorio was on the scene and will explain a male voice flat and a little nasal spoke up and i recognized grey cloaks accent at once my lord the deaths inflicted upon the freakishly blooded kine indeed happened as lord skavis describes but in fact it was no agent of his house who accomplished this deed if as he claims his son accomplished it then where is he why has he not come forward to bear testimony in person the words fell on what i could only describe as a glowering silence if lord skavis was anything like the rest of the whites id met vittorio needed to bury him fast or spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder then who did accomplish this fell act of warfare raith asked his tone mild vittorio spoke again and i could just imagine the way his chest must have puffed out i did my king with the assistance of madrigal of the house of raith raiths voice gained an edge of anger this despite the fact that a cessation of hostilities has been declared pending the discussion of an armistice what is done is done my king lady malvora interjected my dear friend lord skavis was correct in this fact the freaks are weak now is the time to finish themnow and forever not to allow them time to regain their feet despite the fact that the white king thinks otherwise i could hear lady malvoras smile many things change o king there was a booming sound maybe a fist slamming down onto the arm of a throne this does not you have violated my commands and undermined my policies that is treason cesarina is it o king lady malvora shot back or is it treason to our very blood to show mercy to an enemy who is upon the brink of defeat i would be willing to forgive excessive zeal cesarina raith snarled i am less inclined to tolerate the stupidity behind this mindless provocation cold mocking laughter fell on a sudden dead silence stupidity in what way o weak and aged king in what way are the deaths of the kine anything but sweetness to the senses balm to the hunger the quality of her voice changed as if she changed her facing in the cavern i could imagine her turning to address the audience scorn ringing in her tone we are strong and the strong do as they wish who shall call us to task for it o king you if that wasnt a straight line my name isnt harry blackstone copperfield dresden i lifted my staff and slammed it down on the floor forcing an effort of will through it to focus the energy of the blow into a far smaller area than the end of the staff it struck the stone floor shattering a chunk the size of a big dinner platter with a detonation almost indistinguishable from thunder another effort of will sent a rolling wave of silent fire no more than five or six inches high down the tunnel floor in a red carpet of my very own i strode down it ramirez beside me the fire rolling back away from our feet as we went boots striking the stone together we entered the cavern and found it packed with pale and startled beings the entire place a wash of beautiful faces and gorgeous wardrobesexcept for twenty feet around the entrance where everyone had hurried away from the blazing herald of our presence i ignored everything scanning the room until i found grey cloak aka vittorio malvora standing next to madrigal raith not thirty feet away the murdering bastards were staring at us mouths open in shock vittorio malvora i called my voice ringing with wrath in the echoing cavern madrigal raith i am harry dresden warden of the white council of wizards under the unseelie accords i accuse you of murder in a time of peace and challenge you here and now before these witnesses to trial by combat i slammed my staff down again in another shock of thunder and hellfire flooded the runes of the staff to the death utter silence fell on the deeps damn there aint nothing like a good entrance chapter thirtyseven empty night madrigal swore in english his eyes wide this isnt happening i showed him my teeth and replied quietly in the same tongue time to pay the piper prick vitto malvora turned his head to look over his shoulder at a tiny woman no more than five feet tall dressed in a white gown more like a toga than anything else she was curved like the greek goddesses the gown made her resemble her face was a stark frozen mask she turned eyes the color of chrome toward me and winedark lips peeled back from very white teeth there was an immediate uproar from the vampires a sudden chorus of shouts of protest and anger if id been in a less defiant mood it probably would have scared the crap out of me as it was i simply shifted my stance turning slightly to my left while ramirez did the same in the opposite direction so that we stood backtoback there wasnt much else to do but prepare to fight in the event that someone decided to kick off a good oldfashioned wizardsmashin for the evenings group activity that gave me a moment to look around the cavern it was built on the scale of parisian cathedrals with an enormously high arched ceiling that vanished into shadow far overhead the floor and walls were of living stone smooth and grey shot through here and there with strands of green dark red and cobalt blue everything was rounded and smooth not a jagged edge or sharp corner in sight the decor had changed a bit since i was there last there were soft amber orange and scarlet lights splashing onto the walls of the cavern and the lamps they came from had to have been automated because they moved slightly mixing color making all the shadows twitch and generally giving the overall impression of crude firelight without surrendering any of the clarity of electric lighting furniture had been arranged in three large groupings with a large open space in the center of the floor and they were occupied by what i could only presume were the leading members of the three major housessomewhere near a hundred vampires in all servants dressed in the same kind of more heavily embroidered kimono justine had been wearing hovered at the walls bearing trays of drinks and food and so on the floor rose in a series of inchhigh ripples toward the far side of the chamber where the white king sat looking down upon his court raiths throne was an enormous chair of bonewhite stone its back flared out like the hood of a cobra spreading out into an enormous crest decorated with all manner of eyetwisting carvings everything from rather spidery celticstyle designs to basrelief scenes of beings i could not easily identify engaged in activities i had no desire to contemplate a thin sheet of fine mist fell behind the throne the light playing delicately through it sending ribbons and streams of color and refracted rainbows dancing around the throne behind that veil of obscuring mist the floor abruptly ended opening up into a yawning abyss that dropped into the bowels of the earth and for all i knew all the way through its intestinal tract the white king sat upon the throne thomas favored his father heavily and at first glance lord raith could have been thomas he had the same strong appealing features the same glossy dark hair the same lean build he looked little older than thomas but his face was very different it was the eyes i think they were stained somehow with contempt and calculation and a serpentine dispassion the white king wore a splendid outfit of white silk something somewhere between napoleonic finery and chinese imperial garb silver and gold thread and sapphires flickered over the whole of his outfit and a circlet of glittering silver stood out starkly against his raven hair around the throne stood five womenevery one of them a vampire in less elaborate and more feminine versions of his own regalia lara was one of them and not the prettiest though they all bore her a strong likeness raiths daughters i supposed each beautiful enough to haunt a lifetime of dreams each deadly enough to kill an army of fools who sought to make such a fantasy come true the noise continued to rise all around us and i could feel ramirezs shoulders tightening and sense the power he had begun to gather raith rose from his throne with lazy magnificence and roared silence i thought my speaking voice had been loud but raiths shook small stones loose from the unseeing ceiling of the cavern far overhead and the whole place went dead still lady malvora wasnt having any intimidation though she strode into the open space before the throne maybe ten feet from ramirez and me and faced the white king ridiculous she snapped we are not in a time of peace with the white council a state of war has been ongoing for years the victims were not members of the council i said and gave her a sweet smile and they are not signatories to the accords lady malvora snapped given their status as members of the magical community they are however within the purview of the white councils legitimate political concerns and as such are subject to the stipulations for protection and defense found within the accords i am well within my rights to act as their champion lady malvora stared daggers at me sophistry i smiled at her that is of course for your king to decide lady malvoras glare became even more heated but she turned her gaze from me to the white throne raith sat down again slowly carefully fussy with his sleeves his eyes alight with pure pleasure now now dear cesarina moments ago you were claiming credit for dealing what could prove a mortal blow to the freaks at least in the long term just because said freaks are here to object as is their right under the accords you can hardly claim that they have no vested interest in trying to stop you comprehension dawned on lady malvoras lovely face her voice lowered to a pitch that couldnt have carried much farther than myself and maybe to raiths own enhanced senses you snake you poisonous snake raith gave her a chill smile and addressed the assembly we find that we have little choice but to acknowledge the validity of the freaks right of challenge under our agreement in the accords then we must abide by its terms and permit the trial to proceed raith rolled a droll hand at vitto and madrigal unless of course our war heroes here lack the courage to withstand this utterly predictable response to their course of action they are of course free to decline the challenge should they feel themselves unable to face the consequences of their deeds silence fell again almost viciously anticipatory the weight of the attention of the white court fell squarely on vitto and madrigal and they froze the way birds will before a snake remaining carefully motionless this was the ticklish part if the duo declined the trial by combat raith would have to pay the council a weregild for the dead and that would be that of course doing so would be a public admission of defeat and would effectively neuter any influence they had in the white court and by extension would weaken lady malvoras positionnot so much because they declined to fight as because they would have been outmaneuvered and forced to flee a confrontation of course being proven slow and incompetent in front of a hundred ruthless predators be they ever so well dressed would probably prove lethal itself in the long run either way lady malvoras attempted influence coup would be finished the bold and daring plan would have been proven overt and liable to attract far too much attention both of which were simply not of value within the vampires collective character as a result the white king not lady malvora would determine the course of the white courts policy lady malvoras only way out was through a victory in the trials and i was counting on it i wanted vitto and madrigal to fight weregild wasnt good enough to atone for what these creatures had done to far too many innocent women i wanted to give these monsters an object lesson madrigal turned to vitto and spoke in a quiet hiss i half closed my eyes and listened in on the conversation no madrigal said again in english no way hes a stupid thug but this is exactly what he does best vitto and lady malvora traded a long stare then vitto turned to madrigal and said you were the imbecile who set out to attract his attention and got him involved we fight like hell we fight madrigal snarled empty night ortega couldnt take him in a straight fight dont act like such a kine madrigal vitto replied that was a duel of wills a trial by combat allows us any weapons or tactics we wish have fun i wont be one of the people fighting him yes you will vitto replied you can face the wizard or you can face dear auntie cesarina madrigal froze again staring at vitto i promise you that even if he burns you to death it will be swift and painless by comparison decide madrigal you are with malvora or against us madrigal swallowed and closed his eyes son of a bitch vitto malvoras mouth widened into a smile and he turned to address the white king his language shifting back to etruscan or whatever we deny the freaks baseless accusation and accept his challenge of course my king we will prove the injustice of it upon his body wweapons came madrigals unsteady voice lasciels translation was flawlessly smooth but it wasnt hard to extrapolate that madrigals etruscan was about as bad as my latin weapons for our own we must have to fight to get them we must send slaves for to find them raith settled back in his throne and folded his arms i find this an only reasonable request dresden no objection i told him raith nodded once and clapped his hands music then while we wait and another round of wine lady malvora snarled turned on a heel and stalked back into one of the groups of furniture where she became the immediate center of an intent conference musicians struck up from somewhere nearby hidden behind a screen a chamber orchestra and a pretty good one vivaldi maybe im weaker on smallerscale music than i am on symphonies an excited buzz of voices rose up as servants began circulating with silver trays and crystal flute glasses ramirez gave the chamber a somewhat disbelieving stare and then shook his head this is a nuthouse cave i said nutcave what the hell is going on right ramirez didnt have his own photocopy of a demons personality to translate ancient etruscan so i summed up the conversation and the players and gave him the best quotes whats this freak stuff ramirez demanded in a low outraged tone i think its a perspective thing i said they call humans kinedeer herd animals wizards are deer who can call down the lightning and whip up firestorms from that perspective were fairly freakish so were going to kick their asses now right that is the plan incoming ramirez said stiffening lara raith approached us demure in her white formal getup bearing a silver tray with drinks upon it she inclined her head to us her grey eyes pale and shining honored guests would you care for wine nah i said im driving laras lips twitched i had no idea how she had switched into the complex kimono so quickly chalk it up to the same sexy vampire powers that had once let her shoot a layer of skin off my ear while standing on gravel in stiletto heels poof business suit whoosh whoosh silk negligee i shook my head a little and got my thoughts under control adrenaline can make me a little silly lara turned to carlos and said may i offer you a taste of something sweet bantam well he said as long as youre offering stuff how about a little assurance that somebody isnt going to shoot us in the back for fun once were stomping on beavis and butthead over there lara arched a brow beavis and i would have gone with hekyll and jekyll i told him gentlemen she said please be assured that the white throne wishes nothing more than for you to prevail and humiliate its foes i am sure that my father will react most harshly to any violation of the accords okay ramirez said drawing the word out he nodded toward the malvoran contingent still huddled around cesarina so whats stopping ii duca there from taking a whack at you and the king and everybody if she offs you she gets to kill us take over the organization and just do whatever she likes lara looked at him and her expression twisted with distaste to the point that a little shudder actually flickered along her body which i noticed because i am a trained observer of body language and not because of the way the kimono was perfectly outlining one of her thighs you dont understand she shook her head holding her mouth as if shed unexpectedly bitten into a lemon dresden can you explain it to him the white court vamps can be violent i said quietly savage even but that isnt their preferred mode of operation youre worried that malvora is going to come smashing in here like a big old grizzly bear and kill anything in her way but they arent like grizzly bears theyre more like mountain lions they prefer not to be seen acting at all when they do attack theyre going after a victim not seeking an opponent theyll try to isolate them hit them from behind preferably destroy them before they even know that theyre being attacked if lady malvora threw down right now itd be a standup fight they hate those they wont do them unless thereto no alternative oh ramirez said thank yon lara told me of course i said theres been some uncharacteristic behavior going around lately lara tilted her head at me frowning oh come on i said you think its a little odd the faeries didnt immediately stomp all over the red court when they violated unseelie territory a couple of years back dont tell me youre trapping the little faeries because its cheaper than getting those paper party lanterns lara narrowed her eyes at me youre testing their reaction i said giving a minor but deliberate insult and seeing what happens her lips turned up very very slowly are you sure youre quite determined to remain attached to that sad little clubhouse of old men why do you take care of your own i asked in a great many senses wizard she promised the way you took care of thomas i asked her smile turned brittle pride goeth lara i said each is entitled to his opinion she glanced up and said the runners have returned with your foes weaponry good hunting gentlemen she bowed to us again her expression a mask and drifted away back toward her place behind the throne the music came to an end and it seemed to be a signal to the vampires they withdrew from the center of the chamber to stand on either side leaving the long axis of the cavern open the entrance upon one end the white throne upon the other last of all the white king himself rose and descended from the enormous throne to move to one side of the cavern on the right side of the room were all the members of malvora and skavis and on the left gathered the members of house raith the skavis and malvora werent actually standing together but there was a sense of hungry anticipation in the air vampires standing on both sidelines ramirez said guess no one wants to catch a stray lightning bolt or bullet i muttered but it wont help them much if things get confused and turned around once the fight starts raith snapped a finger and thralls in their white kimonos began filing into the room they swayed more than walked filing down the sidelines of the dueling ground and then simply knelt down in a pair of double ranks in front of the vampires on either side of the chamber they formed taken together a wall like that around a hockey arenabut one made of living human flesh crap any form of mayhem that spread to the sidelines was going to run smack into human victimsand my own powers in a fight were not exactly surgical instruments torrents of flame blasts of force and impenetrable bastions of will were sort of my thing you will note however how seldom words like torrent blast and bastion get used in conjunction with terms that denote delicacy and precision ramirez was going to be better off than i was in that regard his combat skills ran more to speed and accuracy versus my own preference for massive destruction but they were no less deadly in their own way carlos looked back and forth then said to me theyre going to try to stay on our flanks use those people in the background to keep us from cutting loose i know i never went to warden combat school i told him but i feel i should remind you that this is not my first time ramirez grimaced at me you just arent going to let that go are you i showed him my teeth so i hit them fast and hard while you keep them off me if they flank youre on offense while i keep them off of you try to maneuver them out to where ill have a clean shot ramirez scowled and his voice came out with more than the usual heat yes thank you harry you want to tie my shoes for me before we start whoa whats that i asked him oh come on man ramirez said quietly his voice tight and angry youre lying to me youre lying to the council i stared at him im not an idiot man ramirez said his expression neutral you can barely get by in latin but you speak ghoul ancient etruscan theres more going on here than a duel and internal politics dresden youre involved with these things more than you should be you know them too well which is a really fucking disturbing thing to realize considering were talking about a race of mindbenders vitto and madrigal emerged from the malvoran contingent vitto bore a long rapier at his side and there were a number of throwing knives on his belt as well as a heavy pistol in a holster madrigal meanwhile carried a spear with a sevenfoot haft and his arms were wrapped with two long strips of black cloth covered in vaguely oriental characters in metallic red thread id have guessed that they were constructs of some kind even before i felt the ripple of magical energy in them as he walked with vitto to stand facing us from thirty feet away carlos i said this is one hell of a time to start having doubts about my loyalty dammit harry he said im not backing out on you its too late for that even if i wanted to but this whole thing feels more and more like a setup every second i couldnt argue with him there i was pretty sure it was i looked back and forth down the length of the ranks of vampires all of whom watched in total silence now grey eyes bright edging over into metallic silver with their rising hunger the formalities of the accords had kept us alive and largely unmolested here amidst the monsters but if we deviated from the conventions wed never live to see the surface again we were in the same position as madrigal and vitto really win or die and i didnt delude myself for one single second that this was going to be as simple as a standup fight part of the nature of the white court was treachery as well it was only a matter of time and timing before one of them turned on us and if we werent ready when it happened wed either be dead or getting fitted for our own white robes vitto and madrigal squared off against us hands on their weapons i took a deep breath and faced them beside me ramirez did the same lord raith reached up his sleeve and withdrew a handkerchief of red silk he offered it to lara who took it and walked slowly down the lines of kneeling thralls she stopped at the sidelines midway between us and slowly lifted the red silk gentlemen she said stand ready let no weapon of any kind be drawn until this cloth reaches the earth my heart started pounding faster and i drew my duster back enough to put a hand near the handle of my blasting rod lara flicked the scarlet silk cloth into the air and it began to fall ramirez was right this was a trap i had done everything i could to prepare for it but the bottom line was that i was not sure what was going to happen but like the man said it was too late to back out now the cloth hit the floor and my hand blurred for my blasting rod as the duel began chapter thirtyeight some people are faster than others im fast always have been especially for a man my size but this duel had gotten off to a fair start and no merely mortal hand is faster than a vampires vitto malvoras gun cleared its holster before my fingers had tightened on the blasting rods handle the weapon resembled a fairly standard model but it had an extension to the usual ammunition clip sticking out of the handle and it spat a spray of bullets in the voice of a yowling buzz saw some vampires are faster than others vitto was fast hed drawn and fired more swiftly than id ever seen thomas move more swiftly than id seen lara shoot but bodies even nighimmortal vampire bodies are made of flesh and blood and have mass and inertia no hand not even a vampires is swifter than thought ramirez already had his power held ready when the scarlet cloth hit the ground and in that instant he hissed a single syllable under his breath and flipped his left hand palm up that bizarre glove he wore flashed and let out a rattling buzz of furious sound a sudden gelatinous cloud of green light interposed itself between us and the vampires before even vitto could fire the bullets struck against that gooey cloud sending watery ripple patterns racing across it plowing a widening furrow through the semisolid mass there was a hissing sound a sharp pain high up on my left cheek and then i was slapped across the chest by a spray of tiny dark particles the size of grains of sand ramirezs shield was nothing like my own i used raw force to create my own steelhard barrier ramirezs spell was based on principles of entropy and water magic and focused on disrupting shattering and dispersing any objects trying to pass through it turning their own energy against them even magic must do business with physics and carlos couldnt simply make the energy the bullets carried go away instead the spell reduced their force by shattering the bullets with their own momentum breaking them into zillions of tiny pieces spreading them out so that their individual impact energy would be negligible when the dispersed cloud of leaden sand struck me it was unpleasant and uncomfortable but it had lost so much power that it wouldnt have gotten through an ordinary leather coat or even a thick shirt much less my spelllaced duster if id had time to breathe a sigh of relief i would have i didnt every bit of focus i had was bent on slamming a surge of energy and will through my blasting rod even before i had the business end lifted all the way up fuego i cried a column of fire as thick as a telephone pole flew from the tip of the rod struck the ground twenty feet away and then whipped across the floor toward vitto as i finished lifting my weapon he was fast hed barely had time to register that his bullets had missed their target before the fire came for him but he flung himself to one side in a desperate dive as he went he gained enough of an angle to get him just around the edge of rodriguezs highly visible shield and the vampires hand flickered to his belt to whip one of those knives at me in a sidearmed throw it would have been a waste of time for any human thrown knives arent terribly good killing weapons to begin withi mean in the movies and tv every time someone throws a knife it kills somebody wham it slams to the hilt in their chest right into the heart or glurk it sinks into their throat and they die instantly real knives dont generally kill you unless the thrower gets abnormally lucky real knives if they hit with the pointy part at all generally only inflict a survivableif very distractinginjury of course when real people throw real knives they dont fling them at a couple of hundred miles an hour most of them havent had centuries to practice either that knife flickered as it came and if i hadnt hunched up my shoulder and tucked my face down behind it the knife might have found the flesh of my neck and killed me instead its tip struck the dusters mantle at an oblique angle and the weapon skittered off the spellarmored coat and tumbled off on a wobbly arc vitto landed in a tumble teeth clenched over a scream of pain his left leg was on fire from the knee down but he was smarthe didnt stop drop and roll in fact he didnt stop at all and it was the only thing that kept my second blast from immolating him the lance of flame missed him by a foot and momentarily smashed the curtain of falling water behind the white throne into steam beside me i heard ramirez fling out one of those green blasts harry ramirez screamed i turned my head in time to see madrigal coming at us from nearly straight ahead his spear in hand ramirez hurled a second shaft of green light at him but it splashed against an unseen barrier a foot away from his body glitters of golden light ran up and down the symbols on the cloth strips wrapped around his arms i understood then ramirezs second shot had been a demonstration hes warded ramirez snarled drop back i snapped as vitto came streaking toward me down the other sideline he was reloading the gun as he came dropping the old magazine slapping a new one in i lifted my shield bracelet readying itthen hesitated for a fraction of a second to get the timing just right gauging angles of incidence and refraction vittos hand game up and the gun snarled again i brought the shield up at the last second a flat plane perpendicular to the floor and ramirez took a hopping step back just in time to get behind the shield as it formed twenty or thirty bullets ricocheted off the invisible barrier in a shower of sparksand spalled more or less toward madrigal raith and his magical protection the nifty armbands apparently werent made to stop physical projectiles because one of the bouncing bullets ripped through the outside of his thigh with an ugly explosion of torn cloth and a misty burst of pale blood he screamed and faltered throwing out one hand to catch his balance before he could hit the floor drop it ramirez shouted his hand blurred toward his pistol and he drew it before madrigal could get moving again i pivoted the shield to clear ramirez taking a couple of steps forward to wall vitto away from carloss flank and transmuted the far surface of the shield into a reflective mirror ramirezs gun began to roar beside memeasured shots that were actually aimed as opposed to the rapid crackcrackcrack of panic fire vitto reacted to the gunfire and the suddenly appearing mirrored wall ten feet long and eight feet high with instant violence he flung the heavy handgun at a suddenly appearing and swiftmoving target before he could realize that it was his own reflection the gun had its slide locked open and when it hit the shield at the speed he threw it something in the assembly slipped and it bounced off in several pieces vitto slowed down for a step eyes widening and i didnt blame him one bit it would have made me blink for a second if my opponent had suddenly changed open air into the back wall of a dance studio then he accelerated again and did something i wasnt ready for he bounded straight up into the air a good ten or twelve feet arching over the top of my shield in an instant and flinging knives with each hand as he came i threw up my right arm trying to interpose it with the oncoming knife as far out from my body as i could the knife hit flat which was fine where the leather of my dusters sleeve covered my arm the handle of the knife though hit my naked wrist and my right hand abruptly went numb i heard the other knife whisper as it tumbled through the air beside me missing me madre de dios carlos screamed the blasting rod tumbled from my useless fingers i cursed and flung myself to one side as vitto landed on the inside of my shield his sword whipping from its scabbard in a horizontal slash at my throat my tactical thinking had been limited to two dimensions maybe reinforced by the mockery of the sports field we fought on the second knife had missed me because vitto hadnt been aiming for me its handle now protruded from ramirezs right calf i couldnt move my fingers correctly which precluded the use of the energy rings on my right hand i dropped the shieldall it would do with him already so close was slow down my movement id have to reform it between me and him the second i got a chance which he didnt seem inclined to give me he sent a lightningquick thrust at my guts and i had to dance back a pair of steps to buy myself enough time to parry it with a sweep of the staff in my left hand there was no way i could fence with vitto even if he didnt totally outclass me physically fighting onearmed with a staff against a competent fighter with a rapier is not a winning proposition if i tried it id be backing away from him in circles until i tripped he slashed a few of my fingers off and finished me or else forced me away from ramirez long enough to doubleteam him and kill him i couldnt sling magic at him either his back was to the crowd of vampires and the human victims shielding them and he was damned fast anything i could throw that would have hurt him could missand if it missed itd kill anyone who got in the way i couldnt take my eyes off vitto for a secondi had to hope that ramirez was holding his own against madrigal i had to buy time and distance i slammed will and hellfire through my staff snarled forzare and released it in a broad wave that lashed out into absolutely everything in front of me the wave of force caught vitto and flung him from his feet he hit a brawny thrall with a neatly clipped goatee and then the wave caught up and struck the man too as well as the folk on either side of him they were flung back into the second row of kneeling thralls and they in turn were all bowled back into the crowd of vampires behind them to a general scream of surprise and dismay it hadnt been a lot of force by the time it got to the thralls not all spread out like that i could have delivered tackles that hit harder it had been enough though to tangle vittowhose leg was still on fire by the wayin a pile of courtiers and thralls welcome ladies and gentlemen i hollered to bowling for vampires to my intense discomfort a round of laughs went up from the raith contingent and i got a smattering of applause i raised my shield again into a shimmering half dome of glittering silver and blue light this time and twisted my head around to look for ramirez i turned in time to see madrigal bleeding from several gunshot wounds rush forward spear held high ramirez had fallen to one knee his wounded leg unable to support his weight and as i watched he dropped the desert eagle and gathered another bolt of disintegrating emerald force in his right hand madrigal laughed at him the sound silvery and scornful and now that he was in motion i could see the chromium glitter of the demonic hunger in his eyes his protective armbands flickered brightly as he rushed forward ramirez i screamed madrigal raised the spear ramirez flung the gathered energy in a last useless strike that missed madrigal entirety and splashed on the stone at his feet a section of stone the size of a big bathtub glowed green for a split second then shattered into dust so fine that its individual grains would be almost invisible to the naked eye just as my average preparation session for a fight does not involve considering twelvefoot kung fu leaps from knifethrowing masters i guess madrigals practices didnt take into account floors that might suddenly become pools of nearly frictionless dust he let out a shriek and plunged into it flailing wildly i could see the wheels spinning in his head trying to work out what had happened and how the hell he would get out of it ramirez shot a look over his shoulder and snarled harry the fingers of my right hand were tingling i raised it clenching it into a weak fist it was good enough to align the rings with my thoughts go madrigal had worked it out he thrashed to one side of the trough ramirezs spell had eaten in the floor thrust the handle of his spear down into the ultrafine dust and shoved himself roughly up and out of the sand trap but not before ramirez drew the silver wardens blade from his hip the sword designed to let the wardens of the white council slice into any enchantment unraveling it with a single stroke carlos drew it lunged out onto his wounded leg with a cry of pain and challenge and sliced the willow blade left and right at madrigal while the spear was grounded and locked into place supporting him the sword cut through the wooden haft of the spear snickersnack which was itself an indicator of just how unbelievably sharp an edge it had to have carried luccio did good work that was just collateral damage though the warden blade also licked lightly across each of madrigals arms the black cloth armbands erupted into sudden flame the embroidered symbols on them flaring into painfully brilliant light as if the scarlet thread had been made of magnesium any construct that held enough energy to counteract the magic of a majorleague wizard especially a combat specialist like ramirez had to have been holding all kinds of energy ramirez had just cut it loose madrigal stared down in sudden panic at the fire writhing up his arms and let out a horrified scream i crouched clenched my fist a little tighter narrowed my eyes and with a single thought released every bit of energy in the ringswhat had been left over after the ghoul attack and what i had added later all at the same time the power hit madrigal low in the belly at a slightly upward angle it slammed him from his feet as the fire blazed over his arms lifted him up over the heads of the gathered raith contingent like a living sizzling comet and slammed him into the cavern wall behind them with literally boneshattering power broken bleeding wreckage tumbled limply down and the wizards i snarled pick up the spare i turned back to face vitto who was only then clawing his way out of a pile of confused and unhappy skavis and malvora vampires and meekly passive thralls he came to his feet with his sword in hand i faced him through the glowing dome i heard a grunt and then ramirez stepped up beside me silver sword in hand still stained with madrigals pinkish blood his staff in the other taking some of the weight from his injured foot i kept the dome up recovered my blasting rod and raised it calling up my will letting fire illuminate the runes carved down its length one sigil at a time the new shield was more taxing than the old and i was getting tiredbut there was nothing to do about that but keep going there were rustling sounds all around us vampires came to their feet they edged closer to the thralls shifted position so that they would be able to see there were murmurs and whispers all around us as the white court sensed that the end was near vittos aunt was not far from him and she stood with one hand to her delicate throatbut she stood fast watching anxiety and calculation warring for space in her eyes just over one shoulder i could just barely make out laras profile as she leaned forward over the thrall kneeling between her and the fightjustineto watch the end her lips parted and glistening wet her eyes glowing the spectacle of it sickened me but i thought i understood something of what triggered it in them death did not come swiftly to vampiresbut the old reaper was in the house and when he struck he would take lives that should have lasted for centuries more that realization let me understand something else about the white courtthat for all of their allure that forbidden attraction the unnatural magnetism of a creature so beautiful outside and so twisted within with their ability to give you the greatest pleasure of your life even as they snuffed it outthey the vampires themselves were not immune to that dark attraction they were regular neareternal voyeurs to deaths handiwork after all they saw the mingled ecstasy and terror on the faces of those they took they fed upon the surrender of life and passion to the endless silenceknowing all the while that in the end they were no different one day one night it would be their turn to face the scythe and the dark cowl and that they would fall fall just as helplessly as their own prey had over and over and over death had already taken madrigal raith and it would soon take vitto malvora and the white court one and all longed to see it happen to feel death brush close by to be tantalized by its nearness to revel in its presence and passing words could not express how badly they needed therapy dysfunctional sickos i put it out of my head i still had work to do all right i growled to ramirez you ready he bared his teeth in a ferocious smile lets get it on vitto malvora the last of annas killers faced me steadily his eyes gone white i thought that for a man about to face two fairly deadly wizards determined to kill him he did not look terribly frightened in fact he looked pleased oh crap vitto threw back his head and spread his arms i dropped the shield and shouted kill him vitto lifted his voice in a sudden thunderous roar and i could sense the will and the power that underlay his call master ramirez was a beat slow in transferring his sword to his other hand so that he could fling green fire at vitto and the vampire lowered his arms and crossed them in front of him hissing words in some strange tongue as he did ramirezs strike shattered upon that defense though bits of greenish fire dribbled onto vittos arms each of them chewing out a scoop of flesh as far across as a nickel crap ramirez snarled but i didnt have time to listen i could feel it feel power building on the cave floor in front of the white throne it wasnt explosive magic but it was strong quivering on a level so fundamental that i could feel it in my bones a second later i recognized this power i had felt the dim echoes of its passing months before in a cave in new mexico there was a deep throb then another then a third and then the air before the white throne suddenly swirled it spun for a moment and then there was abruptly an oblong disk of darkness hanging in the air it spun open pushing the space of the cavern aside and a dank musty mildewscented flood of cold air washed out of the passage that had been opened from the nevernever and into the deeps seconds later there was movement in the passage and then a ghoul sprang through it well i call it a ghoul but just looking at it i knew i was seeing something from another age it was like seeing drawings of things from the last ice agefamiliar animals most of them but they were all too large too heavy with muscle many of them festooned with extra tusks spurs of horn and lumpy armored hide this thing this ghoul was of the same order eight feet tall if it was an inch and its hunched shoulders were so wide that it made the thing look more like a gorilla than it did a hyena or baboon the way most of them did it had serrated ridges of horn on its stark cheekbones and its jaw was far more massive with muscle its forearms were even longer than a normal ghouls its claws heavier longer and backed by knobbed ridges of horn that would let the thing crush and smash as effectively as it sliced and diced its brow ridge was far heavier too and its eyes so recessed as to be little more than glitters from the indirect lighting could hardly be seen the ghoul crouched and leaped twenty feet forward with an easy grace then landed with a roar that made my knees feel a little weak more of them poured out of the gate ten twenty they kept coming and coming hells bells i whispered beside me ramirez swallowed i he said am going to die a virgin vitto let out a wild cackle of glee and howled at last he actually capered a little dance step in place at last the masquerade ends kill them kill them all i dont know if it was one of the vampires or one of the thralls but suddenly a woman screamed in utter terror and the ghouls went mad with bloodlust and surged forward in an unstoppable wave i dropped all the power in my shield and all that i had put into the blasting rod too neither of them would get me out of the hellish cuisinart of pain and death that this cavern was about to become right then i panted this would be the trap chapter thirtynine i knew it ramirez snarled i knew it was a setup he turned to look and me and then blinked it was only then that i realized that i had my teeth bared in a wide smile thats right i told him it is i have seen some real pros open gateways to the nevernever the youngest of the summer queens of the sidhe could open them so smoothly that youd never see it happening until it was over id seen cowl open ways to the nevernever as casually and easily as a screen door with the gate itself being barely noticeable until it vanished a few seconds later leaving behind it the same musty smell now flooding the cavern i couldnt do it that smoothly or with that much subtlety but i could do it just as quickly and just as effectively i spun on my heel as the ghouls flooded the cavern and plunged into the gathered members of the white court in a killing frenzy go ramirez shouted i cant run anyway ill hold them get out of here get over yourself and cover my back i snarled i gathered my will again shifting my staff into my right hand the runes on the staff blazed to life and i pointed the staff across my body at the air four feet off the cavern floor then i released my gathered will focused by my intentions and the energies aligned in my staff and shouted aparturum furious golden and scarlet light flowed down the length of wood searing a seam in reality i drew the staff from left to right drawing a line of fire in the airand after a heartbeat that line expanded burning up like a fire running up a curtain down like rain sluicing down a car window and left behind it a gateway an opening from the raith deeps to the nevernever the gate opened on a cold and frozen woodland scene silvery moonlight slipped through and a freezing wind gusted blowing powdery white snow into the cavernsubstance of the spirit world which transformed into clear if chilly gelatin the ectoplasm left behind when spirit matter reverted to its natural state there was a stir of shadows and then my brother burst through the opening saber in one hand sawedoff shotgun in the other thomas was dressed in heavy biker leather and body armor with honesttogod chain mail covering the bikers jacket his hair was tied back in a tail and his eyes were blazing with excitement harry take your time i barked back at him were not in a crisis or anything the others are right behlook out i spun in time to see one of the ghouls bound into the air and sail toward me the claws on both its hands and feet extended to rip and slash ramirez shouted and flung one of his green blasts at the thing it caught the ghoul at the apex of its flight and simply bored a hole the size of a garbage can in its lower abdomen the ghoul landed in a splatter of gore and fury it kept fighting though its legs flopped around like a seals tail of almost no use to it i sprang backor at least i tried to spring opening a gate to the nevernever is not complicated but it isnt easy either and between that and all the fighting id done i was beginning to bump up against my physical limits my legs wobbled and my spring was more like the lazy hot and motionless end of summer thomas dragged me the last six inches or i wouldnt have avoided the ghouls claws he extended his arm shotgun in hand and blew the ghouls head off its shoulders in a spray of flying bits of bone and horn and a mist of horrible black blood after which the ghoul seized him with one arm and began raking its talons at him with the other the terrible power of the mangled ghoul was enormous links of chain mail snapped and went flying and thomas let out a scream of surprise and outrage what the hell he snarled he dropped the shotgun and took off the ghouls attacking arm with his saber then he broke the grip of the last clawed hand and flung the ghouls body away from him what the hell was that he gasped recovering the shotgun uh i said that was one harry ramirez said backpedaling as best he could with the wounded leg and bumped into me i steadied him before he lost his balance that damned knife was still sticking out of his calf a dozen more ghouls were charging us everything slowed down the way it sometimes does when fresh adrenaline shifts me into overdrive the cavern had gone insane the ghouls had been there for maybe thirty seconds but there were several dozen of them at least with more pouring out of the neat oval gate on the other side of the cavern the ghouls had apparently attacked everyone with equal amounts of ferocity and fury more of them had poured into the malvoran and skavis contingent than the raith side but that might have been a function of simple numbers and proximity the vampires most of them unarmed and unprepared for a fight had been taken off guard that doesnt mean as much to vamps as it does to regular folks but the walls had been splattered with pale blood where the ghouls had rushed in among them and the battle now raging was horrific in one spot lady malvora ripped the arm from a ghouls socket her skin gone marblewhite and hardlooking and proceeded to beat it about the head and shoulders with its own detached limb the ghoul went down with a shattered skull but four more of the creatures buried the white court noblewoman under their weight and power and literally ripped her to pieces in front of my eyes elsewhere a male vampire picked up an eightfootlong sofa and slammed its end down onto a pair of ghouls ripping at the body of a fallen thrall still elsewhere lord skavis had rallied a number of his retainers to him standing off against the maddened ghouls like a rock ignoring a flash floodfor the moment at least other sights werent nearly so pleasant a vampire trying to flee tripped over a human thrall a girl no more than eighteen and dealt her a blow of his fist in pure frustration snapping her neck he was brought down by ghouls a breath later elsewhere other vampires seemed to have lost control of their demonic hunger completely and they had thrown down whatever thralls they could seize with no regard for gender or for what their particular favorite food might be one thrall writhing under a skavis was screaming and pushing her thumbs into her own eyes another shuddered under the fearcompulsion of a malvora clearly in the midst of a seizure or heart attack right up until a tide of ghouls overran predator and prey alike the raith didnt seem to be as wholly frenzied as the other housesor maybe theyd just eaten more today i saw only a couple of thralls downed by them being torn out of their clothes and ravaged on the stone like those near lord skavis a core of organization had formed around lara and her father someonei saw a flash of justines terrified facewas holding a little air horn up and triggering it wildly i spotted vitto malvora charging the ghouls around his fallen auntand watched as he threw himself on the remains with an inhuman howl and began feasting beside the creatures who had killed her it had taken seconds for intrigue to devolve into insanity in a thousand simultaneous nightmareinducing vignettesnone of which i could afford to think significant save one the dozen ghouls plunging directly toward me like a football team on the kickoff huge and fast and ferocious charging me on a straight line from the enemy gate for a second i thought i saw a dark shape in that gate the suggestion of an outlined hood and cloak it might have been cowl id have hit him with all the fire i could call if id had a second to spare but i didnt i brought my shield up as the ghouls came over the floor and held it fast as the leader of the pack slammed into it in a flare of blue and silver light and a cloud of sparks the ghoul only howled and began slamming at the barrier with his fists every single one hit with the energy of a lowspeed car crash and even with my nifty new bracelet i could feel the surge of power i needed to keep the shield steady when each of the blows came thundering down boots thudded behind me someone was shouting bam bam bam the ghoul slammed against my shield and it was an almost painful effort to hold it justine thomas screamed i wouldnt be able to hold this ghoul off for longwhich was all right because the other eleven were going to go right around my shield while he forced me to hold it steady against him and tear me into tiny pieces and eat me hopefully in that order bootsteps thudded behind me and a voice barked a second ghoul several steps in front of the rest flung itself around my shield but was intercepted by ramirez it leaped at him and hit that gelatinouslooking green cloud of a shield he used what happened to the ghoul as its speed carried its whole mass all the way through the shield does not bear thinking on but ramirez was going to need new clothes bam bam bam murphy screamed harry thomas ramirez down i dropped and dragged carlos down with me lowering my shield as i went thomas hit the ground a fraction of a second after i did and the world came apart in thunder sound hammered at my head and ears and i found myself screaming in pain and shock before i ground my teeth and shot a quick glance behind me trying not to lift my head any higher than i had to murphy knelt on the ground by my feet in her dark fatigues body armor black baseball cap and amber safety glasses she had a weird little rectangular gun about the size of a big box of chocolates held to one shoulder it had a tiny little barrel one of those little red dot optical sights and murphys cheek was laid on it one eye aligned with the sight as she poured automatic fire into the oncoming ghouls in neat chattering bursts that ripped the ghoul that had been pounding on my shield into a spray of broken bits it went over backward thrashing one arm and howling in agony beside murphy playing clifford the big red dog to her emily elizabeth was hendricks the huge redheaded enforcer was also kneeling and firing but the gun he held to his shoulder was approximately the size of an intercontinental ballistic missile and spat out a stream of tracer rounds that ripped into the attacking creatures with a vengeance several men i recognized from marcones organization were lined up next to him all firing so were several more men i didnt recognize but whose clothing and equipment were sufficiently different to make me think they were freelancers hired for the job a few more were still pouring through the open gate and into the cavern the ghouls were hardy as hell but there is a difference between shrugging off a few rounds from a sidearm and wading through the disciplined hail of assaultweapon fire that marcones people laid down on them had it been one man firing at one ghoul it might have been differentbut it wasnt there were at least twenty of them shooting into a packed mass and they kept shooting even after the targets were thrashing on the ground until their guns were empty then they reloaded and returned to firing marcone had given his men the instructions id advisedand i imagined the guns he had hired on must have been used to facing supernatural threats of this sort as well marcone was nothing if not resourceful murphy stopped shooting and screamed something at me but it wasnt until marcone stepped forward into the peripheral vision of the armed gunmen and held up a hand with a closed fist that they stopped firing for a second nothing but a high heavy tone buzzed in my ears making me deaf to the other sounds in the cavern the air was full of the sewer stench of wounded ghoul and the sharp scent of burning cordite a swath of stone floor ten yards across and thirty deep had just been carpeted in pureed ghoul the fight was still going on all around us but the main force of ghouls was concentrating on the hardpressed vampires wed bought ourselves a temporary quiet spot but it couldnt last harry murphy screamed over the merely horrific cacophony of the slaughter i gave her a thumbsup i pushed myself to my feet someone gave me a hand up and i took it gratefullyuntil i saw that it was marcone dressed in his black fatigues holding a shotgun in his other hand i jerked my fingers away as if he were more disgusting than the things fighting and dying all around us his cold green eyes wrinkled at the corners dresden if its all right with you i think it would be prudent to retreat back through the gate that was probably a very smart idea the gate was six feet away from me we could pull up stakes hop through and close it behind us gates to the spirit world paid absolutely no attention to trivial things like geographythey obeyed laws of imagination intention patterned thought even if cowl was back there he wouldnt be able to open a gate to the same place as mine because he didnt think like me feel like me or share my intent and purpose seeing fallout from the war with the red court had convinced me that running when you didnt have to fight was a really great idea in fact the merlin had written a letter to the wardens directing them to do so rather than lose even more of our dwindling combat resources if we hung around much longer no one was getting out of this abattoir thomass sword came down on a thrashing ghoul and he shouted with desperation bordering on madness justine he spun to me harry help me leaving was smart but my brother wasnt leaving not without the girl so i wasnt leaving without her either come to think of it there were a whole lot of people who didnt need to be here and in point of fact there were some damned compelling reasons to take them with us when we went those reasons didnt make it any less dangerous and they sure as hell didnt make the idea any less scary but that didnt stop them from existing without laras peace initiative fronted by her puppet father the white court would pitch in more heavily with the reds than they already had if i didnt get lara and her puppet out what was already a grim war with the vampires would quite possibly become an impossible one that was a damned good reason to stay but it wasnt the one that kept me there i saw another ghoul tear into a helpless unresisting thrall closed my eyes for a second and realized that if i did nothing to save as many as i could i would never leave this cavern oh sure i might get out alive but id be back here every time i closed my eyes dresden marcone shouted i agreed to an extraction not to a war a wars all weve got i shouted back weve got to get raith out of this in one piece or the whole thing was for nothing and no one pays you off no one will pay me off if im dead either marcone said i snarled and stepped closer getting into marcones face hendricks rolled a half a step toward me and growled murphy seized the huge man by one enormous paw did something that involved his wrist and his index finger and with a grunt hendricks dropped to one knee while murphy held one of his arms out straight behind him and angled painfully upward take it easy big guy she said someone might get hurt dont move marcone snarledto his men not to me his eyes never wavered from mine yes dresden i could tell you to do it or id strand you all in the nevernever on the way home i said quietly i could tell you to help me or id close the gate and wed all die here i could even tell you to do it or id burn you to ashes where you stand but i wont tell you that marcone narrowed his eyes no no threats wont deter you we both know that i cant force you to do anything and we both know that too i jerked my head at the cavern people are dying john help me save them god please help me marcones head rocked back as if id slapped him after a second he asked who do you think i am wizard someone who can help them i said maybe the only one he stared at me with empty opaque eyes then he said very quietly yes i felt a fierce smile stretch my mouth and turned to ramirez at once stay here with these guys and hold the gate who are these people ramirez said later i whirled back to marcone ramirez is with the council like me keep him covered and hold the gate marcone pointed at several of the men you you you guard this man and hold the gate he pointed out several more you you you you you start rounding up anyone close enough to us to get to without undue risk and help them through men leaped to obey and i felt impressed id never seen marcone quite like this before animated decisive and totally confident despite the nightmare all around there was a power to it something that brought order to the terrifying chaos around us i could see why men followed him how he had conquered the underworld of chicago one of the hired guns cut loose with a burst of fire still shockingly loud enough to make me flinch you know what else i asked marcone i dont really need this cave neither do you marcone narrowed his eyes at me then nodded once and said something over his shoulder to one of the hired guns dresden i would appreciate it if you would ask the sergeant to release my employee murph i complained cant you pick on someone your own size i took a second to admire hendrickss expression but said we need him with his arm still attached murphy eased up on the pressure and then released hendrickss arm the big man eyed murphy rubbing his arm but regained his feet and his enormous machine gun harry thomas said voice tight we need to move yeah i said thomas murphy and we needed mass hendricks with me hendricks checked that with marcone who nodded follow me i told them staywhat are you doing marcone marcone had accepted a weapon from one of his gunmen a deadly little mac that could spew out about a berjillion bullets in a second or two he checked it and clipped a strap hanging from it to a ring on his weapon harness im going with you and you dont have enough time to waste any more of it arguing with me about it dammit he was right fine follow my lead and stay close were going to go round up lord raith and get him and everyone else we can out of here before marcone abruptly raised his shotgun and put a blast through one of the nearer fallen ghouls that had begun to move it thrashed and he put a second shell into it the ghoul stopped moving that was when i noticed that the black ichor that spewed from the ghouls was on the ground and it was moving by itself the black fluid rolled and ran like liquid mercury gathering together in little droplets then larger gobs those in turn ran over the flooruphill in some casesback toward broken ghoul bodies as i watched bits of missing flesh ripped from the ghouls began to fill in again as the ichor returned to their bodies the one thomas had beheaded actually came crawling back over the floor having regained some of the use of its legs it was holding its head up against the stump of its neck with its one arm and the ichor was flowing from both the severed head and the stump merging reattaching it i saw the ghouls jaws suddenly stretch its eyes blink and then focus on me holy crap time we didnt have much time if even the gutted and mangled ghouls could get back up again there was no way the vampires were winning this one the best they could hope for was to runand when more vamps ran more ghouls would be free to overwhelm us or possibly theyd do something even more disgusting than they already had and wed all puke ourselves to death this just cant get much more disturbing i muttered follow me i gripped my staff in both hands and charged ahead into the mass of maddened vampires and ghouls to save one monster from another chapter forty i sprinted toward the little knot of struggling vampires around the white king while dozens of uberghouls ripped into the leading families of the white court i slipped on some slimy ichor but didnt fall on my ass for me thats actually pretty good i noted more details on the way and started trying to think ahead of the next few seconds assuming we got to the white king in one piece and convinced lara to team up and follow us then what what was the next step at least a dozen ghouls bounded out the tunnel heading up that long slope to the caves entrance theyd be in a good position to stop laras mortal security forces from pushing through the tunnel to rescue the king stopping a charge over open ground with firearms is one thing using a gun to charge a large deadly powerful predator in close quarters is a different proposition entirelyand not a winning one naturally the ghouls in the tunnel would also be in position to intercept anyone who tried to flee which meant that we had to leave through the gate which meant that if ramirez and marcones men lost it we were screwed and that meant that if cowl was over there and saw what was going on he would hardly sit by doing nothing i might be able to counter him if i were defending the gate my skills arent fine but im pretty strong and im good at adapting them on the fly cowl had cleaned my clock in two fights already but slowing and delaying him wasnt the same as trying to wipe the walls with him even if i couldnt be a real threat to him personally i could tie him up long enough to hold the gate until we could skedaddle ramirez couldnt he was a dangerous combat wizard but his skills just werent strong enough or broad enough to pose a significant obstacle to cowl if cowlor vitto for that mattersaw what was going on and the ghouls concentrated on the gate the shrieks and roars of the struggle on our right suddenly got louder and i saw the resistance around lord skavis and his henchmen suddenly buckle the horrible glee of the ghouls rushing into the opening was almost more terrifying than the carnage that followed i caught a glimpse of vitto malvora in the middle of the mess shoving a ghoul toward a wounded vampire snarling at others giving orders the largest of the ghouls were with vitto that vampire has the strongest and largest of those creatures with him marcone called to me as we ran hell hit any pockets of resistance with them use them as a hammer i can see that i snapped murphy marcone cover our right hendricks thomas get ready to go in go in where hendricks asked i took my staff in hand focused on the fight raging around the white king and called up my will and hellfire in the hole im about to make i growled get them out theyre mostly eating now but the second we start to break them free marcone cautioned from behind me these others are going to come after us i know i said ill handle it i felt something warm press up against my lower backmurphys shoulders well make sure that her voice broke off suddenly and that boxy little submachine gun chattered in three quick bursts punctuated by a single throaty roar from marcones shotgun holy crap that was close another marcone warned and the shotgun blasted again the air horn in justines hand started blaring more desperately harry thomas shouted go i shouted at thomas and hendricks then i leveled the staff at the nearest clump of the enormous ghouls and shouted forzare my will lashed out leashed to lasciels hellfire and rushed upon the ghouls exploding in a sphere of raw force that blazed with flickers of sulfurous flame it blew them up and outward like extras on the set of the ateam flying in high arcs some of them flew right through the falling curtain of water behind the throne and into the abyssal depths below others slammed hard into the nearest wall and still others fell among the frenzied ghouls now finishing off lord skavis and his retainers thomas and hendricks charged forward my brother had slipped his shotgun into a sheath over one shoulder and now wielded his saber in one hand and that inwardbent knife in the other the first ghoul he reached was still staggered from the blast that had sent his companions flying and thomas never gave him a chance to recover the saber removed its arm and a scything upwardsweeping slash of the crooked knife struck its head from its shoulders a vicious kick to the small of its back crunched into its spine and sent the maimed beheaded creature flying into the next in the line hendricks came in at thomass side the big man could not possibly overpower one of the ghouls despite all the muscle but he did have an important factor on his side mass hendricks was a huge man three hundred pounds and more and once i saw him hit the ghouls i no longer had any doubts about whether he had played football he hit an unbalanced ghoul in the back knocking the creature sprawling slammed the stock of the huge gun into the neck of a ghoul who turned to follow thomass motion then ducked a shoulder and slammed it into the stunned creatures flank sending it sprawling thomas hacked down another ghoul hendricks powered through a single creature who never had the chance to set itself against his locomotive rush and we were suddenly faced with a line of savage goddesses bathed in black blood lara stood in the center her white robes pressed against her skin soaked in the dark fluids leaking from crushed and broken ghouls and it left absolutely nothing to the imagination her hair too had been soaked flat to her skull and it clung to the skin of her blackspattered cheek and to the lines of her darkstained throat in each hand she held a long wavybladed knife long enough to qualify as a small sword though god only knew where shed concealed the weapons before her eyes were chrome silver wide and triumphant and i jerked my gaze away from them as i felt a mad desire just to stare and see what happened in that moment lara was more than simply a vampire of the white court a succubus pale and deadly she was a reminder of days gone by when mankind paid homage to bloodsoaked goddesses of war and death revered the dark side of the protective maternal spirit the savage core of the strength that still allowed tiny women to lift cars off of their children or to turn upon their tormentors with newfound power laras power at that moment hovered around her deadly in its primal seduction its sheer strength on either side of her stood two of her sisters all of them tall all of them beautiful all of them gorgeous and soaked in gore all of them armed with those wavybladed short swords i didnt know any of them but they stared at me with ravenous energy with maddeningly seductive destruction spattered all over them and it took me two or three seconds to remember what the hell was going on lara swayed a step toward me all the motion in her thighs and hips her eyes brilliant and steady focused on me and i felt a sudden urge to kneel that vibrated in my brain and elsewhere i mean how bad could that be just think of the view from down there and it had been a long time since a woman had i dimly heard murphys gun chattering again and marcones and i shook my head and kept my feet then i scowled at lara and croaked we dont have time for this do you want out or not thomas justine cried she appeared from behind lara and the raith sisters and threw herself bodily upon my brother thomas wrapped an arm around her without releasing his grip on his knife and pressed her hard against him i could see his profile as she held him back and his face was transported i suppose thomas always had a certain look whether he was making a joke working out or giving me a hard time about something the sense of him was always the same selfcontained confident pleased with himself and unimpressed with the world around him in justines arms he looked like a man in mourning but he bent his whole body to her holding her with every fiber and sinew not merely his arm and every line of his face became softer somehow gentler as though he had been suddenly relieved of an intolerable agony i had never realized he feltthough i noticed that neither he nor justine touched each others skin ah lara said her voice was a quavering silvery thing utterly fascinating and completely inhuman true love dresden marcone shouted hendricks spun away from where he had been staring at the raith sisters with much the same expression i must have had and stomped past me i shortly heard him adding the racket of his big gun to that of marcones and murphys raith i shouted i propose an alliance between yours and mine until we get out of here alive lara stared at me with her empty silver eyes for a second then she blinked them once and they turned darkening by a few degrees they went out of focus for a moment and she tilted her head lord raith abruptly stepped forward appearing from behind his daughters naturally dresden he said in a smooth tone unless you knew what you were looking for youd never have seen the glassy shine in his eyes or heard the slightly stilted cadence of his words he put on a good act but i had to wonder just how much of his mind lara had left him though i regard myself as bound by honor to see to your protection in the face of this treachery i can only be humbled by the nobility of you offering me your yeah yeah whatever all right i snapped glaring past him at lara run away now speeches later lara nodded and looked quickly around her maybe twenty of the raith clan had survived the fight the remaining ghouls had sprung away during our unexpected assault and now prowled in circles around us well out of arms reach but close enough to rush back in if they saw a weakness they were waiting for the others to finish off the last of the skavis and malvora once they got here theyd overrun us easily near the gate marcones soldiers had a steady line of whiterobed thralls moving out of the cavern there were rather more of them still alive than i had supposed there would be until i saw that the circling ghouls were largely ignoring the passive thralls focused instead on what they knew to be the real threatthe keepers of the mindnumbed herds dresden marcone shouted his shotgun boomed once more and then clicked empty i heard him feeding new shells in as murphys gun chattered theyre coming i grunted acknowledgment and said to lara bring the thralls what bring the bloody thralls i snarled or you can damned well stay here lara gave me a look that might have made me a little nervous about getting killed if i werent such a stalwart guy but then lord raith snapped to the vamps around him bring them i turned drawing more hellfire into the staff and knew that i wasnt going to be able to manage much more in the way of magic i had just done too much and i was on my last legs i had to pull off one more spell if any of us were going to make it out murphys gun kept rattling away as did hendrickss and i could hear gunfire coming from the soldiers around the gate now as well as the ghouls on the opposite side of the cavern began to turn from the ruined remains of the leaders of house skavis and malvora go i said go go go we headed for my gate the vampires seized thralls as they went tossing them into the center of the group forming a ring around them raith formed the core of the group with his daughters and their swords around himand the thralls forming a thick human shield around them in turn trust lara to turn what she had seen as a hindrance to her advantage it was the way her mind worked we started out at a quick paceand then an almosthuman voice cried out there was a surge of magic that flashed against my wizards senses and the lights went out the caverns lighting had been of excellent quality it had remained functional all through the duel despite the magic ramirez and i had been hurling around and through the opening of not one but two gates to the nevernever that implied that raith had invested in lighting with a long track record of high performance and reliability to continue functioning through so muchbut theres never been an electrical system a wizard couldnt put down with a little direct effort and this one was no exception even as i lifted my staff to call up more light my brain was paddling up the logic stream vittorio had seen us making a break for itor cowl had though again i had to remind myself that cowls presence was still theoretical however well supported by circumstantial evidence the theory might be killing the lights wasnt going to be a hindrance to the vampires or to the ghouls which meant that he was trying to hamper us people sinking the cavern into stygian blackness would make marcones troops almost impotent hamper and slow any of the escaping thralls therefore slowing the vampires apparently intent upon protecting them my staff hadnt been made to produce light but it was a flexible tool and i sent more hellfire through it as i lifted it overhead to light our way sending out redorange light in the shape of the runes and sigils carved into the staff out over the darkness and just as i did i realized what else the darkness would do it would force the humans to produce light specifically it would draw the response from wizards that being sunk into darkness always did we called light by one method or another it was the first thing any wizard would do in a situation like this one wed do it fast toofaster than anyone without magic could pull out a light of his own so as my staff lit up i realized that i had just declared my exact position to every freaking monster in the whole freaking cavern the darkness had been a trap designed to elicit this very response and i had walked right into it ghouls let out howls of fury and surged toward me through a hundred runeshaped scarlet spotlights that glinted on their bloodied fangs their talons those horrible hungry sunken eyes guns roared all around me splattering the nearest ghouls into blackblooded slurry it wasnt enough the creatures simply surged forward being torn apart until murphys gun clicked empty reloading she screamed ejecting the weapons magazine hopping a step back as the ghoul shed only wounded continued toward me marcones gun roared and that ghoul went away but when he pumped the weapon it clicked on an empty chamber he dropped it for the little submachine gun clipped to his harness and for a second or two it cut through ghouls like a scythe ripping in a great horizontal swathand then it ran empty i stepped forward as another wave of ghouls bounded over those the gunfire had held off murphy and marcone had bought me time enough for the spell id been forming in my mind to meet with my will and congeal into fire i whirled the staff overhead and then brought it down gripped in both hands striking its end to the stone floor as i cried flammamurus there was a crackling howl and fire ripped its way up out of the stones of the floor it rippled out from the point of impact in a line running thirty or forty yards in either direction a sudden fountain of molten stone that shot up in an ongoing curtain ten or twelve feet high angled toward the ghouls charging us from the far side of the cavern blazing liquid stone fell down over them among them and the oncoming tide of screaming ghouls broke upon that wall of stone and fire with screams of agony and for the first time of fear the wall held off fully half the ghouls in the cavern and screened us from vittorios sight it also provided all the humans with plenty of light to see by hells bells im good i wheezed the effort of the spell was monumental even with the hellfire to help me and i staggered the light vanishing from the runes of my staff harry left murphy screamed i turned my head to my left in time to see a ghoul half of its body a charred ruin slam hendricks aside as if the huge man had been a rag doll and throw itself at me while two more leaped over the group from behind and tried to follow in its wake i was pretty sure i could have taken the ghoul provided he wasnt much heavier than a loaf of bread and had no idea how to use those claws and fangs but just in case he was heavier than he looked and competent at ripping things apart i flung up my shield bracelet it sputtered into life for a second and the ghoul bounced off itand the effort it cost me nearly made me black out i fell the ghoul recovered and thrashed toward me even as i saw thomas appear from the ranks of vampires and thralls and attack its two companions from behind my brothers pale face was all but glowing his eyes were wide with fear and i hadnt ever seen him move that fast he hamstrung both of the other ghouls with the blades in his handswell if hacking through threequarters of the leg including the thick black thighbones could be considered hamstringing he left them on the ground while other raiths tore them to pieces thomas leaped at the lead ghoul he wasnt fast enough the ghoul came at me with a dreadful howl i didnt have enough energy left to lift my body up off the floor and face my killer headon fortunately i did have energy enough to draw the from my duster pocket id like to tell you that i waited till the last second for the perfect shot coolly facing down the ghoul with nerves of steel the truth is that my nerves were pretty much shot and i was too tired to panic i barely got the sights lined up before the ghouls jaws opened wide enough to engulf my entire head i never consciously pulled the trigger but the gun roared and the ghouls head snapped back before it crashed into me there was pain and i suddenly couldnt breathe harry thomas cried the weight vanished from my chest and i sucked in a breath i got my left hand free and pounded at the ghoul with the easy murphy shouted easy harry her small strong fingers caught my wrist and eased the gun out of it i dimly realized that i was lucky it hadnt gone off again while i was thrashing around with it thomas flung the ghoul off me and it landed in a heap the back upper quarter of its head was gone just gone nice shot marcone noted i looked back to see him lifting a pale and sweating hendricks getting one of the big mans arms over his shoulder and supporting his weight shall we thomas hauled me to my feet come on no time to rest now right i said i raised my voice and called lara get them moving we started toward the gate keeping the curtain of molten fire on our flank it was hard just moving one foot in front of the other it took me a while to notice that justine was under one shoulder supporting part of my weight and that i was walking amidst the thralls near the white king and his guard the vampires were still the outer guard spread out over a half circle in what amounted to a running battle only we werent running it was more of a steady walk made all the more eerie by hellish light and shadow and desperation murphys gun chattered several more times and then fell silent i heard the throaty bellow of my i checked my hand and sure enough my gun wasnt there leave them i heard lara snap her cold silver voice slithering around pleasantly in my ear keep the pace steady stay together give them no opening we walked the vampires growing more desperate and less human as the fight went on ghouls roared and screamed and died so did raiths the cold subterranean air of the cavern had grown greenhouse hot and it felt as if there werent enough air left in the air i panted hard but it never seemed to get enough into my lungs i kept lifting one foot and putting it back down again numbly noticing that marcone was behind me with hendricks doing the same thing i glanced to my left and saw the fiery fountain of molten stone beginning to dwindle it hadnt been an ongoing spell i had to keep pumping power into thats the beauty of earth magic momentum once you get it moving it doesnt slow down very quickly id poured fire magic into all that stone and forced it to expand out of the earth around it it had simply taken this long for the spell to play out but thats exactly what had happened the spell was beginning to play out much as i had the curtain lowered slowly thinning and growing less hot and i could see ghouls behind it ready to attack i noted idly that they would be able to rush right into our group of dazed thralls wounded gangsters and weary wizards with nothing much to oppose them oh god justine whimpered shed noticed too oh god the ghouls had all seen the curtain lowering now they rushed forward to the very edge of the fading curtain seemingly uncaring of the molten stone on the floor dozens of them a solid line of the creatures just waiting for the first chance to bounce over and eat our faces a blast of green light flashed down the line it went completely through two ghouls leaving them howling on the floor severed a third ghouls arm at the shoulder and continued on through the white throne leaving a hole the size of a laundry basket in its back ramirez had been waiting for them to line up like that he stood his weight on one foot at the far end of the lowering wall of flaming stone on the ghoul side arms akimbo they whirled toward him but ramirez started lifting his arms alternately from his hip to extend before him the motion like that of a gunfighter in the old west and every draw flung more silent green shafts of deadly light through the ghouls those nearest him tried to rush forward for the kill but ramirez had their measure now and he wasnt content to leave a single gaping hole trusting that it would incapacitate them sufficiently he hurled blast after hideously ruinous blast and left nothing but a scattered pile of twitching parts of the first ghouls to rush him and those beyond them suffered nearly as greatly freshspilled black ichor rushed back and forth across the cavern floor until it looked like the deck of a ship pitching on a lunatic sea what are you waiting for dresden ramirez shouted one little bit of vulcanomancy and you get worn out a particularly wellaimed bolt tore the heads from a pair of ghouls at once how do you like that we all began hurrying ahead not bad i slurred back at him for a virgin his rate of fire had begun to slacken but the gibe drew a fresh burst of ferocity out of ramirez and he redoubled his efforts the ghouls howled their frustration and bounded away from the wall of fire out of its treacherous light and away from the power of the warden of the white council ripping them to shreds it hurts bellowed ramirez drunkenly flinging a last pair of bolts at a fleeing ghoul ow ow it hurts it hurts to be this good there was a hiss of sound a flicker of steel and one of vitto malvoras knives hit ramirezs stomach so hard that that it threw the young man off his feet and to the ground man down marcone shouted we were close enough to the gate that i could see the pale blue light that spilled through it marcone waved his hand through a couple of signals and flicked a finger at ramirez then at hendricks the armed menmercenaries they had to be no gang of criminal thugs was so disciplinedrushed forward taking charge of the wounded seizing ramirez and dragging him back toward the gate roughly pushing and shoving the thralls ahead and toward the gate i went to ramirez staggering away from justine the knife had hit him in the guts hard ramirez had worn a kevlar vest which wasnt much good for stopping sharp pointy things though it had at least kept the knifes hilt from tearing right into the muscle and soft tissue i knew there were some big arteries there and more or less where they were located but i couldnt tell if the knife was at the right angle to have hit them his face was terribly pale and he blinked his eyes woozily as the soldiers started dragging him across the floor and his legs thrashed weakly bringing his own left leg up into his field of view bloody hell he gasped harry theres a knife in my leg when did that happen in the duel i told him dont you remember i thought youd stepped on me and sprained my ankle ramirez replied then he blinked again bloody hell theres a knife in my guts he peered at them and they match be still i warned him vampires and thralls and mercenaries were falling back through the gate now dont move around all right he began to say something but a panicked vampire kicked his leg as he went past ramirezs face twisted in pain and then suddenly slackened his eyes fluttering closed i saw his staff on the ground and grabbed it and pitched it through the gate after him the men carrying him as the fight behind me got closer while most of the retreating vampires still fought off the determined assault of the ghouls how long i heard marcone demand of one of the soldiers the man checked his watchan expensive swiss stopwatch with springs and cogs not some digital thing three minutes eleven seconds the soldier said how many charges six doubles he replied hey i snapped at marcone cutting it a little close huh any longer and they wouldnt accomplish anything marcone replied can you walk yes i can walk i snapped i could get someone to carry you marcone said his tone solicitous and sincere bite me i growled and called murphy here murphy called she was among the last of those retreating from the ghoul onslaught her boxy little volvo of a gun was hanging by its strap on one shoulder and she held my in both hands though it looked almost comically overlarge for her ramirez has got a knife in the stomach i said i need you to look after him hes the other warden right yeah i said hes already through the gate what about you i shook my head and made sure my duster was still covering most of me malvora is still out there he might try to kill our gate or try some other spell ive got to be one of the last ones through murphy gave me a skeptical look you look like youre about to fall over you in any shape to do more magic true i said and offered her my staff hey maybe you should do it she gave me a hard look no one likes a wiseass harry are you kidding as long as the wiseass is talking to someone else people love em i gave her half a smile and said get out of here how are we getting back out again she asked thomas led us there but hell lead you back i said or one of the others will or ramirez if some idiot doesnt kill him trying to help him if its all the same to you id rather you did it harry she touched my hand and departed through the broad oval of the gate i saw her hurry through ankledeep snow beneath what looked like sheltering pine trees to ramirezs side where he lay limply on his cloak the thralls looked confused which of course they would be and cold which given their wardrobe of course they would be thats all of ours shouted the soldier to marcone two minutes fifteen seconds he had to shout the nearest of the ghouls were about ten feet away doing battle against for lack of a more cliched term a thin white line of raith including my brother with his two blades spinning go marcone said and the soldier went through marcone a fresh shotgun in hand stepped up next to me dresden what are you hanging around for if you recall he said i agreed to extract you alive im not leaving until i have done so he paused and added provided of course that it happens in the next two minutes from where i was standing i could see three twobrick bundles of c detonators thrust into their soft surfaces each fitted with oldfashioned precision timepieces they were simple charges on the floor the other three must have been shaped charges affixed to the cavern walls i had no idea how much destruction was going to be wrought by them but i didnt suppose it would be much fun to be there when they went boom alas that the poor ghouls would most likely be staying for the fireworks thomas i called time to go go thomas shouted and the other vampires with him broke from their line and fled for the gate except for one a tall female raith who i blinked holy crap it was lara the other vampires fled past me through the gate and thomas and his sister stood alone against the horde of eightfoot ghouls stood against it and stopped it cold their skin gleamed colder and whiter than glacial ice their eyes blazed silvery bright and they moved with blinding speed and utterly inhuman grace his saber fluttered and slashed drawing a constant stream of blood punctuated by devastating blows of his kukri ah right that was the name of that inwardbent knife i knew id remember it eventually lara moved with him trailing her damp midnight hair and shredded silk kimono she covered thomass back like a cloak hung from his shoulders she was no weaker than her younger brother and perhaps even faster and the wavybladed short sword in her hand had a penchant for leaving spills of ghoulish entrails in its wake together the pair of them slipped aside from repeated rushes and dealt out deadly violence to one foe after another ultimately i think their fight was futileand all the more valiant and astonishing for being so doomed no matter how lethal thomas and lara proved to be or how many ghouls went screaming to the floor their black blood continued to slither back into their fallen bodies and the ghouls that had been taken down continued to gather themselves together to rise and fight again most of those who reentered the fight with renewed vigor and increased fury remained hideously maimed in some way some trailed their entrails like slimy grey ropes others were missing sections of their skulls at least two entered the fray armless simply biting with their wide jaws of vicious teeth beside the beauty of the brother and sister vampires the ghouls deformed bodies and hideous injuries were all the more monstrous all the more vile my god marcone said his voice hushed it is the most beautiful nightmare i have ever seen he was right it was hypnotic time i asked him my voice rough he consulted his own stopwatch one minute fortyeight seconds thomas i bellowed lara now with that the pair of them bounded apart apparently the last thing the ghouls had been expecting and dashed for the gate i turned to goand that was when i felt it there was a dull pulse a throb of some power that seemed at once alien and familiar a sickening whirling sensation and then a sudden stab of energy it wasnt a magical attack an attack implies an act of force that might be predicted countered or at least mitigated in some way this was something far more existential it simply asserted itself and by its very existence it dictated a new reality a spike of thought slammed into my being like a physical blowit wasnt any one single thought it was instead a melange of them a cocktail of emotions so heavy so dense that it drove me instantly to my knees despair flooded through me i was so tired i had struggled and fought to achieve nothing but raw chaos rendering the whole of my effort useless my only true friends had been badly injured or had run leaving me in this hellish cavern those who currently stood beside me were monsters of one stripe or anothereven my brother who had returned to his monstrous ways in feeding on other human beings terror followed hard on its heels i had been paralyzed while surrounded by monsters of resilience beyond description in mere seconds they would fall on me i had fallen with my face toward the gate and though physical movement was beyond me i could see that everyone everyone had also pitched over onto the ground vulnerable to the attack while the gate remained open vampires thralls and mortal warriors alike they had all fallen guilt came next murphy carlos i had gotten them both killed useless it had all been useless marcones stopwatch lay on the ground near his limply outstretched hand hed fallen next to me the second hand was sweeping rapidly downward and the watches on the charges of c the nearest of them about ten feet away did the same then i understood it this was vittorio malvoras attack this hideous paralyzing brew of everything darkest in the moral soul was what he had poured out as the raith administered desire the malvorans gave fear and the skavis despair vitto had gone beyond them all he had taken all the worst of the human soul and forged it into a poisonous deadly weapon and i hadnt been able to do a damned thing to stop him i lay staring at marcones stopwatch and wondered which would kill us all first the ghouls or the explosion chapter fortyone between and the backwardrunning hand of the stopwatch suddenly halted or it seemed that way but several moments later the hand twitched down to the next second and the tick sounded more like a hollow thump i just lay there staring at it and wondering if this was how my mind was reacting to my own imminent death and then i thought that id had enough will to wonder about something rather than just being crushed and suffocated by despair and terror maybe that was how i was reacting to my imminent death with denial and escapist selfinduced hallucinations not precisely my host came lasciels voice i blinked which was a lot more voluntary movement than id had a second before i tried to look around dont try lasciel said her voice a little alarmed you could harm yourself what the hell had she somehow slowed down time time does not exist she said her tone firm not the way you consider it at any rate i have temporarily accelerated the processes of your mind the stopwatch thudthumped again accelerating my brain that made more sense after all we all use only about ten percent of our brains capacity anyway there was no reason it couldnt handle a lot more activity well except that yes she said it is dangerous and i cannot maintain this level of activity for very long before it begins inflicting permanent damage i presumed that lasciel was about to make me an offer i couldnt refuse her voice became sharp angry dont be a fool my host if you perish i perish i simply seek to give you an option that might enable us to survive right and by some odd coincidence might that option just happen to involve the coin in my basement why do you continue to be so stubborn about this my host lasciel demanded her voice tight with frustration taking up the coin would not enslave you it would not impede your ability to choose for yourself not at first no but it would finish up with me enslaved to the true lasciel and she knew it not necessarily she said there was a tone of pleading to her voice accommodations can be reached compromises made sure if im willing to go along with her every plan im sure shed be quite agreeable but you would be alive lasciel cried it didnt matter given that the coin was buried in the stone under my lab anyway not an obstacle my host i can teach you how to call it to you within a few seconds thudthump a thud from behind me footsteps the ghouls they were coming i could see part of marcones face twisted in agony under vittorio malvoras psychic assault please lasciel said please let me help you i dont want to die i didnt want to die either i closed my eyes for another second thudthump it took an effort of will and what seemed like several moments of effort but i managed to whisper aloud no but you will die lasciel said her voice anguished it was going to happen sooner or later but it didnt have to be tonight then quickly first you must picture the coin in your mind i can help you not like that she could help me silence thudthump i cant she whispered i thought she could i cant she replied her voice anguished she would never forgive that never accept me back into her just take the coin harry just take the coin pplease i gritted my teeth thudthump again i said no i cant do this for you untrue shed already partially shielded me from the effects of malvoras attack the situation was simple for her she could do more of what shed already done or she could stand by and do nothing it was her choice lasciel appeared in front of me for the first time on her hands and knees she looked odd too thin her eyes too sunken she had always looked strong healthy and confident now her hair was a wreck her face twisted with pain and and she was crying she looked blotchy and she needed a tissue her hands touched either side of my face it could hurt you it could inflict brain damage do you understand what that could mean harry never can tell it might be nice to have brain damage i already liked jello and maybe theyd have cable tv at whatever home they wound up sticking me in either way it would be better than having my brains scooped out by ghouls lasciel stared at me for a moment and then let out a choking little laugh its your brother your friends thats why if frying my brain got murphy ramirez thomas and justine out of the mess id gotten them into it would be worth it she stared at me for another long moment thudthump then a look of almost childish resentment came over her face and she looked over one shoulder before turning back to me i she shook her head and said very softly wonderingly she doesnt deserve you deserved or not the fallen angel wasnt getting me not ever lasciel squared her shoulders and straightened youre right she said it is my choice listen to me she leaned closer her eyes intent vittorio has been given power that is how he can do this he is possessed i wished i could have raised my eyebrows possessed by what an outsider lasciel said i have felt such a presence before this attack is drawn directly from the mind of the outsider gosh that was interesting not relevant but interesting it is relevant lasciel said because of the circumstances of your birthbecause of why you were born harry your mother found the strength to escape lord raith for a reason what the hell was she talking about thudthump there was a complex confluence of events of energies of circumstances that would have given a child born under them the potential to wield power over outsiders which didnt make any sense outsiders were all but immune to magic it took power garnered only from centuries of study and practice wielded by the most powerful wizards on the planet even to slow them down strange then dont you think that you defeated one when you were sixteen years old what since when the only serious victory id had over a spiritual entity when i was that young had been when my old master had sent an assassin demon after me it hadnt turned out the way dumorne had been hoping lasciel leaned closer he who walks behind is an outsider harry a terrible creature the most potent of the walkers a powerful knight among their ruling entities but when he came for you you overthrew him true i had it was all still a little blurry but i remembered the end of the fight well enough lots and lots of kaboom and then no more demon and there was a burning building thudthump listen lasciel said giving my head a little shake you have the potential to hold great power over them you may be able to escape the power now held over you if you are sure it is what you want i can give you an opportunity to defy malvoras sending but youll have to hurry i dont know how long it will take to throw it off and they are almost upon you after which we were going to have a long talk about my mother and these outsiders and their relation to the black court and exactly what the hell was going on lasciellash rathernodded once and said i will tell you all that i can harry then she rose and stepped past me and toward the oncoming ghouls and vitto malvora her clothes made a slow soft rustle as she stepped away from me and marcones stopwatch went thud tick tick tick for just a second no more than a heartbeat or two i remained impaled on that horrible pike of psychic anguish then an odd sensation fell over me and i dont know precisely how to describe it except to say that it felt like stepping from brutal burning sunlight into a sudden deep shadow then that horrible pain easednot much but enough to let me suddenly move my arms and my head enough to know that i could act so i froze in place mine howled a voice so distorted with lust and violence that it sounded like nothing human she is mine footsteps came closer thumpdrag thumpdrag i saw vittorios horribly burned leg go by in my peripheral vision the sensation of shade began to fade at the edges with the power of vittorios spell returning by slow degrees like sunlight beginning to burn its way through a sheet of frosted glass little raith bitch vittorio snarled what i do to you will make your fathers blood run cold there was the sound of a heavy blow i twitched my head a tiny bit to one side to get a look at what was around me a lot of really huge ghouls that was what apparently no less fierce for being battered and torn by the battle vittorio stood over lara his face pale his leg horribly burned he had his right hand held out the hand that projects energy fingers spread and i could still feel the terrible power radiating from them he was maintaining the pressure of the spell that held everyone down thenand i could see from the reaction of the ghouls around him that they were feeling the bite of the spell too it seemed only to make them flinch and cower a little rather than incapacitating them entirely maybe they were more used to feeling such things he kicked lara in the ribs twice more heavy and ugly kicks that cracked bones lara let out little sounds of pain and i think it was that more than anything that let me push the paralyzing awl of hostile magic completely away from my mind i moved one hand and that slowly from the lack of outcry i took it that no one noticed well put a pin in this for now little raith bitch he whirled toward my brother i had intended to find you you know thomas vittorio continued an outcast like you i assumed might be inclined to throw in his lot with someone with a more equitable vision for the future but youre like some sad dog too ugly to be allowed into the house but faithfully defending the master that holds him in contempt your end isnt going to be pretty either he started to turn toward me smiling but first we start with the busybody wizard he finished the turn saying burns hurt dresden have i mentioned how much i hate being exposed to fire no sense in wasting perfectly good irony i waited until he said fire to spin and pull the trigger on marcones shotgun the weapon bucked hardi hadnt had time to brace it properlyand slammed into my shoulder with bruising force only partly attenuated by my duster the blast pretty well removed vittorios right hand at the middle of his forearm the way i hear it amputation is bad for your concentration it certainly wasnt good for vittorios and you cant hold up the pressure on a spell like hed been using without concentration there was a sudden surge of particularly intense discomfort through the spell as vittorios physical trauma sent a flare of energy through it like feedback on an enormous speaker the ghouls howled in agonized reaction to the surge of discord and it gave me a second or so to act i lashed out with both legs and got vittorio in one of his kneesthe one that wasnt all burned a kick to the knees doesnt bother a vampire from the red courttheir actual knees are all backward anyway a black court vampire wouldnt have been anything but annoyed at having a hand blown off with a shotgun vitto wasnt either when he wasnt drawing upon the power gained from his hunger he was pretty much human and while im a wizard and all im also a fairly big guy tall and skinny sure but when you get tall enough even skinny guys are pretty darned heavy and ive got strong legs his knee bent in backward and he fell with a scream before he could recover i was up on one knee with the shotguns stock against my shoulder and its long barrel against vittorios nose back off i shouted i was going for cool and strong but my voice came out sounding angry and not overly burdened with sanity tell them to back off now vittorios face was twisted with surprise and pain he blinked at the shotgun then at me and then at the stump of his right hand i couldnt hear or see the stopwatch anymore but my head provided the sound effect tickticktickticktick how much time was left less than sixty seconds around me the ghouls recovered from their moment of pain began to let out a steady low growl like the rumbling engines of several dozen motorcycles i kept my eyes focused on their boss if i took a moment to get a good look at all the bits of feral anatomy around me that might start ripping into my flesh at any second i would probably cry that would be unmanly bback vittorio stammered then he said something in a language that sounded vaguely familiar but that i didnt understand he repeated it in a half scream and the ghouls edged a couple of inches away from us ticktickticktick this is what happens i told vittorio i take my people i go through the gate i close it you get to live i leaned into the shotgun a little making him flinch or we can all go down together im feeling ambivalent toward which way we go so ill leave it up to you he licked his lips yyoure bluffing pull that trigger and the ghouls will kill everyone you wont llet them die for the pleasure of killing me its been a long day im tired not thinking real clearly and the way i see it you got me pretty much dead to rights here vitto i narrowed my eyes and spoke very quietly do you really think ill let myself go down without taking you with me he stared at me for a long moment and licked his lips ggo he said then go thomas i shouted wakey wakey now is not the time to lie down and die i heard my brother groan harry lara can you hear me quite she said thomass older sister was already on her feet from the sound and her voice was coming from close behind me thomas get marcone and get him through the gate i gave vittorio a fierce glare dont move dont even twitch vittorio his face in agony held up his left hand fingers spread he was bleeding a lot and started shivering there wasnt any fight left in his face hed hit me with his best shot and id apparently shrugged it off i think it had scared the hell out of him losing his hand hadnt helped his morale any either dont shoot he said just ddont shoot he shot a glance around at the ghouls and said llet them go i heard marcone let out a groan and thomas grunted with effort okay thomas said from behind me im through i kept the gun on vittorio and stood up trying not to let the barrel waver how many seconds did i have left thirty twenty ive heard about people who can keep track of wild situations like this while keeping a steady count but apparently i wasnt one of them i took a step back and felt laras back pressing against mine from the corner of my eye i could see that the ghouls had spread out all around us if she hadnt been there one of them could have blindsided me without any trouble the second i was a couple of feet away from vittorio gulp i took a step back forcing myself to move smoothly steadily when my instincts were screaming at me to run three more steps lara told me in a whisper a little more to your left i corrected the direction of my next step trusting her word one step more and i could hear winter wind sighing behind me silver moonlight shone on the barrel of the shotgun and then i found out whether or not cowl was actually there there was a surge of power an abrasive scream against my arcane senses and the offspring of a comet and a pterodactyl came hurtling out of the darkness at the far end of the cavern my eyes had adjusted enough to see a dim oval of reddish light that outlined a heavily cloaked figurecowl standing in his own gate master vittorio cried his voice slurred look out i screamed and thrashed behind me with my arm as i ducked and lurched to one side trying to sweep lara out of the flying things path as i did it missed us by inches but we got out of the way cowls leathery rasping voice hissed something in a slithering tongue and a second surge of power lashed invisibly across the cavernnot at us but at my gate and as quickly as that my gate began to close the opening sewing itself shut like a ziploc bagstarting with the end closest to me tickticktickticktick the gate was closing far more quickly than i could have gotten up and moved i wasnt getting out but lara might lara i shouted go something with the strength of a freight train and the speed of an indy car seized my duster and hauled on it so hard that it wrenched my neck and nearly dislocated my arms dresden called marcones voice from the closing gate nineteen i hurtled through the air looking wildly around showed me that lara had seized me and leaped for the far end of the collapsing gate eighteen came marcones shout lara and i flew through empty and unremarkable air the gate had closed we missed it chapter fortytwo the only light was the dim scarlet glow from cowls gate and everything had become blood and shadows the eyes of dozens of ghouls burned like nearly dead coals as they turned toward us reflecting that lurid luminescence lara i hissed this cavern goes up in seventeen seconds and there are ghouls in the tunnel out empty night lara swore her voice was thready with pain and fear what can i do good question there had to be wait there might be a way to survive this i was too tired to work any magic but you can trust me i said thats what you can do she turned her pale beautiful goresmattered face to me done get us to the tunnels mouth but if there are ghouls there already hey i said tick tick before id gotten to the end of the first tick lara had seized me again and hauled us across the floor to the mouth of the tunnel behind me cowl was shouting something and so was vittorio and the ghouls set up a howl and were running after us only one of the ghouls was close enough to get in the way but laras wicked little wavybladed sword ripped straight across its eyes and left the monster momentarily stunned with pain lara dumped me at the mouth of the tunnel and i took a couple of steps back in checking the smooth tunnel walls as i shook out my shield bracelet that demonic flying thing of cowls banked around for another pass what now lara demanded the ghouls were coming they were nowhere near as fast as lara had been but they werent far away i took a deep breath now i said kiss me i know it seems weir lara let out a single ravenous snarl and was abruptly pressed up against me arms sliding around my waist with sinuous serpentine power her mouth met mine and ohmygod lara had once boasted that she could do more to me in an hour than a mortal woman could in a week but it aint boasting if its true the first searing second of that kiss was indescribably intense it wasnt simply the texture of her lips it was how she moved them and the simple naked hunger beneath every quiver of her mouth i knew she was a monster and i knew she would enslave and kill me if she could but she wanted me with a passion so pure and focused that it was intoxicating that succubus kiss was a lie but it made me feel within that single moment strong and masculine and powerful it made me feel that i was attractive enough strong enough worthy enough to deserve that kind of desire and it made me feel lust a primal need for sex so raw so scorching that i felt sure that if i didnt find expression for that needhere and now that i would surely go insane the fires that surged up in me werent limited to my loins it was simply too hot too intense for that and my whole body felt suddenly aflame with need every inch of me was suddenly supernaturally aware of lara in all her bloodsoaked sensuality in all her wanton desirability pressed against me the mostly transparent white silk of her gown doing less to conceal her nudity than the black blood of her foes now my body screamed at me take her now fuck the stopwatch and the bombs and the monsters forget everything and feel her and nothing else it was a close thing but i held back enough to keep from forgetting the danger the lust nearly killed mebut lust is an emotion too i embraced that lust allowed it to enfold me and returned the kiss with nearly total abandon i slid my right hand around the succubuss waist and down pulling her hips hard against me feeling the amazing strength and elasticity and rondure of her body on mine with my left hand i extended the shield bracelet toward the cavern the bombs the onrushing ghoulsand i fed that tidal force of lust through it building up the energy i would need some part of me shaping and directing it even as the rest of me concentrated on the mindconsuming pleasure of that single kiss the clocks stopped ticking the explosives went off cleverness determination treachery ruthlessness courage and skill took a leave of absence while physics took over the show tremendous heat and force expanded from the explosives it swept through the cavern in an almighty sword of fire laying low anything unfortunate enough to have remained within i saw for one flashsecond the outline of the ghouls still charging us unaware of what was about to happen against the whitehot fireball that expanded through the chamber and then that blast hit my shield i didnt try to withstand that incredible sledgehammer of expanding force and energy it would have shattered my shield melted my bracelet to my wrist and crushed me like an egg the shield wasnt meant to do that instead i filled the space at the mouth of the cave with flexible resilient energy and packed layer upon layer of it behind the shield and more of it all around us i wasnt trying to stop the energy of the explosion i was trying to catch it there was an instant of crushing compression and i felt the pressure on my shield like a vast and liquid weight it flung me from my feet and i held hard to lara whose arms gripped me in return i began to tumble blinded by the flame and fought to hold the shield now hardening it all around us into a sphere constricting it around us until we were pressed bodytobody we hurtled up the tunnel flung out ahead of the explosion like a ship ahead of a hurricaneor more accurately like a ball being fired down the barrel of a long stony musket the shield banged against the smooth walls dragging more effort out of me a single outcropping might have stopped our progress for a disastrous instant shattering stone shield succubus and shamus into one big mess thank god the vanity of laras family had made sure the walls of the tunnel were polished smooth and gleaming i didnt see the ghouls guarding the upper reaches of the tunnel so much as i felt them hit the shield and be smashed aside and splattered like bugs only to be consumed by the flood of fire washing up the tunnel after us i dont know how fast we were going beyond very the explosion flung us up the long tunnel and out into the night air and up through the branches of a couple of treeswhich shattered under the force then we were arcing through the night spinning with stars above us whipping by and a long tongue of angry flame emerging from the entrance to the deeps below and all the while i was locked in the heated ecstasy of laras kiss i lost track of what was happening somewhere near the top of the arc right about when laras legs twined with mine and she ripped aside my shirt and hers to press her naked chest against me i had just begun wondering what it was id forgotten about how kissing lara was not the best idea when there was a horrible crashing sound that went on for several seconds we werent moving the shield wasnt under pressure and i was so dizzy and tired that i couldnt string two thoughts together i lowered the shield with a groan of relief that was lost in an answering moan of need from the succubus in my arms ststopped i said lara ststop she pressed closer parted my lips with her tongue and i thought that i was going to explode when she suddenly let out a hiss and recoiled from me a hand flying to her mouthbut not before i saw the blisters rising from the burned flesh around her lips i fell slowly to my back and lay there gasping in the neardark there were several small fires nearby we were in a building of some kind there were a lot of broken things i was sure to get blamed for this one lara turned away from me huddling in upon herself bloody hell she said after a moment i cant believe youre still protected but its old my intelligence said ms rodriguez hadnt left south america she hasnt i croaked you mean she turned and blinked at me astonishment on her face dresden do you mean to say that the last time you had relations with a woman was nearly four years ago depressing i said isnt it lara shook her head slowly i had just always assumed that you and ms murphy i grunted no she she doesnt want to get serious with me and you dont want to be casual with her lara said theres an outside chance that i have abandonment issues i said still a man like you and its been four years she shook her head i have enormous personal respect for you wizard but thats just sad i grunted again too tired to lip off saved my life just now i suppose lara looked back at me for a moment and then she turned pink yes it probably did and i owe you an apology for trying to eat me i said she shivered and the tips of her breasts suddenly stood out against the white silk shed rearranged her clothes to cover them i was too tired to feel more than a little disappointed about it yes she said for losing control of myself i confess i thought that we were facing our last moment im afraid i didnt restrain myself very well for that you have my apologies i looked around and realized dimly that we were in some part of the raith chateau itself hngh im uh sorry about the damage to your home here under the circumstances im inclined to be gracious you saved my life you could have saved yourself i said quietly when the gate was closing you could have left me to die you didnt thank you she blinked at me as if i had just started speaking in alien tongues wizard she said after a moment i gave you my word of safe passage a member of my court betrayed you betrayed us all i could not leave you to die without forsaking my wordand i take my promises seriously mister dresden i stared quietly at her for a moment and then nodded then i said i notice that you didnt go terribly far out of your way to save cesarina malvora her lips twitched up at the corners it was a difficult time i did all that i could to protect my house and then the other members of court in attendance mores the pity that i could not save that usurping traitorous bitch you couldnt save that usurping traitorous lord skavis either i noted life is change lara replied quietly you know what i think lara i asked her eyes narrowed and fastened on me i think someone got together with skavis to plan his little hunt for the lowpoweredmagic folks i think someone encouraged him to do it i think someone pointed it out as a great plan to usurp mean old lord raiths power base and then i think that same someone probably nudged lady malvora to move to give her a chance to steal lord skaviss thunder laras eyelids lowered and her lips spread in a slow smile why would someone do such a thing because she knew that skavis and malvora were going to make a move soon in any case i think she did it to divide her enemies and focus their efforts into a plan she could predict rather than waiting upon their ingenuity i think someone wanted to turn skavis and malvora against one another keeping them too busy to undermine raith i sat up faced her and said it was you pulling their strings it was you who came up with the plan to kill those women perhaps not lara replied smoothly lord skavis iswasa wellknown misogynist and he proposed a plan much like this one only a century ago she tapped a finger to her lips thoughtfully and then said and you have no way of proving otherwise i stared at her for a long moment then i said i dont need proof to act on my own is that a threat dear wizard i looked slowly around the ruined room there was a hole in the house almost perfectly round right through the floors above us and the roof four stories above bits and pieces were still falling what threat could i possibly be to you lara i drawled she took in a slow breath and said what makes you think i wont kill you right here right now while you are weary and weakened it would likely be intelligent and profitable she lifted her sword and ran a fingertip languidly down the flat of the blade why not finish you right here i showed her my teeth you gave me your word of safe passage lara threw back her head in a rich laugh so i did she faced me more directly set the sword aside and rose what do you want i want those people returned to life i spat at her i want to undo all the pain thats been inflicted during this mess i want children to get their mothers back parents their daughters husbands their wives i want you and your kind never to hurt anyone ever again right in front of my eyes she turned from a woman into a statue cold and perfectly still what do you want she whispered that i might give you first reparations a weregild to the victims families i said ill provide you with the details for each done second this never happens again one of yours starts up with genocide again and im going to reply in kind starting with you ill have your word on it her eyes narrowed further done she murmured the little folk i said they shouldnt be in cages free them unharmed in my name she considered that for a moment and then nodded anything else some listerine i said ive got a funny taste in my mouth that last remark drew more anger out of her than anything else that had happened the entire night her silver eyes blazed with rage and i could feel the fury roiling around her our business she said in a whisper is concluded get out of my house i forced myself to my feet one of the walls had fallen down and i walked creakily over to it my neck hurt i guess being moved around at inhuman speed gives you whiplash i stopped at the hole in the wall and said im glad to preserve the peace effort i said forcing the words out i think its going to save lives lara your peoples lives and mine ive got to have you where you are to get that i looked at her otherwise id settle up with you right now dont get to thinking were friends she faced me her face all shadowed the light of slowly growing fires lighting her from behind i am glad to see you survived wizard you who destroyed my father and secured my own power you who have now destroyed my enemies you are the most marvelous weapon i have ever wielded she tilted her head at me and i love peace wizard i love talking laughing relaxing her voice dropped to a husky pitch i will kill your folk with peace wizard i will strangle them with it and they will thank me while i do a cold little spear slid neatly into my guts but i didnt let it show on my face or in my voice not while im around i said quietly then i turned and walked away from the house i looked blearily around me got my directions and started limping for the front gate on the way there i fumbled mouses whistle out of my pocket and started blowing it i remember my dog reaching my side and holding on to his collar the last fifty yards or so down the road out until molly came sputtering up in the blue beetle and helped me inside then i collapsed into sleep id earned it chapter fortythree i didnt wake up until i was back home and then only long enough to shamble inside and fall down on my bed i was out for maybe six hours and then i woke up with my whole back fused into one long enormous muscle cramp i made some involuntarily pathetic noises and mouse rose up from the floor beside my bed and jogged out of my room molly appeared from the living room a moment later and said harry whats wrong back i said my back freaking vampire tart wrenched my neck molly nodded once and vanished when she came back she had a small black bag you were holding yourself sort of strangely last night so after i dropped you off i borrowed mothers medicine bag she held up a bottle muscle relaxants a jar tiger balm she held up a plastic container of dust herbal tea mix shiro found in tibet great for joint pain my father swears by it padawan i said im doubling your pay you dont pay me harry tripling it then she gave me a broad smile and ill be happy to get you all set up just as soon as you promise to tell me everything that happened that you can i mean oh and sergeant murphy called she wanted to know as soon as you were awake give her a ring i said and of course ill tell you about it is there any water she went and got me some but i needed her help to sit up enough to drink it that was embarrassing as hell i got more embarrassed when she took my shirt off with a clinical detachment and then winced at all the bruises she fed me the muscle relaxants and set to with the tiger balm and it hurt like hell for about ten minutes then the stuff started working and the notpain was a drug of its own after a nice cup of teawhich tasted horrible but which made it possible to move my neck within ten or twenty minutes of drinking iti was able to get myself into the shower and get cleaned up and into fresh clothes it was heavenly nothing like a nightmarish neardeath experience to make you appreciate the little things in life like cleanliness and not being dead i spent a minute giving mister some attention though apparently hed slept with molly because he accepted maybe a whole thirty seconds of stroking and then dismissed me as unnecessary once he was sure i was in one piece normally he needs some time spread across someones lap to be himself i ruffled mouse for a while instead which he enjoyed dutifully and then got myself some food and sat down in the chair across from molly on the couch sergeant murphys on the way molly reported good i told her quietly so tell me about it you first she gave me a semiexasperated look and started talking i sat in the car being invisible for maybe an hour mouse kept me company nothing much happened then bells started ringing and men started shouting and shooting and the lights went out a few minutes later there was a great big explosionit moved the rearview mirror out of position then mouse started making noise like you said he would and we drove to the gate and he jumped out of the car and came back with you i blinked at her for a minute that sounds really boring but scary molly said very tense she took a deep breath and said i had to throw up twice just sitting there i was so nervous i dont know if if im going to be cut out for this kind of thing harry thank god i said youre sane i took a few more bites of food and then said but i need to know how much you want to know molly blinked and leaned toward me a little what theres a lot i can tell you i said some of it is just business some of it is going to be dangerous for you to know about it might even obligate you in ways you wouldnt like very much so you wont tell me that part she asked didnt say that i said im willing but some of this stuff youd be safer and happier not knowing i dont want to endanger you or trap you into feeling you have to act without giving you a choice about it molly stared at me for a minute while i gobbled cereal then she frowned looked down at her hands for a minute and said maybe just tell me what you think is best for now good answer i said quietly and i told her about the white court about the challenge and the duel about vittorios betrayal and how he gated in the ghouls and how id had my own backup standing by in the nevernever what molly said how did you do that thomas i said hes a vampire and they have the ability to cross into the nevernever at certain places what kind of places molly asked places that are ah i said important to them relevant to them in a particular way places of lust you mean molly said i coughed and ate more cereal yeah and places where significant things have happened to them in thomass case he was nearly sacrificed by a cult of pornstar sorceresses in those caves a few years a im sorry molly said interrupting but it sounded like you said cult of pornstar sorceresses yeah i said oh she said giving me a skeptical look sorry then keep going anyway he nearly died there so i knew he could find it again he led marcone and murphy there and they were camped out waiting for me to open a gate i see molly said and you all ganged up on this vittorio guy and killed him not quite i said and told her what happened leaving out any mention of lasciel or cowl molly blinked as i finished well that explains it then explains what there were all kinds of little lights going by the windows all night they didnt upset mouse i thought maybe it was some kind of sending and figured the wards would keep it out she shook her head it must have been all the little faeries they hang around all the time anyway i said it just takes a lot of them before its obvious enough to notice i chewed cheerios thoughtfully more mouths to feed guess id better call pizza spress and step up my standing order or well have some kind of teeny faerie clan war over pizza rights on our hands i finished breakfast found my back stiffening again after sitting still and was stretching out a little when murphy arrived she was still in her party clothes from the night before complete with a loaded backpack after kneeling down to give mouse his hug she surprised me i got one too i surprised myself with how hard i hugged back molly occasionally displayed wisdom beyond her years she did now taking my car keys showing them to me and departing without a word firmly shutting the door behind her glad youre okay i told murphy yeah she said her voice shook a little even on that one word and she took a deep breath and spoke more clearly that was fairly awful even by your usual standards you made it out all right nothing i wont get over i told her you had any breakfast dont think my stomach is up for much after all that she said i have cheerios i said as if id been saying dark chocolate caramel almond fudge custard oh god murphy sighed how can i resist we sat down on the couch with murphys heavy bag on the coffee table murphy snacked on dry cheerios from a bowl with her fingers okay i told her first things first where is my gun murphy snorted and nodded at her bag i got in and opened it my was inside so was murphys boxy little submachine gun i picked it up and eyed it then lifted it experimentally to my shoulder what the hell kind of gun is this its a p murphy said seethrough plastic i asked thats the magazine she said you can always see how many rounds you have left i grunted its tiny on a hyperthyroid stork like you sure murphy said i frowned and said full automatic ah is this weapon precisely legal even for you she snorted no whered you get it i asked kincaid she said last year gave it to me in a box of belgian chocolate i took the weapon down from my shoulder flipped it over and eyed a little engraved plate on the butt well always have hawaii i read aloud what the hell is that supposed to mean murphys cheeks turned pink she took the gun from me put it in the bag and zipped it firmly closed did we ever decide who blew up my car probably madrigal i said you stood him up for that cup of coffee remember because he was busy kidnapping you and attempting to sell you on ebay murphy said i shrugged vindictive doesnt equal rational murphy frowned the suspiciouscop look on her face something i was long used to seeing maybe but it doesnt feel right he liked his vengeance personal who then i asked vittorio wasnt interested in drawing out the cops neither was lord skaviss agent lara raith and marcone dont do bombs exactly murphy said if not madrigal then who life is a mystery i suggested it was probably madrigal maybe one of the others had a reason for it that we dont know maybe well never know yeah she said i hate that she shook her head harry wouldnt a decent human being be inquiring after his wounded friends and allies about now i assumed if there was bad news youd have told me already i said she gave me a steady look that she said is so archetypically male i grinned how is everyone ramirez is in the hospital same floor as elaine actually and were watching them both unofficially of course we meaning the cops murphy good people how is he still had some surgery to go when i left but the doctor said his prognosis was excellent as long as they can avoid infection he got his guts opened up by that knife that can always be tricky i grunted and had my suspicions about where molly had gone when she borrowed my car hell make it what about that poor noneck you abused mister hendricks is there with two of those mercenaries marcone has some of his people guarding them too cops and robbers i said one big happy family one wonders murphy said why marcone agreed to help i settled back on the couch and rubbed at the back of my neck tilth one hand closing my eyes i bribed him with what murphy asked a seat at the table i said quietly huh i offered marcone a chance to sign on to the unseelie accords as a freeholding lord murphy was quiet for a moment and then she said he wants to keep expanding his power she thought about it a minute more and said or he thinks his power might be threatened from someone on that end someone like the vampires i said the red court had defacto control of prostitution in chicago until biancas place burned down and an agent of the white court has just shown up and killed one of his prostitutes are we sure it was madrigal i am i said no way to prove it but he was the raith involved in this mess that was more or less an accident murphy said taking out one of marcones people i mean shes just as dead i replied and marcone wont stand by when someoneanyonekills one of his own how does becoming a what was it and how does it help freeholding lord i said it means hes entitled to rights under the accordslike rights of challenge when someone kills his employees it means that if a supernatural power tries to move in on him hell have an opportunity to fight it and actually win are there many of these lords nope i said i had bob look into it maybe twenty on the whole planet two dragons drakulthe original not baby vladthe archive the ceo of monoc securities some kind of semiimmortal shapeshifter guru in the ukraine people like that the accords let them sign on as individuals they have the same rights and obligations most people who consider the idea arent willing to agree to be a good traditional host for lets say a group of black court vampires and dont want to get caught up as a mediator in a dispute between the major powers they dont want to make themselves the targets of possible challenges either so not many of them even try it i rubbed at my jaw and no one who is just a vanilla human being has tried it marcone is breaking new ground murphy shook her head and you were able to set him up for it you have to have three current members of the accords vouch for you to sign on i said i told him id be one of them you can speak for the council in this when it comes to defending and protecting my area of responsibility as a warden i damned well can if the council doesnt like it they shouldnt have dragooned me into the job murphy chewed on some cheerios scrunched up her nose in thought and then gave me a shrewd look youre using marcone i nodded its only a matter of time before someone like lara raith tries to push for more power in chicago sooner or later theyll swamp me in numbers and we both know si will always have their hands tied by red tape and politics if marcone signs the accords hell have a strong motivation to oppose any incursionand the means to do so but hes going to use his new means to secure his position here even more firmly murphy said quietly make new allies probably gain new resources yeah hes using me too i shook my head it isnt a perfect solution no murphy said it isnt but hes the devil we know neither of us said anything for several minutes yes murphy admitted he is murphy dropped me off at the hospital and i headed straight for elaines room i found her inside dressing she was just pulling a pair of jeans up over strong slender legs that looked just as good as i remembered when i opened the door she spun thornwand in hand i put my hands up and said easy there gunslinger im not looking for any trouble elaine gave me a gentle glare and slipped the wand into a small leather case that clipped to the jeans she did not look well but she looked a lot weller than she had the last time id seen her her face was still quite pale and her eyes were sunken and bruised but she moved with brisk purpose for all of that you shouldnt sneak up on people like that she said if id knocked i might have woken you up if youd knocked youd have missed out on an outside chance of seeing me getting dressed she shot back touche i glanced around and spotted her bag all packed my stomach twisted a little in disappointment shouldnt you be in bed she shook her head have you ever tried to watch daytime television i was glad when the set finally blew id lose my mind just lying here how you feeling a lot better elaine said stronger which is another reason to leave i dont want to have a nightmare and have my powers kill some poor grampas respirator i nodded so its back to california yes ive done enough damage for one trip i folded my arms and leaned against the door watching her brush back her hair enough to get it into a tail she didnt look at me when she asked did you get them yeah i said she closed her eyes shivered and exhaled okay she shook her head that shouldnt make me feel better it wont help anna it will help a lot of other people in the long run i said she abruptly slammed the brush against the rail of the bed snapping it i wasnt here trying to help a lot of other people dammit she glanced down at the brushs handle and seemed to deflate for a moment she tossed it listlessly into a corner i went over to her and put a hand on her shoulder this just in elaine isnt perfect news at eleven she leaned her cheek on my hand you should know i said i got reparations out of the white court a weregild for their dependents she blinked at me how my boyish charm can you get me contact information for the victims families ill get somebody to get the money to them yes she said some of them didnt have any dependents like anna i grunted and nodded i thought we might use that money to build something elaine frowned at me oh i nodded we use the money we expand the ordo build a network of contacts a hotline for middleclass practitioners we contact groups like the ordo in cities all around the country we put the word out that if people are in some kind of supernatural fix they can get word of it onto the network maybe if something like this starts happening again we can hear about it early and stomp on the fire before it grows we teach selfdefense classes we help people coordinate cooperate support one another we act elaine chewed on her lip and looked up at me uncertainly we you said you wanted to help people i said this might what do you think she stood up leaned up onto her toes and kissed me gently on the lips before staring into my eyes her own very wide and bright i think she said quietly that anna would have liked that ramirez woke up late that evening swathed in bandages his injured leg in traction and i was sitting next to his bed when he did it was a nice switch for me usually i was the one waking up into disorientation confusion and pain i gave him a few minutes to get his bearings before i leaned forward and said hey there man harry he rasped thirsty before he was finished saying it i picked up the little sports bottle of ice water theyd left next to his bed i put the straw between his lips and said can you hold it or should i do it for you he managed a small glare fumbled a hand up and held on to the bottle weakly he sipped some of the water then laid his head back on the pillow okay he said how bad is it alas i said youll live where hospital i said youre stable ive called listenstowind and hes going to come pick you up in the morning we win bad guys go boom i said the white king is still on his throne peace process is going to move ahead tell me so i gave him the battles last few minutes except for lashs role in things harry dresden ramirez murmured the human cannonball bam zoom right to the moon he smiled a little you get cowl doubt it i said he was right by his gate when he saw me running for the exit ten to one he just stepped back through it and zipped it shut in fact im pretty sure he did if thered been an open gate there the blast would have been able to spread into it i dont think we would have been thrown so far how about vitto i shook my head vitto was pretty far gone even before the bombs went off im pretty sure we nailed him and those ghouls too good thing you had that army on standby huh ramirez said a faint edge to his voice hey i said its late i should let you get some rest no ramirez said his voice stronger we need to talk i sat there for a minute bracing myself then i said about what about how tight you are with the vamps he said about you making deals with scumbag mobsters i recognized marcone ive seen his picture in the papers ramirez shook his head jesus christ harry were supposed to be on the same team its called trust man i wanted to spit something hostile and venomous and well deserved i toned myself down to saying gee a warden doesnt trust me thats a switch ramirez blinked at me what dont worry about it im used to it i said i had morgan sticking his nose into every corner of my existence for my entire adult life ramirez stared at me for a second then he let out a weak snort and said all hail the drama queen harry he shook his head im talking about you not trusting me man my increasingly angry retort died unspoken uh what ramirez shook his head wearily let me make some guesses one you dont trust the council you never have but lately its been worse especially since new mexico you think that whoever is leaking information to the vampires is pretty high up and the less anyone in the council knows about what youre doing the better i stared at him and said nothing two theres a new player in the game cowls on the new team we dont know who they are but they seem to have a hardon for screwing over everyone equallyvampires mortals wizards whoever he sighed you arent the only one whos been noticing these things harry i grunted what do you call them the black hats after our ringwraithwannabe buddy cowl you the black council i said oooh ramirez muttered yours is better thanks i said so you cant trust our own people he said but youre cutting deals with the vampires he narrowed his eyes you think you might be able to find the traitor coming in from the other side i put my finger on my nose and the gangster ramirez asked hes a snake i said but his word is good and madrigal and vitto had killed one of his people and i know he isnt working for cowls organization how do you know that because marcone works for marcone ramirez spread his hands weakly was that so damned hard dresden to talk to me i settled back in my chair my shoulders suddenly felt loose and wobbly i breathed in and out a few times and then said no ramirez snorted gently idiot so i said think i should come clean to the merlin ramirez opened one eye are you kidding he hates your guts hed have you declared a traitor locked up and executed before you got through the first paragraph he closed his eye again but im with you man all the way you dont have much endurance after going through something like ramirez had he was asleep before he realized it was about to happen i sat with him for the rest of the night until senior council member listenstowind arrived with his team of medical types before dawn the next morning you dont leave an injured friend all alone the next day i knocked on the door to the office at executive priority and went in without waiting for an answer tonight you will be visited by three spirits i announced the ghosts of indictment past present and future they will teach you the true meaning of you are still a scumbag criminal marcone was there sitting behind the desk with helen beckitt or maybe helen demeter i supposed she wore her professionally suggestive business suitand was sitting across marcones lap her hair and suit looked slightly mussed marcone had his third shirt button undone i cursed my timing if id come ten minutes later id have opened the door in medias res it would have been infinitely more awkward dresden marcone said his tone pleasant helen made no move to stir from where she was its nice to see you alive your sense of humor of course remains unchanged which is unsurprising as it seems to have died in your adolescence presumably it entered a suicide pact with your manners your good opinion i said means the world to me i see you got out of the nevernever simple enough marcone said i had to shoot a few of the vampires once we were clear of the fight i did not appreciate the way they were attempting to coerce my employees hells bells i sighed did you kill any of them unnecessary i shot them enough to make my point after that we had an adequate understanding of one anothermuch as you and i do i understand that you settled matters with annas killers mister dresden helen said with help of course marcone smiled his unreadable little smile at me the people who did the deed wont be bothering anyone anymore i said and most of the people who motivated them have gone into early retirement i glanced at marcone with help but not all of them helen asked frowning everyone we could make answer marcone said has answered it is unlikely we could accomplish more something made me say and im taking steps to prevent or mitigate this kind of circumstance in the future here and elsewhere helen tilted her head at me taking that in then she nodded and said very quietly thank you helen marcone said would you be so good as to excuse us for a few moments wont take long i added i dont like being here helen smiled slightly at me and rose smoothly from marcones lap if it makes you feel any better mister dresden you should know that he dislikes having you here as well you should see how much my insurance premiums go up after your visits dresden he shook his head and they call me an extortionist helen could you send bonnie in with that file certainly helen left healthy brunette bonnie in her ohsofetching exercise outfit bounced in with a manila folder gave me a colgate smile and departed again marcone opened the folder withdrew a stack of papers and started flicking through them he got to the last page turned it around slid it across the desk and produced a pen from his pocket here is the contract you faxed me sign here please i walked over to the desk took the entire stack and started reading it from page one you never sign a contract you havent read even if you arent a wizard if you are one its even more important than that people joke about signing away their soul or their firstborn in my world its possible marcone seemed to accept that he made a steeple of his fingers and waited with the relaxed patience of a wellfed cat the contract was the standard one for approving a new signatory of the accords and though hed had it retyped marcone hadnt changed a word probably i kept reading so you suggested the name demeter for helen i asked as i read marcones expression never changed yes hows persephone he stared at me persephone i said demeters daughter she was carried away by the lord of the underworld marcones stare became cold he kept her there in hades but demeter froze the whole world until the other gods convinced him to return persephone to her mother i turned a page the girl the one in the coma who youre keeping in a hospital somewhere and visiting every week thats helens daughter isnt it the one who got caught in the cross fire of one of your shootouts marcone didnt move newspaper file on it said she was killed i said i read several more pages before marcone answered tony vargassi my predecessor i suppose had a son marco marco decided that i had become a threat to his standing in the organization he was the shooter but the girl i said didnt die marcone shook his head it put vargassi in an awkward position if the girl recovered she might identify his son as the shooter and no jury in the world would fail to send a thug to jail whod shot a pretty little girl but if the girl died and it came back on marco hed be looking at a murder charge and someone who murders little girls gets the needle in illinois i said exactly there was a great deal of corruption at the time i snorted marcones little smile returned for a moment pardon me say instead that the vargassis exerted their influence on official matters with a heavy hand vargassi had the little girl declared dead he convinced the medical examiner to sign false paperwork and he hid the girl away in another hospital i grunted if marco got identified as the shooter and put up for trial vargassi could produce the little girl look shes not dead mistrial one possibility marcone replied and if things went quietly for a while he could simply delete her records and her i said yes whatever happened to old tony vargassi i asked i saw a flash of marcones teeth his whereabouts are unknown as are marcos when did you find out about the girl two years later he said everything was set up through a dummy corporations trust fund she could have just he looked away from me just lain there indefinitely no one would have known who she was known her name does helen know i asked him he shook his head he was quiet for a moment more i cant return persephone from hades the childs death almost destroyed helenand her world is still frozen if she knew her daughter was trapped just lying there in a halflife he shook his head it would shatter her world dresden and i shouldnt wish that ive noticed i said quietly that most of the young ladies working here would be about the same age as her daughter yes marcone said that isnt exactly a healthy recovery no marcone said but its what she has i thought about it while i kept reading maybe helen deserved to know about her daughter hell she probably did but whatever else marcone was he was no fool if he thought news of her daughters fate might shatter helen he was probably right sure she should know but did i have the right to make that decision probably noteven if marcone wouldnt do his best to have me killed if i tried hell i probably had less right to decide than marcone he had way more invested in the girl and her fate than i did because that was the secret id seen in a soulgaze with gentleman johnnie marcone years ago the secret that gave him the strength and the will to rule the mean streets he felt responsible for the little girl whod taken a bullet meant for him hed taken over chicago crime with ruthless efficiency always cutting down on the violence a couple of people had been hurt in gangrelated crimes the gangsters responsible hadnt been heard from again id always assumed it was because marcone had decided to manipulate matters to make himself appear to be a preferable alternative to more careless criminals who might take his place if the cops took him down id never even considered the idea that he might actually give a crap about innocents being harmed granted that didnt change anything he still ran a business that killed far more people than any amount of collateral damage he was still a criminal still a bad guy but he was the devil i knew and he probably could have been worse i got to the last page of the contract and found spaces for three signatures two of them were already filled donar vadderung i asked marcone current ceo of monoc securities marcone replied oslo and lara raith i murmured signing on behalf of her father the white king who is obviously in charge of the white court there was a trace of irony in marcones voice he hadnt been fooled by the puppet show i looked at the third open line then i signed it and left without another word it isnt a perfect world im doing the best i can hmmmm said bob the skull peering at my left hand it looks like i was sitting in my lab my hand spread open on the table white the skull examined my palm id worn a mark there for yearsan unblemished patch of skin amidst all the burn scars in the perfect shape of the angelic sigil that was lasciels name the mark was gone in its place was just an irregular patch of unburned skin it looks like theres no mark there anymore bob said i sighed thank you bob i said its good to have a professional opinion well what did you expect bob said the skull swiveled around on the table and tilted up to look at my face hmmmmm and you say the entity isnt responding to you anymore no and shes always jumped every time i said frog interesting bob said whats that supposed to mean well from what you told me this psychic attack the entity blocked for you was quite severe i shivered remembering yeah and the process she used to accelerate your brain and shield you was traumatic as well right she said it could cause me brain damage uhhuh bob said i think it did huh see what i mean bob asked cheerfully youre thicker already harry get hammer i said smash stupid talky skull for a guy with no legs bob backpedals swiftly and gracefully easy there chief dont get excited but the brain damage thing is for real i frowned explain please well i told you that the entity in your head was like a recording of the real lasciel right yeah that recording was written in your brain in portions you werent using right i think thats where the damage is i mean im looking at you right now and your head has been riddled with tiny holes boss i blinked and rubbed my fingers over my scalp it doesnt feel like that thats because your brain doesnt sense injuries it manages sensing injuries for the rest of you but trust me theres damage i think it wiped out the entity wiped out you mean like killed it bob said technically it was never alive but it was constructed its been deconstructed and i frowned and what and theres um a portion of you missing im sure i would have felt that i said not your body bob said scornfully your life force your chi your soul whoa wait a minute part of my soul is gone bob sighed people get all excited when you use that word the part of you that is more than merely physical yes you can call it whatever you want theres some missing and its nothing to panic over part of my soul is gone and im not supposed to be worried about that i demanded happens all the time bob said you shared a bunch of yours with susan and she with you its what protected you from lara raith you and murphy swapped some pretty recently looks likeyou must have gotten a hug or something honestly harry you really ought to bang her and get it over wi i reached under the worktable drew out a claw hammer and gave bob a pointed look um right he said back to business uh your soul you give away pieces of yourself all the time everyone does some of it goes out with your magic too it grows back relax boss if its no big deal i said then why is it so interesting oh well bob said it is energy you know and i wonder if maybe maybe well look harry there was a tiny bit of lasciels energy in you supporting the entity giving you access to hellfire thats gone now but the entity had to have had some kind of power source to turn against the essence of its own originator so it was running off my soul like im some kind of battery hey bob said dont get all righteous you gave it to her encouraging her to make her own choices to rebel to exercise free will bob shook his head free will is horrible harry believe me im glad i dont have it ugh no thank you but you gave her some you gave her a name the will came with it i was quiet for a moment then said and she used it to kill herself sort of bob said she chose which areas of your brain were going to take the worst beating she took a psychic bullet for you i guess its almost the same thing as choosing to die no it isnt i said quietly she didnt choose to die she chose to be free maybe thats why they call it free will bob said hey tell me that at least you got a pony ride before the carnival left town i mean she could have made you see and feel anything at all and bob paused and his eyelights blinked hey harry are you crying no i snapped and left the lab the apartment felt very empty i sat down with my guitar and tried to sort out my thoughts it was hard i was feeling all kinds of anger and confusion and sadness i kept telling myself that it was the emotional fallout of malvoras psychic assault but its one thing to repeat that to yourself over and over and quite another to sit there feeling awful i started playing beautifully it wasnt perfect performancea computer can do that it wasnt a terribly complex bit of music my fingers didnt suddenly regain their complete dexteritybut the music became alive my hands moved with a surety and confidence i usually felt only in bursts a few seconds long i played a second piece and then a third and every time my rhythm was on and i found myself seeing and using new nuances variations on chords that lent depth and color to the simple pieces i could playsweet sadness to the minor chords power to the majors stresses and resolutions id always heard in my head but could never express in life it was almost like someone had opened a door in my head like they were helping me along i heard a very very faint whisper like an echo of lashs voice everything i can dear host i played for a while longer before gently setting aside my guitar then i went to call father forthill and tell him to come over so that he could pick up the blackened denarius as soon as i dug it out of my basement i picked up thomas outside his apartment and tailed him as he crossed town he took the el over toward the loop and hit the sidewalks again he looked tense and paler than usual hed blown an awful lot of energy killing those ghouls and i knew hed have to feedmaybe dangerouslyto recover what hed lost id called him the day after the battle and tried to talk to him but hed remained reticent remote id told him i was worried about him after blowing that much energy hed hung up on me hed cut short two more calls since so being as how i am a smart and sensitive guy who respects his brothers feelings i was tailing him to find out what the hell he was trying so hard not to talk to me about this way i was sparing him all the effort and trouble of telling me about it by finding out all on my own like i said im sensitive and thoughtful and maybe a little stubborn thomas wasnt being very careful i would have expected him to move around the city like a longtailed cat at a rocking chair convention but he sort of trudged along fashionable in his dark slacks and loose deep crimson shirt his hands in his pockets his hair hiding his face most of the time even so he attracted more than a little feminine attention he was like a walking talking cologne commercial except that even silent and standing he was making women look over their shoulders at him while coyly rearranging their hair he finally stalked into the park tower and went into a trendy little boutiqueslashcoffee shop calling itself the coiffure cup i checked a clock and thought about following him in i could see a few people inside where a coffee bar backed up to the front window a couple of fairly pretty girls were getting things set up behind the counter but i couldnt see any more than that i found a spot where i could watch the door and loomed unobtrusivelywhich is easier than youd think even when youre as tall as i am a couple of women whose hair and nails screamed beautician came in later the boutique opened for business a few minutes after thomas got there and immediately began doing a brisk trade a lot of evidently wealthy terribly attractive generally young women started coming and going it put me in a quandary on the one hand i didnt want anyone to get hurt because my brother had exerted himself so furiously on my behalf on the other i didnt particularly care to go in and find my brother lording it over a roomful of worshipful women like some dark god of lust and shadow i chewed on my lip for a while and decided to go on in if thomas had if he had become the kind of monster his family generally did i owed it to him to try to talk some sense into him or pound it in whichever i pushed open the door to the coiffure cup and was immediately pleasantly assaulted by the aroma of coffee there was techno music playing thumping bouncily and mindlessly positive the front room contained the coffee bar a few little tables and a little podium next to a heavy curtain even as i came in one of the young women behind the bar came out to me gave me a bubbly caffeinated smile and said hi do you have an appointment no i said glancing back at the curtains um i just need to talk to someone one second sir she said in protest and tried to hurry into my path my legs were longer i gave her a smile and outdistanced her pushing the curtain aside the techno music grew a little louder as i went through the back room of the boutique smelled the way boutiques always do of various tonsorial chemicals a dozen styling stations all in use stood six on a side marching up to a rather large and elaborate station on a little raised platform at the base of the little platform was a pedicure station and a young woman with a mud mask and cucumber slices and a body posture of blissful relaxation was lounging through a pedicure on the other side another young woman was under a dryer reading a magazine her expression heavy and relaxed with that postcoiffure glow on the main chair on the platform a deluxe number that leaned back to a custom shampoo sink another young woman lay back with a blissful expression while having her hair washed by thomas he was chatting with her amiably as he worked and she was in the middle of a little laugh when i came in he leaned down and said something in her ear and though i couldnt hear the substance of it it came across in an unmistakable justusgirls kind of tone and she laughed again replying in a similar manner thomas laughed and turned away practically prancing over to a tray of styling implements i supposed he came back with a towel and i swear to god a dozen bobby pins held in his lips he rinsed her hair and started pinning sir protested the coffee girl who had followed me into the room everyone stopped and looked at me even the woman with the cucumbers over her eyes took one of them off and peered at me thomas froze his eyes widened to the size of hand mirrors he swallowed and the bobby pins fell out of his mouth all the women looked back and forth between us and there was an immediate buzz of whispers and quiet talks you have got to be kidding me i said ooh thomas said ahree one of the stylists glanced back and forth between us and said thomas she pronounced it toemoss who is your friend friend oy vey i rubbed at the bridge of my nose with one hand i was never going to get away from this one not if i lived to be five hundred thomas and i sat down at a table over cups of coffee this i asked him without preamble this is your mysterious job this is the moneymaking scam it was cosmetology school first thomas said he spoke in a french accent so thick that it barely qualified as english and night work as a security guard in a warehouse where no one else ever showed up to pay for it i rubbed at my nose again and then this here im thinking youve created your own batch of personal thralls while running around as a hired killer or something and youre washing hair it was difficult to keep my voice quiet but i made the effort there were too many ears in that little place thomas sighed well yes washing cutting styling dying i do it all baby ill bet then it hit me thats how youre feeding i said i thought that took sex thomas asked he shook his head intimacy trust and believe me next to sex washing and styling a womans hair is about as intimate as you can get with her youre still feeding on them i said it isnt the same harry it isnt as dangerousmore like sipping i suppose than taking bites i cant take very much or very quickly but im here all day and it he shivered it adds up he opened his eyes and met mine and theres no chance im going to lose control of myself theyre safe he shrugged a shoulder they just enjoy it i watched the woman whod been under the hair dryer come out smile at thomas and pick up a cup of coffee on the way out she looked well radiant really confident she looked like she felt sexy and beautiful and it was quite pleasant to watch her move while she did thomas watched her go with what i recognized as his look of quiet possession and pride they enjoy it a lot he gave me one of his brief swift grins i imagine theres a lot of husbands and boyfriends enjoying it too but theyre addicted to it id imagine he shrugged again some maybe i try to spread myself around as much as i can it isnt a perfect solution but its the one youve got i said i frowned what happens when you try to wash somebodys hair and it turns out that theyre in love protected true love isnt as common as youd think thomas said especially among people rich enough to afford me and superficial enough to think that it is money well spent but when they do show i asked thats why ive got all the hired help man i know what im doing i shook my head all this time and i snorted and sipped at some coffee it was amazing smooth and rich and just sweet enough and it probably cost more than a whole fastfood meal they all think im your lover dont they this is a trendy upperclass boutique harry no one expects a man with a place like this to be straight uhhuh and the accent toemoss he smiled no one would pay that much money to an american stylist please he shrugged its superficial and silly but true he glanced around suddenly selfconscious his voice lowered and his accent dropped look i know its a lot to ask it was an effort not to laugh at him but i managed to give him a hard look sigh and say your secret is safe with me he looked relieved merci hey i said can you stop by my place tonight after work im putting something together that might help people if someone else starts something like those white court bozos just tried i thought maybe youd want to be in on it um yeah yeah we can talk about it i sipped more coffee maybe justine could help too might be a way to get her out if you want to do it are you kidding thomas asked shes been working for a year to get closer to lara i blinked up at him hells bells i thought she was acting weird i said she came on all zonked out like the mindless party girl but she dropped it a couple of times where i could see i just put it down to well weirdness he shook his head shes been getting information to me nothing huge so far does lara know about her thomas shook his head she hasnt tipped to it yet justine is as far as lara is concerned still one more helpless little doe he glanced up i talked it over with her she wants to stay shes laras assistant most of the time i exhaled slowly holy crap if justine stayed in place and was willing to report on what she knew intelligence gathered at that level could turn the entire course of the warbecause even if the white courts peace proposal went through it just meant a shift in focus and strategy the vamps werent about to let up dangerous i said quietly she wants to do it he said i shook my head i take it youve been in touch with lara of course thomas said given my recent heroismhis voice turned wryin defense of the white king i am now in favor in the court the prodigal son has been welcomed home with open arms really well thomas amended with reluctant irritated arms anyway laras miffed about the deeps guess the bombs werent good for them thomass teeth showed the whole place just collapsed in on itself theres a huge hole in the ground the plumbing at the manor got torn up and the foundation cracked its going to cost a fortune to fix it poor lara i said no more convenient corpsedisposal facilities he laughed its nice to see her exasperated shes usually so selfassured i have a gift he nodded you do we sat quietly for a few minutes thomas i said finally gesturing at the room why didnt your tell me about this he shrugged and looked down at first because it was humiliating i mean working nights to put myself through cosmetology school starting my own place and posing as he waved a hand down at himself i thought i dont know at first i thought youd disapprove or laugh at me or something i kept a straight face no never and after that well id been keeping secrets i didnt want you to think i didnt trust you i snorted in other words you didnt trust me to understand his cheeks turned very slightly pink and he looked down um i guess so yeah sorry dont worry about it he closed his eyes and nodded and said thanks harry i put a hand on his shoulder for a second then dropped it again nothing else needed to be said thomas gave me a suspicious look now youre going to laugh at me i can wait until youve turned your back if you like he grinned at me again its all right i sort of stopped caring about it after i got fed steady for a few weeks straight feels too nice not to be starving again laugh all you want i looked around the place for a minute more the coffee girls were having a private conversation evidently discussing us if all the covert glances and quiet little smiles were any indication i couldnt help it i burst out laughing and it felt good
