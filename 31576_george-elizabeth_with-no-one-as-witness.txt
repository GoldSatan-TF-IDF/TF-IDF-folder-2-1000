elizabeth george with no one as witness book in the inspector lynley series for miss audra isadora with love and if you gaze for long into the abyss the abyss gazes also into you nietzsche prologue kimmo thorne liked dietrich best of all the hair the legs the cigarette holder the top hat and tails she was what he called the whole blooming package and as far as he was concerned she was second to none oh he could do garland if pressed minnelli was simple and he was definitely getting better with streisand but given his choiceand he was generally given it wasnt hehe went with dietrich sultry marlene his number one girl she could sing the crumbs out of a toaster could marlene make no bloody mistake about it so he held the pose at the end of the song not because it was necessary to the act but because he loved the look of the thing the finale to falling in love again faded and he just kept standing there like a marlene statue with one highheeled foot on the seat of the chair and his cigarette holder between his fingers the last note disappeared into silence and he remained for a five countexulting in marlene and in himself because she was good and he was good he was damn damn good when it came down to itbefore he altered his position he switched off the karaoke machine then he doffed his top hat and fluttered his tails he bowed deeply to his audience of two and aunt sal and granever loyal they werereacted appropriately as hed known they would aunt sally cried brilliant brilliant lad gran said thas our boy all over a hunnert percent talent our kimmo waitll i send some snaps to your mum and dad that would certainly bring them running kimmo thought sardonically but he put his highheeled foot on the chair once more knowing gran meant well even if she was something of a dim bulb when it came to what she believed about his parents gran directed aunt sally to move to the right get the boys best side and in a few minutes the pictures had been taken and the show was over for the evening where you off to tonight aunt sally asked as kimmo headed for his bedroom you seein anyone special our kim he wasnt but she neednt know that the blink he told her blithely well you lads keep yourselfs out of trouble then he winked at her and ducked into his doorway always always auntie he lied he eased the door shut behind him then and flicked its lock into place the care of the marlene togs came first kimmo took them off and hung them up before turning to his dressing table there he examined his face and for a moment considered removing some of the makeup but he finally shrugged the idea aside and rustled through the clothes cupboard for a change that would do he chose a hooded sweatshirt the leggings he liked and his flatsoled suede anklehigh boots he enjoyed the ambiguity of the ensemble male or female an observer might ask but only if kimmo spoke would it actually show for his voice had finally broken and when he opened his mouth now the jig was up he drew the sweatshirt hood over his head and sauntered down the stairs im off then he called to his gran and his aunt as he grabbed his jacket from a hook near the door bye darlin boy gran replied keep yourself yourself luv aunt sally added he kissed the air at them they kissed the air in turn love you everyone said at once outside he zipped his jacket and unlocked his bicycle from the railing he rolled it along to the lift and pressed the button there and as he waited he checked the bikes saddlebags to make sure that he had everything hed need he maintained a mental checklist on which he ticked items off emergency hammer gloves screwdriver jemmy pocket torch pillowcase one red rose this last he liked to leave as his calling card one really oughtnt to take without giving as well it was a cold night outside in the street and kimmo didnt look forward to the ride he hated having to go by bike and he hated biking even more when the temperature hovered so close to freezing but as neither gran nor aunt sally had a car and as he himself had no driving licence to flash at a copper along with his most appealing smile if he was stopped he had no other choice but to pedal it going by bus was more or less out of the question his route took him along southwark street to the heavier traffic of blackfriars road till in a crisscrossing fashion he reached the environs of kennington park from there traffic or not it was more or less a bullets path to clapham common and his destination a conveniently detached redbrick dwelling of three storeys which hed spent the last month carefully casing at this point he knew the comings and goings of the family inside so thoroughly that he might as well have lived there himself he knew they had two children mum got her exercise riding a bike to work while dad went by train from clapham station they had an au pair with a regularly scheduled two nights each week off and on one of those nightsalways the same onemum dad and the kids left as a family and went tokimmo didnt know he assumed it was grans for dinner but it just as easily could have been a lengthy church service a session with a counselor or lessons in yoga point was they were gone for the evening till late in the evening and when they arrived home they invariably had to lug the little ones into the house because theyd fallen asleep in the car as for the au pair she took her nights off with two other birds who were similarly employed theyd leave together chatting away in bulgarian or whatever it was and if they returned before dawn it was still long after midnight the signs were propitious for this particular house the car they drove was the largest of the range rovers a gardener visited them once a week they had a cleaning service as well and their sheets and pillowcases were laundered ironed and returned by a professional this particular house kimmo had concluded was ripe and waiting what made it all so nice was the house next door and the lovely to let sign dangling forlornly from a post near the street what made it all so perfect was the easy access from the rear a brick wall running along a stretch of wasteland kimmo pedaled to this point after coasting by the front of the house to make sure the family were being true to their rigid schedule then he bumped his way across the wasteland and propped his bike against the wall using the pillowcase to carry his tools and the rose he hopped up on the saddle of the bike and with no trouble lifted himself over the wall the back garden was blacker than the devils tongue but kimmo had peered over the wall before and he knew what lay before him directly beneath was a compost heap beyond which a little zigzagging orchard of fruit trees decorated a nicely clipped lawn to either side of this wide flower beds made herbaceous borders one of them curved round a gazebo the other graced the vicinity of a garden shed last in the distance just before the house were a patio of uneven bricks where rainwater pooled after a storm and then a roof overhang from which the security lights were hung they clicked on automatically as kimmo approached he gave them a nod of thanks security lights hed long ago decided had to be the ironic inspiration of a housebreaker since whenever they switched on everyone appeared to assume a mere cat was passing through the garden hed yet to hear of a neighbour giving the cops a bell because of some lights going on on the other hand hed heard plenty of stories from fellow housebreakers about how much easier those lights had made access to the rear of a property in this case the lights meant nothing the uncurtained dark windows along with the to let sign told him that no one resided in the house to his right while the house to his left had no windows on this side of it and no dog to set up a spate of barking in the nighttime cold he was as far as he could tell in the clear french windows opened onto the patio and kimmo made for these there a quick tap with his emergency hammersuitable in a crisis for breaking a car windowwas quite sufficient to gain him access to the handle on the door he opened this and stepped inside the burglar alarm hooted like an airraid siren the sound was earsplitting but kimmo ignored it he had five minutesperhaps moretill the phone would ring with the security company on the line hoping to discover that the alarm had been tripped accidentally when they went unsatisfied they would phone the contact numbers theyd been given when that didnt suffice to bring an end to the incessant screeching of the siren they might phone the police who in turn might or might not show up to check matters out but in any case that eventuality was a good twenty minutes away which in itself was ten minutes longer than kimmo needed to score what he was looking for in the building he was a specialist in this particular field leave to others the computers the laptops the cd and dvd players the televisions the jewellery the digital cameras the palm pilots and the video players he was looking for only one kind of item in the houses he visited and the benefit of this item he sought was that it would always be in plain sight and generally in the public rooms of a house kimmo shone his pocket torch round he was in a dining room and there was nothing here to take but in the sitting room he could already see four prizes glittering on the top of a piano he went to fetch them silver frames that he divested of their photographsone always wanted to be thoughtful about some thingsbefore depositing them carefully in his pillowcase he found another on one of the side tables and he scored this as well before moving to the front of the house where near the door a halfmoon table with a mirror above it displayed two others along with a porcelain box and a flower arrangement both of which he left where they were experience told him that chances were good hed find the rest of what he wanted in the master bedroom so he quickly mounted the stairs as the burglar alarm continued to blare against his eardrums the room he sought was on the top floor in the back overlooking the garden and hed just clicked on his torch to check out its contents when the shrieking of the alarm ceased abruptly just as the telephone started to ring kimmo stopped short one hand on his torch and the other halfway to a picture frame in which a couple in wedding gear kissed beneath a bough of flowers in a moment the phone stopped just as abruptly as the alarm and from below a light went on and someone said hullo and then no weve only just walked inyes yes it was going off but i havent had a chance tojesus christ gail get away from that glass that was enough to tell kimmo that matters had taken an unexpected turn he didnt pause to wonder what the hell the family were doing home when they were still supposed to be at grans at church at yoga at counseling or wherever the hell they went when they went instead he dived for the window to the left of the bed as below a woman cried ronald someones in the house kimmo didnt need to hear ronald come tearing up the stairs or gail shouting no stop to understand that he had to be out of there pronto he fumbled with the lock on the window threw up the sash and heaved himself and his pillowcase out just as ronald barreled into the room armed with what looked like a fork for turning meat on a barbecue kimmo dropped with an enormous thump and a gasp onto the overhang some eight feet below cursing the fact that there had been no convenient wisteria vine down which he could tarzan his way to freedom he heard gail shouting hes here hes here and ronald cursing from the window above just before he scarpered for the rear wall of the property he turned back to the house giving a grin and a saucy salute to the woman who stood in the dining room with an awestruck sleepy child in her arms and another hanging on to her trousers then he was off the pillowcase bouncing against his back and laughter bubbling up inside him only sorry he hadnt been able to leave behind the rose as he reached the wall he heard ronald come roaring out of the diningroom door but by the time the poor bloke reached the first of the trees kimmo was up over and heading across the wasteland when the cops finally arrivedwhich could be anywhere from an hour to midday tomorrowhed be long gone a faint memory in the mind of the missus a painted face beneath a sweatshirt hood god this was living this was the best if the haul proved to be sterling stuff hed be a few hundred quid richer come friday morning did it get better than this did it kimmo didnt think so so what that hed said hed go straight for a while he couldnt throw away the time hed already spent putting this job together hed be thick to do that and the one thing kimmo thorne was not was thick not a bit of that no way hoesay he was pedaling along perhaps a mile from his breakin when he became aware of being followed there was other traffic about on the streetswhen wasnt there traffic in londonand several cars had honked as theyd passed him he first thought they were honking at him the way vehicles do to a cyclist they wish to get out of their way but he soon came to realise that they were honking at a slowmoving vehicle close behind him one that refused to pass him by he felt a little unnerved by this wondering if ronald had somehow managed to get it together and track him down he turned down a side street to make sure he wasnt mistaken in his belief in being tailed and sure enough the headlights directly behind him turned as well he was about to shoot off in a fury of pedaling when he heard the rumble of an engine coming up next to him and then his name spoken in a friendly voice kimmo that you whatre you doing in this part of town kimmo coasted he slowed he turned to see who was speaking to him he smiled when he realised who the driver was and he said never mind me whatre you doing here the other smiled back looks like im cruising round for you need a lift somewhere it would be convenient kimmo thought if ronald had seen him take off on the bike and if the cops were quicker to respond than they normally were he didnt really want to be out on the street he still had a couple more miles to go and it was cold as antarctica anyway he said i got the bike with me though the other chuckled well thats no problem if you dont want it to be chapter one detective constable barbara havers considered herself one lucky bird the drive was empty shed elected to do her weekly shop by car rather than on foot and this was always a risky business in an area of town where anyone fortunate enough to find a parking space near their home clung to it with the devotion of the newly redeemed to the source of his redemption but knowing she had much to purchase and shuddering at the thought of trudging in the cold back from the local grocery shed opted for transport and hoped for the best so when she pulled up in front of the yellow edwardian house behind which her tiny bungalow stood she took the space in the drive without compunction she listened to the coughing and gagging of her minis engine as she turned it off and she made her fifteenth mental note of the month to have the car looked at by a mechanic whoone prayedwould not ask an arm a leg and ones firstborn child to repair whatever was causing it to belch like a dyspeptic pensioner she climbed out and flipped the seat forward to gather up the first of the plastic carrier bags shed linked four of them over her arms and was dragging them out of the car when she heard her name called someone sang it out barbara barbara look what ive found in the cupboard barbara straightened and glanced in the direction from which the voice had chimed she saw the young daughter of her neighbour sitting on the weathered wooden bench in front of the groundfloor flat of the old converted building shed removed her shoes and was in the process of struggling into a pair of inline skates far too large by the look of them barbara thought hadiyyah was only eight years old and the skates were clearly meant for an adult thesere mummys hadiyyah informed her as if reading her mind i found them in a cupboard like i said ive never skated on them before i expect theyre going to be big on me but ive stuffed them with kitchen towels dad doesnt know about the kitchen towels hadiyyah giggled not that he doesnt know that ive found them perhaps youre not meant to be using them oh they werent hidden just put away till mummy gets home i expect shes in canada right barbara nodded well you take care with those your dads not going to be chuffed if you fall and break your head dyou have a helmet or something hadiyyah looked down at her feetone skated and one sockedand thought about this am i meant to safety precaution barbara told her a consideration for the street sweepers as well keeps peoples brains off the pavement hadiyyah rolled her eyes i know youre joking barbara crossed her heart gods truth wheres your dad anyway are you alone today she kicked open the picket gate that fronted a path to the house and she considered whether she ought to talk to taymullah azhar once again about leaving his daughter on her own while it was true that he did it rarely enough barbara had told him that she would be pleased to look after hadiyyah on her own time off if he had students to meet or lab work to supervise at the university hadiyyah was remarkably selfsufficient for an eightyearold but at the end of the day she was still that an eightyearold and more innocent than her fellows in part because of a culture that kept her protected and in part because of the desertion of her english mother who had now been in canada for nearly a year hes gone to buy me a surprise hadiyyah informed her matteroffactly he thinks i dont know he thinks i think hes running an errand but i know what hes really doing its cause he feels bad and he thinks i feel bad which i dont but he wants to help me feel better anyway so he said ive an errand to run kushi and im meant to think its not about me have you done your shopping cn i help you barbara more bags in the car if you want to fetch them barbara told her hadiyyah slipped off the bench andone skate on and one skate offhopped over to the mini and pulled out the rest of the bags barbara waited at the corner of the house when hadiyyah joined her bobbing up and down on her one skate barbara said whats the occasion then hadiyyah followed her to the bottom of the property where under a false acacia tree barbaras bungalowlooking much like a garden shed with delusions of grandeursnowed flakes of green paint onto a narrow flower bed in need of planting hmm hadiyyah asked close up now barbara could see that the little girl wore the headphones of a cd player round her neck and the player itself attached to the waistband of her blue jeans some unidentifiable music was issuing tinnily from it in a feminine register hadiyyah appeared not to notice this the surprise barbara said as she opened the front door of her digs you said your dad was out fetching you a surprise oh that hadiyyah clumped into the bungalow and deposited her burdens on the dining table where several days post mingled with four copies of the evening standard a basket of dirty laundry and an empty bag of custard cremes it all made an unappealing jumble at which the habitually neat little girl frowned meaningfully you havent sorted out your belongings she chided astute observation barbara murmured and the surprise i know its not your birthday hadiyyah tapped her skateshod foot against the floor and looked suddenly uncomfortable a reaction entirely unusual for her she had barbara noted plaited her own dark hair today her parting made a series of zigzags while the red bows at the end of her plaits were lopsided with one tied a good inch higher than the other well she said as barbara began emptying the first of the carrier bags onto the work top of the kitchen area he didnt exactly say but i expect its cause mrs thompson phoned him barbara recognised the name of hadiyyahs teacher she looked over her shoulder at the little girl and raised a questioning eyebrow see there was a tea hadiyyah informed her well not really a tea but thats what they called it because if they called it what it really was everyone wouldve been too embarrassed and no one wouldve gone and they did want everyone to go why what was it really hadiyyah turned away and began unloading the carrier bags shed brought from the mini it was she informed barbara more of an event than a tea or really more of a meeting than an event mrs thompson had a lady come to talk to them about their bodies you see and all the girls in the class and all their mums came to listen and afterwards they could ask questions and after that they had orange squash and biscuits and cakes so mrs thompson called it a tea although no one actually drank tea hadiyyah having no mum to take along had eschewed attending the event altogether hence the phone call from mrs thompson to her father because like she said everyone was really meant to go dad said he wouldve gone hadiyyah said but that wouldve been excruciating sides meagan dobson told me what it was all about anyway girl stuff babies boys periods she pulled a shuddering face you know ah got it barbara could understand how azhar must have reacted to the phone call from the teacher no one she had ever met had as much pride as the pakistani professor who was her neighbour well kiddo if you ever need a gal pal to act as a substitute for your mother she told hadiyyah im happy to oblige how lovely hadiyyah exclaimed for a moment barbara thought she was referring to her offer as maternal surrogate but she saw that her little friend was bringing forth a package from within the bag of groceries chocotastic poptarts is this for your breakfast hadiyyah sighed perfect nutrition for the professional woman on the go barbara told her let it be our little secret okay one of many and whatre these hadiyyah asked as if she hadnt spoken oh wonderful clottedcream icecream bars if i was a grownup id eat just like you i do like to touch on all the basic food groups barbara told her chocolate sugar fat and tobacco have you come across the players by the way you mustnt keep smoking hadiyyah told her rustling in one of the bags and bringing out a carton of the cigarettes dads trying to stop did i tell you mummyll be so pleased she asked him and asked him to stop hari itll make your lungs all nasty if you dont quit is what she says i dont smoke i should hope not barbara said some of the boys do actually they stand round down the street from school thesere the older boys and they take their shirttails out of their trousers barbara i expect they think it makes them look cool but i think it makes them look she frowned thoughtful beastly she settled on perfectly beastly peacocks and their plumes barbara acknowledged hmm the male of the species attracting the female otherwise shed have nothing to do with him interesting no men should be the ones wearing makeup hadiyyah giggled at this saying dad would look a sight wearing lipstick wouldnt he hed be fighting them off with a broomstick mummy wouldnt like that hadiyyah noted she scooped up four tins of all day breakfastbarbaras preferred dinner in a pinch after a longer than usual day at workand carried them over to the cupboard above the sink no i dont expect she would barbara agreed hadiyyah what is that bloodyawful screeching going on round your neck she took the tins from the little girl and nodded at her headphones from which some sort of questionable pop music was continuing to issue nobanzi hadiyyah said obscurely nowhatie nobanzi theyre brilliant look from out of her jacket pocket she brought the plastic cover of a cd on it three anorexic twentysomethings posed in crop tops the size of scrooges generosity and blue jeans so tight that the only thing left to imagine was how theyd managed to cram themselves into them ah barbara said role models for our young give that over then lets have a listen hadiyyah willingly handed over the earphones which barbara set on her head she absently reached for a packet of players and shook one out despite hadiyyahs moue of disapproval she lit one as what sounded like the chorus to a songif it could be called thatassailed her eardrums the vandellas nobanzi definitely was not with or without martha barbara decided there was a chorus of unintelligible words lots of orgasmic groaning in the background appeared to take the place of both the bass line and the drums barbara removed the headphones and handed them over she drew in on her fag and speculatively cocked her head at hadiyyah hadiyyah said arent they brilliant she took the cd cover and pointed to the girl in the middle who had dualcolored dreadlocks and a smoking pistol tattooed on her right breast thiss juno shes my favourite shes got a baby called nefertiti isnt she lovely the very word id use barbara screwed up the emptied carrier bags and shoved them in the cupboard beneath the sink she opened her cutlery drawer and found at the back of it a pad of sticky notes that she generally used to remind herself of important upcoming events like consider plucking eyebrows or clean this disgusting toilet this time however she scribbled three words and said to her little friend come with me its time to see to your education before grabbing up her shoulder bag and leading her back to the front of the house where hadiyyahs shoes lay beneath the bench in the flagstoned area just outside the door to the groundfloor flat barbara told her to put on her shoes while she herself posted the sticky note on the door when hadiyyah was ready barbara said follow me ive let your dad know and she headed off the property and in the direction of chalk farm road wherere we going hadiyyah asked are we having an adventure barbara said let me ask you a question nod if any of these names are familiar buddy holly no richie valens no the big bopper no elvis well of course who wouldnt know elvis but that hardly counts what about chuck berry little richard jerry lee lewis great balls of fire ring any bells no bloody hell whatre they teaching you at school you shouldnt swear hadiyyah said on chalk farm road it was not an overlong walk to their destination the virgin megastore in camden high street to get there though they had to negotiate the shopping district which as far as barbara had ever been able to ascertain was unlike any shopping precinct in the city packed shopfront to street with young people of every colour persuasion and manner of bodily adornment flooded by a blaring cacophony of music from every direction scented with everything from patchouli oil to fish and chips here shops had mascots crawling up the front of them in the form of superhuge cats the gigantic bottom of a torso wearing blue jeans enormous boots an aeroplane nose downonly vaguely did the mascots have anything to do with the wares within the individual shops since most of these were given over to anything black and many things leather black leather black faux leather black faux fur on black faux leather hadiyyah barbara saw was taking everything in with the expression of a novice the first indication barbara had that the little girl had never before been to camden high street despite its proximity to their respective homes hadiyyah followed along eyes the size of hubcaps lips parted face rapt barbara had to steer her in and out of the crowd one hand on her shoulder to make sure they didnt become separated in the crush brilliant brilliant hadiyyah breathed hands clasped to her chest oh barbara this is so much better than a surprise glad you like it barbara said will we go into the shops when ive seen to your education she took her into the megastore to classic rock n roll this barbara told her is music nowwhere to start you off well theres no question really is there because at the end of the day we have the great one and then we have everyone else so she scanned the section for the hs and then the hs themselves for the only h that counted she examined the selections flipping each over to read the songs while next to her hadiyyah studied the photos of buddy holly on the cd covers bit odd looking she remarked bite your tongue here thisll do its got raining in my heart which i guarantee will make you swoon and rave on whichll make you want to dance on the work top this kiddo is rock n roll peoplell be listening to buddy holly in one hundred years i guarantee it as for nobuki nobanzi hadiyyah corrected her patiently theyll be gone next week gone and forgotten while the great one will rave on into eternity this my girl is music hadiyyah looked doubtful he wears awfully strange specs she noted well yeah but that was the style hes been dead forever plane crash bad weather trying to get home to the pregnant wife too young barbara thought too much in a hurry how sad hadiyyah looked at the photo of buddy holly with awakened eyes barbara paid for their purchase and peeled off its wrapper she brought out the cd and replaced nobanzi with buddy holly she said feast your ears on this and when the music started she led hadiyyah back out to the street as promised barbara took her into several of the shops where the heretodaypasséinthirtyminutes fashions were crammed onto clothing racks and hung from the walls scores of teenagers were spending money as if news of armageddon had just been broadcast and there was a sameness to them that caused barbara to look at her companion and pray hadiyyah always maintained the air of artlessness that made her such a pleasure to be around barbara couldnt imagine her transformed into a london teenager in a tearing hurry to arrive at adulthood mobile phone pressed to her ear lipstick and eye shadow colouring her face blue jeans sculpting her little arse and highheeled boots destroying her feet and she certainly couldnt imagine the little girls father allowing her out in public so arrayed for her part hadiyyah took everything in like a child on her first trip to a fun fair with buddy holly raining in her heart it was only when theyd progressed upwards to chalk farm road where the crowds were if anything thicker louder and more decorated than in the shops below that hadiyyah removed her earphones and finally spoke i want to come back here every week from now on she announced will you come with me barbara i could save all my money and we could have lunch and then we could go in all of the shops we cant today cause i ought to be home before dad gets there hell be cross if he knows where weve been will he why oh cause im forbidden to come here hadiyyah said pleasantly dad says if he ever saw me out in camden high street hed wallop me properly till i couldnt sit down your note didnt say we were coming here did it barbara gave an inward curse she hadnt considered the ramifications of what shed intended as only an innocent jaunt to the music shop she felt for a moment as if shed corrupted the innocent but she allowed herself to experience the relief of having written a note to taymullah azhar that had employed three words onlykiddos with mealong with her signature now if she could just depend on hadiyyahs discretionalthough from the little girls excitementdespite her intention of keeping her father in the dark as to her whereabouts while he was on his errandbarbara had to admit it was highly unlikely that shed be able to hide from azhar the pleasure attendant on their adventure i didnt exactly tell him where wed be barbara admitted oh thats brilliant hadiyyah said cause if he knewi dont much fancy being walloped barbara do you dyou think hed actually oh look look hadiyyah cried whats this place called then and it smells so heavenly are they cooking somewhere cn we go in this place was camden lock market which they had come up to in their journey homeward it stood on the edge of the grand union canal and the fragrance of the food stalls within it had reached them all the way on the pavement within and mixing with the noise of rap music emanating from one of the shops one could just discern the barking of food vendors hawking everything from stuffed jacket potatoes to chicken tikka masala barbara cn we go inside this place hadiyyah asked again oh its so special and dadll never know we wont be walloped i promise barbara barbara looked down at her shining face and knew she couldnt deny her the simple pleasure of a wander through the market how much trouble could it cause indeed if they were to take half an hour more and poke about among the candles the incense the tshirts and the scarves she could distract hadiyyah from the drug paraphernalia and the bodypiercing stalls if they came upon them as to the rest of what camden lock market offered it was all fairly innocent barbara smiled at her little companion what the hell she said with a shrug lets go theyd taken only two steps in their intended direction when barbaras mobile phone rang however barbara said hang on to hadiyyah and read the incoming number when she saw who it was she knew the news was unlikely to be good the games afoot it was acting superintendent thomas lynleys voice and it bore an underlying note of tension the source of which he made clear when he added get over to hilliers office as quickly as you can hillier barbara studied the mobile like an alien object while hadiyyah waited patiently at her side toeing a crack in the pavement and watching the mass of humanity part round them as it heaved its way towards one market or another ac hillier cant have asked for me youve got an hour lynley told her but sir he wanted thirty minutes but we negotiated where are you camden lock market can you get here in an hour ill do my best barbara snapped the phone off and shoved it into her bag she said kiddo weve got to save this for another day somethings up at the yard something bad hadiyyah asked maybe yes maybe no barbara hoped for no she hoped that what was up was an end to her period of punishment shed been suffering the mortification of demotion for months now and she couldnt help anticipating an end to what she considered her professional ostracism every time assistant commissioner sir david hilliers name came up in conversation and now she was wanted wanted in ac hilliers office wanted there by hillier himself and by lynley who barbara knew had been manoeuvring to get her back to her rank almost as soon as shed had it stripped from her she and hadiyyah virtually trotted all the way back to eton villas they parted where the flagstone path divided at the corner of the house hadiyyah gave a wave before she skipped over to the groundfloor flat where barbara could see that the sticky note shed left for the little girls father had been removed from the door she concluded that azhar had returned with the surprise for his daughter so she went to her bungalow for a hasty change of clothes the first decision she had to makeand quickly because the hour lynley had spoken of on the mobile was now fortyfive minutes after her dash from the markets on chalk farm roadwas what to wear her choice needed to be professional without being an obvious ploy to win hilliers approval trousers and a matching jacket would do the first without teetering too close to the second so trousers and matching jacket it would be she found them where shed last left them in a ball behind the television set she couldnt recall exactly how theyd got there and she shook them out to survey the damage ah the beauty of polyester she thought one could be the victim of stampeding buffalo and still not bear a wrinkle to show it she set about changing into an ensemble of sorts this was less about making a fashion statement and more about throwing on the trousers and rooting for a blouse without too many obvious creases in it she decided on the least offensive shoes she owneda pair of scuffed brogues that she donned in place of the red hightop trainers she preferredand within five minutes she was able to grab two chocotastic poptarts she shoved them into her shoulder bag on her way out of the door outside there remained the question of transport car bus or underground all of them were risky a bus would have to lumber through the clogged artery of chalk farm road a car meant engaging in creative rat running and as for the undergroundthe underground line serving chalk farm was the notoriously unreliable northern line on the best of days the wait alone could be twenty minutes barbara opted for the car she fashioned herself a route that would have done justice to daedalus and she managed to get herself down to westminster only eleven and a half minutes behind schedule still she knew that hillier was not going to be chuffed with anything other than punctuality so she blasted round the corner when she got to victoria street and once shed parked she headed for the lifts at a run she stopped on the floor where lynley had his temporary office in the hope that he might have held off hillier for the extra eleven and a half minutes it had taken her to get there he hadnt done or so his empty office suggested dorothea harriman the departmental secretary confirmed barbaras conclusion hes up with the assistant commissioner detective constable she said he said youre to go up and join them dyou know the hems coming out of your trousers is it damn barbara said ive a needle if you want it no time dee dyou have a safety pin dorothea went to her desk barbara knew how unlikely it was that the other woman would have a pin indeed dee was always turned out so perfectly that it was tough to imagine her even in possession of a needle she said no pin detective constable sorry but theres always this she held up a stapler barbara said go for it but be quick im late i know youre missing a button from your cuff as well dorothea noted and theresdetective constable youve gotis this sluts wool on your backside oh damn damn barbara said never mind hell have to take me as i am which wasnt likely to be with open arms she thought as she crossed over to tower block and took the lift up to hilliers office hed been wanting to sack her for at least four years and only the intervention of others had kept him from it hilliers secretarywho always referred to herself as judiwithanimacintoshtold barbara to go straight in sir david she said was waiting for her had been waiting with acting superintendent lynley for a good many minutes she added she smiled insincerely and pointed to the door inside barbara found hillier and lynley concluding a conference call with someone who was on hilliers speakerphone talking about preparing to engage in damage limitation i expect well want a press conference then hillier said and soon so we dont end up seeming as if were doing it just to appease fleet street when can you manage it well be sorting that out directly how closely do you want to be involved very and with an appropriate companion at hand fine ill be in touch then david david and damage limitation barbara thought the speaker was obviously a mucketymuck from the dpa hillier ended the conversation he looked at lynley said well and then noticed barbara just inside the door he said where the hell have you been constable so much barbara thought for having a chance to polish anyones apples she said sorry sir as lynley turned in his chair traffic was deadly life is deadly hillier said but that doesnt stop any of us from living it absolute monarch of the flaming non sequitur barbara thought she glanced at lynley who raised a warning index finger approximately half an inch she said yes sir and she joined the two officers at the conference table where lynley was sitting and where hillier had moved when hed ended his phone call she eased a chair out and slid onto it as unobtrusively as possible the table she saw with a glance held four sets of photographs in them four bodies lay from where she sat they appeared to be young adolescent boys arranged on their backs with their hands folded high on their chests in the manner of effigies on tombs they would have looked like boys asleep had they not been cyanotic of face and necklaced with the mark of ligatures barbara pursed her lips holy hell she said when did they over the past three months hillier said three months but why hasnt anyone barbara looked from hillier to lynley lynley she saw looked deeply concerned hillier always the most political of animals looked wary i havent heard a whisper about this or read a word in the papers or seen any reports on the telly four deaths the same mo all victims young all victims male please try to sound a little less like an hysterical newsreader on cable television hillier said lynley shifted position in his chair he cast a look barbaras way his brown eyes were telling her to hold back from saying what they all were thinking until the two of them managed to get alone somewhere all right barbara thought she would play it that way she said in a careful professional voice who are they then a b c and d we havent any names no one reported them missing in three months thats evidently part of the problem lynley said what dyou mean where were they found hillier indicated one of the photographs as he spoke the firstin gunnersbury park september tenth found at eightfifteen in the morning by a jogger needing to have a piss theres an old garden inside the park partially walled not far off gunnersbury avenue that looks to be the means of access therere two boardedup entrances there right on the street but he didnt die in the park barbara noted with a nod at the photo in which the boy had been positioned supine on a mattress of weeds that grew at the juncture of two brick walls there was nothing that suggested a struggle had taken place in the vicinity there was also in the entire stack of pictures from that crime scene no photograph of the sort of evidence one expected to find where a murder occurs no he didnt die there nor did this one hillier picked up another batch of photographs in it the body of another slender boy was draped across the bonnet of a car positioned as neatly as the first in gunnersbury park this one was found in an ncp car park at the top of queensway just over five weeks later whats the murder squad over there saying anything from cctv the car park doesnt have closedcircuit cameras lynley answered barbaras question theres a sign posted that there may be cameras on the premises but thats it thats supposed to do the job of security this one was in quaker street hillier went on indicating a third set of photos an abandoned warehouse not far from brick lane november twentyfifth and this he picked up the final batch and handed them over to barbarais the latest he was found in st georges gardens today barbara glanced at the final set of pictures in them the body of an adolescent boy lay naked on the top of a lichencovered tomb the tomb itself sat on a lawn not far from a serpentine path beyond this a brick wall fenced off not a cemeteryas one would expect from the tombs presencebut a garden beyond the wall appeared to be a mews of garages and a block of flats behind them st georges gardens barbara asked where is this place not far from russell square who found the body the warden who opens the park every day our killer got access from the gates on handel street they were chained up properly but bolt cutters did the trick he opened up drove a vehicle inside made his deposit on the tomb and took off stopped to wrap the chain back round the gate so anyone passing wouldnt notice tyre prints in the garden two decent ones casts are being made witnesses barbara indicated the flats that lined the garden just beyond the mews weve constables from the theobalds road station doing the doortodoor barbara pulled all of the photographs towards her and laid the four victims in a row she immediately took note of the differencesall of them major onesbetween the final dead boy and the first three all of them were young teenagers whod died in an identical fashion but unlike the first three boys the latest victim was not only naked but also had a copious amount of makeup on lipstick eye shadow liner and mascara smeared across his face additionally the killer had marked his body by slicing it open from sternum to waist and by drawing with blood an odd circular symbol on his forehead the most potentially explosive political detail however had to do with race only the final victim was white of the earlier three one was black and the two others were clearly mixed race black and asian perhaps black and filipino black and a blend of god only knew what seeing this last feature barbara understood why there had been no frontpage newspaper coverage why no television and worst of all why no whispers round new scotland yard she raised her head institutionalised racism thats what theyre going to claim isnt it no one across londonin any of the stations involved righteven twigged theres a serial killer at work no one got round to comparing notes this kid here she raised the photograph of the black youthmightve been reported missing in peckham maybe in kilburn or lewisham or anywhere but his body wasnt dumped where he lived and disappeared from was it so the rozzers on his home patch called him a runaway left it at that and never matched him up to a murder that got reported in another stations patch is that what happened you can see the need for both delicacy and immediate action hillier said cheap murders hardly worth investigating all because of their race thats what theyre going to call the first three when the story gets out the tabloids television and radio news the whole flaming lot we intend to get the jump on what they call anything if the truth be told the tabloids the broadsheets the radio and the television newshad they been attuned to whats going on and not intent on pursuing scandals among celebrities the government and the bloody royal familymight have broken this story themselves and crucified us on their front pages as it is they can hardly claim institutionalised racism for our failure to see what they themselves could have seen and did not rest assured that when each stations press officer released the news of a body being found the story was judged a nonstarter by the media because of the victim just another dead black boy cheap news not worth reporting hohum with respect sir barbara pointed out thats hardly going to stop them braying now well see about that ah hillier smiled expansively as his office door swung open again heres the gentleman weve been waiting for have they sorted out your paperwork winston may we call you sergeant nkata officially barbara felt the question come at her like an unexpected blow she looked at lynley but he was standing to greet winston nkata whod paused just inside the door unlike her nkata was dressed with the care he habitually employed everything about him was crisp and clean in his presencein the presence of all of them come to thatbarbara felt like cinderella in advance of the fairy godmothers visit she got to her feet she was about to do the very worst thing for her career but she didnt see any other way outexcept the way out which she decided to take she said to her colleague winnie brilliant cheers i didnt know and then to the other two ranking officers ive just remembered a phone call im meant to return then she left the room acting superintendent thomas lynley felt the distinct need to follow havers at the same time he recognised the wisdom of staying put ultimately he knew hed probably be better able to do her service if at least one of them managed to remain in ac hilliers good graces that unfortunately was never easy the assistant commissioners style of command generally existed on the border between machiavellian and despotic and rational individuals gave the man a very wide berth if they could lynleys own immediate superiormalcolm webberly whod been on medical leave for some timehad been running interference for both lynley and havers since the day hed assigned them to their first case together without webberly at new scotland yard it fell to lynley to recognise which side of the bread bore the butter the present situation was trying lynleys determination to remain a disinterested party in his every interaction with hillier thered been a moment early on when the ac could have easily told him about winston nkatas promotion the very same moment when the man had refused to restore barbara havers to her rank what hillier had said with little enough grace was i want you heading up this investigation lynley acting superintendent i can hardly give it to anyone else malcolm would have wanted you on it anyway so put together the team you need lynley had mistakenly put the acs laconism down to distress superintendent malcolm webberly was hilliers brotherinlaw after all and the victim of an attempted homicide hillier doubtless worried about his recovery from the hitandrun that had nearly killed him so he said hows the superintendents progress sir this isnt the time to talk about the superintendents progress was hilliers reply are you heading this investigation or am i handing it over to one of your colleagues id like to have barbara havers back as sergeant to be part of the team would you well this isnt a bargaining session its a yes ill get to work directly sir or a sorry im going on an extended holiday so lynley had been left with the yes ill get to work directly and no room to manoeuvre for havers he made a quick plan though which involved assigning his colleague to certain aspects of the investigation that would be guaranteed to highlight her strengths certainly within the next few months hed be able to right the wrongs that had been done to barbara since the previous june then of course hed been blindsided by hillier winston nkata arrived newly minted as sergeant blocking havers from promotion in the near future and unaware of what his role was likely to be in the ensuing drama lynley burned at all this but he kept his features neutral he was curious to see how hillier was going to dance round the obvious when he assigned nkata to be his righthand man because there was no doubt in lynleys mind that this was what ac hillier intended to do with one parent from jamaica and the other from the ivory coast nkata was decidedly handsomely and suitably black and once the news broke of a string of racial killings that had not been connected to one another when they damn well should have been the black community was going to ignite not one stephen lawrence but three with no excuse to be had but the most obvious which barbara havers herself had stated in her usual politically unastute manner institutionalised racism that resulted in the police not actively pursuing the killers of young mixedrace boys and blacks just because hillier was carefully oiling the skids in preparation he seated nkata at the conference table and brought him into the picture he made no mention of the race of the first three victims but winston nkata was nobodys fool so you got trouble was his cool observation at the end of hilliers comments hillier replied with studied calm the situation being what it is were trying to avoid trouble whichs where i come in right in a manner of speaking what manner of speaking is that nkata inquired howre you planning to keep this under the carpet not the fact of the killings mind you but the fact of nothing being done bout the killings lynley controlled his need to smile ah winston he thought no ones dancing blueeyed boy investigations have been mounted on all the relevant patches was hilliers reply admittedly connections should have been made between the murders and they werent because of that we at the yard have taken over ive instructed acting superintendent lynley to put together a team i want you playing a prominent role on it you mean a token role nkata said i mean a highly responsible crucial visible nkata cut in yes all right a visible role hilliers generally florid face was becoming quite ruddy it was clear that the meeting wasnt following his preconceived scenario had he asked in advance lynley would have been happy to tell him that having once done a stint as chief battle counsel for the brixton warriors and bearing the scars to show it winston nkata was the last person one ought to fail to take seriously when devising ones political machinations as it was lynley found himself enjoying the spectacle of the assistant commissioner floundering hed clearly expected the black man to snap joyfully at the chance to play a significant role in what was going to become a highprofile investigation since he wasnt doing that hillier was left walking a tightrope between the displeasure of an authority being questioned by such an underling and the political correctness of an ostensibly moderate english white man who at heart truly believed that rivers of blood were imminently due to flow in the streets of london lynley decided to let them go at it alone he got to his feet saying ill leave you to explain all the finer points of the case to sergeant nkata sir therere going to be countless details to organise men to bring off rota and the like id like to get dee harriman on all that straightaway he gathered up the relevant documents and photographs and said to nkata ill be in my office when youre through here winnie sure nkata said soons we got the fine print read lynley left the office and managed to keep himself from chuckling till he was some distance down the corridor havers he knew would have been difficult for hillier to stomach as a detective sergeant once again but nkata was going to be a real challenge proud intelligent clever and quick he was a man first a black man second and a cop only a distant third hillier lynley thought had got every part of him in the wrong order he decided to use the stairs to descend to his office once he crossed to victoria block and that was where he found barbara havers she was sitting on the top step one flight down smoking and picking at a loose thread on the cuff of her jacket lynley said youre out of order doing that here you know that dont you he joined her on the step she studied the glowing tip of the tobacco then returned the cigarette to her mouth she inhaled with showy satisfaction maybe theyll sack me havers did you know she asked abruptly he gave her the courtesy of not pretending to misunderstand of course i didnt know i would have told you got a message to you before you arrived something he took me by surprise as well as he doubtless intended she shrugged what the hell its not as if winnie doesnt deserve it hes good clever works well with everyone hes putting hillier through the paces though at least he was when i left them has he twigged that hes to be window dressing black face at press conferences front and centre no colour problems here and look at this everyone weve got the proof in person hilliers so bloody obvious winstons five or six steps ahead of hillier id say i shouldve stayed to see it you should have done barbara if nothing else it would have been wise she tossed her cigarette to the landing below them it rolled stopped against the wall and sent a lazy plume of smoke upwards when have i ever been that lynley looked her up and down with the ensemble today as a matter of fact except he leaned forward to look towards her feet are you actually holding the trousers together with staples barbara quick easy and temporary im a bird who hates commitment idve used sellotape but dee recommended this i shouldntve bothered one way or the other lynley rose from the step and extended his hand to help her up as well apart from the staples youve done yourself proud right thats me today the yard tomorrow the catwalk havers said they descended to his temporary office dorothea harriman came to the door once he and havers were spreading the case materials out on the conference table she said shll i start phoning them in acting superintendent lynley the secretarial grapevine round here is as ever a model of efficiency lynley noted bring stewart off rota to run the incident room hales in scotland and macphersons involved with that forgeddocuments situation so leave them be and send winston through when he gets down from hillier detective sergeant nkata right harriman was making her usual competent notes on a sticky pad you know about winnie as well havers asked impressed already have you got a snout up there or something dee the cultivation of resources should be the aim of every dutiful police employee harriman said piously cultivate someone across the river then lynley said i want all the forensic material so has on the older cases then phone each police borough where a body was found and get every scrap of every report and every statement they have on these crimes havers in the meantime youll need to get on to the pncgrab at least two dcs from stewart to help youand pull out every missingpersons report filed in the last three months for adolescent boys ages he looked at the photos i think twelve to sixteen should do it he tapped the picture of the most recent victim the boy with makeup smeared across his face and i think well want to check with vice on this one its a route to go with all of them in fact havers picked up on the direction his thoughts were taking if theyre rent boys sirrunaways who happened to fall into the game saythen it may be theres no missingperson report filed for any one of them at least not in the same month they were killed indeed lynley said so well work backwards in time if we have to but weve got to start somewhere so lets keep it at three months for now havers and harriman left to see to their respective assignments lynley sat at the table and felt in his jacket pocket for his reading spectacles he took another look at the photographs spending the most time on those pictures of the final killing they could not he knew accurately portray the understated enormity of the crime itself as hed seen it earlier that day when he had arrived at st georges gardens the scytheshaped area held a full complement of detectives uniformed constables and scenesofcrime officers the forensic pathologist was still on the scene bundled against the greyday cold in a mustard anorak and the police photographer and videographer had just completed their work outside the tall wroughtiron gates of the gardens the public had begun to gather and from the windows of the buildings just beyond the gardens brick wall and the mews behind it more spectators were observing the activity taking place the careful fingertip search for evidence the minute examination of a discarded bicycle that sprawled near a statue of minerva the collection of silver objects that were scattered on the ground round a tomb lynley hadnt known what to expect when he showed his id at the gate and followed the path to the professionals the phone call hed received had used the phrase possible serial killing and because of this as he walked he steeled himself to see something terrible a disembowelment in the manner of jack the ripper perhaps a decapitation or dismemberment hed assumed it would be the horrific that he would be gazing upon when he worked his way to look at the top of the tomb in question what he hadnt assumed was that it would be the sinister yet that was what the body represented to him the sinister left hand of evil ritualistic killings always struck him that way and that this murder had been a ritual was something that he did not doubt the effigylike arrangement of the body served to encourage that deduction but so did the mark in blood on the forehead a crude circle crisscrossed by two lines that each bore cruciforms at the top and the bottom additionally the element of a loincloth added support to this conclusion an odd laceedged piece of fabric which had been tucked as if lovingly round the genitals as lynley donned the latex gloves and stepped to the side of the tomb to gaze more closely upon the body he saw and learned of the rest of the signs that pointed to some sort of arcane rite having been carried out upon it whatve we got he murmured to the forensic pathologist whod been snapping off his gloves and shoving them into his pocket two am or thereabouts was the succinct reply strangulation obviously incised wounds all inflicted after death one cut for the primary incision down the torso with no hesitation thensee the separation here just at the area of the sternum it looks like our knife man dipped his hands inside and forced a bigger opening like a quack surgeon we wont know if anythings missing inside him till we cut him open ourselves looks doubtful though lynley noticed the inflection the pathologist had given to the word inside he glanced quickly at the victims folded hands and his feet all digits accounted for he said as to outside the body is something missing the navel its been chopped right off have a look christ yes opes got a dodgy one on her hands ope turned out to be a greyhaired woman in scarlet earmuffs and matching mittens who came striding towards lynley from a group of uniformed constables whod been in some sort of discussion when hed arrived on the scene she introduced herself as dci opal towers from theobalds road police station in whose patch they were currently standing shed taken just one look at the body and concluded they had a killer who could definitely go serial shed explained shed mistakenly thought that the boy on the tomb was the unfortunate initial victim of someone they could identify quickly and stop before he struck again but then dc hartell over therewith a nod towards a babyfaced detective constable who chewed gum compulsively and watched them with the nervous eyes of someone expecting a dressing downsaid hed seen a killing something like this in tower hamlets when he worked out of the brick lane station a while back i phoned his former guv and we had a few words we think were looking at the same killer in both cases at the time lynley hadnt asked why shed then phoned the met he hadnt known till he met with hillier that there were additional victims he hadnt known that three of the victims were racial minorities and he hadnt known that not a single one of them had yet been identified by the police all that was later spelled out to him by hillier in st georges gardens he merely reached the conclusion that reinforcements were called for and that someone was needed to coordinate an investigation that was going to involve turf in two radically different parts of town brick lane in tower hamlets was the centre of the bangladeshi community containing remnants of the west indian population who had once been its majority while the area of st pancras where st georges gardens formed a green oasis among distinguished georgian conversions was decidedly monochromatic the colour in question being white he said to dci towers how far has brick lane got in their investigation she shook her head and looked towards the wroughtiron gates through which lynley had come he followed her gaze and saw that members of the press and television newsdistinguished by their notebooks their handheld tape recorders and the vans from which video cameras were being unloadedhad begun to gather a press officer was directing them to one side she said according to hartell brick lane did sod all which is why he wanted out of the place he says its an endemic problem now could be he just has an axe hes grinding on the reputation of his exguv over there or could be those blokesve been sleeping at the wheel but in either case weve got some sorting to do she hunched her shoulders and drove her mittened hands into the pockets of her down jacket she nodded at the news people to say theyre going to have a field day if they twig all thatbetween you me and the footpath i thought it best we look like weve got coppers from bottom to top crawling all over this lynley eyed her with some interest she certainly didnt look like a political animal but it was clear that she was quick on her feet nonetheless he felt it wise to ask youre sure about what constable hartell is claiming then wasnt at first she admitted but he convinced me quick enough how he didnt get as close a look at the body as i did but he took me aside and asked about the hands the hands what about the hands she gave him a glance you didnt see them you best come with me superintendent chapter two despite the early hour at which he rose the next morning lynley found that his wife was already up he found her in what was going to be their babys nursery where yellow white and green were the colours of choice a cot and changing table comprised the furniture delivered so far and photographs clipped from magazines and catalogues indicated the placement of everything else a toy chest here a rocking chair there and a chest of drawers moved daily from point a to point b in her first trimester helen was nothing if not changeable when it came to the appearance of their sons nursery she was standing before the changing table her hands massaging the small of her back lynley joined her brushing her hair away from her neck making a bare spot for his kiss she leaned back against him she said you know tommy i never expected impending parenthood to be so political an event is it how she gestured to the surface of the changing table there lynley saw the remains of a package lay it had obviously come by post on the previous day and helen had opened it and spread its contents upon the table these consisted of an infants snowy christening garments gown shawl cap and shoes next to them lay yet another set of christening garments another gown shawl and cap lynley picked up the postal wrapping that had covered the box he saw the name and the return address daphne amalfini he read she lived in italy one of helens four sisters he said whats going on battle lines are being drawn i hate to tell you but im afraid that soon well have to choose a side ah right i take it that these lynley indicated the set of garments most recently unpacked yes daphne sent them along with a rather sweet note by the way but theres no mistaking the meaningful subtext she knows that your sister must have sent us the ancestral lynley baptismal regalia being so far the only reproductive lynley of the current generation but daph seems to think that five clyde sisters procreating like bunnies is reason enough why the clyde apparel should be sufficient unto the christening day no thats not right not sufficient unto the day at all more like de rigueur for the day its all ridiculousbelieve me i knowbut its one of those family situations that ends up being blown out of proportion if one doesnt handle it correctly she looked at him and offered a quirky smile its utterly stupid isnt it hardly comparable to what youre dealing with what time did you actually get home last night did you find your dinner in the fridge i thought id eat it for breakfast actually takeaway garlic chicken well perhaps not any suggestions you care to make about the christening clothes then and dont suggest we forego the christening altogether because i dont want to be responsible for my fathers having a stroke lynley thought about the situation on the one hand the christening garments from his own family had been used for at least fiveif not sixgenerations of infant lynleys as they were ushered into christendom so there was a tradition established in using them on the other hand if the truth were told the clothes were beginning to look as if five or six generations of infant lynleys had worn them on the other other handpresuming three hands were possible in this matterevery child of every one of the five clyde sisters had worn the more recently vintaged clyde family raiment and thus a tradition was being started there and it would be pleasant to uphold it sowhat to do helen was right it was just the sort of idiotic situation that bent everyone out of shape some sort of diplomatic resolution was called for we can claim both sets were lost in the post he offered i had no idea you were such a moral coward your sister already knows hers arrived and in any case im a dreadful liar then i must leave you to work out a solomonlike solution a distinct possibility now that you mention it helen remarked a careful application of the scissors first right up the middle of each then needle thread and everyones happy and a new traditions begun into the bargain they both gazed at the two christening ensembles and then at each other helen looked mischievous lynley laughed we dont dare he said youll work it out in your inimitable fashion two christenings then youre on the path to solution already and what path are you on youre up early our jasper felix awakened me doing gymnastics in my stomach whats your excuse id like to head off hillier if i can the press bureau are setting up a meeting with the media and hillier wants winston there right at his side im not going to be able to talk him out of that but im hoping to get him to keep it low key he maintained that hope all the way to new scotland yard there however he soon enough saw that forces superior even to ac hillier were at work making big plans in the person of stephenson deacon head of the press bureau and intent upon justifying his present job and possibly his entire career he was doing this by means of orchestrating the assistant commissioners first meeting with the press which apparently involved not only the presence of winston nkata at hilliers side but also a dais set up before a curtained background with the union jack draped artfully nearby as well as detailed press kits manufactured to present a dizzying amount of noninformation at the rear of the conference room someone had also arranged a table that looked suspiciously intended for refreshments lynley evaluated all of this bleakly whatever hopes hed had of talking hillier into a subtler approach were thoroughly dashed the directorate of public affairs were involved now and that division of the met reported not to ac hillier but to his superior the deputy comissioner the lower downslynley among themwere obviously being transformed into cogs in the vast machinery of public relations lynley realised that the best he could do was to protect nkata from the exposure as much as possible the new detective sergeant had already been there hed been told where to sit when the press conference took place and what to say should he be asked any questions lynley found him steaming in the corridor the caribbean in his voice child of his west indian mother always came out in moments of stress th became either d or t manpronounced monworked its way forward as interjection of choice i dint get into this to be some dancing monkey nkata said my job int meant to be all about my mum turning on the telly and seeing my mug on the screen he thinks im dim thats what he thinks im here to tell him im not this goes beyond hillier lynley said with a nod of greeting to one of the sound technicians who was ducking into the conference room stay calm and put up with it for the moment winnie itll be to your advantage in the long run depending on what you want to do with your career but you know why im here you bloody know why put it down to deacon lynley said the press bureau are cynical enough to think the public will leap to a preordained conclusion when they see you on the dais elbow to elbow with the assistant commissioner of the met just now deacons arrogant enough to think your appearance there will quiet speculation in the press but none of that is a reflection on you either personally or professionally youve got to remember that in order to get through this yeah well i dont believe it man and if theres speculation out there then its deserved how many more dead ist going to take blackonblack crime is still that crime with next to no one looking into it an if this particlar situation happens to be whiteonblack crime and its gone ignored having me acting like hilliers righthand man when you and he both know he wouldntve even promoted me if the circumstancesd been different here nkata paused drawing breath as he seemed to search for just the right peroration to his remarks murder as politics lynley said yes thats it is that nasty undoubtedly is it cynical yes unpleasant yes machiavellian yes but at the end of the day it doesnt mean you need to beor areanything less than a decent officer hillier came out of the room then he looked pleased with whatever stephenson deacon had set up for the coming press briefing well be buying at least fortyeight hours once weve met with them he said to lynley and nkata winston mind you remember your part lynley waited to see how nkata would react to his credit winston did nothing but nod neutrally but when hillier walked off in the direction of the lifts he said to lynley thesere kids were talking about dead kids man winston lynley said i know whats he doing then i believe hes positioning the press to take a fall nkata looked in the direction hillier had taken hows he going to manage that by waiting long enough for them to expose their bias before he talks to them he knows the papers will get on to the fact that the earlier victims were black and mixed race and when they do theyll start baying for our blood what were we doing asleep at the wheel et cetera et cetera at that point hell counter with piously wondering why its taken them so long to glean what the cops knewand told the pressfrom the first this last death makes page one of every paper it runs near the front of the evening news but what about the others hell ask why werent they considered top stories hilliers taking the offensive then nkata said its why hes good at what he does most of the time nkata looked disgusted four white boys killed in different parts of town and the coppersd be liaising themselves like the bloody dickens from the first they probably would then we cant correct their failures winston we can loathe them and try to change them for the future but we cant go back and make them different we cn keep them from being swept under the rug we could champion that cause yes i agree and as nkata started to say more lynley plunged on with but while we do that a killer goes on killing so what have we gained have we unburied the dead brought anyone to justice believe me winston the press will recover from hilliers allegations about the pot and the kettle shortly after he makes them and when they do theyll be all over him like gnats on fruit in the meantime weve got four killings to deal with properly and we wont be able to do that if we dont have the cooperation of those very same murder squads youre hot to expose as bigoted and corrupt does that make sense to you nkata thought about this he finally said i want a real role in all this i got no plans to be hilliers lad at press conferences man understood and agreed lynley said youre a ds now no ones likely to forget that lets get to work the incident room had been set up a short distance from lynleys office where uniformed pcs were already at the computer terminals logging information that was coming in per lynleys request to the police boroughs where the earlier bodies had been found china boards held crimescene photographs along with a large schedule containing team members names and the identifying numbers of the actions assigned to them technicians had set up three video machines so that someone could review all relevant cctv tapeswhere and if they existedfrom every area where the bodies had been dumped and their flexes and cords snaked along the floor the telephones were already ringing manning them at the moment were lynleys longtime colleague di john stewart and two dcs the former was seated at a desk already compulsively organised barbara havers was in the midst of highlighting data sheets with a yellow marker when lynley and nkata walked in at her elbow sat an opened package of mr kipling strawberry jam tarts and a cup of coffee which she drained with a grimace and a bloody hell cold after which she looked longingly at a packet of players halfburied beneath a pile of printouts dont even think of it lynley told her whatve you got from so she set down her marker pen and worked the muscles of her shoulders youre going to want to keep this one away from the press now thats a fine beginning lynley commented lets have it then going back three months juvenile index and missing persons together coughed up fifteen hundred and seventyfour names damn lynley took the data sheets from her and flipped through them impatiently across the room di stewart rang off and finished his notes you ask me havers said it looks like things havent changed much since the last time so faced the press about not keeping their systems up to date youd think they wouldnt want egg on their neckties again youd think so lynley agreed as a matter of course the names of children reported missing went into the system at once but often when the child was found the name was not then removed from the system nor was it necessarily removed when children who might have started out missing ended up either incarcerated as youth offenders or placed in the care of social services it was a case of the left and right hands not knowing and more than once this sort of inefficiency on the part of missing persons had created a logjam in an investigation im reading the news on your face havers said but no way can i do this alone sir more than fifteen hundred names by the time i get through them all this blokewith a jerk of her head towards the photographs posted on the china boardhell have his next seven victims dispatched well get you some help lynley said to stewart john get some additional manpower for this put half on the phones checking to see if these kids have turned up since they went missing and have the other half go for a match our four bodies to descriptions in the paperwork anything remotely possible that could allow us to tie a name to a corpse run with it and whatve we heard from vice on the most recent body has theobalds road given us anything on the boy in st georges gardens has kings cross what about tolpuddle street di stewart took up a notebook according to vice the description doesnt fit any boy recently on the job anywhere among the regulars no ones missing so far get on to vice where the other bodies were found as well lynley said to havers see if you can make a match with anyone reported missing there he went to the china board where he gazed at the photos of the most recent victim john stewart joined him as usual the di was nervous energy combined with an obsession for detail the notebook he carried was open to an outline which hed done in various colours significant only to himself lynley said to him whatve we got from across the river no reports yet stewart said i checked with dee harriman not ten minutes ago well want them to test the makeup this boys wearing john see if we can track down the manufacturer could be our victim didnt put it on himself if thats the case and if the makeups not something available at every boots in town the point of sale could move us in the right direction in the meantime run a check on recent releases from prison and from mental hospitals recent releases from every youth facility within one hundred miles as well and this works in both directions so keep that in mind both directions stewart looked up from his furious writing our killer could come from one of them but so could our victims and until we have a positive identification on all four of these boys we dont know exactly what were dealing with except the most obvious one sick bastard theres enough evidence on the last body to attest to that lynley agreed his gaze went to that evidence even as he spoke as if drawn there without his intention the long postmortem incision on the torso the blooddrawn symbol on the forehead the missing navel and what hadnt been noted or photographed until the body was moved for the very first time the palms of the hands burned so thoroughly that the flesh was black he shifted his gaze to the list of actions hed already assigned on the previous long night of setting up the team there were men and women knocking on doors in the vicinity where every one of the first three bodies had been found additional officers were studying prior arrests to see if any lesser crimes had been documented that bore the hallmark of escalating behaviour which might lead to such murders as they now had on their hands this was well and good but they also needed to get someone on to the loincloth that had dressed the final body someone to deal with the bicycle and the pieces of silver that had been left at the scene someone to triangulate and analyse all of the crime scenes someone to run down all sex offenders and their alibis and someone to check throughout the rest of the country to see if there were similar unsolved murders elsewhere they knew they had four but there was every possibility that they had fourteen or forty eighteen police detectives and six police constables were working the case at this moment but lynley knew without a doubt they were going to need more there was only one way to get them sir david hillier lynley thought sardonically was going to love and hate that fact simultaneously hed be pleased as punch to announce to the press that thirtyplus officers were working the case but hed hate like the dickens having to authorise the overtime for them all such however was hilliers lot in life such were the disadvantages of ambition by the next afternoon lynley had in hand from so the complete autopsies of the first three victims and the preliminary postmortem information from the most recent killing he combined this with an extra set of photographs from all four of the murder scenes he packed this material into his briefcase went for his car and set out from victoria street in a light mist that was blowing in from the river traffic was stop and start but when he finally got over to millbank he had the river to contemplateor what he could see of it which was mostly the wall built along the pavement and the old iron street lamps that cast a glow against the gloom he veered to the right when he came to cheyne walk where he found a place to park that was being vacated by someone leaving the kings head and eight bells at the bottom of cheyne row it was a short distance from there to the house at the corner of this street and lordship place less than five minutes found him ringing the bell he anticipated the barking of one very protective longhaired dachshund but that didnt happen instead the door was opened by a tallish redhaired woman with a pair of scissors in one hand and a roll of yellow ribbon in the other her face brightened when she saw him tommy deborah st james said perfect timing i need help and here you are lynley entered the house shedding his overcoat and setting his briefcase by the umbrella stand what sort of help wheres simon ive already roped him into something else and one can only ask husbands for so much assistance before they run off with the local floozy from the pub lynley smiled what am i to do come with me she led him to the dining room where an old bronze chandelier was lit over a table spread with wrapping materials a large package there was already brightly wrapped and deborah seemed to have been caught in the midst of designing a complicated bow for it this lynley said is not going to be my métier oh the plans are laid deborah told him youre only going to need to hand over the sellotape and press where indicated it shouldnt defeat you ive started with the yellow but theres green and white to add those are the colours helens chosen lynley stopped is this for her for us by any chance how vulgar tommy deborah said i never saw you as someone whod hint round for a present here take this ribbon im going to need three lengths of forty inches each hows work by the way is that why youve come i expect youre wanting simon peach will do where is she walkies deborah said rather reluctant walkies because of the weather dads taken her but i expect theyre battling it out somewhere to see whos going to walk and whos going to get carried you didnt see them not a sign peach has probably won then i expect theyve gone into the pub lynley watched as deborah coiled the lengths of ribbon together she was concentrating on her design which gave him a chance to concentrate on her his onetime lover the woman whod been meant to be his wife shed found herself facetoface with a killer recently and she still hadnt healed completely from the stitches that had patched up her face a scar from the sutures ran along her jaw and typical of deborahwhod always been a woman almost completely devoid of ordinary vanityshe was doing nothing to hide it she looked up and caught him observing her what she said i love you he told her frankly differently from before but there it is her features softened and i love you tommy weve crossed over havent we new territory but still somehow familiar thats exactly how it is they heard footsteps then coming along the corridor and the uneven nature of them identified deborahs husband he came to the door of the dining room with a stack of large photographs in his hands he said tommy hullo i didnt hear you come in no peach deborah and lynley said together then laughed companionably i knew that dog was good for something simon st james came to the table and laid the photographs down it wasnt an easy choice he told his wife st james was referring to the photographs which as far as lynley could see were all of the same subject a windmill in a landscape comprising field trees background hillsides and foreground cottage tumbling to ruins he said may i and when deborah nodded he looked at the pictures more closely the exposure he saw was slightly different in each but what was remarkable about them all was the manner in which the photographer had managed to catch all the variations of light and dark while at the same time not losing the definition of a single subject ive gone for the one where youve enhanced the moonlight on the windmills sails st james told his wife i thought that was the best one as well thank you love always my best critic she completed her task with the bow and had lynley assist with the sellotape when she was done she stood back to admire her work after which she took a sealed envelope from the sideboard and slipped it into place on the package she handed it over to lynley with our fondest wishes tommy she said truly and completely lynley knew the journey deborah had traveled in order to be able to say those words having a child of her own was something denied her thank you he found that his voice was rougher than usual both of you there was a moment of silence among them which st james broke by saying lightly a drink is in order i think deborah said she would join them as soon as shed sorted out the mess shed made in the dining room st james led lynley from there to his study just along the corridor and overlooking the street lynley fetched his briefcase from the entry then leaving the wrapped package in its place when he joined his old friend st james was at the drinks cart beneath the window a decanter in his hand sherry he said whisky have you gone through all the lagavullin yet too hard to come by im pacing myself ill assist you st james poured them both a whisky and added a sherry for deborah which he left on the cart he joined lynley by the fireplace and eased himself into one of the two old leather chairs to one side of it something of an awkward business for him owing to the brace hed worn for years on his left leg he said i picked up an evening standard this afternoon it looks like a messy business tommy if my reading between the lines is any good so you know why ive come whos working on the case with you the usual suspects im after clearance to add to the team hillier will give it reluctantly but what choice has he were going to need fifty officers but well be lucky to end up with thirty will you help you expect hillier to give clearance for me ive a feeling hell greet you with open arms we need your expertise simon and the press bureau will be only too happy to have hillier announcing to the media the inclusion of independent forensic scientist simon allcourtst james formerly of the metropolitan police now an expert witness university lecturer public speaker et cetera just the sort of thing to restore public confidence but dont let that pressure you what would you have me do my crimescene days are far and away gone and god willing you wont have further crime scenes anyway youd consult i wont lie to you and say it wouldnt impinge on everything else you have on your plate but id try to keep the requests to a minimum let me see what you have then youve brought copies of everything lynley opened his briefcase and handed over what hed gathered before leaving scotland yard st james set the paperwork to one side and went through the photographs he whistled silently when he looked up at last he said to lynley they didnt jump to serial killing at once so you see the problem but these have all the hallmarks of a ritual the burnt hands alone just on the final three still with the similarities all along in the positioning of the bodies theyre as good as advertising themselves as serial killings for the latest onethe body in st georges gardensthe dci on scene marked it as a serial killing at once as to the others each body was left on the patch of a different station in every case they appear to have gone through the motions of an investigation but it seems it was easy to call each of them a oneoff crime gang related because of the race of the victims gang related because of the condition of the bodies marked in some way with the signature of a gang as a warning to others thats nonsense im not excusing it its a pr nightmare for the met i daresay yes will you help can you fetch my glass from the desk its in the top drawer lynley did so a chamois pouch held the magnifying glass and he brought this to his friend and watched while st james studied the photographs of the corpses more closely he spent the most time over the recent crime and he gazed long upon the face of the victim before he spoke even then it seemed he spoke more to himself than to lynley the abdominal incision on the final body is obviously postmortem he said but the burning of the hands before death lynley agreed that makes it very interesting doesnt it st james looked up for a moment thoughtfully his gaze on the window before he examined victim four another time hes not particularly good with the knife no indecision about where to cut but surprised to discover it wasnt easy not a medical student or a doctor then i shouldnt think so what sort of implement a very sharp knife will have worked just fine a kitchen knife perhaps that and a certain amount of strength because of all the abdominal muscles involved and to create this aperturethat cant have been easy hes quite strong hes taken the navel simon on the final body gruesome st james acknowledged one would think hes made the incision just to get enough blood to make the mark on the forehead but taking the navel discounts that theory doesnt it what dyou make of the forehead mark by the way a symbol obviously the killers signature in part id say so but more than that if the entire crime is part of a ritual and it looks like that doesnt it then id say this is the final part of the ceremony a full stop after the victim dies its saying something then definitely but to whom to the police whove failed to grasp that a serial killers at work in the community to the victim whos just completed a real trial by fire to someone else thats the question isnt it st james nodded he laid the pictures to one side and took up his whisky then thats where ill begin he said chapter three when she turned off the ignition that evening barbara havers remained inside the mini once again listening disconsolately to its sputtering engine she rested her head on the steering wheel she was knackered odd to think that spending hours upon hours on computers and telephones was more exhausting than hoofing round london to track down witnesses suspects reports and background information but that was the case there was something about staring at a computer terminal reading and highlighting printouts and running through the same monologue on the phone with one desperate set of parents after another that made her long for baked beans on toastbring on a tin of heinz that ultimate comfort foodfollowed by a horizontal position on the daybed with the television remote tucked in her hand simply put she hadnt had an easy time for one moment during the first two endless days first there was the subject of winston nkata detective sergeant winston nkata it was one thing to know why hillier had promoted her colleague at this particular point in time it was quite another to realise that victim of political machination or not winston actually did deserve the rank what made it all worse was having to work with him in spite of this knowledge realising that he was just as uneasy with the whole situation as she was had winston been smug she would have known how to cope had he been arrogant she would have had a bloody good time taking the piss had he been ostentatiously humble she could have dealt with that in a satisfyingly biting fashion but he was none of that just a quieter version of regular winston a version that affirmed what lynley had indicated winnie was nobodys fool he knew perfectly well what hillier and the dpa were trying to do so ultimately barbara felt sympathy for her colleague and that sympathy had inspired her to fetch him a cup of tea when she fetched one for herself saying well done on the promotion winnie as she placed it next to him along with the constables assigned by di stewart barbara had spent two days and two evenings coping with the overwhelming number of missingpersons reports that she had pulled from so ultimately nkata had joined the project they had managed to cross off the list a good number of names in that time kids who had returned to their homes or had contacted their families in some way making their whereabouts known a few of themas expectedhad turned up incarcerated others had been tracked down in care but there were hundreds upon hundreds unaccounted for which took the detectives to the job of comparing descriptions of missing adolescents with descriptions of the unidentified corpses part of this could be done by computer part of it had to be done by hand they had the photographs and the autopsy reports from the first three victims to work from and both parents and guardians of the missing kids were almost universally cooperative eventually they even had one possible identity established but the likelihood was remote that the missing boy in question was truly one of the bodies they had thirteen years old mixed race black and filipino shaved head nose flattened on the end and broken at the bridge he was called jared salvatore and hed been gone nearly two months reported missing by his older brother whoso it was noted in the paperworkhad made the call to the cops from pentonville prison where he himself was banged up for armed robbery how the older brother had come to know young jared was missing was not documented in the report but that was it sorting out identities for each corpse from the vast number of missing kids they had was thus going to be like picking fly poo out of pepper if they couldnt come up with some kind of connection between the murder victims and considering how widespread the body sites were a connection seemed unlikely when shed had enoughor at least as much as she could handle for the daybarbara had said to nkata im out of here winnie you staying or what nkata had pushed back his chair rubbed his neck and said ill stay for a while she nodded but didnt leave at once it seemed to her that they both needed to say something although she wasnt sure what nkata was the one who took the plunge what dwe do with all this barb he set his biro on a legal pad question is how do we be we cant xactly ignore the situation barbara sat back down there was a magnetic paperclip holder on the desk and she picked this up and played with it i think we just do what needs doing i expect the rest will sort itself out he nodded thoughtfully i dont sit easy with this i know why im here i want you to unnerstan that got it barbara said but dont be rough on yourself you deserve hillier wouldnt know sod all bout what i deserve nkata cut in not to mention dpa not before this not now and not later barbara was silent she couldnt dispute what they both knew to be the truth she finally said you know winnie were sort of in the same position how dyou mean woman cop black cop not that its more about vision hillier doesnt really see either one of us fact is you can apply that to everyone on this team he doesnt see any of us just how we can either help him or hurt him nkata considered this i spose youre right so none of what he says and does matters because we have the same job at the end of the day question is are we up for that cause it means letting go of how much we loathe him and just getting on with what we do best im on for that nkata said but barb you still deserve hey she interrupted so do you now she yawned widely and shoved her shoulder against the recalcitrant door of the mini shed found a parking space along steeles road round the corner from eton villas she plodded back to the yellow house hunched into a cold wind that had come up in the late afternoon and went along the path to her bungalow inside she flipped on the lights tossed her shoulder bag on the table and dug the desired tin of heinz from a cupboard she dumped its contents unceremoniously into a pan under other circumstances shed have eaten the beans cold but tonight she decided she deserved the full treatment she popped bread into the toaster and from the fridge took a stella artois it wasnt her night to drink but shed had a tough day as her meal was preparing itself she went for the television remote which as usual she couldnt find she was searching the wrinkled linens of the unmade daybed when someone rapped at her door she glanced over her shoulder and saw through the open blinds on the window two shadowy forms on her front step one quite small the other taller both of them slender hadiyyah and her father had come calling barbara gave up her search for the remote and opened the door to her neighbours she said just in time for a barbara special ive two pieces of toast but if you behave yourselves we can divide them three ways she held the door wider to admit them giving a glance over her shoulder to check that shed tossed her dirty knickers in the laundry basket sometime during the last fortyeight hours taymullah azhar smiled with his usual grave courtesy he said we cannot stay barbara this will only take a moment if you do not mind he sounded so sombre that barbara glanced warily from him to his daughter hadiyyah was hanging her head her hands clasped behind her back a few wisps of hair escaped from her plaits brushing against her cheeks and her cheeks themselves were flushed she looked as if shed been crying whats wrong is something barbara felt dread from a dozen different sources none of which she particularly cared to name whats going on azhar azhar said hadiyyah his daughter looked up at him imploringly his face was implacable we have come for a reason you know what it is hadiyyah gulped so loudly that barbara could hear it she brought her hands from round her back and extended them to barbara in them she held the buddy holly cd she said dad says im to give this back to you barbara barbara took it from her she looked at azhar she said butsorry but is it not allowed or something that seemed unlikely she knew a little about their customs and gift giving was one of them and azhar said to his daughter without answering barbaras question there is more is there not hadiyyah lowered her head again barbara could see that her lips were trembling her father said hadiyyah i shall not ask you i fibbed the little girl blurted out i fibbed to my dad and he found out and im meant to give this back to you in conseeconconsequence she raised her head shed begun to cry but thank you because i thought it was lovely i liked peggy sue especially then she spun on her heel and fled back towards the front of the house barbara heard her sob she looked to her neighbour she said listen azhar this is actually my fault i had no idea hadiyyah wasnt supposed to go to camden high street and she didnt know where we were going when we set off it was something of a joke anyway she was listening to some pop group and i was giving her aggro about them and she was saying how great they are and i decided to show her some real rock n rock and i took her down to the virgin megastore but i didnt know it was forbidden and she didnt know where we were going barbara was out of breath she felt like an adolescent getting caught for being out after curfew she didnt much like it she calmed herself and said if id known youd forbidden her to go to camden high street i never would have taken her there im dead sorry azhar she didnt mention it straightaway which is the source of my irritation with hadiyyah azhar said she should have done so but like i said she didnt know where we were going till we got there once you arrived was she wearing a blindfold of course not but then it was too late i didnt exactly give her a chance to say something hadiyyah should not need an invitation to be truthful okay agreed it happened and it wont happen again at least let her keep the cd azhar glanced away his dark fingersso slender they looked like a girlsmoved beneath his trim jacket to the pocket of his pristine white shirt he felt there and brought forth a packet of cigarettes he shook one out appeared to think about what to do next and then offered the packet to barbara she took this as a positive sign their fingers brushed as she took a cigarette from him and he lit a match that he shared with her she wants you to stop smoking barbara told him she wants many things as do we all youre angry come in lets talk about this he remained where he was azhar listen i know what youre worried about camden high street and all that but you cant protect her from everything its impossible he shook his head i dont seek to protect her from everything i merely seek to do whats right but i find that i dont always know what that is being exposed to camden high street isnt going to pollute her and buddy hollyhere barbara gestured with the cdisnt going to pollute her either its not camden high street or buddy holly that comprises my concern azhar said it is the lie barbara okay i can see that but it was only a lie of omission she just didnt tell me when she could have told me or should have told me or whatever that is not it at all what is it then she lied to me barbara to you about and this is something i will not accept but when when did she lie to you when i asked her about the cd she said you had given it to her azhar that was true but she failed to include the information about where it had come from that in itself slipped out when she was chatting about cds in general about how many there were to choose from at the virgin megastore bloody hell azhar thats not a lie is it no but the outright denial of having been in the virgin megastore is and this is something that i will not accept hadiyyah is not to start that with me she will not begin lying she will not not to me his voice was so controlled and his features so rigid that barbara realised far more was being discussed than his daughters initial venture into prevarication she said okay i get it but she feels wretched whatever your point is i think you made it i hope so she must learn that there are consequences to the decisions she makes and she must learn this as a child i dont disagree but barbara drew in on her cigarette before she dropped it to the front step and ground it out it seems like making her admit her wrongdoing to mesort of like in publicis punishment enough i think you should let her keep the cd ive decided the consequences you can bend though cant you too far he said and you break on the wheel of your own inconsistencies what happens then barbara asked him when he didnt reply she went on quietly with hadiyyah and lyingthis isnt really what its all about is it azhar he replied i will not have her start and he stepped back preparatory to leaving he added politely i have kept you from your toast long enough before he returned to the front of the property no matter his conversation with barbara havers and her reassurance on the subject winston nkata didnt rest easily beneath the mantle of detective sergeant hed thought he wouldthat was the hell of itbut it wasnt happening and the comfort he wanted in his employment hadnt materialised for most of his career he hadnt started out in police work feeling uneasy about his job but it hadnt been long before the reality of being a black cop in a world dominated by white men had begun to sink in hed noticed it first in the canteen in the way that glances sidled over to him and then slid onto someone else then he felt it in the conversations how they became ever so slightly more guarded when he joined his colleagues after that it was in the manner that he was greeted with just a shade more welcome than was given the white cops when he sat with a group at table he hated that deliberate effort people made to appear tolerant when he was near the very act of diligently treating him like one of the lads made him feel like the last thing hed ever become was one of the lads at first hed told himself he didnt want that anyway it was rough enough round loughborough estate hearing himself called a fucking coconut it would be that much worse if he actually ended up becoming part of the white establishment still he hated being marked as phony by his own people while he kept in mind his mothers admonition that it doesnt make you a chair f some ignoramus calls you a chair he found it increasingly difficult just to keep himself moving in the direction he wanted to go on the estate that meant to and from his parents flat and nowhere else otherwise it meant upward in his career jewel luv his mother had said when he phoned her with the news of his promotion doesnt matter one bit why they promoted you what matters is they did and now the openings there you walk through it and you dont look back but he couldnt do that instead he continued to feel weighed down by ac hilliers sudden notice of him when before hed been nothing more to the man than a passing face to which the assistant commissioner could not have put a name if his continued existence had depended upon it yet there was still so much truth to what his mother had said just walk through the opening he had to learn how to do it and the entire subject of openings applied to more than one area of his life which was what he was left thinking about once barb havers departed for the day he took a final look at the pictures of the dead boys before he too left the yard he did it to remind himself that they were youngterribly youngand as a consequence of their racial background he had obligations that went beyond merely bringing their killer to justice below in the underground carpark he sat for a moment in his escort and thought about those obligations and what they called for action in the face of fear he wanted to slap himself stupid for even having that fear he was twentynine years old for gods sake he was an officer of the police that alone should have counted for something and it would have done in other instances but it counted for nothing in this situation when being a cop was the single profession in life least designed to impress yetit couldnt be helped that he was a cop he was also a man and a mans presence was called for nkata finally set off with a deep breath he followed a route across the river to south london but instead of heading home he took a detour round the curved brick shell of the oval and drove down kennington road in the direction of kennington station the tube itself marked his destination and he found a place to park nearby he bought an evening standard from a vendor on the pavement using the activity to build up his courage for walking the length of braganza street at its bottom arnold housepart of doddington grove estaterose out of a lumpy carpark across from this building a horticultural centre grew behind a chainlink fence and it was against this fence that nkata chose to lean with his newspaper folded beneath his arm and his gaze on the thirdfloor covered walk that led to the fifth flat from the left it wouldnt take much effort to cross over the street and weave his way through the carpark once there he was fairly certain the lift would be available since more often than not the security panel giving access to it was broken how much trouble would it be then to cross to weave to punch the button and then to make his way to that flat he had a reason to do so there were boys being murdered across londonmixedrace boysand inside that flat lived daniel edwards whose white father was dead but whose black mother was very much alive but then that was the problem wasnt it she was the problem yasmin edwards exconvict jewel his mother would have said had he ever had the nerve to tell her about yasmin whatn gods name you thinking but that was easy enough to answer thinking of her skin mum and how it looks when a lamp shines against it thinking of her legs which ought to be wrapped round a man who wants her thinking of her mouth and the curve of her bum and the way her breasts rise and fall when shes angry tall she is mum tall to my tall good woman who made one very big mistake which shed paid for like she ought and anyway yasmin edwards wasnt really the point nor was she the target of duty that was daniel who at nearly twelve could well be in the sights of a killer because who knew how their killer was choosing his victims no one and until they did know how could hewinston nkatawalk away from giving a warning where it might be needed all that was required of him was to walk across the street dodge a few cars in the wretched carpark depend upon the security panel being broken ring the bell for the lift and knock on that door he was fully capable of doing that and he was going to later he swore that to himself but just as he was about to lift his foot in step number one of however many it was going to take to get to yasmin edwards front door the woman herself came along the pavement she wasnt walking from the underground station as nkata himself had done rather she was coming from the opposite direction from beyond the gardens at the bottom of braganza street where from her little shop in manor place she offered hope in the form of makeup wigs and makeovers to black women suffering from disorders of the body and the soul in reaction to seeing her nkata found himself fading back against the chainlink fence and into a pool of shadow he hated himself the moment he did it but he just couldnt move forward as he ought to have done for her part yasmin edwards walked steadily towards doddington grove estate she didnt see him in the shadows and that alone was reason to talk to her goodlooking woman on the street alone in this neighbourhood after dark need to be cautious yas need to be on the lookout someone jump youhurt yourape yourob you whats daniel going to do if his mum goes the way of his dad and dies on him but nkata couldnt say that not with yasmin edwards herself being the reason why daniels father was dead so he stayed in the shadows and he watched her even as he felt the terrible shame of his breath going faster and his heart beating harder than it ought yasmin moved forward along the pavement he saw that her plaits with their beaded ends were gone now her hair close cropped and no longer making the soft chorus that he would otherwise have heard from where he stood she shifted the carrier bags she held from one hand to the other and she felt in the pocket of her jacket he knew that she was seeking her keys end of the day a meal to be got for her boy life going on she reached the carpark and crisscrossed through the illdefined bays at the lift she punched the security code that would give her access and then she punched the button to call it she quickly disappeared within she came out again on the third floor and strode towards her door when she put her key in its lock it opened before she had a chance to unlock it and there was daniel backlit by a shifting glow that would be coming from the television set he took the carrier bags from his mother but as he was about to move off she stopped him hands on hips she stood head cocked weight on one of her long lithe legs she said something and daniel came back to her he set the bags down and submitted to a hug just at the point when it looked like the hug was being only endured and not enjoyed his own arms went round his mothers waist then yasmin kissed the top of his head after that daniel took the carrier bags inside and yasmin followed him she shut the door a moment later she appeared at the window which nkata knew looked out from the sitting room she reached for the curtains to shut them against the night but before she did that she stood for twenty seconds or so gazing into the darkness her expression set he was still in the shadows but he could sense it he could feel it she hadnt looked his way once but nkata could swear that yasmin edwards had known all along that he was there chapter four a day later stephenson deacon and the directorate of public affairs decided the time had ripened enough for the first press briefing assistant commissioner hillier given the word from above instructed lynley to be there for the big event with our new detective sergeant in tow lynley wanted to be there as little as nkata but he knew the wisdom of at least appearing to cooperate he and the ds descended via the stairs to arrive promptly at the conference they encountered hillier in the corridor ready the ac spoke to lynley and nkata as he paused to examine his impressive head of grey hair in the glass cover of a notice board unlike the other two men he looked pleased to be there and he seemed to be restraining himself from rubbing his hands in anticipation of the coming confrontation clearly he expected the briefing to click along like the welloiled machine it was designed to be he didnt wait for a response to his question instead he ducked into the room they followed the print and broadcasting journalists had been relegated to the rows of seats fanning out before the dais the television cameras were set to shoot over their heads this would illustrate later for the publicvia the nightly newsthat the met was making all possible efforts to keep the citizenry in the picture through an ostensibly open and welcoming venue for their human conduits of information stephenson deacon the head of the press bureau had himself chosen to make the prefatory remarks at this first briefing his appearance not only signaled the importance of what was about to be announced but it also telegraphed to the general public the appropriate level of police concern only the presence of the head of the dpa could have made a more impressive statement the newspapers had of course jumped upon the story of a body found on the top of a tomb in st georges gardens as anyone with a brain at new scotland yard had known they would the reticence of the police at the crime scene the arrival there of an officer from new scotland yard long before the removal of the body the lapse of time between the bodys discovery and this press conferenceall of it had whetted the appetite of the journalists and spoke of a much bigger story to come when deacon turned the meeting over to him hillier played on this he began with the larger purpose of the press conference which was he declared to make our young people aware of the dangers they face in the streets he went on to sketch out the crime under investigation and just at the point at which anyone might have logically wondered why a briefing was being held to inform the media of a killing theyd already featured at the top of the news and on the first pages of their papers he said at this juncture were looking for witnesses to what appears to be a series of potentially related crimes against young men it took less than five seconds for the word series to lead ineluctably to serial at which point the reporters jumped aboard like commuters leaping on the nights final train their questions erupted like pheasants from beaten bushes lynley could see the pleasure in hilliers features as the reporters asked just the sort of questions that he and the press bureau had hoped they would ask leaving unspoken the very topics that he and the press bureau had wished to avoid hillier held up a hand with an expression that communicated both his understanding and his tolerance of their outburst he then went on to say precisely what he had planned to say regardless of their questions the individual crimes he explained had initially been investigated by the murder squads most closely associated with the locations in which the bodies had been found doubtless their brother and sister journalists who were responsible for gathering the news at each of these relevant stations would be happy to supply the notes they themselves had already assembled on the killings which would save everyone valuable time just now for its part the met was going to press forward with a thorough investigation of this most recent murder tying it to the others if there was a clear indication that the crimes were related in the meantime the mets immediate concernas hed already mentionedwas the safety of the young people who populated the streets and it was crucial that the message get out to them at once adolescent boys appeared to be the target of one or more killers they needed to be aware of that and take appropriate precautions when away from home hillier then introduced the two leading officers in the investigation acting detective superintendent thomas lynley would be heading it and coordinating all previous investigations done by the local stations he said he would be assisted by detective sergeant winston nkata no mention was made of di john stewart or anyone else there followed more questions these about the composition size and strength of the squad which lynley answered after that hillier deftly resumed control he said as if it had just crossed his mind while were on the subject of the constitution of the squad and he went on to tell the journalists that hed personally brought aboard forensic specialist simon allcourtst james and to enhance his work and the work of the officers from the met a forensic psychologistotherwise more commonly known as a profilerwould be contributing his services as well for professional reasons the profiler preferred to remain in the background but suffice it to say that he had trained in the us at quantico virginia home of the federal bureau of investigations profiling unit hillier then drew the meeting to a practised close telling the journalists that the press bureau would be offering them daily briefings he switched off his mike and led lynley and nkata out of the room leaving the reporters with deacon who signaled a minion to pass out the sheaves of additional information that had previously been determined suitable for media consumption in the corridor hillier gave a satisfied smile time bought he said see that you use it well his attention then went to a man who was waiting nearby in the company of hilliers secretary a visitors badge pinned to his baggy green cardigan hillier said to him ah excellent youve arrived already and he set about making the introductions this was hamish robson he told lynley and nkata the clinical and forensic psychologist hed just been speaking about to the journalists otherwise employed at the fischer psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane in dagenham dr robson had kindly agreed to be of assistance by joining lynleys murder squad lynley felt his spine stiffen he realised hed been blindsided yet again having erroneously assumed during the press conference that hillier had been lying through his teeth about an unnamed forensic psychologist he went through the motions of shaking dr robsons hand however while he said to hillier if we could have a word sir in as agreeable a voice as he could manage hillier made much of glancing at his watch he made even more of telling lynley that the deputy commissioner was waiting for a report on the conference theyd only just concluded lynley said this will take less than five minutes and i consider it essential adding the word sir as a deliberate afterthought whose tone and meaning hillier could not avoid comprehending very well hillier said hamish if youll excuse us ds nkata will show you where the incident room ill need winston for the moment lynley said not because this was strictly the truth but because somewhere along the line he knew he was going to have to drive home to hillier the point that the assistant commissioner of police was not running the investigation there was a tight little silence during which hillier appeared to be evaluating lynley for his level of insubordination he finally said hamish if youll wait here for a moment and he ushered lynley and nkata not to an office not to the stairs not to the lift to take them above to his own quarters but into the mens toilet where he told a uniformed constable in the act of emptying his bladder to vacate the premises and stand before the door allowing no one to enter before lynley could speak hillier said pleasantly dont do that again please if you do youll find yourself back in uniform so fast that youll wonder who zipped your trousers seeing what the temperature of this conversation was likely to become despite hilliers momentarily affable tone lynley said to nkata winston would you leave us please sir david and i need to have some words id prefer you not hear go back to the incident room and see where havers has got to with missing persons particularly with the one that looks like a possibility nkata nodded he didnt ask if he was meant to take hamish robson with him as previously ordered by hillier instead he looked glad of the command that gave him the opportunity to demonstrate where his loyalties lay when he was gone hillier was the one to speak youre out of order with due respect lynley returned although he felt little enough of it i believe you are how dare you sir ill bring you up to the minute daily lynley said patiently ill face the television cameras if you like and sit at your side and force ds nkata to do the same but im not going to hand over the direction of this investigation to you you need to stay out of it thats the only way this is going to work do you want to be up for review believe me that can be arranged if you need to do it youll have to do it lynley replied but sir youve got to see that at the end of the day there has to be only one of us heading this inquiry if you want to be that person then be him and have done with pretending im in charge but if you want me to be that person youre going to have to back off youve blindsided me twice now and i dont want a third surprise hilliers face went the red of sunset but he said nothing as he evidently registered the lengths lynley had gone to to remain calm as he simultaneously evaluated the ramifications of lynleys words he finally said i want daily briefings youve been getting them youll continue to get them and the profiler stays sir we dont need psychic mumbo jumbo at this point we need all the help we can get hilliers voice grew loud the papers are twentyfour hours away from starting the hue and cry you damn well know that i do but we also both know thats going to happen eventually now that the other murders have been mentioned are you accusing me no no you said what had to be said in there but once they start digging theyll go after us and theres plenty of truth in what theyre going to allege about the met where the hell are your loyalties hillier demanded those buggers are going to go back and look up the other murders and then theyll put it down to usnot to themselvesthat not one of them ever made the front page at which point theyll wave the racism flag and when they do the whole communitys going to blow like it or not we have to stay one step ahead of them the profilers one way to do it and that as you might say is that lynley considered this he hated the idea of having a profiler onboard but he had to admit that his presence did serve the purpose of buoying up the investigation in the eyes of the journalists who were covering it and while he ordinarily had no use for either newspapers or televisionseeing the collection and dissemination of information as something that was yearly becoming more opprobrioushe could understand the necessity of keeping their focus on the progress of the current investigation if they started to rave about the mets failure to see the relationships among three prior killings they would put the police in the position of having to waste time attempting to excuse the lapse this served no one and nothing but the coffers of the newspapers who might be able to increase their sales by fanning the flames of a public indignation that always lay like a dragon in repose all right lynley said the profiler stays but i determine what he sees and what he doesnt agreed hillier said they returned to the corridor where hamish robson waited for them unaccompanied the profiler had taken himself down to a notice board some distance from the toilets lynley had to admire the man for that he said dr robson to which robson replied hamish please hillier said the superintendent will take you in hand at this point hamish good luck were relying on you robson glanced from hillier to lynley behind his goldrimmed spectacles his eyes looked wary the rest of his expression was muted by his greying goatee and as he nodded a lock of thinning hair flopped onto his forehead he brushed it off the glint of a gold signet ring caught the light im happy to do what i can he said ill need the police reports the crimescene photos the superintendent will give you what you need hillier said and to lynley keep me up to speed he nodded to robson and strode off in the direction of the lifts as robson observed hillier walking off lynley observed robson and decided he looked harmless enough there was indeed something vaguely comforting about his dark green cardigan and his pale yellow shirt he wore a conservative solidbrown tie with this the same colour as his trousers which were worn and lived in he was podgy of body and looked like everyones favourite uncle you work with the criminally insane lynley said as he led the other man to the stairwell i work with minds whose only outlet for torment is the commission of a crime isnt the one the same as the other lynley asked robson smiled sadly if that were only the case lynley briefly introduced robson to the team before he took him from the incident room to his office there he gave the psychologist copies of the crimescene photographs the police reports and the preliminary postmortem information from the forensic pathologists whod examined the bodies at the scene of each crime he held back the autopsy reports robson took a cursory look through the material then explained that it would take him at least twentyfour hours to evaluate it that was no problem lynley told him there was plenty for the team to do while they were waiting for hislynley wanted to say performance as if the man were a psychic come to bend spoons in their presence he settled on information instead report gave robson too much legitimacy the investigators seemed robson appeared to look for a word rather wary to have me among them theyre used to the oldfashioned way of doing things lynley told him i believe theyll find what i have to say useful superintendent im glad to hear that lynley said and he called dee harriman to see dr robson on his way when the profiler had departed lynley returned to the incident room and the work at hand what did they have he wanted to know di stewart was as ever ready with his report which he stood to present like a schoolboy hoping for high marks from the teacher he announced hed subdivided his officers into teams the better to deploy them in different areas at this a few eyes rolled heavenward in the incident room stewart did most things like a frustrated wellington they were inching forward engaging in the tedious plodwork of a complicated investigation stewart had two officers from team onetheyll be doing background he reportedcovering the mental hospitals and the prisons they had unearthed a number of potential leads that they were following up paedophiles having finished their time in open conditions within the last six months paroled murderers of adolescents gang members in remand awaiting trial and from youth offenders lynley asked stewart shook his head sod all appeared useful from that end of things all the youth offenders recently released were accounted for what are we getting from the doortodoors at the body sites lynley asked little enough stewart had constables reinterviewing everyone in those areas seeking witnesses to anything at all they knew the drill it wasnt so much the unusual that they were looking for but the ordinary that upon reflection made one stop and think since serial killers by their very nature faded into the woodwork the woodwork itself had to be examined inch by tedious inch hed directed enquiries to hauling companies as well stewart explained and hed so far come up with fiftyseven lorry drivers who would have been on gunnersbury road on the night when the first victim had been left in gunnersbury park a dc was in the process of contacting them to see if she could jumpstart their memories about any kind of vehicle that might have been parked alongside the brick wall of the park on the road into london in the meantime another dc was in touch with every taxi and minicab service looking for much the same result as to the doortodoor a line of houses stood directly across the road from the park albeit separated from it by four lanes of traffic and a central reservation there were hopes of getting something from one of them one never knew who might have been suffering insomnia and gazing out of the window on the night in question the same went for quaker street by the way where a block of flats stood opposite the abandoned warehouse in which the third body had been found on the other hand the multistory carpark locationsite of the second bodywas going to be more difficult the only person who might have seen anything inside it was the attendant on duty that night but he swore hed seen nothing between one in the morning and sixtwenty when the body was discovered by a nurse heading to an early shift at chelsea and westminster hospital that didnt of course mean he hadnt slept right through the entire circumstance the carpark in question had no central kiosk at which an attendant sat day and night but rather an office tucked away deep in the interior of the structure and furnished with a reclining chair and a television set to make the long hours of the night shift seem moderately less so and st georges gardens lynley asked that was somewhat more hopeful stewart reported according to theobalds roads dc whod canvassed the vicinity a woman living on the third floor of the building at the junction of henrietta mews and handel street heard what she thought was the sound of the gardens gate being opened sometime round three in the morning shed thought it was the park warden at first but upon reflection shed realised it was far too early for him to be unlocking the gates by the time she got herself out of bed swathed in her dressing gown and in place at her window she was just in time to see a van driving off it passed beneath a streetlamp as she watched it was largeish as she described it she thought the colour of the van was red thats taken it down to a few hundred thousand vans across the city however stewart added regretfully he flipped his notebook closed his report complete we need to get someone on to swansea pulling vehicle records anyway barbara havers said to lynley that constable is a complete nonstarter and you ought to know it stewart informed her havers bristled and began to respond lynley cut her off john he said the dis name in a minatory tone stewart subsided but he didnt look happy to have haverslowly dc that she wasoffering her opinion stewart said fine ill see to it ill put someone on to the old bat in handel street as well we may be able to jog something else from her memory about what she saw from that window what about the piece of lace on body four lynley asked nkata was the one to reply looks like tatting you ask me what tatting thats what its called my mum does it knotting up string along the edges of a mat for putting on antique furniture or under a piece of porcelain or something are you talking about an antimacassar john stewart asked antiwhat one of the dcs asked its antique lacework lynley explained the sort of thing ladies used to do for their bottom drawers bloody hell barbara havers said our killers an antiques roadshow freak guffaws all round greeted this remark lynley said what about the bicycle left in st georges gardens prints on it are the kids theres some sort of residue on the pedals and the gear shift but sos not done with it yet the silver at the scene aside from the fact that the silver comprised only photo frames no one knew anything else about it someone made reference to the antiques roadshow once again but the comment was less humorous the second time round lynley told them all to carry on he directed nkata to continue trying to make contact with the family of the one missing boy who looked like a possible match he told havers to continue with the missingpersons reportsan order she did not embrace with a full heart if her expression was any indicationand he himself returned to his office and sat down with the autopsies he put on his reading spectacles and went over the reports with eyes that he tried to make fresh he also created a crib sheet for himself on this he wrote means of death strangulation by ligature in all four cases ligature missing torture prior to death palms of both hands burnt in three of four cases marks of restraints across the forearms and at ankles in all four cases suggesting victim tied to an armchair of some kind or possibly supine and restrained another way fibre analysis corroborates this same leather fibres on the arms and ankles in all four cases contents of stomach a small amount of food eaten within an hour preceding death in all four cases gagging device ducttape residue over the mouth in all four cases blood analysis nothing unusual postmortem mutilation abdominal incision and removal of navel in victim four marking forehead marked in blood in victim four trace evidence on the bodies black residue under analysis hairs an oil under analysis in all four cases dna evidence nothing lynley went through it all once then a second time he picked up the phone and called so the forensic lab on the south bank of the thames it had been ages since the first of the murders surely by now they had an analysis of both the oil and the residue theyd found on the first of the bodies no matter how overwhelmed with work they were maddeningly they had nothing yet on the residue but whale was the single answer he was given when he finally tracked down the responsible party in lambeth road she was called dr okerlund and she was apparently given to monosyllables unless pressed for more information whale lynley asked do you mean the fish for gods sake mammal she corrected him sperm whale to be exact official namethe oil not the whaleis ambergris ambergris whats it used for perfume all you need from me superintendent perfume are we playing at echoes here thats what i said nothing else what else dyou want me to say i mean the oil dr okerlund is it used for anything besides perfume couldnt tell you she said thats your job he thanked her for the reminder as pleasantly as he could manage then he rang off he added the word ambergris in the section for trace evidence and he returned to the incident room he called out anyone familiar with ambergris oil it was found on the bodies its from whales cardiff i reckon a dc noted not wales lynley said whales the ocean mobydick mobywho christ phil someone called out try elevating your reading beyond page three ribald remarks greeted this comment lynley let them feed off one another to his way of thinking the work they had to engage in was time consuming wearisome and gut wrenching weighing on the shoulders of the officers involved and often causing trouble in their homes if they needed to relieve the stress of it with humour that was fine by him nonetheless what happened next was more than welcome barbara havers looked up from a phone call she had just completed weve got a positive id on st georges gardens she announced hes a kid called kimmo thorne and he lived in southwark barbara havers insisted that they take her car not nkatas she saw lynleys assigning her to the interview of kimmo thornes relations as an opportunity for a celebratory cigarette and she didnt want to pollute the interior of winstons pristinely kept escort with her ash or smoke she lit up as soon as they hit the underground carpark and she watched with some amusement as her colleague folded his sixfeet fourinch frame into her mini he was left grumbling with his knees pressed into his chest and his head scraping the ceiling once she finally got the car started they lurched in the direction of broadway from there parliament square opened onto westminster bridge and their route across the river this was more winstons territory than it was barbaras and he acted the part of navigator once york road loomed in front of them on the left from that point she found it short work to weave over to southwark where kimmo thornes aunt and grandmother lived in one of the many nondescript blocks of flats that had been thrown up south of the river after the second world war the buildings only distinction turned out to be its proximity to the globe theatre but as barbara sardonically pointed out to nkata as they alighted into the cramped street it wasnt as if anyone who lived in the vicinity could actually afford a ticket when they presented themselves at the thorne establishment they found gran and aunt sal sitting dully before three framed photographs that had been placed on a coffee table in front of their sofa theyd identified the body aunt sal explained i dint want mum to go but she wasnt having any of that from me its done her in proper seeing our kimmo laid out like that he was a good boy i hope they hang who did this to him gran said nothing she looked shellshocked in her hand she clutched a white handkerchief that was embroidered round the edges with lavender bunnies she gazed on one of the pictures of her grandsonin it he appeared curiously attired as if for a fancy dress party wearing an odd combination of lipstick a mohawk green tights and a robin hood tunic with doc marten bootsand she pressed the handkerchief beneath her eyes when tears welled up in them during the course of their interview the police barbara told kimmo thornes gran and aunt were doing everything they could to find the young mans killer it would help enormously if miss and mrs thorne would tell them everything they could about the last day of kimmos life after she said all this barbara realised that shed automatically assumed the role that had once been hers the very role that now belonged to nkata she gave a tiny grimace of chagrin and looked in his direction he lifted a hand telegraphing its okay in a gesture that was unnervingly like one lynley might have made in the same circumstances she dug out her notebook aunt sal took the request seriously she started with kimmos rising in the morning he dressed in his usual leggings boots an outsize sweater that nice brazilian scarf knotted round his waistthe one his mum and dad sent over at christmas do you remember it mum and put on his makeup he had his breakfast of cornflakes and tea and he went to school barbara exchanged a glance with nkata considering the description of the boy along with the pictures on the coffee table and their proximity to the globe the next question rose naturally nkata asked it was kimmo taking courses at the theatre acting classes or the like oh their kimmo was made for drama and make no mistake about that aunt sal replied but no he wasnt doing a course at the globe or anywhere else as things turned out this was his regular getup when he left the flat or when he stayed in the flat if it came down to that setting aside the issue of his clothing barbara said he wore makeup regularly then when the two women nodded she did a mental cross off on one of their working theories that the killer might have bought cosmetics somewhere and smeared them across the most recent victims face yet it was hardly likely that kimmo was attempting to attend school thus arrayed certainly his aunt and gran would have heard from the head teacher if that had been the case still she asked them if kimmo had returned home from schoolor wherever hed been she added mentallyat the usual time on the day of his death they said hed been back by six oclock as usual and theyd had dinner together as usual as well gran did a fryup which kimmo didnt much like because he was watching his figure and afterwards aunt sal did the washing up while kimmo applied the tea towel to the cutlery and crockery he was the same as always aunt sal said chatting telling stories making me laugh till my insides hurt he had a real way with words wasnt a thing in life he couldnt make a drama of and act it out and sing and dancethe boy could do them like magic do them nkata asked judy garland liza barbra dietrich even carol channing when he put on the wig hed been working hard lately at sarah brightman aunt sal said only the high notes were a trial for him and hed not got the hands quite right but he wouldve he wouldve god love the boy only now finally aunt sal broke down she began to sob when she tried to speak and barbara glanced nkatas way to see if he was making the same assessment of this little family it was clear that as odd as kimmo thorne had looked and might have been hed also been night and day to his aunt and his gran gran took her daughters hand and pressed the bunnyedged handkerchief into it she took up the story he did marlene dietrich for them after supper falling in love again the tails the mesh stockings the heels the hateven the platinum hair with its little scoop of a wave he had it all down perfect had kimmo and then after the show he went out what time was this barbara asked gran looked at an electric clock that sat atop the television set she said half ten sally aunt sal dabbed her eyes somewhere round there where was he going they didnt know but he said hed be messing about with blinker blinker barbara and nkata said together blinker they confirmed they didnt know the boys last nameapparently blinker was male and of the human speciesbut what they did know was that he was definitely the cause of any trouble their kimmo ever got into the word trouble struck barbara but she let nkata do the honours what sort of trouble no real trouble aunt sal assured them and nothing hed ever started on his own it was just that that bloody blinkersorry mum she said hastilyhad passed along something of some kind to their kimmo which kimmo had flogged somewhere only to be caught out selling stolen property but it was that blinker responsible aunt sal said our kimmod never been in trouble before that certainly remained to be seen barbara thought she asked if the thornes could direct them to blinker they had no phone number for him but they knew where he lived they said it shouldnt be hard to find him on any morning because the one thing they knew about him was that he was up all night hanging about leicester square and he slept till one in the afternoon he kipped on his sisters sofa and she lived with her husband on kipling estate near bermondsey square aunt sal didnt know the sisters namenor did she have the first idea of blinkers christian name but she expected if the police went round asking where a bloke called blinker might be someone would know for certain blinker was someone who always managed to get known barbara asked if they might have a look through kimmos belongings then aunt sal took them to his room this was crowded with bed dressing table wardrobe chest of drawers television and music system the dressing table held a display of makeup that would have done boy george proud the top of the chest of drawers served as a location for wig stands of which there were five and the walls held dozens of professional head shots of kimmos sources of apparent inspiration from edith piaf to madonna the boy was nothing if not eclectic in his taste whered he get the dosh for all this barbara asked once aunt sal had left them to look through the dead boys lumber she didnt mention anything about employment did she makes you think about what blinker was really giving him to sell nkata replied drugs he waggled his hand maybe yes maybe no a lot of something he said we need to find that bloke winnie shouldnt be tough someonell know him on the estate ask round enough someone always does ultimately they got little joy from their efforts in kimmos room a small stack of cardsbirthday christmas and the odd easter thrown in all signed lovekins darling from mummy and dadwere hidden away in a drawer along with a photo of a welltanned thirtysomething couple on a sunny foreign balcony a yellowed newspaper article about a transgender professional model whod been outed by the tabloids in the distant past surfaced beneath a knot of costume jewellery on the dressing table a hairstyling magazineat least in other circumstancescould have indicated a future career otherwise much of it was what one would expect in the bedroom of a fifteenyearold boy malodorous shoes underpants screwed up beneath the bed stray socks it would have been ordinary except for the presence of all the items that made it into a hermaphroditic curiosity when theyd seen it all barbara stood back and said to nkata winnie what dyou reckon he was really into nkata joined her in assessing the room i got a feeling this blinker can tell us they both knew there was no point in looking up blinker at the moment theyd be better off trying in the morning just about the time those who had jobs would be setting off for work from the housing estate where blinker lived they returned to aunt sal and gran then and barbara asked about kimmos parents it was the small and pathetic hoard of postcards in the boys room that prompted her question rather than a need to know for purposes of their investigation it was also what that hoard of postcards said about peoples priorities in life oh they were in south america gran said theyd been there since just before kimmos eighth birthday his dad was in the hotel business you see and theyd gone there to manage a luxury spa they intended to send for kimmo when they got settled in but mum wanted to learn the language first and it was taking her longer than shed thought it would had they been informed of kimmos death barbara asked because gran and aunt sal had exchanged a look surely there were arrangements theyd want to be making to come home straightaway she said this in part because she wanted them to have to acknowledge what she assumed kimmos parents were parents only because of an egg a sperm and an accidental inception they had more important concerns than what had come of that fleshrubbing moment between them which led her to think of the other victims and of what it was that might tie all of them together chapter five by the next day two pieces of news from so gave cause for what went for good cheer the two tyre prints at the scene of the st georges gardens body had been identified by manufacturer theyd also been characterised by a peculiar wearing pattern on one of them that was going to please the crown prosecutors when and if the met made an arrest of someone in possession of those tyres and a vehicle to which they might be attached the other piece of news had to do with the residue on the pedals and the gears of the bicycle in st georges gardens as well as the residue on all four of the bodies they were dealing with it was all identical from this the murder squad concluded that kimmo thorne had been picked up somewherebike and alland murdered somewhere else after which his killer dumped the body the bike and probably the silver photo frames in st georges gardens all of this constituted meagre progress but progress all the same so when hamish robson returned to them with his report lynley was inclined to forgive him for showing up three and a half hours later than the promised twentyfour hours hed thought it would take him to assemble some usable information dee harriman fetched him from reception and returned him to lynleys office he said no to the offer of an afternoon cup of tea and instead he nodded towards the conference table rather than taking one of the two chairs in front of the desk it seemed a subtle way of telegraphing equality to lynley despite his apparent reticence robson didnt appear to be a man who was going to be easily cowed by anyone he carried with him a legal pad a manila folder and the paperwork lynley had given him on the previous day he folded his hands neatly across the top of it all and asked lynley what he knew about profiling lynley told him hed never yet had an occasion to use a profiler although he was aware of what profilers did he didnt add any comments about his reluctance to use one or about his belief that in truth robson had only been called in in the first place to give hillier something to hand to that ravenous dog the media would you like some background on profiling then robson asked not particularly to tell you the truth robson observed him evenly his eyes behind his spectacles looked shrewd but he made no remark other than to say obscurely right well see about it wont we he took up his legal pad without further ado they were looking he told lynley for a white male between twentyfive and thirtyfive he would be neat in his appearance close shaven short haired in good physical condition which was possibly the result of weight training he would be known to the victims but not well known he would be of high intelligence but low achievement a man with a decent school record but with disciplinary problems stemming from a chronic failure to obey he would likely possess a history of job losses and while he would probably be working at this time it would be in employment below his capabilities they would find criminal behaviour in his childhood and adolescence possibly petty arson or cruelty to animals he would be at this time unmarried and living either alone or with a dominant parent despite what he already knew about profiling lynley felt doubtful about the number of details robson had provided he said how can you know all this dr robson robsons lips moved in a smile that triedand failednot to look satisfied he said i do assume you know what profilers do superintendent but do you know how and why profiling actually works its rarely inaccurate and its nothing to do with crystal balls tarot cards or the entrails of sacrificed animals at this smacking of the gentle correction a parent gives to a wayward child lynley considered half a dozen ways to regain dominance they were all a waste of time he concluded so he said should we begin again with each other robson smiled genuinely this time thank you he said he went on to tell lynley that to know a killer one merely had to look at the crime committed which was what the americans had begun doing when the fbi had developed their behavioural science unit by gathering information over the decades of pursuing serial killers and by actually interviewing incarcerated serial killers by the dozens theyd discovered there were certain commonalities that could be depended upon to be present in the profile of the perpetrator of a certain kind of crime in this particular crime for example they could rely upon the fact that the killings were bids for power although their killer would tell himself that the killings had another reason entirely not just killing for the thrill of it not at all robson answered this actually has nothing to do with thrill this mans striking out because hes been frustrated contradicted or thwarted whatever thrill there is is secondary thwarted by the victim no a stressor has set him on this course but its source isnt the victim who is it then what a recent job loss that the killer thinks is unfair the breakup of a marriage or another amorous relationship the death of a loved one the rejection of a proposal of marriage a court injunction a sudden loss of money the destruction of a home by fire flood earthquake hurricane think of something that would put your world or anyones world into chaos and youll have a stressor we all have them in our lives lynley said but not all of us are psychopaths its the combination of the psychopathic personality and the stressor thats deadly not the stressor alone robson fanned out the crimescene photographs despite the aspects of the crime suggesting sadismthe burnt hands for exampletheir killer felt a certain amount of remorse for what hed done once hed done it robson said the body in each case told them that its position traditional to corpses placed in coffins prior to burial not to mention the fact that the final victim wore what amounted to a loincloth this he said was called psychic erasure or psychic restitution its as if the killing were a sad duty that the perpetrator believes and tells himself he must perform lynley felt this was going too far the rest he could swallow there was sense to it but thisrestitution penance sorrow why do it four times if he felt remorse afterwards the conflict for him robson said as if in reply to the questions lynley hadnt asked is the compulsion to kill which has been triggered by the stressor and can only be relieved by the act of killing itself versus the knowledge that what hes doing is wrong and he does know that even as he is driven to do it again and again so you believe hell strike another time lynley said theres no question about it this is going to escalate its actually escalated from the first you can see that in how hes been upping the stakes not only in where hes put the bodiestaking bigger risks of discovery every time he positions onebut also in what hes done to the bodies increasing the marking on them what we call making his signature more apparent its as if he believes the police are too stupid to catch him so hes going to taunt you a bit hes burned the hands three times and youve failed to make the connection between the killings so hes had to do more but why so much more wouldnt it have been enough just to slice open the final victim why add the mark on the forehead why the loincloth why take the navel if we discount the loincloth as psychic restitution were left with the slice the missing navel and the mark on the forehead if we see the slice as part of a ritual that we as yet dont understand and the missing navel as a gruesome souvenir that allows him to relive the event then what we really have is the mark on the forehead to serve as a conscious escalation of the crime what do you make of that mark lynley asked him robson took up one of the photographs that featured it particularly its rather like a cattle brand isnt it i mean the mark itself not how it was made a circle with two twoheaded crosses quadrisecting it it clearly stands for something so youre saying its not a signature on the crime like the other indicators im saying its more than a signature because its too deliberate a choice to be merely a signature why not use a simple x if you just want your mark on the body why not a cross why not one of your initials any of those would be quicker to put on your victim than this especially when time is probably of the essence youre saying this mark serves a dual purpose then id say so no artist signs a painting till its done and the fact that this mark was made with the victims blood tells us that it was likely put on his forehead after death so yes its a signature but its something more i think its a direct communication with the police or with the victim or the victims family robson handed the photographs back to lynley your killer has an enormous need to be noticed superintendent if it isnt satisfied by the current publicitywhich it wont be because his sort of need is never actually satisfied by anything you seethen hell strike again soon id say you can depend upon that he handed lynley the reports as well he included with them his own report which he took from the manila folder neatly typed and official with a cover sheet on the letterhead of fischer psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane lynley added the reports to the photographs robson had already handed over along with his card he thought about everything the profiler had said he knew other officers who believed completely in the artor perhaps it was a real science based on irrefutable empirical evidenceof psychological profiling but he had never been one of them put to the test hed always preferred his own mind and a sifting through concrete facts to trying to take those same facts and from them create a portrait of someone utterly unknown to him besides he couldnt see how it actually helped the situation at the end of the day they still had to locate a killer among the ten million people who lived in greater london and he wasnt clear on how the profile robson had provided was going to help do that the psychologist appeared to know this however he added a final detail as if to put a full stop to his report you also need to prepare yourself for contact he said what sort lynley asked from the killer himself alone he was fu creature divine eternal deity of what must be he was the truth and his was the way but the knowledge of this was no longer enough the need was upon him again it had come far sooner than he had expected it had come in days instead of in weeks possessing him with the call to act yet despite the pressure to judge and avenge to redeem and release he still moved with care it was essential he choose correctly a sign would tell and so he waited for there had always been a sign a loner was best he knew that much and naturally there were loners aplenty to choose from in a city like london but following one of them was the only way to confirm his selection as right and apt secure in the camouflage of other passengers fu performed this task by bus his chosen one climbed aboard ahead of him immediately making for the curve of stairs to the upper saloon fu did not follow him there instead once onboard he remained below where he took a position two poles away from the exit door with a view of the stairs their journey turned out to be a long one they inched along congested streets at each of the stops fu kept his attention fixed on the exit between the stops he entertained himself by studying his companions in the lower saloon the tired mother with the screaming toddler the ageing spinster with sagging ankles the schoolgirls with coats unbuttoned and blouses hanging out of their skirts the asian youths with their heads together making plans the black youths with their earphones on and their shoulders moving to the beat of music no one else could hear all of them were in need but most of them didnt know it and none of them knew who stood among them for anonymity was the greatest gift of living in this place someone somewhere pressed the button that would alert the driver to pull over at the next request stop a clatter from the stairs and a large mixed group of youths descended fu saw that the chosen one was among them and he eased his own way down the aisle to the door he ended up directly behind his prey and he could smell the scent of him when he stood on the steps before they disembarked it was the rank odour of the boys early adolescence restless and randy out on the street fu hung back giving the boy a good twenty yards the pavement wasnt as crowded here as it had been elsewhere and fu looked round to get an idea of exactly where he was the area was mixed race black white asian and oriental the voices here spoke a dozen languages and while no one group looked completely out of place somehow every individual did fear did that to people fu thought distrust caution expect the unexpected from any quarter be ready either to flee or to fight or to go unnoticed if that was possible the chosen one adhered to this latter principle he walked head down and appeared to acknowledge no one he passed this fu thought was all to the good when it came to his own intentions when the boy reached his destination though it was not his home as fu had thought it might be instead he walked from the bus stop down the length of a commercial area of markets video shops and betting parlours till he came to a small shop with soapcovered windows and there he entered fu crossed the street so that he could observe from the shadows of the doorway to a bicycle shop the place the boy had entered was well lit and despite the cold the door was propped open brightly clad men and women stood about chatting while among them children darted noisily the boy himself was talking to a tall man in a colourful collarless shirt that hung to his hips he had skin the hue of white coffee and round his neck hung a carved wooden necklace there appeared to be some sort of connection between this individual and the boy but it was something less than father and son for there was no father fu knew that so this manthis particular manperhaps fu thought he had not chosen wisely after all he was soon reassured the crowd took seats and began singing they did so haltingly taped music accompanied their efforts heavy on drums and suggesting africa their leaderthe man the boy had spoken torepeatedly stopped and started them again while this was going on the boy himself slipped out he came back into the street zipping his jacket and he headed in the shadows farther along the commercial area fu followed unseen up ahead the boy turned a corner and headed down another street fu hurried his own pace and was just in time to see him duck inside the doorway of a windowless brick building next to a scruffy workmans café fu paused assessing he didnt wish to risk being seen but he needed to know if his choice of the boy was legitimate he sidled up to the door he found it unlocked so he eased it open an unlit corridor led to the doorway of a large room that was fully illuminated from this room came the sounds of thuds grunts and the occasional guttural noise of a man ordering someone to jab god damn it and use an upper cut for christs sake fu entered this place immediately he smelled the dust and the sweat the leather and the mildew the unwashed male clothes along the walls of the corridor posters hung and midway to the bright room beyond a trophy cabinet stood fu snaked along the wall with care he had nearly gained the doorway when someone spoke from out of nowhere you need something man it was a black male voice and none too friendly fu allowed himself to diminish in size before he turned to see who owned it a refrigerator made flesh stood on the bottom step of a darkened stairway that fu had not noticed he was dressed for outdoors and he was slapping a pair of gloves against his palm he repeated his question wha you need man thiss private premises fu had to be rid of him but he also had to see somehow he knew this building contained the affirmation he needed before he could act he said sorry i didnt know it was private i saw a few blokes come out and i wondered what this place was im new round here the man observed him saying nothing fu added im looking for new digs and he smiled affably just doing a recce of the area sorry i didnt mean to offend he gave his shoulders a little hunch for effect he moved towards the front door although he had no intention of leaving and even if he was forced out to the street by this lout he would return as soon as the other man was gone the black said you cn have a look then but dont be bothering no one you got that fu felt a bubble of anger rising the tone of voice the audacity of the order he breathed in calm with the stale air of the corridor and he said what is this place boxing gym you cn have a look just try not to look like a punch bag the black left then laughing at his weak attempt at wit fu watched him depart he found that he was longing to follow to give in to the temptation to let the other learn with whom he had just spoken the longing fast grew into a hunger but he refused to submit instead he went to the bright doorway and keeping to the darkness he gazed into the room from which the grunts and thuds were coming punch bags speed bags two boxing rings free weights a treadmill skipping ropes two video cameras equipment was everywhere so were the men using the equipment mostly blacks but there were half a dozen white youths among them and the man whod been doing the shouting was also white bald as a baby and wearing a grey towel round his shoulders he was instructing two boxers in the ring they were black sweating panting like overheated dogs fu sought out the boy he found him pounding a punch bag hed changed his clothes and was wearing a tracksuit already it bore large crescents of sweat fu watched as he pummeled the bag without either style or precision he hurled himself upon it and pounded ferociously ignoring everything else around him ah fu thought the journey across london had been well worth the risk after all what he witnessed now had been worth even the brief interlude with the lout on the stairs for unlike any other moment before this when fu had been able to study the boy this time the chosen one stood revealed he had an anger within him to match fus own he was indeed in need of redemption for a second time winston nkata didnt go straight home instead he followed the river to vauxhall bridge where he crossed and circled round the oval once again he did it all without thinking simply telling himself that it was time the press conference made everything easier yasmin edwards would know something about the murders at this point so his purpose in calling would be to emphasise those details whose importance she might not have fully understood it was only when hed parked across from doddington grove estate that nkata came fully to what he considered to be his senses and that didnt turn out to be an ideal situation because coming to his senses also meant coming to his sensations and the one he felt as he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel was again largely cowardice on the one hand he did have the excuse hed been looking for more than that he had the duty hed taken the attestation to perform surely it was a small enough matter to impart the necessary information to her so why he should be feeling nerved out about doing his job it was way beyond him to suss that one out except nkata knew that he was lying to himself even as he allowed himself thirty seconds to do so there were half a dozen reasons for his being reluctant to ride the lift up to that thirdfloor flat and not the least of them was what hed deliberately done to the woman who lived within it he hadnt really come to terms with why hed assigned himself the job of making yasmin edwards aware of her lovers infidelity it was one thing to be in honest pursuit of a killer it was quite another to want the killer to be someone who stood in the way of nkata himself achievingwhat he didnt want to consider the answer to that question he said come on man and shoved open the car door yasmin edwards might have knifed her own husband and done time for it but the one thing he knew for certain was that if it came to knives between them he had far more experience in wielding one there had been a time when he would have rung a different flat to gain access to the lift telling the occupant at the other end of the buzzer that he was a cop so he could ride up to the third floor and knock on yasmin edwards door without her knowing he was on his way but he didnt allow himself to do that now instead he buzzed her flat and when he heard her voice asking who was there he said police missus edwards ill need a word please a hesitation made him wonder if shed recognised his voice a moment later though she released the lock on the lift its doors slid open and he stepped inside he thought she might meet him at the door to her flat but it was as firmly closed as everwith the curtains drawn for the evening at the sittingroom windowwhen he strode down the outdoor corridor to it she answered quickly enough when he knocked though which told him she must have been standing just inside waiting for his arrival she observed him expressionlessly and she didnt have to lift her head much to do so for yasmin edwards was an elegant six feet tall and as imposing a presence as shed been when hed first met her shed changed out of her work clothes and was wearing striped pyjamas she wore nothing else and he knew her well enough to recognise that shed deliberately put on no dressing gown when shed heard whod come calling which was her way of signaling to the police that she feared nothing from them having experienced the worst at their hands already yas yas he wanted to say thats not the way it has to be but instead he said missus edwards and reached for his identification as if he believed she didnt remember who he was she said what is it man nother murderer youre sniffing up round here no one in this flat capable of that but me so when is it i need the alibi for he shoved his warrant card back into his pocket he didnt sigh although he wanted to he said could i have a word missus edwards truth to tell its about dan she looked alarmed in spite of herself but as if she suspected a trick of some kind she remained where she was blocking his entrance she said you best tell me whats about daniel constable sergeant now nkata said or does that make it worse she cocked her head he found he missed the sight and the sound of her beaded plaits although her closecropped hair suited her just as well she said sergeant is it that what you come to tell daniel i didnt come to talk to daniel he said patiently i come to talk to you about daniel i cn do it outside if thats what you want missus edwards but youre gonna get colder if you stand there much longer he felt his face get hot because of what his words implied about what hed noticed the tips of her breasts peaking against the flannel of the pyjama top her exposed skin the colour of walnut goosefleshing where the top formed a v as best he could nkata avoided looking at the vulnerable parts of her that were open to the winter air but still he could see the smooth and stately curve of her neck the mole hed never noticed before beneath her right ear she shot him a look of contempt and reached behind the door where he knew she kept a line of hooks for coats she brought from it a heavy cardigan which she took her time about donning and buttoning to the throat when she was garbed to her liking she gave him her attention again better she asked whatevers best for you mum it was her sons voice coming from his bedroom doorway which nkata knew was to the left of the front door whas going on whos daniel edwards stepped into view just beyond yasmins shoulders his eyes widened when he saw who was calling on them and his grin was contagious exposing those perfect white teeth of his so adult in his twelveyearold face nkata said lo dan whas happening hey daniel said you member my name hes got it in his records yasmin edwards said to her son thas what cops do are you ready for the cocoa yet its in the kitchen if you want it homework finished you coming in daniel said to nkata we got cocoa mum makes it fresh i have enough to share f you like dan is your hearing sorry mum daniel said that grin again though daniel disappeared through the kitchen doorway the opening and closing of cupboards ensued from that direction in nkata said to the boys mother with a nod at the interior of the flat thisll take five minutes i cn promise that cos i got to get home i dont want you trying to get dan nkata raised his hands in a sign of surrender missus edwards i bother you since what happened happened no right i think you cn trust me she seemed to think this over while behind her the cheerful clatter continued in the kitchen finally she swung the door open nkata stepped inside and shut it behind him before she had a chance to change her mind he gave a quick look round hed determined not to care about what he might find inside but he couldnt help his curiosity when hed met yasmin edwards shed been living as lovers with a german woman a lag like herself whod done time for murder also like herself so he wondered if the german had been replaced there was no sign of this being the case everything was much as it had been before he turned to yasmin and found her watching him she held her arms crossed beneath her breasts and her face read satisfied he hated being off balance with her he wasnt used to that with women he said theres a boy been murdered body was put up in st georges gardens near russell square missus edwards she said with a shrug north of the river as if she meant how can that affect this part of town he said no its more than that thiss one of a string of boys been found all over town gunnersbury park tower hamlets carpark in bayswater and now the garden one in the gardens white but the rest of them looks like all been mixed race and young missus edwards kids she shot a look towards the kitchen he knew what she was thinking her daniel fitted the profile hed just described he was young he was mixed race still she shifted her weight to one hip and said to nkata all north of the river dont affect us over here and whyre you really here f you dont mind my asking as if everything she said and the abrupt way she said it could protect her from fearing for her boys safety before nkata could answer daniel returned to them a cup of steaming cocoa in his hand he appeared to avoid his mothers look as he said to nkata i brought you this anyway its made from scratch you cn have more sugar in it if you want cheers dan nkata took the mug from the boy and clasped him on the shoulder daniel grinned and shifted from one bare foot to the other look like you grown since i saw you nkata added did daniel said we measured we got marks on a wall in the kitchen you cn see if you want mum marks me first of every month i grew two inches sprouting up like that nkata said make your bones hurt yeah howd you know oh i xpect cos you grew fast as well thas right nkata said five inches one summer ouch daniel laughed he appeared ready to settle in for a chat but his mother stopped this by saying his name sharply daniel looked from nkata to her then back to nkata have your cocoa nkata said see you later yeah the boys face asked that a promise be made yasmin edwards didnt allow it saying daniel this mans here on business nothing else that was enough the boy scooted back to the kitchen casting one final look over his shoulder yasmin waited till he was gone before she said to nkata anything else he took a gulp of the cocoa and set the mug on the ironlegged coffee table where the same red highheelshaped ashtray still sat empty now that the german woman whod used it was gone from yasmin edwards life he said you got to have more of a care right now with dan her lips flattened you trying to tell me no he said you the best mum that boy could have in the world and i mean it yasmin he startled himself with his use of her given name and he was grateful when she pretended not to notice he hurried on i know you got stuff to do coming out f your ears what with the wig business an all that dan spends time on his own not cos thats the way you want it but cos thats how it is all im saying is this bleeders picking up boys dans age and hes killing them and i dont want that to happen to dan hes not stupid yasmin said curtly although nkata could tell this was all bravado she wasnt stupid either i know that yas but hes nkata searched for the words you cn tell he needs a man s obvious an from what we cn tell bout the boys been killedtheyre going with him theyre not fighting it no one sees anything cos theres nothing to see cos they trust him okay daniel int about to go with some we think he uses a van nkata cut in persisting in spite of her evident scorn we think its red im saying daniel doesnt take rides not from people he doesn know she cast a look in the direction of the kitchen she lowered her voice whatre you saying you think i dint teach him that i know you taught him like i said i cn see youre a good mum to the boy but that doesn change what the fact is inside of him yas and the fact is he needs a man thinkin youre going to be it or something yas now that hed begun saying her name nkata found he couldnt say it enough it was an addiction for him one he knew he had to be rid of in very short order or he would be lost like a needle freak dossing in a doorway in the strand so he tried again missus edwards i know dan spends time on his own cos youre busy and thas not good and thas not bad its just how it is all i want you to unnerstan is whas going on in your neighbourhood see fine she said i unerstand now she moved past him to the door and reached for the knob saying you did what you come for and now you can yas nkata wouldnt be dismissed he was there to do the woman a service whether she liked it or not and that service was to impress upon her the danger and urgency of the situation neither of which she apparently wished to grasp theres a bugger out there going after boys just like daniel nkata said rather more hotly than he would have liked hes getting them in a van and hes burning their hands till the skin goes black then hes strangling them and hes slicing them open he had her attention now and that spurred him to continue as if each word were a way he proved something to her although what that something was he didnt want to consider at the moment then he marks them up a bit more with their own blood and then he puts their bodies on display boys go with him and we dont know why and till we know he saw that her face had changed anger horror and fear had metamorphosed intowhat was it he was seeing she was looking beyond him her gaze fixed on the kitchen and he knew just like thatas if fingers had snapped in front of his face and he suddenly returned to consciousness he knew he didnt have to turn he only had to wonder how long daniel had been standing in the doorway and how much he had heard aside from having given yasmin edwards a wealth of information that she did not need and that he was not authorised to give to anyone hed frightened her son and he knew that without looking just as he knew hed long outstayed whatever welcome he might have had in doddington grove estate done enough yasmin edwards whispered fiercely moving her gaze from her son to nkata said enough seen enough nkata tore his gaze from her moving it to take in daniel he was standing in the doorway with a piece of toast in his hand one leg crossed over the other and squeezing as if he needed the toilet his eyes were big and what nkata felt was sorrow that hed had to see or hear his mum in anything resembling an altercation with a man he said to daniel i dnt want you to hear that man no need and im sorry you just be careful on the street theres a killer going after boys your age i dont want him going after you daniel nodded he looked solemn he said kay and then when nkata turned to leave you come round again or what nkata didnt answer him directly he said you just keep safe okay and as he stepped out of the flat he ventured a final look at daniel edwards mother his expression said to her what did i tell you yasmin daniel needs a man her expression responded just as clearly whatever youre thinking that man int you chapter six five more days passed they comprised what every investigation into murder comprised cubed by the fact that the squad was dealing with multiple killings so the hours that stacked upon hours which worked their way into long days longer nights and meals grabbed on the run ended up being devoted to percent slog this involved endless phone calls record checks fact gathering statements taking and reports making another percent went to coalescing all the data and trying to make some sense of it three percent went to revisiting every piece of information dozens of times to make sure nothing had been misunderstood misplaced or missed altogether and percent went to the occasional feeling that progress was actually being made staying power was necessary for the first percent caffeine worked well for the rest during this time the press bureau did its promised part to keep the media informed and at these events ac hillier continued to require ds winston nkataand frequently lynley as wellto serve as window dressing for the mets display of your taxes at work despite the maddening nature of the press conferences lynley had to admit that so far hilliers performances in front of the journalists appeared to be paying off since the press had not begun baying yet but that didnt make the time spent with them any less onerous my efforts might best be devoted to other pursuits sir he informed hillier as diplomatically as possible after his third appearance on the dais this is part of the job was hilliers reply cope there was little enough to report to the journalists di john stewart having divided his allocation of officers into teams they were working with a military precision that could not be anything but pleasing to the man team one had completed their study of the alibis given by the possible suspects theyd dug up after looking into releases from mental hospitals and prisons theyd done the same for sex offenders set free within the last six months theyd documented who was working in open conditions prior to discharge and theyd added homeless shelters to their list to see if anyone behaving suspiciously had been hanging about on any of the murder nights so far theyd uncovered nothing in the meantime team two had taken over beating the bushes in an effort to roust out witnessesto anything gunnersbury park still looked like their best bet for this and di stewart was as he put it damn well determined to find something in that direction surely he had lectured the team someone had to have seen a vehicle parked on gunnersbury road in the early hours of the morning when victim number one had been left inside for it remained that the only two means of access into the park after hours were over the wallwhich at eight feet high seemed an unlikely route for someone carrying a bodyor through one of the two boardedup sections of that wall on gunnersbury road but so far a canvassing of houses across the street had given team two nothing and interviews with nearly all the lorry drivers who would have been on that route hadnt unearthed anything either nor had conversationsstill ongoingwith taxi and minicab companies they were left with the red van seen in the area of st georges gardens but when swansea delivered a list of such vehicles registered to owners in the greater london area the total was an impossible even hamish robsons profile of the killersuggesting that they limit their interest to those vehicle owners who were male single and between the ages of twentyfive and thirtyfivedidnt make that number remotely manageable the entire situation made lynley long for the cinematic version of the detectives life a brief period of slog a slightly longer period of cogitation and then great scenes of action in which the hero chased the villain over land over sea through back alleys and beneath elevated railway tracks finally clobbering him into submission and securing his exhausted confession but that wasnt how it was it was after yet another appearance in front of the press that three hopeful developments occurred within moments of each other however lynley returned to his office in time to pick up the phone and receive a call from so the analysis of the black residue on all of the bodies and on the bicycle had coughed up a valuable piece of information the van they were looking for was likely a ford transit the residue came from the disintegration of a type of optional rubber lining that had been offered for use on the floor of this vehicle between ten and fifteen years ago the ford transit detail was going to go some way towards narrowing down the list theyd received from swansea although they wouldnt know by how much until they fed the data into the computer when lynley returned to the incident room with this news he was greeted by the second development theyd had a positive identification on the body left in the bayswater carpark winston nkata had taken a jaunt to pentonville prison to show photographs of their killers second victim to felipe salvatoredoing time for armed robbery and assaultand salvatore had sobbed like a fiveyearold when he declared the dead boy to be his little brother jared whom hed reported missing the first time hed skipped a regular visit to the clink as for any other members of jareds familythey were proving more difficult to locate a fact apparently having to do with the cocaine addiction and peripatetic nature of the dead boys mother the final development also came from winston nkata whod spent two mornings on kipling estate attempting to unearth someone whom they knew only as blinker his perseverancenot to mention his good mannershad finally paid off one charlie burov aka blinker had been located and was willing to talk to someone about his relationship with kimmo thorne the st georges gardens victim he didnt want to meet up on the housing estate where he dossed at his sisters though instead he would meet someonenot in uniform hed apparently stressedinside southwark cathedral five pews from the back on the lefthand side at precisely in the afternoon lynley grasped the opportunity to get out of the building for a few hours he phoned the assistant commissioner with an update that offered fodder for the next press conference and he himself effected an escape to southwark cathedral he tapped dc havers to go along he told nkata to check jared salvatores name with vice in the last police borough in which hed lived and after that to get on to the present location of the boys family then he set off with havers in the direction of westminster bridge it was a straightforward affair to get to southwark cathedral once the general confusion round tenison way was mastered fifteen minutes after setting off from victoria street lynley and the detective constable were in the nave of the church voices came from the direction of the chancel where a group of what appeared to be students stood round someone pointing out details on the tester above the pulpit three outofseason tourists were flipping through postcards at a bookstall directly across from the entrance but no one appeared to be waiting for a meeting with anyone the situation was exacerbated by the fact that like most medieval cathedrals southwark had no regular pews so there was no fifthrowfromthebackandontheleft seating where charlie burov aka blinker might have slouched in anticipation of their arrival so much for his churchgoing proclivities lynley murmured as havers looked round sighed and muttered a curse he added mind the mouth constable lightning is never a dear commodity when it comes to the lord he mightve at least sussed out the place first she groused in the best of all worlds lynley finally spied a spindly blackgarbed figure near the baptismal font who was darting looks in their general direction ah over there havers that could be our man he didnt run off as they approached him although he cast a nervous glance towards the group at the pulpit and then another towards the people at the bookstall when lynley asked politely if he was mr burov the boy said s blinker you the fuzz then out of the side of his mouth like a character in a bad film noir lynley introduced himself and havers while he gave the boy a quick appraisal blinker appeared to be round twenty years old with a face that would have been completely nondescript had not head shaving and body piercing been in vogue as it was studs erupted from his face like a visitation of smallpox in silver and when he spoke which was with some difficulty it was to reveal half a dozen additional studs lined up along the edge of his tongue lynley didnt want to think about the difficulty they presented the boy in eating hearing the difficulty they presented him in speaking was bad enough this might not be the best place to have our conversation lynley noted is there somewhere nearby blinker agreed to a coffee they managed to find a suitable café not far from st mary overy dock and blinker slid onto a chair at one of the grubby formicatopped tables where he studied the menu and said cn i get a spag bol then lynley eased a malodorous ashtray towards havers and said to the boy be my guest although he shuddered at the thought of personally ingesting any kind of foodnot to mention any kind of pastaserved up in a place where ones shoes adhered to the lino and the menus looked in need of disinfectant blinker apparently took lynleys reply as licence for liberality for when the waitress came for their order he added gammon steak two eggs chips and mushrooms along with a tuna and sweetcorn sandwich to the spaghetti havers ordered an orange juice lynley a coffee blinker grabbed the plastic salt shaker and began rolling it between his palms he didnt want to talk until hed had a nosh he told them so they waited in silence for the first of his plates to arrive havers taking the opportunity for another smoke lynley nursing his coffee and steeling himself to the spectacle of the boy working food past his tongue studs hed apparently had plenty of practice as things turned out when the first plate was deposited in front of him blinker made quick work of the gammon steak and its companions with minimum fuss andblessedlyeven less display when hed sopped up the remaining egg yolk and gammon grease with a triangle of toast he said better that and appeared ready to give himself over for conversation and a cigarette which he cadged from havers while he waited for the pastas arrival on the scene he was that torn up about kimmo he told them but hed warned his matehed warned him a hundred million timesabout taking it up the chute from blokes he didnt know kimmo always claimed the risk was worth it though and he always made them use a spunk bageven if admittedly he didnt always turn round at the vital moment to make sure it was on i tol him it want about some bloke infectin him for gods sake blinker said it was about xactly what happened to him anyways i never wanted him out there alone never when kimmo was on the streets i was on the streets wif him thas the way it was sposed to be ah lynley said im getting the picture you were kimmo thornes pimp then hey it want like that blinker sounded affronted so you werent his pimp barbara havers put in what would you call it when it was home with its mother i was his mate blinker said i kept watch for any nasty sort of business at might be going on like some bloke wif more on his mind than a bit f fun wif kimmo we worked together like a team it want my fault was it kimmo being the one they fancied lynley wanted to say that blinkers appearance might have had something to do with who was being fancied by the punters but he let the subject go he said the night kimmo disappeared he didnt start out with you then i dint even know he was going out did i wed done leicester square the night before see and wed found a party wanting some entertainment over in hollen street so we did a bit of business wif them we had enough dosh off that that we dint need to be out again and kimmo said his gran wanted him home for a night anyways was that normal lynley asked nah so i shouldve known summat was up when he said it but i didnt cos it was fine wif me not to go out i had the tellyand other things to do such as havers asked when blinker didnt respond merely looking in the direction of the kitchen for his spaghetti bolognese to put in an appearance she said what else were you two into besides prostitution charlie hey like i said we never were into lets not play games havers cut in tart it up any way you want but the truth is if you get paid for it charlie its not true love and you did get paid for it right isnt that what you said and isnt that why you didnt need to be going out another night because kimmo had earned you enough cash for a week probably providing entertainment in hollen street im wondering what you did with the lolly though smoke it shoot it snort it what you know i don have to talk to you lot blinker said hotly i could get up right now and be out of that door fastern and miss your spaghetti bolognese havers asked holy hell not that lynley said havers in the tone he generally usedwith limited successto restrain her and to blinker would it have been like kimmo to go off on his own despite your usual arrangement he did sometimes yeah like i said i tol him not to but he did it anyways i said it want safe he want a big bloke was he an if he misjudged who he let do him blinker crushed his cigarette and looked away his eyes grew watery stupid little bugger he muttered his spaghetti bolognese showed up along with a dispenser of cheese that looked like sawdust deficient in iron this he sprinkled delicately over the pasta and tucked in his emotion subdued by his appetite the café door opened and two workmen entered jeans whitened by plaster dust and thicksoled shoes crusted with cement they called out familiar hellos to the cook who was visible by means of a serving hatch and they chose a table in a corner where they placed their orders for a multicourse meal not unlike the one blinker himself had requested i tol him this would happen if he went it alone blinker said when he had finished wolfing down the pasta and was waiting for his tuna and sweetcorn sandwich i tol him over an over but he never listened did he he said he could tell about blokes he could the bad ones he said they have this kind of smell bout them like they been thinking too long what they want to do to you and it makes their skin all oily and cooked up like i tol him that was rubbish and he had to take me wif him no matter what but he wasnt having any of that was he so look what happened so you think this is the work of a punter lynley said kimmo making a bad judgment call when he was alone what else could it be kimmos gran said youve got him in trouble havers said she claims he was flogging stolen property you handed over to him what dyou know about that blinker rose in his chair as if hed been mortally wounded i never he said shes a bloody liar she is flaming old cow she dint like me from the first and now shes tryin to get me under the cosh int she well any trouble kimmo got in dint have nothing to do wif me you ask round bermondsey and see who knows blinker and who knows kimmo thas what you do bermondsey lynley asked but blinker was saying nothing else he was instead fuming at the idea that someone had fingered him as a thief instead of as what he really was a common chili chump on the street promoting the services of a fifteenyearold boy lynley said were you and kimmo lovers by the way blinker shrugged as if the question were unimportant he looked round for his tuna sandwich saw it waiting for delivery on the sill of the serving hatch and went to fetch it himself the waitress said hang on mate ill get to you soon nough blinker ignored her and took the sandwich to the table there he didnt sit again nor did he eat instead he wrapped the sandwich in his used paper napkin and shoved the package into the pocket of his worn leather jacket lynley watched him and saw that the young man wasnt so much piqued by his final question as he was grieved in a way that he clearly had not expected to be in a quivering muscle visible on his jaw the answer lay he and the dead boy had indeed been lovers if not recently then initially and probably before they had set off on a course of making money through the use of kimmos body blinker looked at them as he zipped his jacket he said like i said kimmo wouldntve had no trouble if he stayed wif me but he didnt did he he went his own way when i tol him not to thought he knew the world he did and look where it got him that said he was gone making for the door and leaving lynley and havers studying the remains of his spaghetti bolognese like high priests searching for auguries havers said didnt even say cheers for the meal she picked up his fork and twirled two strands of the pasta onto it this she then raised to the level of her eyes the body though kimmos body none of the reports claim sex before he died do they none of the reports lynley agreed which could mean that his death has nothing to do with working the streets unless of course what happened that night happened before they ever got to the sex lynley pushed his coffee cup to the centre of the table most of it undrunk but if we have to eliminate sex as part havers asked then the question is how are you at getting up before dawn she looked at him bermondsey id say thats our next direction lynley watched her as she considered this the fork still dangling from her fingers she finally nodded but she didnt look pleased i hope youre planning to be part of that party id hardly let a lady prowl round south london in the dark on her own lynley replied thats good news then im glad youre reassured havers what are you intending to do with that pasta she glanced at him then back at the fork still dangling in the air this she said she popped the spaghetti into her mouth and chewed it thoughtfully they definitely need to do some work on their al dente she told him jared salvatore the second victim of their murdererto whom theyd begun referring as red van for want of another sobriquethad lived in peckham some eight miles as the crow flies from where his body had been found in bayswater since from pentonville prison felipe salvatore had not been able to provide a recent address for his family nkata went first to their lastknown abode which was a flat in the wilderness of north peckham estate this was a place where no one wandered unarmed after dark where cops were not welcome where turf was marked it offered the worst there was in communal living dismal lines of washing hanging from balconies and from drainpipes broken and tyreless bicycles shopping trolleys given over to rust and every kind of rubbish imaginable the north peckham area made nkatas own housing estate look like utopia on opening day at the address hed been given for the salvatore family nkata found no one at home he knocked up neighbours who either knew nothing or were willing to say nothing until he found one who offered the information that the crackhead cow and her snivellers had finally been evicted after a monumental battle with navina cryer and her crew all of whom hailed from clifton estate that was the extent of the information available on the family but having been given a new namethat of navina cryernkata next went to clifton estate to seek her and whatever information she could give him of the salvatores navina turned out to be a sixteenyearold girl who was hugely pregnant she lived with her mother and her two younger sisters along with two toddlers in nappies who during nkatas conversation with the girl were never identified as belonging to anyone unlike the denizens of north peckham estate navina was only too happy to talk to the police she took a long look at nkatas warrant card took a longer look at nkata himself and ushered him inside the flat her mother was at work she informed him and the rest of that lotby which he reckoned she meant the other childrencould look after themselves she led him to the kitchen there a table held several loads of unwashed laundry and the air was ripe with the scent of disposable nappies in need of disposal navina lit a cigarette on one of the grimy stoves gas burners and she leaned against it rather than taking a seat at the table her stomach protruded so far that it was difficult to see how she actually remained upright and beneath the taut material of her leggings her veins stood out like worms after rainfall she said abruptly bout time innit wha was it lit the fire under you lot id like to know so nex time i got the right approach nkata sorted through these remarks he concluded from them that shed been expecting the police considering the information hed gleaned from the one neighbour willing to talk on north peckam estate he assumed she was referring to the outcomewhatever it had beenof her reported altercation with mrs salvatore he said woman over north peckham she told me you might know the whereabouts of jared salvatores mum s that right navina narrowed her eyes she took a deep hit on her cigarettedeep enough to make nkata shudder for her unborn childand as she blew the smoke out she studied him then studied the ends of her fingernails which were painted fuchsia and matched her toenails she said slowly wha bout jared you got word on him word for his mum you can tell me where she is nkata replied like she going t care you mean navina sounded scornful like he mean more to her than flake that cunt dint even know he was gone till i tol her mister an if you find her under whaever car she been dossin since they got done wif her on north peckham you cn tell her i said she cn die an i spit on her coffin an be glad to do it she took another hit on the cigarette nkata saw that her fingers were shaking he said navina cn we reverse things here im in the dark how wha more do i got to tell you lot he been gone an gone an it aint like him which is what i been sayin over and over only no ones listenin an i just bout ready hang on nkata said cn i get you to sit over here im sorting this but youre going too quick he pulled a chair from beneath the table and indicated she should take it one of the toddlers trundled into the kitchen at that point nappy hanging nearly to his knees and navina took a moment to change him which consisted of ripping the nappy off tossing it into a swing binwith its load mercifully intactand strapping him into another without undo ceremony the remains of his droppings still clinging to his flesh after that she rooted out a boxed ribena for the child and handed it over leaving him to suss out a manner of detaching its straw and driving it into the small carton then she lowered herself into the chair all along her cigarette had dangled from her lips but now she stubbed it out in an ashtray that she took from beneath the pile of dirty laundry nkata said to her you reported jared missing thas what youre telling me i tol the cops drectly he dint show up for the antenatal i knew right then there was summat wrong cause he always come dint he to see bout his baby nkata said hes the dad then jared salvatores your babys dad an proud to be from the first he was thirteen years old not many blokes get started so fast and he liked that jared it made him swell up bigger n you wouldve believed the day i tol him nkata wanted to know what shed been doing messing with a mere boy who should have been at school making a future and not out on the loose making babies but he did not ask navina herself should have been at school if it came to that or at least she should have been doing something more useful than offering herself to a randy adolescent at least three years her junior she also had to have been doing the job with jared since the boy had been twelve it made nkatas head swim just thinking about it and knowing that at twelve years old with a willing female he too might have happily plunged away his life hot for that fleshy moment of contact and thinking about nothing else he said to navina we got the report from his brother felipe in the ville jared dint show for visiting when he shouldve and felipe called him in missing this was something like five six weeks ago i went to them louts two days later navina cried two days afer he dint show at the antenatal like he was sposed to i tol the cops and they dint listen they werent havin none of it off me when was this moren a month ago she said i go to the station and tell that bloke in reception i got someone missin he say who and i say jared i tell him he dint come to the antenatal and he dint ever give me a bell about that or nothin which want like him they figger he done a runner cause of the baby see they say wait nother day or two and when i go back they say wait nother an i keep goin an i keep tellin them an they jot down my name an jareds an no one does nothing she began to cry nkata got up from his own chair and went to hers he put his hand on the back of her neck he could feel how slender it was beneath his fingers and how warm her flesh was where it touched his own and from that he guessed what the girls appeal had been prior to being made hugely swollen and ungainly with a thirteenyearolds child he said im sorry they shouldve listened the locals im not from there she raised her wet face but you said a copthen where he told her then as gently as he could he told her the rest that the father of her baby was dead at the hands of a serial killer that hed probably already been dead on the day of the antenatal appointment hed missed that he was one of four victims who like himself were adolescent boys whose bodies had been found too far from their homes for anyone in the vicinity to recognise them navina listened and her dark skin shone beneath the tears that continued to roll down her cheeks nkata felt torn between the need to comfort her and the desire to lecture some sense into her what did she actually think he wondered and wanted to say that a thirteenyearold boy would be around forever not so much because hed die although god knew enough of their young men never made it to thirty but because hed come to his senses eventually and realise there was more to life than fathering babies and he wanted whatever that more was the need to comfort won out nkata fished a handkerchief from his jacket pocket and pressed it on her he said they shouldve listened and they dint navina i cant xplain why im that sorry bout it cant you xplain she asked bitterly whatm i to them cow up the spout done to by the kid got caught wif two nicked credit cards and thas what they remember bout him innit snatched a purse oncer twice wif some blokes tried to carjack a mercedes one night some rude boy so we dont plan on lookin for him nowhere so get out of here girl and stop pollutin our precious atmosphere thank you well i loved him i did and we meant to have a life together and he was makin that life he was learning cookin and he meant to be a real chef you ask round about that you see what they say cooking chef nkata took out the slender leather diary he used as a notebook and he jotted the words down in pencil he didnt have the heart to press navina for more information from what shed already said he reckoned there was going to be a treasure trove of facts about jared salvatore at the peckham police station he said you be all right navina you got someone i cn ring for you she said my mum and for the first time she seemed sixteen and also what she probably was at heart which was afraid like so many of the girls who grew up in an environment where no one was safe and everyone was suspect her mum worked in the kitchen at st giles hospital and when nkata spoke to her by phone she said shed be home at once she int startin is she the woman asked anxiously and then said thank jesus for that at least when nkata told her it was something of a different nature entirely but her presence would be a great comfort to the girl he left navina in anticipation of her mothers arrival and he went from clifton estate to peckham police station which was only a short distance along the high street in reception a white special constable was working behind the counter and he spent just a shade longer than seemed necessary at his tasks before he acknowledged nkata then he said help you with a face that managed to be perfectly blank nkata took a certain pleasure in saying ds nkata as he showed his warrant card to the man he explained why hed come as soon as he mentioned the salvatore family name it seemed he would need no further introduction finding someone at the station who didnt know the salvatores would have been more challenging than finding someone whod mixed with them at one time or another aside from felipe doing time in pentonville there was another brother languishing in remand on a charge of assault the mother had a record going back to her adolescence and the other boys in the family were apparently doing what they could to better it before they reached their twenties so the real question was who in the station did ds nkata want to talk to because just about anyone could give him an earful nkata said that whoever had taken navina cryers missingpersons report about jared salvatore would do this of course brought up the delicate question of why no one had bothered to file such a report but he didnt want to travel that road surely someone had listened to the girl if not formally recording what shed said that was the person he wanted to find constable joshua silver turned out to be the man he came to fetch nkata from reception and ushered him into an office shared by seven other officers where space was at a minimum and noise was at a maximum he had something of a cubby hole carved out between a bank of perpetually ringing phones and a row of ancient filing cabinets and he guided nkata to this yes he admitted hed been the person to whom navina cryer had spoken not the first time shed come to the station when she hadnt apparently got beyond reception but the second and third times yes hed written down the information shed offered but truth to tell he hadnt taken her seriously the salvatore yobbo was thirteen years old silver reckoned the boyd done a runner what with the girl on her way to popping there was nothing in his past that suggested hed be apt to hang round waiting for any blessed events to be occurring kids been in trouble since he was eight years old the constable said he came up before the magistrate first when he was ninebag snatching from an old lady this wasand the last time we hauled his bum through the door it was for breaking into a dixons planned to sell the takings in one of the street markets our jared you knew him personally as good as anyone round here yeah nkata handed over a photo of the body that felipe salvatore had named as that of his brother constable silver examined it and nodded his confirmation of felipes identification it was jared all right the almond eyes the squashedtip nose all the salvatore kids had them gift of the racial mix of their parents dads filipino mums black a crackhead silver looked up quickly as he said this last as if hed suddenly realised he might have given offence i sorted that nkata took the picture back he asked about the cooking that jared was supposedly learning silver knew nothing about this and declared it the product of either navina cryers wishful thinking or jared salvatores outright prevaricating all he knew was that jared had been turned over to youth offenders where a social worker had triedand obviously failedto make something of him youth offenders over here nkata said could theyve arranged some training for the boy dthey get jobs for kids when pigs fly silver said our jared frying fish in your local little chef dont know idve eaten a meal that bloke put on a plate if i was starving silver took a staple remover from the top of his desk and used it to dig some grime from beneath his thumbnail as he concluded heres the real truth about scum like the salvatores sergeant most of them end up where theyre heading all along and it was going to be no different for jared which was something navina cryer couldnt accept felipes locked up already matteos in remand jared was third in line of the kids so he was next in line for the nick dogooders over at youth offenders mightve done their best to stop that from happening but they had everything set against it from the start everything being nkata inquired silver eyed him over the staple remover and flicked the detritus from beneath his thumbnail onto the floor no offence meant but youre the exception man youre not the rule and i expect you had some advantages along the way but therere times when people dont add up to much and this is one of those times you start out bad you end up worse thats just how it is not if someone takes an interest was what nkata wanted to reply nothing was written in stone but he said nothing he had the information hed come for he had no greater understanding of why jared salvatores disappearance had gone largely unremarked by the police but he needed no greater understanding as constable silver himself had put it thats just how it was chapter seven when she got back to chalk farm at the end of the day barbara havers was feeling almost jaunty not only had the interview with charlie burovaka blinkerseemed like a moment of actual progress but being out of the incident room and engaged in the human end of the investigation in lynleys company made her feel as though regaining her rank was not a pipe dream after all she was in fact blithely humming its so easy when she hiked homeward from the spot shed found to park the mini even when rain began to fall and was driven into her face by the wind she was not bothered she merely stepped up her paceand the tempo of her tuneand hurried towards eton villas she glanced quickly at the groundfloor flat when she went up the drive lights were on inside azhars digs and through the french windows she could see hadiyyah sitting at a table with her head bent over an open notebook homework barbara thought hadiyyah was a dutiful pupil she stood for a moment and watched the little girl as she did so azhar came into the room and walked by the table hadiyyah looked up and followed him longingly with her gaze he didnt acknowledge her and she didnt speak merely ducking her head again to her work barbara felt a sharp twinge at the sight of this struck by an unexpected anger whose source she didnt want to examine she went along the path to her bungalow inside she flipped on the lights tossed her shoulder bag on the table and dug out a tin of all day breakfast which she dumped unceremoniously into a pan she popped bread into the toaster and from the fridge took a stella artois making a mental note to cut back on the drinking since this was yet another night when she was not supposed to be imbibing at all but she felt like celebrating the interview with blinker as her meal was doing what it could to prepare itself without her participation she went as usual for the television remote which again as usual she couldnt find she was searching for it when she noticed that her answer machine was blinking she punched it to play as she continued her search hadiyyahs voice came to her tense and low sounding as if she was trying to keep someone else from hearing her i got gated barbara she said thiss the first chance i had to ring you cause im not meant even to use the phone dad said im gated till further notice an i dont think its fair at all damn barbara muttered studying the grey box from which her little friends voice came dad said its owing to my arguing with him i dint really want to give back the buddy holly cd see then when he said i had to i said could i just leave it for you with a note and he said no i had to do it in person and i said i dint think that was fair and he said i was to do what he told me and since i clearly dint want to do it hed make sure it was done properly whichs why he came with me and then i said he was mean mean mean and i hated him and he a silence as if she were listening to something nearby she hurried on im not meant to argue with him ever is what he said and he gated me so i cant use the phone and i cant watch telly and i cant do anything but go to school and come home and its not fair she began to cry gotta go bye she managed to say with a hiccup then the message was over barbara sighed she had not expected this of taymullah azhar he had broken rules himself leaving an arranged marriage and two small children to take up with an english girl with whom hed fallen in love hed been ousted from his family as a result forever a pariah to his own kin of all the people on earth he was the last person she would have anticipated being so inflexible and unforgiving she was going to have to have a talk with him punishments she thought should match their crimes but she knew she would have to come up with an approach that didnt seem like actually talking to him by which of course she really meant giving him a piece of her mind no she was going to have to dress it in the guise of a natural part of a conversation which meant she was going to have to develop a subject of conversation that would allow the topics of hadiyyah lying being gated and unreasonable parents to arise naturally at the moment though the very thought of all that verbal manoeuvring made barbaras head feel like a balloon too full of air she made a mental note to seek out a reasonable excuse to talk to azhar and she uncapped her stella artois there was a good chance she thought that she would need to consume two bottles of lager tonight fu made the necessary preparations these did not take long because he had laid the groundwork well once the chosen boy had proved himself worthy he had watched him until he knew all his routines and movements so when the time was right he was able to make a quick choice of the environs in which he would finally act he chose the gym he felt confident hed found a place where hed been able to park without difficulty each time hed been in the vicinity it was in a street where on one side a stained brick wall formed the boundary of a schoolyard and on the other a cricket ground lay in darkness the street wasnt particularly close to the gym but fu didnt expect that to present much trouble because more important than anything else the place he parked was on the route the boy would have to take to get to his home when he emerged from the gym fu was waiting although he made it seem as though their meeting were a coincidence hey fu said all pleased surprise is thatwhatre you doing here the boy was three steps ahead of him shoulders hunched as they always were head hanging down when he turned fu waited for recognition to dawn it did quickly enough to satisfy the boy looked left and right but it didnt seem so much because he wanted to escape what was coming as to see if anyone else was there to witness the circumstance of such a person being in such a place where that person patently didnt belong but there was no one nearby for the gyms entrance was on the side of the building not the front on the main route more used by pedestrians the boy jerked his head in that ageold male adolescent form of hello his short dreadlocks bounced round his dark face hey whatre you doing round here fu offered the excuse hed planned trying to make peace with my dad and getting nowhere as usual it meant nothing at all in the general scheme of life but fu knew it would mean everything to the boy it told a tale of brotherhood in twelve brief words obvious enough to be understood by a thirteenyearold subtle enough to suggest that a bond of the unspoken might actually exist between them heading back to the banger what about you dyou live round here up past the station finchley road and frognal im parked in that direction ill give you a lift if you like he moved along keeping his pace somewhere between a stroll and a brisk wintertime walk like a regular mate he lit a cigarette offered one to the boy and confided that hed parked a bit of a distance from where hed met his dad because hed known hed want to clear his head afterwards with a walk never works out with the two of us talking fu said mum says she only wants us to relate to each other but i keep telling her you cant relate to a bloke who walked out before you were born he felt the boys eyes on him but they suggested interest and not suspicion i met my dad once works on german cars over in north kensington he does i went to see him waste of time bloody waste the boy kicked a squashed fanta can that lay in their path loser bugger wanker yeah no one elsell probly touch it fu gave a bark of laughter motors just over that way he said come on he crossed over the road careful not to watch to see if the boy was following he took his keys from his pocket and jangled them in his hand the better to telegraph the nearness of the van should his companion begin to feel uneasy he said heard youve been doing well by the way the boy shrugged fu could tell he was pleased by the compliment though whatre you on to now doing a design what sort there was no reply fu glanced the boys way thinking he might have pushed too far invading what was delicate territory for some reason and the boy did look embarrassed and reluctant to speak but when he finally replied fu understood his hesitation the discomfiture of a teenager afraid of being labelled uncool he said for a church thing meets in a shop down finchley road that sounds good but it didnt really the idea of the boys being attached to a church group gave fu pause because the disenfranchised were what he wanted a moment later however the boy clarified the levelor lack thereofof both his virtue and his connection with others rev savidges got me in care at his house thevicar is itof the church group him and his wife oni shes from ghana from ghana recently the boy shrugged it seemed a habit with him don know its where his own peoplere from rev savidges people its where they came from before they got sent to jamaica on a slave ship oni shes called rev savidges wife oni ah the second and third time hed said her name here then was a real something to be mined several nuggets at once fu said oni thats a brilliant name yeah shes a star like to live with them then reverend savidge and oni the shoulders again that casual lift of them that hid what the boy no doubt was feeling not to mention what he was wanting all right he said better than with my mum anyway and before fu could press asking the boy questions that would reveal his mums imprisonment thereby allowing fu to forge yet another false bond with him the boy said so wheres your car then in a restless manner which could be interpreted as a very bad sign thankfully though they were nearly upon it parked in the shadows of an enormous plane tree right there fu said and he gave a look round to make sure the street was as deserted as it had been on his every recce of the site it was perfect he tossed his cigarette into the street and when the boy had done the same he unlocked the passenger door hop in he said you hungry ive some takeaway in that bag on the floor roast beef although it should have been lamb lamb would have been richer with appropriate associations fu shut the door when the boy was inside and going for the bag of food as required of him he tucked right in happily he didnt notice that his door had no interior handle and that his seat belt had been removed fu joined him heaving himself into the drivers seat and thrusting the ignition key into its home he started the van but he did not put it into gear nor did he release its hand brake he said to the boy grab us something to drink okay ive a cooler back there behind my seat i could do with a lager theres cokes if you want one or have a beer yourself if youd rather cheers the boy twisted in his seat he peered into the back where because the van was carefully panelled and thoroughly insulated it was conveniently dark as the devils bum he said behind where as required of him fu said hang on ive got a torch here somewhere and he made much of searching round his seat till he put his hands on the torch in its special hidden spot he said got it have some light then and he flicked it on focused on the cooler and the promise of beer within it the boy didnt notice the rest of the vans interior the body board firmly in its brackets the wrist and ankle restraints curled to either side on the floor the stove from the vehicles former days the roll of tape the washing line and the knife especially that the boy saw none of this because like the others whod preceded him he was just a male adolescent with the male adolescents appetites for the illicit and in this moment the illicit was represented by beer in another moment an earlier moment the illicit had been represented by crime it was that for which he now stood doomed to punishment turned in his seat and bending to the back of the van the boy reached towards the cooler this exposed his torso it was a movement designed to aid what followed fu turned the torch and pressed it into the boy two hundred thousand volts scrambled his nervous system the rest was easy lynley was standing at the work top in the kitchen downing a cup of the strongest coffee hed been able to manage at half past four in the morning when his wife joined him in the doorway helen blinked against the overhead lights as she tied the belt of her dressing gown round her she looked extremely weary bad night he asked her and added with a smile all that worry over christening clothes stop she grumbled i dreamed our jasper felix was doing backflips in my stomach she came to him and slipped her arms round his waist yawning as she rested her head against his shoulder what are you doing dressed at this hour the press bureau havent taken to offering predawn press briefings have they you know what i mean see how diligently we work at the met were up before the sun on the scent of malefactors hillier would ask for that if he thought of it lynley replied wait another week itll occur to him misbehaving is he just being hillier hes parading winston in front of the press like rod hull except poor emu doesnt get to speak helen looked up at him youre angry about this arent you its not like you not to be philosophical is this about barbara winstons getting the promotion instead of her that was rotten of hillier but i should have seen it coming lynley said hed love to get rid of her still always ive never known quite how to protect her helen even doing the superintendent bit temporarily i feel at a loss i havent a quarter of webberlys skill at this sort of thing she released herself from his embrace and went to the cupboard where she took out a mug which she filled with skimmed milk and put into the microwave to heat she said malcolm webberly has the advantage of being sir davids brotherinlaw darling that would have counted for something when they knocked heads on an issue wouldnt it lynley grumbled neither agreement nor dissent he watched his wife take her warmed milk from the microwave and stir a spoonful of horlicks into it he finished off his coffee and was rinsing out the cup when the front doorbell buzzed helen turned from the work top saying who on earth as she looked towards the wall clock thatll be havers you are going to work then really at this hour going to bermondsey he left the kitchen and she followed horlicks in hand the market tell me its not to shop she said bargains are bargains and you know id never turn away from one myself but surely one ought to draw the line at bargains reached before the sun comes up lynley chuckled are you sure you dont want to come with us the odd piece of priceless porcelain for twentyfive pounds the peter paul rubens hidden beneath two centuries of grime with nineteenthcentury household cats painted over it by a sixyearold he crossed the marble tiles of the entrance and opened the door to find barbara havers leaning against the iron railing a knitted cap pulled low on her brow and a donkey jacket wrapped round her stubby body havers said to helen if youre seeing him off at this hour the honeymoon has definitely gone on too long my restless dreams are seeing him off helen said that and general anxiety over the future according to my husband havent decided on the christening clobber yet helen looked at lynley did you actually tell her tommy was it confidential no just inane the situation that is not your telling it and then to barbara we may have a small fire in the nursery it will unfortunately burn both sets of clothes beyond use and recognition what do you think sounds just the ticket to me havers said why go for family compromise when you can have arson our very thought better and better lynley said he put his arm round his wifes shoulders and kissed the side of her head lock up behind me he instructed her and go back to bed helen spoke to her small bump do not haunt my dreams again young man mind your mummy and then to lynley and barbara and you mind how you go before she shut the door behind them lynley waited to hear the bolts shoot into place next to him barbara havers was lighting a cigarette he eyed her with disapproval saying at half past four in the morning even in my worst days havers i couldnt have managed that are you aware theres nothing more sanctimonious than a reformed smoker sir i dont believe it he replied leading them down the street in the direction of the mews where his car was garaged there must be something else nothing she said thereve been studies done on it even your basic mary magdalenes living now as nuns dont rate a sausage compared to your former weed fiends it must be our concern for the health of our fellows more like your desire to inflict your misery on everyone else give it up sir i know you want to rip this out of my hand and smoke it to the nub how long have you gone without at this point so long i cant even remember actually oh bloody right she said to the sky they set off in the blessing of early morning london there was virtually no other vehicle on the streets because of this they zipped through sloane square with all traffic lights in their favour and in less than five minutes they saw the lights of chelsea bridge and the tall brick smokestacks of battersea power station rising into the charcoal sky across the thames lynley chose a route along the embankment that kept them on the wrong side of the river as long as possible where he was more familiar with the turf here too there were very few vehicles just the odd cab heading into the centre of town for the days work and the occasional lorry getting a head start on deliveries thus they wended their way to the massive grey fortress that was the tower of london before crossing over and from there it was no difficult feat to find bermondsey market not overly far along tower bridge road using the illumination of tall streetlamps as well as torches fairy lights strung round the occasional stall and other localised lights of dubious origin and weak wattage vendors were in the final stages of setting up for business their day would begin shortlyfor the market opened at five in the morning and was a thing of memory by two in the afternoonso they were intent upon the assembly of the poles and tables that defined their stalls around them in the darkness waited boxes of countless treasures which were stacked on carts that had been wheeled into position from vans and cars along the nearby streets already there were people waiting to be the first to browse through everything from hairbrushes to highbutton shoes no one officially held them back but it was clear from watching the vendors at work that customers would not be welcome until the goods were fully displayed beneath the predawn sky as in most london markets the vendors occupied the same general area every time bermondsey was open for business so lynley and havers began at the north end and worked their way south asking for someone who could talk to them about kimmo thorne the fact that they were police did not garner them the quick cooperation they had hoped for under circumstances that involved the death of one of the vendors own but this they knew was likely due to bermondseys reputation for being a clearing ground for stolen property a place where the trade part of in the trade frequently meant breaking and entering theyd spent more than an hour quizzing vendors when a seller of ersatz victorian dressingtable sets thiss guaranteed one hunderd prcent the genuine article sir and madam recognised kimmos name and after declaring both the name and the person in possession of it an odd ltle sod you ask me he directed lynley and havers to an elderly couple at a silver stall you talk to the grabinskis over there he said using his chin to indicate the direction theyll be able to tell you whats what with kimmo dead sorry about wha happened to the ltle sod read about it in the news of the world so evidently had the grabinskis who turned out to be a couple whose only son had died years in the past but at something near the same age as kimmo thorne theyd quite taken to the boy they explained not so much because he reminded them physically of their dear mike but because he had something of mikes enterprising nature this quality the grabinskis both admired in kimmo and deeply missed in their departed son so when kimmo had turned up on occasion with the odd something or other or a bagful of somethings he wanted to sell they shared their stall with him and he gave them a portion of his profit not that theyd ever asked him for it mrs grabinski said hastily her name was elaine and she wore sage green wellingtons with red wool kneesocks gaily turned over their tops she was polishing an impressive epergne and the moment lynley had said kimmo thornes name shed said kimmo whos come to ask about kimmo then bout time innit and she made herself available to help them as did her husband who was hanging a display of silver teapots on strings that dangled from one of the horizontal poles of the stall the boy had come to them first hoping they would buy from him mr grabinksicall me rayinformed them but he asked a price they werent willing to pay and when no one else in the market was willing to pay it either kimmo had returned to them with another offer to sell from the stall himself and to give them a portion of the takings theyd liked the boyhe was that cheeky elaine confidedso they gave him a quarter of one of the tables along the side of the stall and there he did his business he sold silver piecessome plate some sterlingwith a speciality in photo frames weve been told he got into some trouble with that lynley said evidently he sold something that shouldnt have been on sale in the first place having been lifted off someone else havers put in oh they knew nothing about that both grabinskis hastened to say as far as they were concerned it was someone wanting to get kimmo in trouble who told that tale to the local rozzers doubtless in fact it was their chief competitor in the market one reginald lewis to whom kimmo had also gone trying to sell his silver before returning to them reg lewis was that jealous of anyone wanting to set up business round early morning bermondsey wasnt he hed tried to keep the grabinskis out twentytwo years back when they first started hed done the same to maurice fletcher and to jackie hoon when they started up so there was no truth to kimmos goods being stolen havers asked looking up from her notebook because when you think of it how else would a kid like kimmo be coming across valuable pieces of silver for sale they had assumed he was selling off family pieces elaine grabinski said they did ask him and thats what he told them he was helping out his gran by offering the family silver to the public to lynley it looked like a case of the grabinskis believing what they had wanted to believe because they liked the boy rather than a case of kimmo being a sophisticated liar who pulled the wool over the eyes of an elderly couple they had to have known at some level that he wasnt the legitimate article but at that same level they had to have not cared we told the police wed speak up for the boy if it came to court ray grabinski asserted but once they carted poor kimmo off we didnt hear nother word about him till we saw the news of the world that is an you ask reg lewis bout that you lot elaine grabinski said returning to the epergne with renewed vigour she added ominously what i wouldnt put past him fits in a teaspoon and her husband said now pet and patted her shoulder reg lewis turned out to be only slightly less antique than his wares he wore bright tartan braces beneath his jacket and they held up a pair of ancient plus fours his spectacles were as thick as the bottom of whisky tumblers overlarge hearing aids protruded from his ears he fit the profile of their serial killer as well as a sheep fit the profile of a genius he werent sprised none when the cops had come calling for kimmo he told them something was off with the bugger first time reg lewis laid eyes on the creature dressed half man half woman he did with them tights of his or whatever they were and those poncey ankle boots and the like so when the cops showed up with a list of stolen property in their mitts hereg lewis mind youwas not gobsmacked that they found what they were looking for in the possession of one kimmo thorne carted him off then and there they did and good riddance it was besmirching the reputation of the market he was flogging pinched silver and not any pinched silver mind you but pinched silver that hed been too thick to notice had personal and immediately identifiable engraving upon it what happened to kimmo after that reg lewis didnt know and didnt much care the only good thing the little nancy boy did at the end of the day was not drag the grabinskis down with him and werent those two blind as bats in the daylight anyone with sense wouldve known that boy was up to no good when he first showed his mug in the market reg warned the grabinskis off him he did but would they listen to someone with their best interests at heart not bloody likely yet who turned out to be right at the end of the day eh and who never heard a word of youwererightregandweapologiseforournastiness from anyone eh reg lewis had nothing more to add kimmo had vanished that day with the coppers perhaps hed done a stretch in borstal perhaps hed had the fear of god put into him at the police station all reg knew was that the boy hadnt brought any more stolen silver to sell in bermondsey market which was fine by reg cops over in borough high street could fill anyone in on the rest couldnt they reg lewis said everything but good riddance to bad rubbish and if hed read about or heard about kimmo thornes murder he made no mention of the fact but it was clear that the boy had done nothing to enhance the reputation of the market in regs eyes more than that as he had pointed out they would have to suss out from the local police they were on their way to do sowending their way through the market back to lynleys carwhen his mobile rang the message was terse its meaning unmistakable he was wanted immediately on shand street where a tunnel beneath the railway took the narrow little thoroughfare to crucifix lane they had another body lynley flipped off the phone and looked at havers crucifix lane he said do you know where it is a vendor at a nearby stall answered the question right up tower bridge road he told them less than half a mile from where they stood a railway viaduct shooting out from london bridge station comprised the north perimeter of crucifix lane bricks formed it so deeply stained with more than a century of soot and grime that whatever their original colour had been it was now a distant memory what remained in that memorys place was a bleak wall done up in variations of carbonaceous sediment into this structures supporting arches had been built various places of business lockups for hire warehouses wine cellars carrepair establishments but one of the arches created a tunnel through which ran a single lane that was shand street the north part of this street served as the address of several small businesses closed at this hour of the morning and the south part of itthe longer partcurved under the railway viaduct and disappeared into the darkness the tunnel here was some sixty yards long a place of deep shadows whose cavernous roof was bandaged with corrugated steel plates from which water dripped soundless against the consistent rumble of early morning trains heading into and out of london more water ran down the walls seeping from the rusty iron gutters at a height of eight feet collecting in greasy pools below the scent of urine made the tunnels air rank broken lights made its atmosphere chilling when lynley and havers arrived they found the tunnel completely sealed off at either end with a constable at the crucifix lane end whoclipboard in handwas restricting entrance he had apparently met his match in the early representatives of the news media however those hungry journalists who monitored every police stations patch in the hope of being first with a breaking story five of them had already assembled at the police barrier and they were shouting questions into the tunnel three photographers accompanied them creating strobelike lighting as they shot above and around the constable who was trying vainly to control them as lynley and havers showed their identification the first of the television news vans pulled up disgorging camera and soundmen onto the pavement as well a media officer was needed desperately serial killer lynley heard one of the journalists call out as he crossed the barrier with havers behind him kid adult male female hang on mate give us bloody something lynley ignored them havers muttered vultures and they moved in the direction of a lowslung paintless and abandoned sports car sitting midway through the tunnel here they learned the body had been discovered by a taxi driver on his way from bermondsey to heathrow from which he would spend the day driving transatlantic fares into london for an exorbitant price made more exorbitant by the perennial tailback on the east side of the hammersmith flyover that driver was long gone his statement taken in his place the soco team already worked and a di from the borough high street station waited for lynley and havers to join him he was called hogarth he said and his dci had given the word to make no moves till someone from scotland yard checked out the crime scene it was clear he wasnt happy about that lynley couldnt be troubled with unruffling the dis feathers if this was indeed another victim of their serial killer there would be far greater concerns than someones not liking having his patch invaded by new scotland yard he said to hogarth what have we got as he donned a pair of latex gloves handed over by one of the scenesofcrime officers black kid hogarth replied boy young twelve or thirteen hard to tell doesnt fit the mo of the serial you ask me dont know why you lot got a call lynley knew the victim was black hillier was covering his welltailored backside in advance of his next press briefing lets see him he said and he stepped past hogarth havers followed the body had been deposited unceremoniously in the abandoned car where the drivers seat had over time disintegrated down to metal frame and springs there with its legs splayed out and its head lolling to one side it joined coke bottles styrofoam cups carrier bags of rubbish mcdonalds takeaway containers and a single rubber glove that lay on what had once been the rim of the cars back window the boys eyes were open staring sightlessly at what remained of the cars rusted steering column short dreadlocks springing out of his head with smooth walnut skin and perfectly balanced features he had been quite lovely he was also naked hell havers murmured at lynleys side young lynley said he looks younger than the last christ barbara why in gods name he didnt finish letting the unanswerable go unasked he felt havers glance graze him she said with a prescience that came from working with him for years therere no guarantees no matter what you do or what you decide or how or with whom youre right he said there are never guarantees but hes still somebodys son all of them were that we cant forget it think hes one of ours lynley took a closer look at the boy and upon a first glance he found himself agreeing with hogarth while the victim was naked as had been kimmo thorne his body clearly had been dumped without ceremony and not laid out like all the others he had no piece of tatting as a modesty wrap on his genitalia and there was no distinguishing mark on his forehead both additional features of kimmo thornes body his abdomen did not appear to be incised but perhaps more important the position of the body itself suggested haste and a lack of planning that were uncharacteristic of the other murders as the soco team moved round him with their evidence bags and collection kits lynley made a closer inspection this proved to tell him a more complete tale he said have a look at this barbara as he gently lifted one of the boys hands the flesh was deeply burned and the marks of a restraint dug into the wrist there was much about any serial killing that was known only by its perpetrator held back by the police for the dual reason of protecting the victims families from unnecessarily heartbreaking knowledge and of winnowing out false confessions from the attention seekers who plagued any investigation in this particular case there was much that still remained police knowledge only and both the burns and the restraints were part of that knowledge havers said thats a pretty good indication of whats what isnt it it is lynley straightened up and glanced over to hogarth hes one of ours he said wheres the pathologist been and gone hogarth replied photographer and videographer as well weve just been waiting for you lot before we clear him out of here the rebuke was implied lynley ignored it he asked for the time of death for any witnesses for the taxi drivers statement pathologists given us a time of death between ten and midnight hogarth said no witnesses to anything so far as we can tell but thats not surprising is it not a place youd find anyone with brains after dark as for the taxi driver hogarth consulted an envelope that he took from his jacket pocket it evidently did duty as his notepad he read off the name of the driver his address and the number of his mobile phone hed had no fare with him the di added and the shand street tunnel was part of his regular route to work goes past between five and half past every morning hogarth told them said thiswith a nod at the abandoned carhas been here for months complained about it moren once he said banged on about how its asking for trouble when traffic division cant seem to get round to hogarths attention went from lynley to the crucifix lane end of the tunnel he frowned whos this you lot expecting a colleague lynley turned a figure was coming along the tunnel towards them backlit from the lights for the television cameras that were rolling in the street there was something familiar about the shape of him big and bulky with a slight stoop to the shoulders havers was saying cautiously sir isnt that when lynley himself realised who it was he drew in a breath so sharp that he felt its pressure beat within his eyes the interloper on the crime scene was hilliers profiler hamish robson and there could be only one way hed gained access to the tunnel lynley didnt hesitate before striding towards the man he took robson by the arm without preamble you need to leave at once he said i dont know how you managed to cross that barrier but youve no business here dr robson robson was clearly surprised by the greeting he glanced over his shoulder in the direction of the barrier through which hed just come he said i had a phone call from assistant ive no doubt of that but the assistant commissioner was out of order i want you to clear out immediately behind his glasses robsons eyes assessed lynley could feel the evaluation going on he could read the profilers conclusion as well subject experiencing understandable stress true enough lynley thought each time the serial killer struck the bar would be raised robson hadnt seen stress yet compared to what hed see if the killer snuffed out someone else before the police got to him robson said i cant pretend to know whats going on between you and ac hillier but now that im here i might be of use to you if i have a look ill keep my distance theres no risk ill contaminate your crime scene ill wear what you need me to wear gloves overalls cap whatever now im here use me i can help you if youll let me sir havers spoke lynley saw that from the opposite end of the tunnel a trolley had been wheeled the body bag upon it ready to be used a soco team member stood with paper bags prepared for the victims hands all that was required was a nod from lynley and part of the problem engendered by robsons presence would be taken care of there would be nothing for him to see havers said ready robson said quietly im already here forget how and why forget hillier altogether for gods sake use me the mans voice was as kind as it was insistent and lynley knew there was truth in what he said he could hold rigidly to the arrangement hed negotiated with hillier or he could use the moment and refuse to let it mean anything else than simply that seizing an opportunity in front of him one that presented a chance to have a bit more insight into the mind of a killer abruptly he said to the team members waiting to bag the body hang on for a moment and then to robson have a look then robson nodded murmured good man and approached the paintless car he went no closer than four feet from it and when he wanted to examine the hands he did not touch them but rather asked di hogarth to do it for his part hogarth shook his head in disbelief but cooperated having scotland yard there at all was bad enough having a civilian on the scene was unthinkable he lifted the hands with an expression that said the world had gone mad after several minutes of contemplation robson returned to lynleys side he said first what lynley and havers had themselves said so young god this cant be easy for any of you no matter what youve seen in your careers it isnt lynley said havers came to join them by the car the preparations began for transferring the body onto the trolley to remove it for postmortem examination robson said theres a change things are escalating now you can see hes treated the body completely differently no covering of the genitals no respectful positioning theres no regret at all no psychic restitution instead theres a real need to humiliate the boy legs spread out genitalia exposed seated with the rubbish deposited by vagrants his interaction with this boy prior to death was unlike his interactions with the others with them something occurred to stir him to regret with this boy that didnt happen rather its opposite did not regret then but pleasure and pride in the accomplishment as well hes confident now hes sure he wont be caught havers said how can he think that hes put this kid on a public street for gods sake thats just the point robson gestured to the far end of the tunnel where shand street opened up to the small businesses that lined it in a few dozen yards of south london redevelopment that took the form of modern brick buildings with decorative security gates in front of them hes placed the body where he could easily have been seen doing so couldnt you argue the same of the other locations lynley asked you could do but consider this in the other locations there was far less risk for him he could have used something no witness would question as he transported the body from his vehicle to the dump site a wheelbarrow for example a large duffel bag a street sweepers trolley anything that wouldnt seem out of place in that particular area all he had to do was get the body from his vehicle to the dump site itself and under cover of darkness using that reasonable means of transport hed be fairly safe but here hes out in the open the moment he puts the body into that derelict car and he didnt just dump it there superintendent it only looks dumped but make no mistake he arranged it and he was confident he wouldnt be caught at his work cocky bastard havers muttered yes hes proud of what hes been able to accomplish i expect hes somewhere nearby even now watching all the activity hes managed to provoke and enjoying every bit of it what dyou make of the missing incision the fact that he didnt mark the forehead can we conclude hes backing off now robson shook his head i expect the missing incision merely means that for him this killing was different to the others different in what way superintendent lynley it was hogarth whod been supervising the transfer of the body from the car to the trolley hed stopped the action prior to the body bag being zipped round the corpse you might want a look at this they went back to him he was gesturing to the boys midsection there what had been obscured before by the bodys slumped position in the seat was visible now that it was stretched on the trolley while the incision from sternum to navel had indeed not been made on this most recent victim the navel itself had been removed their killer had taken another souvenir that hed done so after death was evident in the lack of blood from the wound that hed done so in angeror possibly in hastewas evident in the slash across the stomach deep and uneven it provided access to the navel which a pair of secateurs or scissors had then removed souvenir lynley said psychopath robson added i suggest you post surveillance at all the previous crime scenes superintendent hes likely to return to any one of them chapter eight fu was careful with the reliquary he carried it before him like a priest with a chalice and set it down on a tabletop gently he removed the lid a vaguely putrescent odour wafted upward but he found that the smell did not bother him nearly as much as it had done at first the scent of decay would fade soon enough but the achievement would be there forever he looked down upon the relics satisfied there were two of them now nestling like shells in a rain cloud with the slightest of shakes the cloud subsumed them and that was the beauty of where hed placed them the relics were gone but still they were there like something hidden within the altar of a church in fact the activity of reverently moving the reliquary from one place to another was indeed just like being in a church but without the social restrictions that churchgoing always placed upon members of the congregation youll sit up straight youll stop the fidgeting dyou need a lesson in how to behave when youre told to kneel you do it boy put your palms together god damn it pray fu blinked the voice at once distant and present telling him a maggot had slunk into his head in through his ear and onward to his brain hed been less than careful and the thought of church had given it entry at last a snicker initially then an outright laugh then the echo of pray pray and pray and finally looking for a job are you where dyou expect to find one stupid git and you get out of the way charlene or do you want some of this for yourself it was yammer and yammer it was shout and shout it sometimes went on for hours at a time hed thought hed finally rid himself of the worm but thinking of church had been his mistake i want you out of this house you hear sleep in a doorway if thats what it takes or dont you have the bottle for that you drove her there blast you you did her in fu squeezed his eyes shut he reached out blindly his hands found an object and his fingers felt buttons he pushed them indiscriminately until sound roared forth he found himself staring at the television set where a picture came into focus as the voice of the maggot faded away it took him a moment to understand what he was looking at the morning news was assaulting his ears fu gazed at the screen things began to make sense a female reporter with windtousled hair stood in front of a police barricade behind her the black arch of the shand street tunnel gaped like the upper jaw of hades and deep within that pissscented cavern temporary lights illuminated the back end of the abandoned mazda fu relaxed into the sight of that car released and released it was he thought unfortunate that the barrier had been set up at the south end of the tunnel from this position the body could not be seen and hed taken such pains to make the message clear the boy doomed himself dont you see not to retribution from which there had never once been a realistic hope of escape but from release until the end the boy had both protested and denied fu had expected to wake from the night with a sense of disquiet born of the boys refusal to admit his shame true he hadnt felt any such sense at the moment of his death experiencing instead the momentary loosing of the vice that had his brain in its grasp tighter and tighter with each passing day but he had assumed hed feel it later on when clarity and personal honesty demanded that he evaluate his choice of subject yet upon waking he hadnt felt anything remotely like unease at all instead until the arrival of the maggot wellbeing had continued to suffuse him like the sense of repletion after a good meal not releasing any other information at the moment the reporter was saying earnestly we know theres a body weve heardand let me stress that weve only heard and it has not been confirmedthat its the body of a boy and weve been told that officers have arrived from the met police squad already investigating the last murder in st georges gardens but as to whether this latest killing is related to the earlier murderswere going to have to wait for word on that as she spoke several individuals came out of the tunnel behind her plainclothes cops by the look of them a dumpy woman with puddingbasin hair took some direction from a blond officer in an overcoat that had the look of old money about it she nodded once and headed out of sight whereupon the officer stood in conversation with a bloke in a mustard anorak and another with concave shoulders and a crumpled mac the reporter said ill just see if i can have a word and advanced as close to the barricade as she could get but every other reporter had the same idea and so much jostling and shouting ensued that no one got an answer to anything the cops ignored the lot of them but the telly cameraman zoomed in anyway fu got a good look at his adversaries the dumpy woman was gone but he had time to study overcoat anorak and crumpled mac he knew he was more than a match for them five and counting he murmured to the television dont touch that dial nearby he had a cup of tea that hed made upon waking and he saluted the television with it before he replaced it on a nearby table around him the house creaked as its pipes supplied the old radiators with water to heat the rooms and he heard in those creaks an announcement of the maggots imminent return look at this he would instruct as he pointed to the television where the police discussed him and his handiwork i leave the message and they must read every step of it planned in exquisite detail the stertorous breathing behind him then that eternal signal of the maggots presence not in his head now but here in this room whatre you doing boy fu didnt need to have even a look the shirt would be white as it always was but worn at both the collar and cuffs the trousers would be charcoal or brown the tie knotted perfectly and the cardigan buttoned hed have polished his shoes polished his specs and polished his round bald head as well the question again whatre you doing with the threat implicit in the tone fu made no reply since the answer was obvious he was watching the news and experiencing the unfolding of his personal history he was making his mark and wasnt that exactly what hed been instructed to do you best answer me when i speak to you i asked whatre you doing and i want a reply and then where the hell were you brought up get that teacup off the bloody wood you want to polish the furniture in your spare time since youve got so much of it whatre you thinking about anyway or are you out of practice in that department fu fixed his attention on the television he could wait him out he knew what came next because some things were written bran in warm milk soaked into slop a glass of fibre dissolved in juice those prayers sent heavenward for a quick movement of the bowels so he wouldnt have to experience said movement in a public place like the gents loo at school and if movement was achieved a triumphant notation on the calendar hanging inside the cupboard door r for regular when regular was the last thing a maggot could ever hope to be but something was different this morning fu could feel him charging a horseman directly from revelations saying where are they whatve you bloody donei told you to keep your filthy mitts off didnt i say didnt i expressly tell you you turn off that god damn telly and look at me when im talking to you he wanted the remote fu would not hand it over you defying me charlene you defying me what if he was fu thought what if she was what if they were what if he did what if everyone did amazingly he found himself unafraid wary nevermore utterly at ease even a bit amused the maggots power was nothing in comparison with his own now that hed finally taken it up and the beauty of it all was that the maggot had no idea who or what he was dealing with fu felt such a presence in his veins such capability such sureness and knowledge he rose from the chair and he allowed his body to come into its fullness undisguised he said i wanted and i took thats what it was then nothing nothing it was as if the maggot read fus power he sensed a sea change good on you fu said to him selfpreservation tended to gain you very high marks round here but the maggot couldnt leave it completely alone not when his way of simply being had long been so thoroughly ingrained in him so he watched fus every move and he waited eager for an indication that it was safe to speak fu went to put the kettle on to boil perhaps he thought he would have a whole bloody pot of tea and he would choose a blend possessing something of a vaguely celebratory air he studied the boxes of tea in the cupboard imperial gunpowder he thought too weak although he had to admit that he found the name attractive he settled on one that had been his mothers favourite lady grey with its hint of fruit and then what are you doing up before nine am the first time inhow long whenre you planning to do something useful thats what i really want to know fu looked up from spooning lady grey into the teapot no one knows he said not you not anyone thats what you think taking a slash in public but no one knows your name on the charge sheet three or four times and thats fine isnt it whos going to care and dont you touch charlene anyone touches the stupid cow its going to be me now they were in familiar territory the openpalm slapping so as not to leave a mark the grip on the hair and the head jerked back the shove into the wall and the kick in places where it wouldnt show punctured lung fu thought was that what it was saying you watch boy you learn from this fu felt the urge come upon him then his fingertips tingled and the muscles throughout his body made him ready to strike but no the time was not right when the day came though it was going to be such a pleasure to lower the pudgy soft neverknownhardwork hands to the pan to its burning surface his face hovering above the maggot and his lips hurling the curses this time he would beg like all the others but fu would not relent he would take him to the edge like the others and just like the others he would hurl him over see my power know my name detective constable barbara havers made her way over to borough police station and found it on the high street which in this part of town and at this time of morning was funneling commuters through its narrow canyon the noise level was intense and the cold air was heavy with diesel exhaust fumes these were doing their best to deposit even more grime upon the already grimy buildings that sat back from pavements littered with everything from beer cans to condoms limp with use it was that kind of neighbourhood barbara was beginning to feel the stress shed never worked on a serial killing before and while shed always known the sensation of urgency attendant on getting to a killer and making an arrest shed never actually experienced what she was experiencing now which was the feeling that she was somehow personally responsible for this latest murder five now with no one held to an accounting whatever else they werent working fast enough she was finding it difficult to keep her focus on kimmo thorne victim number four with number five dead and number six out there somewhere innocently going about his daily affairs it was all she could do to stay calm as she entered the borough high street station and flashed her identification she needed to speak to whoever had nabbed a kid called kimmo thorne in bermondsey market she told the special the matter was urgent she watched as he placed three telephone calls he spoke low keeping his eye upon her and no doubt evaluating her as a representative of new scotland yard she didnt look the partdisheveled and ill dressed with all the glamour of a wheelie binand this morning she knew she was particularly unkempt one did not rise before four am spend several hours in the grime of south london and still manage to swan about looking like the catwalk was in ones afternoon diary shed thought her red hightop trainers had added a cheerful touch to her ensemble but they seemed to be causing the special constable the most concern considering the disapproving looks he kept casting in their direction she paced over to a notice board and read about communityaction committees and neighbourhood watch programmes she considered adopting two sadlooking dogs whose pictures were posted and she memorised the phone number of someone willing to sell her the secrets of instant weight loss while allowing her to continue to eat whatever she wanted she went on to read all about taking the offensive when walking at night and was halfway through this when a door opened and a male voice said constable havers youre wanting me i believe she turned and saw a middleaged sikh in the doorway his turban blindingly white and his dark eyes deeply soulful he was called ds gill he told her would she accompany him to the canteen hed been having his breakfast and if she didnt mind his finishing itmushrooms on toast with baked beans he had become more english than the english he said she took a coffee and a chocolate croissant from the food on offer eschewing the wiser and decidedly more nutritious possibilities why indulge in a virtuous half grapefruit when she was soon to learn the secret of weight loss while continuing to eat whatever she wanted which was usually something laced with lard she paid for her goodies and carried them to the table where ds gill was once again tucking into the breakfast she had interrupted he told her that everyone at the borough high street station knew about kimmo thorne even if not everyone had met the boy kimmo had long been one of those individuals whose doings were never far from the police radar screen when his aunt and his gran had reported him missing no one at the station had been surprised although to have him turn up as a murder victim whose body was dumped in st georges gardensthat had shaken a few of the less hardened officers at the station making them wonder if they had done enough to try to keep kimmo on the straight and narrow you see we quite liked the boy here constable havers gill confided in his pleasant eastern voice my gracious he was a character kimmo always ready with the chat whatever his circumstances happened to be to be honest it was very difficult not to like him despite the crossdressing and soliciting although to be frank we never actually caught him in the act of soliciting no matter how we went about it that boy had such a sense for when someone was undercoverif i may say so he was streetwise beyond his years and for that reason we may have fallen derelict in our duty to apprehend him by a more advanced means which could in turn have saved him and for this i personallyhe touched his chestdo feel responsible his matea bloke called blinkerone charlie burovsays they worked it as a pair across the river out of leicester square and not round here kimmo did the deed while blinker kept watch that explains some of it gill noted some well you see he was not a stupid boy wed had him in for warnings we tried to tell him time and again that it was only luck that was keeping him out of trouble but he would not hear us kids barbara said she was trying to be delicate with her croissant but it was defying her attempts at social nicety dissolving into delicious flakes that she restrained herself from licking from her fingers not to mention from the table whatre you going to do about them anyway they think theyre immortal didnt you at that age gill shook his head i was far too hungry then to think immortality was in store for me constable hed finished his breakfast and folded his paper napkin neatly he placed his plate to one side and brought his cup of tea closer for kimmo it was more than a sense that he could not be hurt that he could not fall into danger by making the wrong choice he had to believe himself an astute judge of whom to go with and whom to refuse because he had plans and soliciting was a means to make them happen he could notand would notgive it up what sort of plans gill looked momentarily embarrassed as if against his will he were about to confide an offensive secret to a lady actually he wished to have a sexual change he was saving for that he told us the first time we had him into the station a bloke over in the market said you lot finally sent him down for selling stolen goods barbara said but what i dont get is why kimmo thorne theres got to be dozens over there flogging lumber theyve nicked this is true gill said but as you and i well know we do not have the manpower to sort through every stall in every market in london to ascertain which products are legitimately on offer and which are not in this particular case however kimmo was selling items thatwithout his knowledgehad all been engraved with infinitesimal serial numbers and the last thing he expected was to find the owners of the items seeking them out friday after friday in the market when they found him with their belongings for sale they rang us up directly i was called out and he raised his fingers the gesture said the rest is history youd never twigged before that that he was breaking and entering he was rather like a canine in that gill said he did not foul his own den when he wished to break the law he did so in another stations jurisdiction he was clever that way thus gill explained kimmos arrest for selling stolen property went down as his first offence because of that when he went in front of the magistrate he was put on probation this too the ds deeply regretted had kimmo thorne been taken seriously had he been given more than a slap on the hand and a probation officer in youth offenders to report to he might have changed his ways and still been walking the streets today but alas that had not happened instead hed been sent to an organisation for youth at risk and theyd tried to work with him barbaras ears pricked up organisation she asked what where it was a charity called colossus gill told her a fine project right here south of the river he said they offer young people alternatives to street life crime and drugs with recreational programmes community activities lifeskills classesand not just for youth at risk with the law but for the homeless for truants for those in carei admit to having relaxed my own vigilance on kimmos behalf when i knew he had been assigned to colossus surely i thought someone there would take him under a protective wing as a mentor barbara asked is that what they do thats what he needed gill said someone to take an interest in him someone to assist him towards seeing he had a degree of value that he did not quite believe he actually had someone to turn to someone to the ds seemed to bring himself up short perhaps realising hed gone from relaying information as an officer of the law to advocating action like a social militant he loosened the tight grip he had on his teacup small wonder that he was upset by the boys death barbara thought with his present mindset she wondered not only how long gill had been a cop but also how he managed to stay one facing what he had to face at work every day she said its not your fault you know you did what you could fact is you did more than most cops wouldve done but as things turned out i did not do enough and that is what i must live with now a boy is dead because detective sergeant gill could not bring himself to do enough but there are millions of kids like kimmo barbara protested and most of them are alive at this moment you cant help them all you cant save each one that is what we tell ourselves isnt it what else should we tell ourselves that saving all of them is not required of us what is required is helping the ones whom we come across and this constable i failed to do bloody hell dont be so hard on yourself who else he said is there to do so tell me that if you will because here is exactly what i believe if more of us were hard on ourselves more children would live lives all children deserve at this barbara dropped her gaze from his she knew she couldnt argue with that but the fact that she wanted to do so told her how close she herself was to caring too much and this she knew made her more like gill than she as part of the team investigating these crimes could afford to be that was the irony about police work care too little and more people died care too much and you couldnt catch their killer id like a word lynley said now he didnt add sir and he made no real effort to modulate his voice had he been present hamish robson no doubt would have taken note of everything his tone implied about aggression and the need to settle a score but lynley didnt care about that theyd negotiated an arrangement hillier hadnt upheld it the ac had just concluded a meeting with stephenson deacon the head of the press bureau had left hilliers office looking as grim as lynley felt things were obviously not going smoothly at that end of things and for a moment lynley took a perverse pleasure in this the thought of hillier eventually dangling in the wind of the press bureaus machinations before a pack of baying journalists was deeply gratifying just now hillier said as if he hadnt spoken where the hell is nkata weve a meeting with the media coming up and i want him here in advance he gathered up an array of papers spread out on his conference table and shoved them at an underling who was still seated there having attended the meeting that had gone on prior to lynleys arrival he was a razorthin twentysomething in john lennon spectacles who was continuing to take notes as he apparently tried to avoid becoming the focus of hilliers exasperation theyre on to colour the ac said curtly so who the hell over therehe jerked his finger in what lynley decided was supposed to be a southerly direction meaning south of the river meaning the shand street tunnelleaked that bit to those predators i want to know and i want that buggers head on a dish you powers the underling jumped to leaning in to say sir yes sir get that halfwit rodney aronson on the phone hes running the source these days and the colour question came in by phone from someone on that rotten little rag trace it back to us that way put pressure on aronson on anyone else you come across as well i want every leak plugged by the end of the day get on to it sir powers scooted from the room hillier went to his desk he picked up the phone and punched in a few numbers either oblivious of or indifferent to lynleys presence and his state of mind unbelievably he began to book himself a massage lynley felt as if battery acid were running through his veins he strode across the room to hilliers desk and he pushed the button to disconnect the ac from his phone call hillier snapped what the bloody hell do you think youre i said i want a word lynley cut in you and i had an arrangement and youve violated it do you know who youre talking to only too well you brought robson in as window dressing and i allowed it hilliers florid face went crimson no one bloody allows our agreement was that i would decide what he saw and what he didnt see he had no business at anyones crime scene but there he was given access theres only one way that sort of thing happens thats right hillier said keep it in mind theres only one way anything happens round here and you are not that way ill decide who has access to what when and how superintendent and if it comes to me that it might advance the investigation by having the queen turn up to shake hands with the corpse then prepare yourself to tug your forelock because her rollers going to drop her off for a look robsons part of the team cope with it lynley was incredulous one moment the assistant commissioner was frothing at the mouth about locating leaks within the investigation the next moment he was happily welcoming a potential snout right into their midst but the problem went beyond what hamish robson might deliberately or inadvertently reveal to the media he said had it occurred to you that youre putting this man at risk that youre exposing him to danger just for the hell of it youre making yourself look good at his expense and if anything goes wrong its down to the met have you thought of that youre so far out of order answer my question lynley said theres a killer out there whos taken five lives and for all we know he was standing behind the barrier this morning among the gawkers taking note of everyone who came and went youre being hysterical hillier said get out of this office ive no intention of listening to you rant like a common lout if you cant handle the pressure of this case then take yourself off it or ill do it for you now where the hell is nkata hes meant to be here when i talk to the press are you listening to me have you any idea lynley wanted to pound his fist on the top of the acs desk just to feel something beyond outrage for a moment he tried to calm himself he lowered his voice listen to me sir its one thing for a killer to mark one of us thats part of the risk we face when we take the job but to put someone in the sight lines of a psychopath just to protect your political backside thats enough hillier looked apoplectic thats bloody well enough ive put up with your insolence for years but youre so far out of order at this point he came round the desk stopping within three inches of lynley get out of this office he hissed get back to work for the moment were going to pretend this conversation never happened youre going to go about your business youre going to obey every order that comes in your direction youre going to get to the bottom of this mess and youre going to make a prompt arrest after thathere hillier poked lynleys chest and lynleys vision went red although he managed to restrain himself from reactingwell decide whats going to happen to you have i made myself clear yes good now get back to work and get a result lynley allowed the ac the last word although it felt like swallowing poison to do so he turned on his heel and left hillier to his political scheming he used the stairs to descend to the incident room cursing himself for thinking he could make a difference in hilliers way of doing business he needed to keep his focus on matters that counted he realised and the acs use of hamish robson was going to have to be eliminated from that list all the members of the murder squad were in the picture with regard to the shand street tunnel body and when lynley joined them it was to find them as subdued as he expected all counted they numbered thirtythree now from the constables on the street to the secretaries keeping track of all the reports and relevant documentation being defeated by a single individual when they had the power of the met behind themwith everything from sophisticated communications systems and cctv films to forensic labs and databaseswas more than disheartening it was humiliating and worse it had failed to stop a killer so they were much subdued when lynley entered the only noise among them was the tapping of computer keys that too ceased when lynley said quietly whats the form di john stewart spoke from one of his multicoloured outlines triangulating the crime scenes wasnt proving fruitful he said the killer was literally all over the london map this suggested a confident knowledge of the city which in turn suggested someone whose day job would give him that knowledge taxi driver comes to mind obviously stewart said minicab driver bus driver as well since not one body site is particularly far off a bus route either the profilers saying hes working a job below his ability lynley acknowledged although he was loath even to mention hamish robson after his contretemps with hillier courier works as well one of the dcs pointed out riding round on a motorbiked give you the knowledge as good as studying to drive a black cab even a bicycle someone else said but then where does the van come in personal transport he doesnt use it for his job what do we have on the van lynley asked who talked to the st georges gardens witness a team two constable spoke up careful massaging of the witness had initially gleaned nothing but shed phoned in late last night with a sudden memory which she said she hoped was a real memory and not a combination of imagination and her desire to help the police at any rate she felt she could say with confidence that it was a fullsize van they were looking for it had faded white lettering on the side suggesting it was or had once been a business van confirmation for the ford transit essentially stewart said were working with the dvla list looking for a red one that belongs to a business and lynley said takes time tommy we havent got time lynley heard the agitation in his voice and he knew the others heard it as well he was reminded at the worst possible moment that he wasnt malcolm webberly that he didnt possess the former superintendents calm nor his steady approach when under pressure he saw in the faces gathered round him that the other officers were thinking this as well he said more evenly move forward on that front john the moment youve got something ill want to know as to that stewart hadnt made eye contact at lynleys outburst instead making a notation that he underscored three times partway down his precise outline weve got two sources from the net for the ambergris oil only two its not your everyday purchase the two sources were in opposite directions a shop called crystal moon on gabriels wharf thats a southoftheriver location for us someone noted hopefully and a stall in camden lock market called wendys cloud someone would need to suss out each place barbara lives up in the camden lock area lynley said she can deal with that winston canwhere is he by the way hiding from dave the knave probably was the reply an irreverent reference to hillier hes started getting fan mail from the telly watchers has winnie all those lonely birds looking for a man with promise is he in the building no one knew get him on his mobile havers as well as he spoke barbara havers arrived winston nkata followed in her wake seconds later the others greeted them with tensiondiffusing hoots and ribald greetings that suggested their dual advent had a personal explanation behind it havers gave them two fingers sod you lot she said affably im surprised to find you outside of the canteen for his part nkata merely said sorry trying to track down a social worker for the salvatore boy success lynley asked sod all keep with it hilliers looking for you by the way nkata scowled he said got something on jared salvatore from peckham police he relayed all the information hed gathered while the others listened and made relevant notes girlfriend said he was learning to cook somewhere but the blokes at the station arent giving that credence he concluded have someone check the cookery schools lynley told di stewart stewart nodded and made a note lynley said havers what about kimmo thorne she said that everything theyd been told by blinker and then by the grabinskis and reg lewis in bermondsey market had checked out with the borough police she went on to add that kimmo thorne had evidently been involved in a programme called colossus which she called bunch of dogooders south of the river shed gone there to check out the place a renovated manufacturing plant not far from the knot of streets that merged at elephant and castle they werent open yet havers concluded the place was locked up tight but there were some kids hanging about waiting for someone to show up and let them in what did they give you lynley asked her not a bloody thing havers said i said you lot involved in this place and they twigged i was a copper that was that look into it then will do sir lynley filled them in then on what hamish robson had had to say about the latest killing he didnt tell them that the profiler had been sent to the scene by hillier there was no sense in getting them worked up about something over which they had no control thus he mentioned the killers change in attitude towards the most recent victim and the indications that he could reappear at any of the crime scenes hearing this di stewart set about arranging surveillance at the body sites before he went on to another report the officers whod been slogging through all of the relevant cctv tapes from the areas near the bodydump sites were continuing that tedious job it wasnt exactly gripping drama but the constables in question were soldiering on supported by vats of hot coffee they were looking not only for a van but for another means of transporting a body from point a to point b and one that wouldnt necessarily be noticed by people living in the vicinity milk float streetsweeping trolley and the like to this information he added that theyd had a report from so on the makeup worn by kimmo thorne the brand was no seven commonly sold at boots did the superintendent want them to start observing all the cctv films from the boots outlets nearest kimmo thornes home he didnt sound thrilled with this possibility still he pointed out that might give us something bloke at the till disapproving how the thorne kid was bent and wanting to do him in that sort of thing lynley didnt want to count anything out at this point so he gave the nod for stewart to assign a team to get on to the security tapes from the boots outlets in the vicinity of kimmo thornes southwark home he himself assigned the two outlets for oil of ambergris to nkata and to havers telling havers to look in on wendys cloud when she headed home at the end of the day in the meantime she would accompany him to elephant and castle he was determined to see himself what could be gained from a call upon colossus if one of the boys had been associated with it what was to say the rest of the victimsstill unidentifiedmight not have been allied with it as well couldnt this lastve been a copycat killing havers asked thats something we havent talked about yet i mean i know how robson explained the differences between this body and the others but those differences could be owing to someone knowing something about the crime scene but not everything right that couldnt be discounted lynley agreed but the truth was that copycat killings came from information generated by the news media and despite the fact that they had a leak somewhere in the investigation he knew that it was a recent one the press jumping on the fact that the latest body was black was evidence of that since there were far more sensational details to exploit on the front pages of the tabloids than that one and lynley knew how the media worked they werent about to withhold something gruesome if it had the potential to sell another two hundred thousand copies of their papers so indications were strong that they didnt have anything gruesome on record yet which suggested this killing wasnt a copy of the earlier ones but rather another death in a line of similar deaths all bearing the signature of a single killer that was the person they had to find quickly for lynley was perfectly capable of making the psychological jump implied by everything hamish robson had told him that morning about the man they were looking for if hed treated this last body with contempt and without remorse things were escalating now chapter nine nkata managed to depart victoria street without a runin with hillier hed had a message on his mobile from the acs secretary advising him of sir davids wish to confer prior to the next press briefing but he decided to ignore it hillier no more wanted to confer with him than he wanted to be exposed to the ebola virus and that was a fact one which nkata had been reading between the lines of his every meeting with the man he was tired of being hilliers token nodofhead to equal opportunities for minorities at the met he knew if he continued to play along with the propaganda he was going to end up despising his profession his associates and himself that wasnt fair on anyone so he escaped from new scotland yard directly upon the conclusion of the meeting in the incident room he used oil of ambergris as his excuse he made his way across the river to gabriels wharf an expensive square of riverfront tarmac which stood just beyond the midway point between two of the bridges that spanned the thames waterloo and blackfriars it was a summertime kind of place completely open to the air despite the cheery lights strung above it in crisscross fashionand lit even though it was still daylightin winter the wharf was experiencing little custom no one at all was doing business in the shop hiring out bicycles and inline skates and while there were a few browsers in the small ramshackle galleries that defined the wharfs boundaries the other enterprises were virtually deserted these comprised restaurants and food stalls which in summer would be hard pressed to keep up with the demand for the crepes pizzas sandwiches jacket potatoes and ices that were largely going ignored at present nkata found crystal moon lodged between two takeaways crepes on the left and sandwiches on the right it was part of the eastern portion of the wharf where shantylike shops and galleries backed right up to a line of tenements the upper floors of these had long ago been painted with trompe loeil windows each of a style so different from the last that the overall feeling was one of speeding round europe on foot georgian london windows gave way within four paces to rococo paris which in turn faded fast to the doges venice it was nothing if not fanciful in keeping with the wharf itself crystal moon maintained the whimsical atmosphere inviting one to enter through a beaded curtain fashioned to look like a galaxy dominated by a slice of lunar green cheese nkata ducked through this and opened the door beyond it expecting to be greeted inside by a pyramid wearing hippie hopeful who called herself something like aphrodite but whose real name was kylie from essex instead he found a grandmotherly type seated on a tall stool next to the till she was wearing a soft pink twin set and purple beads and she was leafing through a glossy magazine a stick of incense burning next to her spread the scent of jasmine into the air nkata nodded but did not immediately approach her rather he took stock of what was on offer crystals abounded as one might expect hanging from cords decorating small lamp shades worked into candleholders loose in small baskets but so did incense tarot cards dream catchers fragrant oils flutes recorders andfor some reason not immediately apparentdecorated chopsticks he went to the oils black man in the shop white woman alone at another time nkata might have set her mind at rest by introducing himself and proffering his identification today however with hillier and everything hillier stood for on his mind he just wasnt in the mood for adding to the peace of any white person old lady or not he did a little browsing anise benzoin klinden chamomile almond he picked up one read the label and noted the multitude of uses he replaced it and picked up another behind him the pages of the magazine continued to turn with no alteration in pace finally after stirring on her stool the proprietor of the shop spoke only it turned out she wasnt the proprietor at all which she revealed to nkata with an embarrassed little laugh as she offered to assist him i dont know how much help i can be she told him but im willing to try i just come in once a week for the afternoon you see while gigithats my granddaughterhas her singing lessons this is her little place what shes doing till shes broken into the businessisnt that how they say it may i be any help by the way looking for anything special whats all this for then nkata indicated the display of small bottles that contained the oils oh many things dear the old lady said she eased herself off the stool and came over to the display to stand beside him he towered over her but she didnt seem to be disconcerted to discover this she crossed her arms beneath her breasts said my goodness youve taken your vitamins havent you and went on amiably some of them have medicinal uses dear some are for magic some are for alchemy this is according to gigi naturally i dont actually know if theyre good for anything why dyou ask dyou need something special nkata reached for the bottle of ambergris oil what about this one she took it from him and said ambergrislets see shall we she carried the bottle back to the counter and from beneath it she brought forth a volume if she herself hadnt been what nkata expected to find inside a shop called crystal moon the enormous book she heaved to the counter was it looked like something from the prop room at elstree studios large leather bound with dogeared pages nkata expected moths to fly out when she opened it she seemed to read his mind because she laughed in an embarrassed fashion and said yes a bit silly i know but people expect this sort of thing dont they she flipped through some pages and began to read nkata joined her at the counter she started tuttutting shaking her head and fingering her beads what he asked its a bit unpleasant actually its associations i mean pointing to the page she went on to tell him that not only did some poor sweet whale have to die in order for people to get their hands on the oil but the substance itself was used in doing works of wrath or vengeance she frowned and looked up at him earnestly now i must ask forgive me please gigi would be appalled but there are some thingswhy would you be wanting the ambergris lovely man like you is it something to do with the scar dear its unfortunate you have it but if i might saywell it does give your face a certain distinction so if i might guide you in another direction she told him that a man like himself should think instead about calamint oil which would help keep women away because surely he was mobbed by them on a daily basis on the other hand bryony could be used in love potions if there was a special woman out there who had struck his fancy or agrimony which would banish negativity or eucalyptus for healing or sage for immortality there were so many choices with far more positive uses than the ambergris dear and if she could possibly do anything at all to guide him in a direction that would assist him in an outcome having positive repercussions in his life nkata realised it was time he brought out his identification he told her that ambergris oil had been associated with a murder murder her eyestheir blue faded with agewidened as one hand went to her chest my dear you dont thinkhas someone been poisoned because i dont believeit cant be possiblethe bottle would be marked in some wayi know thatit would have to be nkata hastened to reassure her no one had been poisoned and even if someone had the shop would only be responsible if the shop had administered the substance that wasnt the case was it of course not of course not she said but my dear when gigi hears about this shell be devastated to be even remotely connected to a murdershe is the most peaceable young woman truly if you could see her in here with her customers if you could hear the music she plays ive the cds right here and youre welcome to look through them see the god within spiritual journeys and there are others all about meditations and the like it was her mention of the word customers that nkata brought her back to he asked if the shop had sold any of the ambergris oil recently she told him that she didnt quite know they probably had done gigi did a respectable business even at this time of year but they had no records of individual purchases there were the credit card receipts of course so the police might go at things from that end otherwise there was only the notebook that customers signed if they wanted a copy of crystal moons newsletter would that help at all nkata doubted it but he accepted the offer and took it from the woman he gave her his card and told her that if she remembered anything at allor if gigi could add to what her grandmother knew yes yes of course anything at all and as a matter of fact heaven knows what help it might be dear but there is a list gigis been keeping her grandmother said its only postal codes shes been keen to open crystal moon two on the other side of the rivernotting hilland shes been keeping the postal codes of her customers to buoy her case for a loan from the bank would that help at all nkata didnt see how but he was willing to take the list anyway he thanked gigis gran and started to leave but found himself pausing in spite of himself in front of the display of oils once again is there anything else then gigis gran asked he had to admit to himself that there was he said which one d you say banishes negativity that was the agrimony dear he scooped up a bottle and carried it to the counter thisll do then he said elephant and castle existed as a place apparently oblivious of the other londons that had over the years developed and died around it the swinging london of miniskirts vinyl boots the kings road and carnaby street had decades ago passed it by the catwalks of fashion week london had never been laid anywhere near its environs and while the london eye the millennium footbridge and the tate modern all stood as examples of the dawn of a brand new century in town elephant and castle remained locked in the past true the area was struggling to be redeveloped as were many places south of the river but its struggle was one against the odds and the odds comprised drug users and suppliers doing business on the streets as well as poverty ignorance and despair it was into this milieu that its founders had set colossus taking what had been a derelict structure designed for the manufacture of mattresses and modestly renovating the place to serve the community in an entirely different way barbara havers directed lynley to the spot on new kent road where a small carpark behind the jaundiced brick structure offered a place for participants in colossus to have a smoke a crowd of them stood round doing just that as lynley guided his car into one of the parking bays as he put on the brake and shut down the engine havers pointed out that a bentley was perhaps not the best choice of transport to be bringing into the neighbourhood lynley couldnt disagree he hadnt quite thought things through when in the underground carpark on victoria street havers had said why dont we take my motor sir at that moment hed just wanted to assert some control over things and one part of getting that control was putting distance between himself and any edifice that happened to shelter the assistant commissioner of police another part had been making the decision about how that distance was going to be effected but now he saw that havers had been right it wasnt so much that they put themselves at risk driving a posh car into this kind of place it was more that they made a statement about themselves which didnt need making on the other hand he told himself at least they werent announcing the fact that they were coppers to all and sundry but he was disabused of that notion the moment he stepped out of the bentley and locked it behind him the filth someone muttered and this caution passed quickly throughout the smokers until all conversation had died among them so much for the value of vehicular incognito lynley thought as if hed spoken havers replied in a low voice its me sir not you theyve got rozzer radar this lot they knew who i was straightaway when they saw me earlier she glanced his way but you cn act like my driver if you want we still might be able to pull the wool lets start with a fag you cn light it for me lynley shot her a look she grinned just a thought they made their way through the silent group to a flight of iron stairs that climbed the back of the building on the first floor a broad green door bore colossus inscribed on a small plaque of polished brass a window set high above this showed a bank of lights along a corridor within lynley and havers entered and found themselves in a combination gallery and modest gift shop the gallery constituted a pictorial history of the organisation its founding its development of the site that housed it and its impact on the inhabitants of the area the gift shopwhich was essentially a single display case of reasonably priced itemsoffered tshirts sweatshirts caps coffee mugs shot glasses and stationery all with identical logos these consisted of the organisations mythological namesake surmounted by dozens of tiny figures who used his massive arms and shoulders as a means to cross from destitution to achievement beneath the giant was the word together forming a half circle that was completed by colossus which created the other half above him within this case also was a signed photograph of the duke and duchess of kent lending their royal patronage to some event connected with colossus this apparently was not for sale on the far side of the display case a door led into the reception room there lynley and havers found themselves being immediately eyed by three individuals who fell into silence the moment they approached two of the threea slender youngish man in a eurodisney baseball cap and a mixedrace boy perhaps fourteen years oldwere playing cards at a low table between two sofas the thirda large young man with neat ginger hair and a wispy beard nicely trimmed but still barely covering pockmarked cheekssat behind the reception desk a turquoise cross dangling from one earlobe he wore one of the colossus sweatshirts and at the otherwise spotless desk hed apparently been making notations in blue pencil upon a calendar while soft jazz came from speakers positioned above him he did not look friendly once his glance took in havers next to him lynley heard the dc sigh i need a bloody makeover she muttered you might want to lose the shoes he suggested help you the young man asked from beneath the desk he brought forth a bright yellow bag with mr sandwich printed on it from this he took a sausage roll and crisps and he set about eating without further ado cops his actions telegraphed to them would not get in the way of his daily routine although it appeared to be entirely unnecessary lynley produced his id for the gingerhaired young man ignoring the two others for the moment a plastic nameplate at the desks edge indicated he was introducing himself and havers to one jack veness who seemed to be deeply unimpressed that the two rozzers standing before him were representing new scotland yard giving a glance to the cardplayers as if for approval veness simply waited for more to be said he chewed his sausage roll dipped into his crisps and glanced at the wall clock above the door or perhaps it was to the door itself that he looked lynley thought through which mr veness might be waiting for rescue he seemed all right superficially but there was an air of unease about him they were there to speak to the director of colossus lynley told jack veness or for that matter to anyone else who could talk to them about one of their clientsif that was the proper term he added kimmo thorne the name had just about the same effect as a stranger walking into a barroom in an oldtime american western in other circumstances lynley might have been amused the two cardplayers ceased their game altogether setting their cards on the table and making no secret of the fact that they intended to listen to everything that was said from that moment on while jack veness ceased chewing his sausage roll he set it on its mr sandwich bag and pushed his chair away from his desk lynley thought he intended to fetch someone for them but instead he went to a water cooler there he filled a colossus mug from the hot spigot provided after which he grabbed a tea bag and gave it a few douses inside next to lynley havers rolled her eyes she said scuse us mate your hearing aid just blow a fuse or something veness returned and put his mug on the desk i cn hear you lot fine im just trying to decide if its worth giving you an answer across the room eurodisney gave a low whistle his companion ducked his head veness looked pleased that hed managed to obtain their approval lynley decided this was enough you can make that decision in an interview room if you like he said to veness to which havers added were happy to oblige here to serve and all that you know veness sat he wadded a hunk of sausage roll into his mouth and said past it everyone knows everyone else at colossus thorne included thats how it works thats why it works that goes for you as well i take it lynley said regarding kimmo thorne you take it right veness agreed what about you two havers asked the cardplayers did you know kimmo thorne as well she took out her notebook as she asked the questions whatre your names by the way eurodisney looked startled to be suddenly questioned at all but he said cooperatively that he was called robbie kilfoyle he added that he didnt actually work at colossus like jack but merely volunteered several days each week this being one of those days for his part the boy identified himself as mark connor he said he was in day four of assessment that makes him new round here veness explained so he wont have known kimmo kilfoyle added but you did know him havers asked kilfoyle even though you dont work here hey you know he didnt say that veness said you his brief havers retorted no then i expect he can answer for himself and again to kilfoyle did you know kimmo thorne where do you work unaccountably veness persisted drop it he brings in the bloody sandwiches all right kilfoyle scowled perhaps offended by the dismissive tone he said like i said already i volunteer on the phones in the kichen i work in the kit room when things pile up so i saw kimmo round i knew him didnt everyone veness said and speaking of whichtheres a group going out on the river this afternoon dyou have time to handle that rob he gave kilfoyle a long look as if some sort of double message were being sent i cn help you rob mark connor offered sure kilfoyle said and to jack veness you want me to set things up now or what now would be brilliant well then kilfoyle gathered up the cards and accompanied by mark he headed for an interior door unlike the others he wore a windbreaker rather than a sweatshirt and instead of colossus written on it it bore a logo of a stuffed baguette with arms and legs and the words mr sandwich below it the departure of these two effected a complete change in jack veness for some reason as if an unseen switch had been suddenly turned offor onin him the young man altered on the head of a pin he said to lynley and havers right then sorry i can be a real streak of piss when i want yknow i wanted to be a cop but i couldnt make it its easier to blame you than to look at myself and work out why i didnt cut it he snapped his fingers offered a smile hows that for instant psychoanalysis five years of therapy and the man is cured the change in veness was disconcerting like discovering two personalities inside one body it was impossible not to wonder if the presence of kilfoyle and connor had had something to do with who hed portrayed himself to be earlier but lynley went with the change in the man and brought up kimmo thorne again next to him havers flipped open her notebook the newly minted jack veness didnt quiver an eyelash he told them frankly that he knew kimmo and had known him from the time of kimmos assignment to colossus he after all was the organisations receptionist everyone who came who went and who remained was someone he quickly got to know he made it his business to know he emphasised it was he told them part of his job to know why was this lynley asked because veness said you never knew did you knew what exactly havers put in what you were dealing with that lot with this veness indicated the young people smoking outside in the carpark they come from everything dont they the streets care youth offenders drug rehab gangs turning tricks running weapons selling drugs doesnt make sense to trust them till they give me a reason to trust them so i keep an eye out did this apply to kimmo as well lynley asked applies to everyone veness said winners and losers alike havers took up the ball at that remark she said hows that apply to kimmo he get on your bad side some way not mine he said someone elses then veness contemplatively fingered his sausage roll if theres something we should know lynley began he was a tosser veness said a loser look it happens sometimes kids got something here alls thats needed is climbing aboard but sometimes they just stop comingeven kimmo whos supposed to show up or hell be back in borstal in a winkand i cant get my brain round that see youd think hed grab on to anything thatd help him out of that one but he didnt did he he just stopped showing up when did he stop jack veness thought for a moment he took a spiral book from the middle drawer of his desk and examined the signatures that crawled down a dozen or more pages it was lynley saw a signingin register and when veness replied to lynleys question the date he gave for kimmos final appearance at colossus matched up with his murder within fortyeight hours dumb fuck veness said shoving the signingin book to one side didnt know when he was well off trouble is kids cant wait for the payoff can they some kids mind you not all of them they want the result but not the process that leads to the result i expect hes quit like i said that happens he was murdered actually lynley said thats why he stopped coming but youd worked that out hadnt you havers added else why would you be talking about him in the past tense from the start and why else would the rozzers be dropping in on you and twice in one day because one of that lotas veness himself had done she indicated the group who were gathered outsidemustve told someone in here that i stopped by earlier before you opened up veness shook his head vehemently i didntno no i didnt know he shot his gaze over to a doorway and a corridor off which brightly lit rooms opened he appeared to think something over for a moment before he said that kid over in st pancras in the gardens bingo havers said youre definitely no dummy when youre breathing jack that was kimmo thorne lynley added his is one of five deaths were investigating five hey now wait you cant be thinking colossus were not drawing any conclusions lynley said hell sorry then about what i said tosser and loser hell veness picked up his sausage roll then put it back down he wrapped it up and returned it to its takeaway bag he said some kids just drop out see they have a chance but they still walk away they go for what looks like the easy route its frustrating as hell to watch he blew out a breath but damn im sorry was it in the papers i dont read em much and not his name at first lynley said just the fact of his body being found in st georges gardens he didnt add that chances were good to excellent that the papers were going to become full of the serial killings now names places and dates as well a young white victim had piqued the tabloids interest this mornings young black victim gave them the opportunity they needed to cover their own backsides mixed race cheap news of little interest theyd decided about the earlier killings all that had changed with kimmo thorne and now with the black boythe tabloids were going to grab on to the opportunity to make up for lost time and overlooked responsibility the death of a boy associated with colossus brings up a number of questions lynley pointed out to jack veness as you can no doubt imagine and weve identified another boy who might be associated with colossus as well jared salvatore sound familiar salvatore salvatore veness mumbled the name no i dont think so id remember then well need to speak to your director yeah yeah yeah veness surged to his feet youll want to talk to ulrike she runs the whole operation hang on then ill see that said he shot off through the doorway that led to the interior of the building he turned a corner and quickly disappeared lynley looked at havers now that was interesting she agreed we dont even have to look for still waters in that bloke i got that impression as well so i spose the question is how deepre things really running with him havers asked lynley reached across the desk and snagged the signingin book that jack had been using he handed it to havers salvatore she said its a thought he replied chapter ten in very short order lynley and havers discovered that not only was the director of colossus also in the dark about kimmo thornes death but additionally for some reason jack veness had not put her in the picture with regard to the matter when he went to find her evidently he had told her only that two cops from new scotland yard wanted to see her it was an intriguing omission ulrike ellis turned out to be a pleasantlooking young woman in the vicinity of thirty with sandy cornrow plaits gathered back from her face and enough brass bangles on her wrists to qualify her as the prisoner of zenda she wore a heavy black turtleneck blue jeans and boots and she came to reception herself to fetch lynley and havers to her office as jack veness resumed his place behind the reception desk ulrike led the way down a corridor on the walls of which bulletin boards held neighbourhood announcements photographs of young people classes on offer and schedules of colossus events once in her office she scooped a small stack of the big issue off a chair in front of her desk and shoved the magazines onto a space on a bookshelf crowded with volumes and with files needing replacement in a cabinet this standing near her desk already overflowed with other files she said i keep buying these in reference to copies of the big issue and then i never get a chance to read them take a few if you like or do you buy them yourselves she glanced over her shoulder and added ah well everyone ought you know oh i know what people think if i buy one this unwashed sodll go off and spend the profit on drugs or booze wont he and how will that be of help to him but what i say is that people might want to stop assuming the worst and start pitching in to make a difference in this country she looked round the office as if seeking other employment and said well that didnt much help did it one of you still has to stand or shall we all stand is that better tell me this is to finally going to take notice of us actually lynley told her as barbara havers wandered to the bookshelf to have a look at ulrike elliss many volumes he and dc havers were not there representing community affairs rather theyd come to talk to the director of colossus about kimmo thorne did ms ellis know the boy ulrike sat behind her desk lynley took the chair havers remained at the volumes reaching for one of several framed photographs that stood among them ulrike said has kimmo done something see here were not responsible for the kids staying out of trouble we dont even claim to be able to do that colossus is about showing them alternatives but sometimes they still choose the wrong ones kimmos dead lynley said you may have read about the body that was found in st georges gardens up in st pancras hes been identified in the press by now ulrike said nothing in reply at first she merely stared at lynley for a good five seconds before her glance went to havers still in possession of one of her photographs she said put that down please in the calmest possible voice she loosed her plaits from their binding and refastened them tightly before she said more then it was merely i phonedi did phone the moment i was told so you knew he was dead havers put the photograph back in place but facing outward so lynley could see it a very young ulrike an older man in ministers garb who might have been her father and between them the brightly clad figure of nelson mandela ulrike said no no i didnt meanwhen kimmo failed to come to day five of his assessment course griff strong reported him as he was meant to do i phoned kimmos probation officer straightaway thats how we do it if one of our kids is ordered here by the magistrate or by social services griff strong is a social worker trained as a social worker i mean were not social workers per se at colossus griff leads one of our assessment courses he does extremely well with the kids very few of them drop out once theyve had griff lynley saw havers take down this information he said is griff strong here as well today if he knew kimmo were going to want to speak to him to griff ulrike looked at her phone for some reason as if this would give her the answer no no hes not in hes bringing in a delivery she seemed to feel the need to toss her plaits into a more comfortable position he said hed be late today so were not expecting him untilyou see he does our tshirts and sweatshirts a sideline of his you may have seen them outside reception in the glass case hes an excellent social worker were very lucky to have him lynley felt havers looking his way he knew what she was thinking more depths to plumb here he said weve another dead boy as well jared salvatore was he also one of yours another there are five deaths were investigating in all ms ellis havers added do you read the newspapers by any chance does anyone round here if it comes to that ulrike looked at her i hardly think that questions fair which one havers said but she didnt wait for an answer this is a serial killer were talking about hes going after boys round the age of those youve got standing in your carpark smoking fags one of them could be next so pardon my manners but i dont care what you think is fair in other circumstances lynley would have reined the constable in at this point but he could see that havers demonstration of impatience had had a positive effect ulrike got to her feet and went over to the filing cabinet she squatted and jerked out one of the crammed drawers which she fingered through rapidly she said of course i readi look at the guardian every day or as often as i can but not recently right havers said why is that ulrike didnt reply she continued going through her files she finally slammed the drawer closed and rose empty handed she said there is no salvatore among our kids i hope that satisfies you and now let me ask you something in turn who sent you to colossus in the first place who lynley asked what do you mean oh come on we have enemies any organisation like thistrying to make the slightest degree of change in this bloody backward countrydo you honestly think there arent people out there who want us to fail who put you on to colossus police work put us on to colossus lynley said the borough high street station to be specific havers added you actually want me to believeyouve come here because you think kimmos death has something to do with colossus havent you well you wouldnt even be thinking that if it hadnt been suggested by someone outside these walls be that someone from borough high street station or someone from kimmos life like blinker lynley thought except kimmos studfaced mate hadnt once mentioned colossus if he even had known about it he said tell us what happens in the assessment course ulrike went back to her desk for a moment she stood there looking down at her phone as if waiting for a prearranged deliverance beyond her havers had moved to a wall of degrees certificates and commendations where shed been jotting down salient details from the objects on display ulrike watched her she said quietly we care about these kids we want to make a difference for them we believe that the only way to do that is through connection one life to one life is that the assessment then lynley asked the attempt to connect with the young people who come here it was that and far more than that she told them it was the young peoples first experience with colossus a fortnight in which they met daily in a group of ten other young people with an assessment leader griffin strong in kimmos case the object was to engage their interest to prove to them that they could achieve success in one area or another to establish in them a sense of trust and to encourage them to commit to taking part in the colossus programme they began with developing a personal code of conduct for the group and each day they assessed what had gone onand been learnedthe day before icebreaking games at first ulrike said then trust activities then a personal challenge like climbing the rock wall out the back then a trip which they plan and take together somewhere into the countryside or to the sea hiking in the pennines something like that at the end we invite them back for classes computers cookery single living health from learning to earning jobs you mean havers asked they arent ready for jobs not when they first get here most of them are monosyllabic if not completely nonverbal theyre beaten down what we try to do is show them theres another way from what theyve been doing in the streets theres returning to school learning to read completing college walking away from drugs theres having a belief in their future theres managing their feelings theres having feelings in the first place theres developing a sense of selfesteem she looked sharply at them both as if trying to read them oh i know what youre thinking such touchyfeely crap the ultimate in psychobabble but the truth is that if behaviour is going to change its going to do it from the inside out no one chooses a different path till he feels differently about himself that was the plan for kimmo lynley asked from what weve learned he seemed to feel fairly good about himself already despite the choices he made no one making kimmos choices feels good about himself at heart superintendent so you expected him to change through time and exposure to colossus we have she said a high level of success despite what youre obviously thinking about us despite our not knowing kimmo was murdered we did what we were meant to do when he failed to show up as you said lynley agreed and what do you do about the others the others does everyone come to you via youth offenders not at all most of them come because theyve heard about us in another way entirely through church or school through someone already involved in the programme if they stay its because they begin to trust us and they start to believe in themselves what happens with those who dont havers asked dont what start to believe in themselves obviously this programme doesnt work for them all how can it were up against everything in their backgrounds from abuse to xenophobia sometimes a kid cant cope here any better than he can cope anywhere else so he dips in and then out and thats how it is we dont force anyone to stay who isnt required to by a court order as for the rest as long as they obey the rules we dont force them to leave either they can be here for years if they like and are they occasionally yes like who im afraid thats confidential ulrike it was jack veness hed come to the doorway of ulrikes office quiet as the fog phone i tried to tell him you were busy but he wasnt having it sorry what dyou want me he raised his shoulders as a way of completing the question who is it then reverend savidge hes in a state says sean laverys gone missing says he didnt turn up at home last night when he was due back from the computer course should i no ulrike said put him through jack jack left her office she closed her fingers into a fist she didnt look up as she waited for the phone to ring there was another body this morning ms ellis lynley said then ill put him on the speakerphone she replied please god this has nothing to do with us while she waited for the phone call to ring through she told them that the caller was the foster parent of one of the boys in their programme he was called sean lavery and he was black she looked at lynley the question hanging unasked between them he merely nodded confirming her unspoken fears about the body found that morning in the shand street tunnel when the phone rang ulrike punched the button for the speaker reverend savidges voice came through deep and anxious where was sean he wanted to know why hadnt sean returned from colossus last night ulrike told him what little she knew as far as she understood reverend savidges foster son sean lavery had been at colossus as usual on the previous day and had left as usual on his regular bus shed heard nothing contrary to that from his computer instructor and his instructor hadnt reported him as absent which he definitely would have done because sean had come to them via a social worker and colossus always kept in touch where the hell was he then reverend savidge demanded there were boys going missing all over london was ulrike ellis aware of that or did it not count to her if the boy in question happened to be black ulrike assured him that shed speak with the computer instructor the first chance she had but in the meantimehad reverend savidge phoned round to see if sean had perhaps gone home with a friend or gone to his dads or gone to see his mum she was still in holloway wasnt she which wasnt a particularly difficult trip for a boy seans age to make sometimes boys do just go off for a bit shed said to savidge he said not this boy madam and he rang off abruptly ulrike said oh lord and lynley knew it was a prayer he said one himself reverend savidges next call lynley reckoned was going to be to his local police only one of the two detectives left the building after the phone call from reverend savidge the otherthe unattractive woman with the chipped front teeth and the ridiculous red hightop trainersremained behind the man detective superintendent lynley was going to head up to south hampstead to talk to sean laverys foster father his subordinate detective constable barbara havers was going to hang round as long as it was necessary to have a word with griffin strong ulrike ellis processed all this in a matter of seconds once the cops had finished with her lynley asked for bram savidges address havers asked could she have a wander round the premises the better to manage a word here and there ulrike knew she could hardly say no things were bad enough without her being anything less than cooperative so she agreed to the constables request for no matter what had happened beyond the walls of this place colossus and what colossus represented were larger than the life of one boy or a dozen boys but even as she reassured herself that colossus would emerge unscathed from this setback ulrike worried about griff he should have shown up at least two hours ago no matter what shed told the cops about the putative delivery of tshirts and sweatshirts the fact that he hadnt there was nothing to do but phone him on his mobile and warn him what to expect when he arrived she wouldnt be blatant about it however she didnt trust the security of mobile phones instead she would tell him to meet her at the charlie chaplin pub or in the shopping centre up on the corner or at one of the market stalls just outside or even in the subway that led to the underground station because what did it matter when what was important was simply that they meet so she could warn himof what she asked herself and why her chest was hurting it had been hurting for days but it had suddenly become worse did one have heart attacks at thirty years old when shed squatted in front of the filing drawer shed experienced a combination of lightheadedness and increased chest pain that nearly overcame her shed thought she would swoon god swoon where had that word come from ulrike told herself to stop it she picked up the phone and dialed for an outside line when she had it she tapped in the number of griff strongs mobile shed interrupt him doing whatever he was doing but that couldnt be helped griff said yes on the other end he sounded impatient and what was that about he worked at colossus she was his boss deal with it griff she said where are you he said ulrike in a voice whose tone was a message in itself but the fact hed used her name told her he was in a place of safety she said the police have been i cant say more we need to meet before you get here police his previous impatience was gone ulrike could hear the fear that replaced it she herself felt a corresponding frisson she said two detectives one of them is still in the building shes waiting for you for me shall i no you must come in if you dontlook lets not have this conversation on a mobile how soon can you meet atsay at charlie chaplin and then because it was more than reasonable where are you so she could determine how long it would take him to get there even the thought of the police at colossus didnt put griffin off his stride however he said fifteen minutes not at home then but shed deduced that much when hed said her name she knew she wouldnt get anything more from him charlie chaplin then she said fifteen minutes she rang off what remained was the waiting that and wondering what the constable was doing as she had her ostensible look round the premises ulrike had determined in a flash that it benefitted colossus for the dc to have this look unattended allowing her to wander freely sent a message about colossus having nothing to hide but lord lord her chest was pounding her cornrow plaits were far too tight she knew if she pulled on one of them the whole lot would detach from her scalp rendering her bald what did they call it stress causing ones hair to fall out alopecia that was it was there something called spontaneous alopecia probably shed be afflicted with that next she got up from her desk from a rack next to the door she plucked her coat her scarf and her hat she slung these over her arm and left her office she ducked down the corridor and slid into the loo there she prepared she wore no makeup so there was nothing to check save the condition of her skin which she blotted with toilet tissue her cheeks bore the faint pockmarks of an adolescence given over to outbreaks of acne but she felt it was an overt mark of selfabsorption to use some sort of foundation to cover them that smacked of a lack of selfacceptance and sent the wrong message to the board of trustees whod hired her for the strength of her character which was what she was going to need if colossus was to get through this bad period strength plans had long been laid for the organisations expansion to a second locationthis one in north londonand the last thing the development committee needed over at the administration and fundraising offices was the news that colossus was being mentioned in the same sentence as a murder investigation that would bring expansion to a screeching halt and they needed to expand the urgency was everywhere kids in care kids on the street kids selling their bodies kids dying from drugs colossus had the answer for them so colossus had to be able to grow the entire situation they were in at the moment had to be dealt with expeditiously she had no lipstick but she did carry gloss she rooted this out of her bag and smoothed it across her lips she adjusted the neck of her sweater a bit higher and shrugged on her coat she put on the hat and the scarf and decided she looked enough like a supervisor to get through the meeting with griffin strong without being accused of personifying carpe diem in the worst possible way this was about colossus she reminded herself and would remind griff when she finally saw him everything else was secondary barbara havers wasnt about to cool her heels in her wait for griffin strong instead after she told ulrike ellis that shed poke round a bit if no one minds she left the directors office to do so before ulrike could assign her a watchdog she then had a proper wander round the building which was filling up with colossus participants newly returned from late lunch from cigarettes in the carpark or from whatever dubious else theyd been doing she watched them drift off to various activities some went to a computer room some to a large educational kitchen some to small classrooms some to a conference room where they sat in a circle and talked earnestly overseen by an adult who documented their ideas or concerns on a flip chart the adults in question barbara took close note of she would need to get the name of each one each ones pastnot to mention his presentwould have to be checked out just because grunt work all of it but it had to be done she got aggro from no one as she had her wander most everyone simply and in some cases studiously ignored her eventually she made her way into the computer room where a mixed bag of adolescents appeared to be working on web designs and a tubby male instructor round barbaras own age was guiding an asian youth through the use of a scanner when he said you try it this time and stepped away he saw barbara and came over to her help you he said quietly he kept it friendly enough but there was no disguising the fact that he knew who she was and what she was there for the news was apparently traveling at a jackrabbit pace grass doesnt grow here does it barbara said whos spreading the word that bloke jack in reception it would be part of his job the man replied he introduced himself as neil greenham and he offered his hand to shake it was soft feminine and a little too warm he went on to say that jacks information had been largely unnecessary i would have known you were a cop anyway personal experience clairvoyance my fashion sense youre famous well relatively as these things go greenham went to a teachers desk in one corner of the room from there he took a folded newspaper he returned to her and handed it over i picked up the latest evening standard on my way back from lunch like i said youre famous curiously barbara unfolded it there on the front page the headline shrieked the news of the early morning discovery in the shand street tunnel beneath it were two photographs one was a grainy picture of the tunnels interior in which several figures round a sports car were silhouetted by the stark portable lights brought in by the soco team the other was a fine clear shot of barbara herself along with lynley hamish robson and the local di as they spoke outside the tunnel and in view of the press only lynley was identified by name there was barbara thought little blessing in that she handed the paper back to greenham dc havers she said new scotland yard he nodded at the paper dont you want that for your scrapbook ill buy three dozen on my way home tonight could we have a word he gestured to the classroom and the young people at work im in the middle of something can it wait they look like theyre coping without you greenham ran his gaze over them as if checking for the truth of this statement he gave a nod then and indicated they could speak in the corridor one of yours is gone missing barbara told him have you heard that yet has ulrike told you greenhams eyes shifted from barbara to the corridor he looked in the direction of ulrike elliss office here barbara thought was a piece of news that apparently hadnt traveled on the jackrabbit express and that was curious considering ulrikes telephone promise to reverend savidge to talk to the computer instructor about the newly missing boy greenham said sean lavery bingo he just hasnt come in yet today arent you meant to report him at the end of the day yes he could merely be late as the evening standards pointing out a dead boy was found in the london bridge area round half past five this morning sean we dont know yet but if it is thats two kimmo thorne as well the same killer you mean serial ah someone does read the newspapers round here i was getting a little curious about that why no one seemed to know kimmos dead you knew but you didnt talk about it with any of the others greenham shifted weight from one leg onto the other he said sounding not too comfortable about the admission theres a bit of a divide ulrike and the assessment people on one side the rest of us on the other and kimmo was still at the assessment level right yet you knew him greenham wasnt about to be caught by the undercurrent of accusation in the remark he said i knew who he was but who wouldnt have known who kimmo was crossdresser eye shadow lipstick he was hard to miss and harder to forget if you know what i mean so it wasnt only me everyone knew kimmo five minutes after he walked through the door and this other kid sean loner a bit hostile didnt want to be here but he was willing to give computers a try in time i think we couldve got through past tense barbara said greenhams upper lip looked damp that body we dont know who it is i suppose i assumedwith you here and all not a good idea assuming barbara took out her notebook she saw the look of alarm pass across greenhams pudgy face she said tell me about yourself mr greenham he recovered quickly address education background hobbies do i kill adolescent boys in my spare time start with how you fit in the hierarchy round here there is no hierarchy you said there was a divide ulrike and assessment on one side everyone else on the other how did that come about he said you misunderstand the divide has to do with information and how its shared thats all otherwise were all on the same page at colossus were about saving kids thats what we do barbara nodded thoughtfully tell that to kimmo thorne how long have you been here four years he replied and before im a teacher i worked in north london he gave the name of a primary school in kilburn before she could ask he told her hed left that employment because hed come to realise he preferred to work with older children he added that hed also had issues with the head teacher when barbara asked what sort of issues he told her forthrightly that they were about discipline which side of the fence did you happen to reside on barbara asked sparing and spoiling or as the twig is bent youre rather full of clichés arent you im a walking encyclopaedia of them so it wasnt corporal punishment he told her it was classroom discipline the removal of privileges a thorough talking to a brief spate of social ostracism that sort of thing public ridicule a day in the stocks he coloured im trying to be frank with you youll phone them up i know theyre going to tell you we had our differences but thats only natural people are always of different opinions right barbara said well we all have those dont we our different opinions you have them here as well difference of opinions leading to conflicts leading towho knows what perhaps the divide you mentioned ill repeat the point i tried to make before were all on the same page colossus is about the kids the more people you talk to the more youre going to understand that now if youll excuse me i see that yusuf needs my help he left her then returning to his classroom where the asian boy was bent over the scanner looking as if he wished to hammer it barbara knew the feeling she left greenham to his students her further exploration of the premisesstill unimpededtook her to the very back of the building there she found the kit room where a group of kids were being set up with appropriate dress and equipment for winter kayaking on the thames robbie kilfoylehe of the earlier cardplaying and the eurodisney baseball caphad them lined up and he was measuring them for wetsuits a row of which hung along one wall hed pulled life jackets from a shelf as well and those who were done being measured were sorting through these finding one that fitted conversation among them was muted it appeared theyd all finally got the word either about kimmo thorne or about the cops asking questions kilfoyle dismissed them to the game room when they had their wet suits and their life jackets wait there for griffin strong he told them he would be assisting their assessment leader on the river trip and he was going to grouse about it if he didnt find them all ready when he showed up then as they filed out kilfoyle went on to sort through a mound of wellingtons piled on the floor he began to pair them and slide them onto shelves that were marked with sizes he gave barbara a nod of recognition still here he said as ever seems were all waiting for griffin strong truth to that all right there was an airiness to his voice suggesting double meanings barbara took note volunteer here long she asked him kilfoyle thought about that one two years he said bit more something like twentynine months what about before that he gave her a look one that said he knew this was no simple chat on her part thiss my first spate of volunteering anywhere why which the firsttime part or the volunteeringatall part volunteering at all he stopped his work a set of wellingtons in his hand i do their sandwich deliveries like i said in reception thats how i met them i could see they needed help becausebetween you and methey pay their actual employees shit so they can never find enough help or keep them long when they do find them i started hanging about after my lunch deliveries were done for the day doing this doing that and hey presto i was a volunteer nice of you he shrugged good cause besides id like to be taken on eventually even though they pay their employees shit i like the kids and anyway colossus pays more than im currently making believe me so how do you make them what your deliveries bicycle he replied theres a cart that gets attached to the back going where the cart the deliveries he didnt wait for an answer round south london mostly a bit in the city why whatre you looking for a van barbara thought deliveries by van she noted that kilfoyle had started to flush but she didnt want to put that down as any more significant than greenhams damp upper lip or his too soft hands this bloke was ruddy skinned anyway in the way of many englishmen and he had the doughy face narrow nose and knobby chin that would mark him out as british no matter where he went barbara realised then how badly she wanted to read one of these blokes as a serial killer behind their ordinary exteriors but the truth was shed so far wanted to read just about everyone shed come across exactly the same and no doubt when he finally showed his mug griff strong was going to look bloody good to her as a serial killer as well she needed to keep things slow and easy at this point she thought piece details together she told herself dont cram them into position simply because you want them to be there so how do they keep body and soul together barbara asked not to mention roofs over their heads who you said wages were bad here oh that mostly theyve got second jobs such as he considered dont know them all but jacks got a weekend job in a pub and griff and his wife have a silkscreen business fact is i think only ulrikes making enough not to have something else going on at the weekends or at night its the only way anyone can actually do this and still eat he looked past barbara to the doorway and added hey mate i was just about to set the hounds on you barbara turned and saw the same boy whod been playing cards with kilfoyle earlier in reception he was slouching in the doorway baggy blue jeans crotched at the knees and boxer shorts bulging at the waist he shuffled into the kit room where kilfoyle set him up sorting through a tangle of climbing ropes he began pulling them out of a plastic barrel and coiling them neatly round his arm do you happen to know sean lavery barbara asked kilfoyle he thought about this been through assessment hes on a computer course with neil greenham then i probably know him by sight if not by name back herehe used his chin to indicate the kit roomi only see the kids close up when theres an activity scheduled and they come in for supplies otherwise theyre just faces to me i dont always put a name to them or keep a name on them once theyve moved beyond the assessment level because only assessmentlevel kids use this stuff barbara asked him referring to the supplies in the kit room generally speaking yes he said neil greenham tells me theres a divide between the assessment people and everyone else round here with ulrike on the assessment side he indicated thats a trouble spot thats just neil kilfoyle said he shot a look towards his helper and lowered his voice he hates being out of the loop he takes offence easy hes keen to have more responsibility and why what whys he keen to have more responsibility kilfoyle moved from the wellingtons to the remaining life jackets that had not been chosen for wear by the team going out on the thames most people want that in their jobs dont they its a power thing neil likes power i dont know him well but i get the feeling hed like to have more say about how things are run round here and what about you youve got to have bigger plans for yourself than volunteering in this kit room you mean here at colossus he thought about this then gave a shrug okay ill play i wouldnt mind being hired to do outreach when they open the colossus branch north of the river but griff strongs angling for that and if griff wants it its going to be his why kilfoyle hesitated weighing a life jacket between one hand and another as if he were also weighing his words he finally replied lets just say neil was right about one thing everyone knows everyone else at colossus but ulrikes going to make the decision on the outreach job and she knows some people better than others from the bentley lynley phoned the police station in south hampstead and brought them into the picture the body found that morning south of the river which was possibly one of a series of killingsif the station would allow him a conversation with a certain reverend savidge who might soon be phoning them about a missing boyarrangements were made as he crossed the river heading diagonally through the city he found bram savidge at his ministry which turned out to be a former shop for electrical goods whose whimsical name plugged inn had been economically used as part of the churchs moniker plugged inn to the lord in the swiss cottage area of finchley road it appeared to be part church and part soup kitchen at the moment it was operating as the latter when lynley walked in he felt like an overweight nudist in a crowd wearing overcoats he was the only white face in the establishment and the black faces looking him over were doing so without much welcome he asked for reverend savidge please and a woman whod been dishing out a savoury stew to a line of the hungry went to fetch him when savidge turned up lynley found himself facetoface with six feet five inches of solid africa which was hardly what hed expected from the public school sound of the mans voice on the speakerphone in ulrike elliss office reverend savidge appeared in a caftan of red orange and black while on his feet were roughly made sandals which he wore without socks despite the winter weather an intricately carved wooden necklace lay on his chest and a single earring of shell bone or something very like dangled just below the height of lynleys eyes savidge might have just stepped off the plane from nairobi except his clipped beard framed a face not as dark as one would have expected aside from lynley he was actually the lightestskinned person in the room youre the police that accent again speaking not only of public schools and a university degree but also of an upbringing in an area that was a far cry from his present community his eyesthey were hazel lynley notedtook in lynleys suit shirt tie and shoes he made his evaluation in an instant and it wasnt good so be it lynley thought he showed his identification and asked if there was somewhere private for them to speak savidge led the way to an office at the back of the building they wound there through long tables set up for use in eating the meal being dished out by women wearing garb not unlike savidges own at these perhaps two dozen men and half as many women wolfed down the stew drank from small cartons of milk and slathered bread with butter music played low to entertain them a chant of some sort in an african tongue savidge closed the door on all this when they got to his office he said scotland yard why i phoned the local station they said someone would come i assumedwhats happening whats this all about i was in ms elliss office when you phoned colossus whats happened to sean savidge demanded he didnt come home you must know something tell me lynley could see the reverend was used to being instantly obeyed there was little doubt why this was the case he dominated by simple virtue of being alive lynley couldnt remember the last time hed seen a man who so effortlessly exuded such authority he said i understand sean lavery lives with you id like to know reverend savidge im going to need some information one way or the other they engaged in a brief battle of eyes and wills before savidge said with me and my wife yes sean lives with us in care his own parents his mums in prison attempted murder of a cop savidge paused as if registering lynleys reaction to this lynley took care not to give him one dads a mechanic over in north kensington they were never married and he had no interest in the boy before or after mums arrest when she went inside sean went into the system and how did you end up with him ive had boys in my home for nearly two decades boys are there others then not now just sean why reverend savidge went to a thermos out of which he poured himself a cup of something fragrant and steaming he offered this to lynley who demurred he took it to his desk and sat nodding lynley into a chair on the desk a legal pad held jottings things listed and crossed out circled and underlined sermon savidge said apparently noticing the direction of lynleys gaze it doesnt come easy the other boys reverend savidge i have a wife now onis english isnt good she felt overwhelmed and a bit overrun so i had three of the boys placed elsewhere temporarily till oni settles in but not sean lavery hes not been placed elsewhere why hes younger than the others it didnt feel right to move him lynley wondered what else hadnt felt right he couldnt help concluding it might have been the new mrs savidge inadequate in english and home alone with a household of adolescent boys how did sean come to be involved in colossus he asked its quite a distance for him to go there from here colossus dogooders came to the church they called it outreach but what it amounted to was talking up their programme an alternative to what they obviously believe every child of colour would get up to given half the chance and absent their intervention you dont approve of them then this communitys going to help itself from within superintendent its not going to improve by having help imposed upon it by a group of liberal guiltridden social activists they need to toddle back to whichever of the home counties they came from hockey sticks and cricket bats well in hand yet somehow sean lavery ended up there despite your feelings i had no choice in the matter neither did sean it was all down to his social worker but surely as his guardian you have a strong say in how he spends his free time under other circumstances but there was an incident with a bicycle as well savidge went on to explain it was a complete misunderstanding he said sean had taken an expensive mountain bike from a boy in the neighbourhood hed thought hed been given permission to use it the boy had thought otherwise he reported it stolen and the cops found it in seans possession the situation was considered a first offence and seans social worker suggested nipping any potential for illegal behaviour in the bud so colossus came into the picture savidge had initially if reluctantly approved the idea of all his boys sean had been the first to come to the notice of the police he was also the first who wouldnt attend school colossus was supposed to remedy all this hes been there how long lynley asked closing in on a year attending regularly he has to its part of his probation savidge lifted his mug and drank he wiped his mouth carefully he went on with seans said from the first that he didnt steal that bike and i believe him at the same time i want to keep him out of trouble which you and i know hes going to get into if he doesnt go to school and doesnt get involved with something he hasnt exactly looked forward to colossus every dayfrom what i can tellbut he goes he managed the assessment course and hes actually had some good words to say about the computer course hes doing now who was his assessment leader griffin strong social worker sean liked him well enough or at least well enough not to complain about him has he ever failed to come home before reverend savidge never hes been late a few times but hes phoned to let us know thats it is there any reason he might have decided to run off savidge thought about this he circled his hands round his mug and rolled it between his palms he finally said once he managed to track down his dad without telling me in north kensington yes munro mews a carrepair shop sean tracked him down a few months ago i dont know exactly what happened hes never said but i dont expect it was anything positive his dads moved on in his life he has a wife and kids which is all i know from seans social worker so if sean went hoping to get dads attentionthat would have been a real nonstarter but not enough to cause sean to run off the dads name savidge gave it to him one sol oliver but then he ran out of the willingness to cooperate and selfsubordinate he was clearly not used to doing either he said now superintendent lynley ive told you what i know i want you to tell me what youre going to do and not what youre going to do in fortyeight hours or however long you expect me to wait because sean might have run off he doesnt run off he phones if hes going to be late he leaves colossus and he checks in here on his way to the gym he pounds the punch bag and then he goes home the gym lynley took note of this what gym where how often did he go and how did sean get from plugged inn to the lord to the gym and from there to home on foot by bus did he ever hitchhike did someone drive him savidge regarded him curiously but answered willingly enough sean walked he told lynley it wasnt far either from here or from home it was called square four gym did the boy have a mentor there lynley asked someone he admired someone he spoke of savidge shook his head he said that sean went to the gym as part of coping with his anger and upon his social workers recommendation he had no ambition to be a body builder a boxer a wrestler or anything else along those lines as far as savidge knew what about friends lynley asked who were they savidge thought about this for a moment before he admitted that sean lavery didnt seem to have friends but he was a good boy and he was responsible savidge insisted and the one thing he could vouch for was that sean wouldnt fail to come home without phoning and explaining why and then because somehow savidge knew that new scotland yard would not have come in place of the local police without more of a reason than having been in ulrike elliss office when he phoned he said perhaps its time you told me why youre really here superintendent in reply lynley asked reverend savidge if he had a photo of the boy not there in his office savidge told him for that they would need to go to his home chapter eleven even if robbie kilfoyle in his eurodisney cap hadnt alluded to the fact barbara havers would have twigged that something was going on between griffin strong and ulrike ellis about fifteen seconds into seeing them together whether it was merely a case of angstfilled love going unacknowledged of footsie in the local canteen or kama sutra under the stars she couldnt have said nor could she tell if it was just a oneway street with ulrike doing all the driving in a car she was piloting to nowhere but that there was something in the air between themsome sort of electrical charge that usually meant naked bodies and moaning exchanges of bodily fluids but could really mean anything in between handshakes and the primal actonly a deafmute alien life form would have thought to deny the director of colossus personally brought griffin strong to barbara she made the introductions and the way she said his namenot to mention the way she looked at him with an expression not unlike the one barbara felt on her own face whenever she gazed upon a fruittopped cheesecakepretty much put neon lights round whatever secret she or they were supposed to be keeping and obviously there had to be a secret not only had robbie kilfoyle earlier mentioned the word wife in connection with strong but the man himself wore a wedding band the approximate size of a lorry tyre which in itself was a wise idea barbara thought strong was just about the most gorgeous thing shed ever seen walking unmolested on the streets of london he no doubt needed something to ward off the hordes of females whose jaws probably dropped to their chests when he passed them he looked like a film star he looked better than a film star he looked like a god he also barbara realised looked uneasy she couldnt decide if this counted in his favour or marked him down for further study he said ulrikes told me about kimmo thorne and sean lavery you might as well know they were both mine sean went through assessment with me ten months ago and kimmo was going through assessment now i let ulrike know straightaway when hekimmodidnt turn up obviously i didnt know sean was missing as hes not currently one of mine barbara nodded helpful she thought and the bit about sean was an interesting wrinkle she asked was there a spot where they could talk they didnt exactly need ulrike ellis hanging upon their every word strong said he shared an office with two other assessment leaders they were off with their kids today though and if shed follow him there theyd have some privacy he himself didnt have a lot of time though because he was due to help take some kids out on the river he gave ulrike a quick glance and motioned barbara to follow him for her part barbara tried to interpret that glance and the nervous smile that quivered on ulrikes lips as she received it you and me babe our secret darling well talk later i want you naked rescue me in five minutes please the possibilities seemed endless barbara followed griffin strongits griff he saidto an office just the other side of reception it displayed the same decorating sense as ulrikes heavy on clutter and light on available space bookshelves filing cabinets one shared desk the walls held posters intended to influence young people in a positive direction illiterate football stars with curious hairdos pretending to read charles dickens and pop singers doing thirty seconds of public service in soup kitchens colossus posters joined these on them the familiar logo appeared that giant allowing himself to be used by the smaller and the less fortunate strong went to one of the filing cabinets and fingered through a packed drawer to pull out two files he consulted them and told her that kimmo thorne had come to colossus via the magistrates court youth offenders and his predilection for selling stolen goods sean had come via social services and something about a hijacked mountain bike again that demonstration of helpfulness strong returned the files and went to the desk where he sat and rubbed his forehead you look tired barbara noted ive a baby with colic he said and a wife with postnatal blues im coping but only just that at least partially explained whatever might be going on with ulrike barbara decided it fell into the poormisunderstoodandneglectedhusband class of extramarital whatevers tough times she said in acknowledgement he flashed her a smile ofwhat else would it beperfect white teeth its worth it ill get through them bet you will barbara thought she asked him about kimmo thorne what did strong know about his time at colossus about his associates here his friends mentors acquaintances teachers and the like having had him in the assessment coursewhich she was given to understand would provide the most intimate of the interactions that the kids would engage in at colossushe probably knew kimmo better than anyone else did good kid strong told her oh hed been in trouble but he wasnt cut out for criminality he just did it as a means to an end not for kicks and not as an unconscious social statement and hed rejected that sort of life anyway well at least that was how it had seemed so far it had been too soon to tell which way kimmo would actually go which was generally the case during a young persons first weeks at colossus what sort of boy was he barbara then asked well liked griff told her pleasant affable he was just the sort of boy who stood a good chance of actually making something of himself he had real potential and real talent it was a bloody shame some bastard out there had targeted him barbara took down all of this information despite knowing most of it already despite feeling it was all somehow rehearsed doing this gave her the opportunity not to look at the man who was passing the details along to her she evaluated his voice while not distracted by his gq looks he sounded sincere enough very forthcoming and all that but there was nothing in what he was telling her that indicated he knew kimmo better than anyone else and that didnt make sense he was supposed to know him well or at least to be getting to know him well yet there was nothing here to indicate that and she had to wonder why any special friends here she asked he said what and then do you actually think someone from colossus may have killed him its a possibility barbara said ulrikell tell you everyones thoroughly vetted before they come to work here the idea that somehow a serial killer had a good chat with ulrike before you and i met then barbara looked up from her notes he had a deerintheheadlights expression on his face of course she told me you were here when she told me about kimmo and sean but she said there were several other deaths youre investigating so it cant have anything to do with colossus and no one knows if seans just bunked off for the day anyway true barbara said any special friends mine we were talking about kimmo kimmo right everyone liked him and youd think the opposite would be the case considering how he got himself up and how most kids feel about their sexuality in adolescence hows that then you know a bit ill at ease unsure at first about their own proclivities and consequently unwilling to have anything to do with someone who might cast a questionable light upon them in the eyes of their peers but no one seemed to shun kimmo he didnt allow it as to special friends there was no one he singled out and no one who singled out him more than anyone else but thats not something that would happen in assessment anyway the kids are supposed to bond as a group what about sean she asked him what about sean friends strong hesitated then he had a rougher time than kimmo as i recall he said reflectively he didnt get close to the group he went through assessment with but he seemed more standoffish in general an introvert things on his mind such as i dont know except he was angry and he didnt try to hide it about what being here i expect in my experience most kids are angry when they come to us through social services they generally break down sometime during their assessment weeks but sean never did how long had griffin strong been an assessment leader at colossus barbara asked unlike kilfoyle and greenham whod had to think about how long theyd been associated with the organisation griff said fourteen months at once and before barbara asked social work id started out in medicinethought id be a pathologist till i found i couldnt abide the sight of a dead bodythen i switched over to psychology and sociology ive a first in each that was impressive enough as well as easily checked out whered you work barbara asked him he didnt respond at once so again barbara lifted her head from her notebook she found him staring at her and she knew that hed intended her to raise her head and that he enjoyed the sensation of having forced her into doing so flatly she repeated her question he finally said stockwell for a time before that lewisham is this important just now everythings important barbara took her time writing stockwell and lewisham into her notebook she said what sort anyway when shed put a little flourish on the final letter what sort of what social work kids in care lags on the loose single mums what he didnt answer a second time barbara thought he might be playing the power game again but she raised her head anyway this time though he wasnt looking at her but rather at the football player on the poster ostensibly enraptured by his leatherbound copy of bleak house barbara was about to repeat her question when griff appeared to come to a decision about something he said you might as well know youll find out anyway i was sacked from both jobs for i dont always get on with supervisors especially if theyre female sometimes he gave his attention fully back to her two dark deep eyes compelling her to keep her gaze locked upon him there are always disagreements in this sort of work there have to be were dealing with human lives and each life is different from the last isnt it you could say that barbara said curious about where he was going with all this he showed her in short order yes well i have a tendency to express myself strongly and women have a tendency not to take that well i end up gettinglets call it misunderstood for want of a better term ah there it was barbara thought the misunderstood business it just wasnt being applied where shed expected it to be but ulrike doesnt have that problem with you not so far he said but then ulrike likes discussion shes not afraid of a healthy debate among the team or a healthy something else as well barbara thought especially that she said you and ulrike are close then he wasnt about to get into that she runs the organisation what about when youre not here at colossus what are you asking if youre bonking your boss i guess im wondering how the other assessment leaders might feel about it if you and ulrike happen to be making the beast with two backs after hours or how anyone else might feel about it for that matter is that how you lost your other two jobs by the way he said evenly youre not very nice are you not with five dead bodies to account for five you cant possibly concludei was toldulrike said youd come here about kimmo yeah but thats just one of two dead bodies with names barbara said but you said that seanseans only missing isnt he hes not deadyou dont know weve a body this morning that could be sean and im sure ulrike clued you in on that beyond that weve got a kid called jared salvatore identified and three others in line to be claimed by someone five in all he didnt say anything but he seemed to be holding his breath for some reason and barbara wondered what that meant he finally murmured jesus whats happened to the rest of your assessment kids mr strong barbara asked what do you mean how closely do you follow them when theyre done with their first two weeks at this place i dont i havent i mean they go on to their instructors next if they want to go on that is the instructors keep tabs on how theyre doing and they report in to ulrike the whole team meets every two weeks and we talk and ulrike herself counsels the kids having trouble he frowned he tapped his knuckles on his desk if these other kids turn out to be ourssomeones trying to discredit colossus he told her or one of us someones trying to get at one of us you think thats the case barbara asked if even one other of the bodies comes from here what else is there to think that kids are in danger all over london barbara said but that theyre really up against it if they end up here like were setting out to kill them you mean strongs question was outraged barbara smiled and flipped her notebook closed your words not mine mr strong she said reverend bram savidge and his wife lived in a west hampstead neighbourhood that belied the church leaders weareofthepeople demeanour it was a small house true but it was far more than anyone whom lynley had seen either dishing out the food or eating it at plugged inn to the lord could afford and savidge led the way there in a latemodel saab as dc havers would have happily pointed out someone round here wasnt hurting for lolly savidge waited for lynley to find a place for the bentley on the treelined street he stood on the front step of his house looking vaguely biblical with his caftan blowing in the winter breeze coatless despite the frigid winter weather when lynley finally joined him he sorted out three locks on the front door and opened it he called oni ive brought a visitor darling he didnt call out about sean lynley noted not has the boy phoned not any word from sean just ive brought a visitor darling and in a tentative manner that sounded somehow like a warning and was completely out of character for the man lynley had been speaking with so far there was no immediate reply to savidges call he said to lynley wait here and directed him to the sitting room he himself went to a staircase and climbed quickly to the first floor lynley heard him moving along a corridor he took a moment to gaze round the sitting room which was simply fitted out with wellmade furniture and a brightly patterned rug the walls held old documents framed and mounted and as above him doors opened and closed in rapid succession lynley went to examine these one was an antique bill of lading apparently from a ship called the valiant sheba whose cargo had been twenty males thirtytwo femaleseighteen of whom were documented as breedingand thirteen children another was a letter written in copperplate on stationery that bore ash grove nr kingston as its letterhead faded with time this proved difficult to read but lynley made out excellent stud potential and if you can control the brute my thricegreatgrandfather superintendent he didnt quite take to slavery lynley turned in the doorway savidge stood with a girl at his side oni my wife he said shes asked to be introduced it was hard for lynley to believe he was looking at savidges wife for oni appeared no older than sixteen if that she was thin long necked and african to the core like her husband her manner of dress was ethnic and she carried an unusual musical instrument in her arms its belly not unlike a banjo but with a tall bridge that lifted more than a dozen strings high up one glance at her explained a great deal to lynley oni was exquisite like midnight unblemished with hundreds of years of blood untarnished by miscegenation she was what savidge himself could never be because of the valiant sheba she was also the last thing a rational man would want to leave alone with a group of teenage boys lynley said mrs savidge the girl smiled and nodded she looked to her husband as if for guidance she said you might wanting and halted as if sorting through a catalogue of words that she knew and grammar whose rules she barely understood he said this is about sean darling we dont mean to disturb your practice with the kora why dont you go on with it down here while i take the policeman up to seans room yes she agreed i will be playing then she went to the sofa and placed the kora carefully on the floor as they were about to leave her she said it is very sunless today no another month passes bram idiscoverno not discover isnti learn this morning savidge hesitated lynley discerned a change in him like tension released he said well talk later then oni she said yes and the other as well again perhaps the other quickly he directed lynley to the stairs he led the way to a room at the back of the house when they were within it he seemed to feel the need to explain he shut the door and said were trying for a baby no luck so far thats what she meant thats rough lynley said shes worried about it worried that i mighti dont knowdiscard her or something but shes perfectly healthy shes perfectly formed shes savidge stopped as if he realised how close he was to describing someones breeding potential himself he settled on changing course altogether and he said anyway this is seans room did you ask your wife if hes turned up phoned sent a message she doesnt answer the phone savidge said her english isnt good enough she lacks confidence anything else what do you mean i mean did you ask her about sean i didnt need to she would have told me she knows im worried whats her relationship with the boy whats that got to do with mr savidge ive got to ask lynley said his gaze steady shes obviously much younger than you shes nineteen years old much closer in age to the boys youve sheltered than to yourself am i right this isnt about my marriage my wife or my situation superintendent oh but it is lynley thought he said youre what twenty years older than she twentyfive years older and the boys were what age savidge seemed to grow larger indignation colouring his reply this is about a missing boy in a circumstance in which other boys of a similar age have gone missing if the newspapers are anything to go by so if you think im going to let you misdirect my concerns because you lot have botched an investigation youd better change course he didnt wait for an answer instead he went to a bookcase that held a small cd player and a rank of paperback books that looked untouched from the top of this he took up a photograph in a plain wooden frame he thrust it at lynley in the picture savidge himself in his african garb stood with his arm round the shoulders of a solemnlooking boy wearing an overlarge tracksuit the boy had a head of germinant dreadlocks and a wary expression like a dogs too often returned to his cage at the battersea shelter after a walk he was very dark only a little lighter than savidges wife he was also unmistakably the boy whose body theyd found that morning lynley looked up beyond savidges shoulder he saw that the walls of seans room had posters on them louis farrakhan in passionate exhortation elijah mohammed backed by neatsuited members of the nation a young muhammad ali perhaps the most famous of the converted he said mr savidge and then for a moment he found himself in the position of not knowing exactly how to go on a body in a tunnel became all too human the moment you placed it in a home at that point a body altered from a body to a person whose death could not go unmarked by a desire for revenge or a need for justice or the duty to express the simplest form of regret he said im sorry weve got a body youre going to have to look at it was found this morning south of the river savidge said oh my god is it i hope it isnt lynley said although he knew it was he took the other mans arm to give him support there were questions he was going to have to ask savidge eventually but at the moment there was nothing more to say ulrike managed to cool her heels in her office till jack veness closed down the phones and tidied up the reception room for the day once shed acknowledged his good night and heard the outer door slam behind him she went in search of griff she found robbie kilfoyle instead he was in the entry corridor emptying two rubbish bags of colossus tshirts and sweatshirts into the storage cupboard beneath the display case of goods for sale at least she saw griff had told the truth in this he had spent several hours at his silkscreening business today shed doubted that when theyd met at the charlie chaplin the first thing shed said was whereve you been all day griffin and then winced at the tone of her voice because she knew what she sounded like and he knew she knew which was why hed said dont before he told her a piece of equipment had needed repair at the silkscreening shop and hed seen to it he said i told you id be going by the business on my way in you wanted me to bring more shirts remember that was a quintessential griffin reply i was doing what you asked he implied ulrike said to robbie kilfoyle have you seen griff i need a word with him squatting on the floor robbie rested back on his heels and tipped his cap to the back of his head he said hes helping take that new group of assessment kids onto the river they went off in the vansround two hours ago robbies expression told her he thought sheas directorought to be aware of this piece of information he said he left this stuffwith a nod at the rubbish bagsback in the kit room i reckoned it was best to pack it all in here cn i help you with something help me well if you want griff and griffs not here i might be able to he shrugged i said i wanted a word with him robbie ulrike was at once aware of how curt she sounded she said sorry that was rude of me im frazzled the police first kimmo now sean robbie said yeah i know hes not dead though is he sean lavery ulrike looked at him sharply i didnt say his name how dyou know about sean robbie seemed taken aback that cop asked if i knew him ulrike that woman cop she came by the kit room she said sean was in one of the computer courses so when i had a chance i asked neil what was going on he said sean lavery didnt turn up today that was it then he added okay ulrike as an afterthought but he didnt sound deferential when he said it she couldnt blame him she said imlook i didnt mean to sound soi dont knowso suspicious im on edge first kimmo now sean and the police dyou know what time griff and the kids will be back robbie took a moment seeming to evaluate her apology before he replied this she decided was a wee bit much he was after all only a volunteer he said i dont know theyll probably stop for a coffee afterwards half seven prhaps eight hes got his own keys to the place right true she thought he could come and go as he liked which had been convenient in the past when theyd wanted to have a political powwow planning strategies before staff meetings and after hours heres where i stand on an issue griffin what about you i suppose youre right she said they could be gone hours not too late though the dark and all that and it must be cold as hell on the river between you and me i cant think why assessment chose kayaking at all for their group activity this time round seems a hike wouldve been better a footpath in the cotswolds or something going between villages they couldve stopped for a meal at the end he went back to stowing the tshirts and sweatshirts away in the cupboard is that what you would have done she asked him taken them on a hike somewhere safe he looked over his shoulder its probably nothing you know what sean lavery they bunk off sometimes these kids ulrike wanted to ask him why he thought he knew the kids at colossus better than she but the truth was he likely did know them better because shed been distracted for months on end kids had come into and gone from colossus but her mind had been elsewhere which could cost her her job if it came down to the board of directors looking for someone culpable for what was going onif something was going on all those hours days weeks months and years given to this organisation down the toilet in one hardy flush shed be able to get another job somewhere but it wouldnt be at a place like colossus with all of colossuss potential to do exactly what she so fervently believed needed to be done in england to make change at a grassroots level which was at the level of the individual childs psyche where had it all gone shed come into her job at colossus believing that she could make a difference and she had done just that right up till the time griffin charles strong had planted his cv on her desk and his mesmerising dark eyes on her face and even then shed managed to maintain an air of cool professionalism for months on end knowing full well the dangers represented by becoming involved with anyone at her place of employment her resolve had weakened over time perhaps just to touch him shed thought the gorgeous head of hair wavy and thick or the broad oarsmans shoulders beneath the fishermans sweater he favoured or the lower arm whose wrist was banded by a leather plait touching him had eventually become such an obsession that the only way possible to rid herself of the preoccupation with her hand grazing some part of his body was simply to do it just reach across the conference table and grasp his wrist to emphasise her agreement with some remark hed made during a staff meeting and then feel the rush of surprise when he briefly closed his other hand over hers and squeezed she told herself it was merely a sign that he appreciated her support of his ideas except there were signsand then there were signs she said to robbie kilfoyle when youre finished here make sure the doors are locked wont you will do he said and she felt his gaze fixed on her speculatively as she returned to her office there she went to the filing cabinet she squatted in front of the bottom drawer that shed opened before in the presence of the detectives she fingered through the manila folders and brought out the one she needed which she shoved into the canvas book bag she used as a briefcase that done she grabbed up her bicycle clothing and went to change for the long ride home she did her changing in the ladies toilet taking her time and all the while listening for the hopeful sounds of griff strong and the assessment kids returning from the river but the only thing she heard was robbie kilfoyle leaving and then she herself was alone at colossus she couldnt risk griffs mobile this time round not when she knew he was with a group there was nothing left but to write him a note rather than deposit it on his desk however where he could use the excuse of not having seen it she took it outside to the carpark and shoved it beneath the windscreen wiper of his vehicle on the drivers side she even took a piece of sellotape to make sure the note didnt blow away then she went for her bike unlocked it and headed for st georges road the first part of the crisscrossing route that would take her from elephant and castle up to paddington the ride took her nearly an hour in the bitter cold her mask prevented her from breathing the worst of the traffic fumes but there was nothing to protect her from the constant noise she reached gloucester terrace more exhausted than usual but at least grateful that the ride itselfand the need to be on guard against traffichad kept her mind occupied she chained her bicycle to the railing in front of number where she unlocked the front door to the usual cooking smells emanating from the groundfloor flat cumin sesame oil fish overcooked sprouts rotting onions she held her breath and went for the stairs she was up five of them when behind her the frontdoor buzzer sounded sharply the door had a rectangle of glass on top and through it she saw the shape of his head she descended quickly i rang your mobile griff sounded irritated why didnt you answer fuck it ulrike if youre going to leave me a note like that i was on my bike she told him i can hardly answer it when im riding home i turn it off you know that she held the door open and turned from it he would have no choice but to follow her upstairs on the first floor she switched on the timed light and went for the door of her flat inside she dumped her canvas holdall on the lumpy sofa and turned on a single lamp she said wait here and went into her bedroom where she took off her bikeriding clothes sniffed her armpits and found them wanting a damp flannel took care of that problem after which she examined herself in the mirror and was satisfied with the heightened colour the ride across london had brought to her cheeks she slid into a dressing gown and tied its belt she returned to the sitting room griff had turned on the brighter overhead lights she chose to ignore that she went to the kitchen where the fridge held a chilled bottle of white burgundy she took out two glasses and fetched the corkscrew seeing this griff said ulrike ive just got off the river im knackered and theres just no way she turned round that wouldnt have stopped you a month ago anytime anywhere man the torpedoes and damn the consequences you cant have forgotten i havent good she poured the wine and carried a glass over to him i like to think of you as eternally ready she hooked her arm round his neck and drew him to her an instant of resistance and then his mouth was on hers tongues more tongues a lengthy caress and after a moment his hand sliding from her waist to the side of her breast fingers reaching for her nipple squeezing coaxing her to groan heat shooting into her genitals yes very nice stuff griff she released him abruptly and moved away he had the grace to look flustered he went to a chairnot the sofaand sat he said you said this was urgent emergency twentyfiveline whip crisis chaos thats why i came this is exactly the opposite direction from home by the way which means ill not even get home now till god knows what time how unfortunate she said with duty calling you and all that and im fully aware of your address griffin as you well know i dont want a row have you brought me here for a row why would you think that where were you all day he raised his head to the ceiling one of those martyred male looks of the sort one saw in paintings of dying early christian saints he said ulrike you know my situation youve always known it you cant havewhat would you have me do now or then walk out on arabella when she was five months pregnant while she was in labour now shes got an infant to contend with i never gave you the slightest indication youre right she produced a brittle smile she could actually feel how frangible it was and she loathed herself for reacting to him she saluted him with her wineglass in a mock toast you never did bully for you everything always in the open and on the upandup dont ask anyone to wear a blindfold thats a very good way to sidestep responsibility he put his wineglass on the table its contents untouched he said all right i surrender white flag whatever you want why am i here what did she want look i was late today because i went to the silkscreening shop i told you that not that its actually any of your business what arabella and i ulrike laughed although it was somewhat forced a bad actress on an overlit stage i have a fine idea of what arabella wanted and what you probably gave herall seven and a half inches of it but im not talking about you and the darling wife im talking about the policewoman constable whatsername with the broken teeth and bad hair are you trying to back me into a corner what are you talking about im talking about your whole approach i protest i call a halt to the way youre behaving just now i say enough i tell you to fuck off and youve got what you want which is my head on a bloody charger no dancing and no seven veils required is that what you think is that why you actually think ive asked you to come here she drained her glass of wine and felt the effect of it almost immediately are you saying you wouldnt sack me given half the chance in an instant she replied but thats not why were talking then why what did she talk to you about exactly what you thought shed talk to me about and and and what did you tell her what dyou think i told her kimmo was kimmo sean was sean one was a freespirit transvestite with the personality of a vaudeville queen a kid no one in his right mind would want to harm the other looked like someone who wanted to chew screws for breakfast i let you know when kimmo missed a day of assessment sean was out of my orbit and on to something else so i wouldnt have known if he stopped turning up thats all you told her she studied him as she asked the question wondering about what kind of trust could possibly exist between two people whod betrayed a third his eyes had narrowed he said only we agreed and as she openly evaluated him he added or dont you trust me she didnt of course how could she trust someone who lived by betrayal but there was a way to test him and not only that but a way to fix him in position so that he had to maintain the pretence of cooperation with her if it was a pretence in the first place she went to her canvas holdall from it she took the file shed removed from her office she handed this over to him she watched as his gaze dropped to it as his eyes took in the label at the top he looked up at her once hed read it i did what you asked what am i supposed to do with this then what you have to she said i think you know what i mean chapter twelve when detective constable barbara havers pulled into the underground carpark at new scotland yard the next morning she was already on her fourth cigarette not counting the one shed lit up and sucked down as she made her way from bed to shower shed been smoking steadily since leaving her digs and the always maddening trip from north london had done nothing to improve either her nerves or her mood she was used to rows shed had runins with everyone shed ever worked with and shed even gone so far as to shoot at a superior officer in the truly advanced row that had cost her her rank and very nearly her job but nothing that had gone before in her patchy careernot to mention in her lifehad affected her as shed been affected in five minutes of conversation with her neighbour she hadnt intended to take on taymullah azhar her objective had been to extend a simple invitation to his daughter careful researchwell what went for careful research on her part which was to buy a copy of whats on like a tourist come to see the queenhad informed her that a place called the jeffrye museum offered glimpses into social history via models of sitting rooms through the centuries wouldnt it be brilliant for hadiyyah to accompany barbara there in order to feed her eager little mind with something other than considerations of the belly rings currently being worn by female pop singers it would be a journey from north to east london it would in short be edubloodycational how could azhar a sophisticated educator himself object to that quite easily as it turned out when barbara knocked him up on her way out to her car he opened the door and he listened politely as was his habit with the fragrance of a wellbalanced and nutritional breakfast floating out from the flat behind him like an accusation against barbaras own morning ritual of poptart and players sort of a double whammy you could call it barbara finished the invitation and even as she said it she wondered where the hell double whammy had come from i mean the museums built in a row of old almshouses so theres historical and social architecture involved as well the sort of thing kids pass without knowing what theyre passing if you know what i mean anyway i thought it might be what she asked herself a good idea an opportunity for hadiyyah an escape from further punishment that last was it of course barbara had passed hadiyyahs solemn little gated face in the window one time too many enough was bleeding enough shed thought azhar had made his point he didnt need to beat the poor kid over the head with it this is very kind of you barbara azhar had said with his usual grave courtesy however in the circumstance in which hadiyyah and i find ourselves shed appeared behind him then having apparently heard their voices she cried barbara hello hello and she peered round her fathers slender body she said dad can barbara not come in were having our breakfast barbara dads made french toast and scrambled eggs thats what im having with syrup hes having yogurt she wrinkled her nose but not evidently at her fathers choice of food because she went on to say barbara have you been smoking already dad can barbara not come in cant kiddo barbara said hastily so azhar wouldnt have to issue an invitation he might not want to issue im on my way to work keeping london safe for women children and small furry animals you know the drill hadiyyah bounced from foot to foot i got a good mark in my maths exam she confided dad said he was proud when he saw it barbara looked at azhar his dark face was sombre school is very important he said to his daughter although he looked at barbara as he spoke hadiyyah please go back to your breakfast but cant barbara come hadiyyah the voice was sharp have i not just spoken to you and has barbara herself not told you that she must go to work do you listen to others or merely desire and hear nothing that precludes desires fulfillment this seemed a little harsh even by azhars standards hadiyyahs face which had been glowing altered in an instant her eyes widened but not with surprise barbara could see she did it to contain her tears she backed away with a gulp and scooted in the direction of the kitchen azhar and barbara were left together eyeball to eyeball he looking like a disinterested witness to a car crash she feeling the warning sign of heat seeping into her gut that was the moment when she should have said well right thats that then prhaps ill see you both later tata and gone on her way knowing she was wading out of her depth and mindlessly swimming into someone elses business but instead shed held her neighbours gaze and allowed herself to feel the heat and its progression from her stomach to her chest where it formed a burning knot when it got there she spoke that was a bit out of order dont you think shes just a kid whenre you planning to give her a break hadiyyah knows what she is meant to do azhar replied she also knows there are consequences when she goes her own way in defiance okay all right got it written in stone tattooed on my forehead whatever you want but how about punishments fitting the crime and while were at it how about not humiliating her in front of me she is not she is barbara hissed you didnt see her face and let me tell you this for a lark all right lifes hard enough especially for little girls what they dont need is parents making it harder she needs to you want her brought down a peg or two want her sorted want her to know shes not numero uno in anyones life and she never will be just let her out in society azhar and shell get the message she bloody well doesnt need to hear it from her father barbara could see shed gone too far with that azhars facealways composedshuttered completely you have no children he replied if one day you find yourself fortunate enough to be a mother barbara you will think otherwise about how and when your child should be disciplined it was the word fortunate and all it implied that allowed barbara to see her neighbour in an entirely new light dirty fighter she thought but two could play at that game no wonder she walked out azhar how long did it actually take her to get a reading on you too long id guess but thats not much of a surprise is it after all she was an english girl and none of us english girls play the game with all fiftytwo cards in the deck do we that said she turned and left him enjoying the cowards brief triumph at having had the last word but it was the simple fact that shed had that word that kept barbara in raging and internal conversation with an azhar who wasnt present all the way into central london so when she pulled into a parking bay beneath new scotland yard she was still in a state and hardly in the proper frame of mind for a days productive employment she was also lightheaded from nicotine she stopped in the ladies loo to splash some water on her face she looked in the mirror and hated herself for stooping to examine her image for evidence of what she realized taymullah azhar had been seeing for all these months theyd been neighbours unfortunate female homo sapiens a perfect specimen of everything gone wrong no chance for a normal life barbara whatever the hell that was sod him she whispered who was he anyway who the bloody hell did he think he was she ran her fingers through her choppedup hair and she straightened the collar of her blouse realising she should have ironed ithad she owned an iron she looked three quarters of the journey towards a fright but that couldnt be helped and it didnt matter there was a job to do in the incident room she found that the morning briefing was already going on superintendent lynley glanced her way in the middle of listening to something being said by winston nkata and he did not look particularly chuffed as his gaze traveled beyond her to the clock on the wall winston was saying works of wrath or vengeance cording to what the lady at crystal moon told me she looked it up in a book she handed over a register of shop visitors wanting to be on their newsletter list and shes got credit card purchases and postal codes of customers as well lets match the postal codes with the body sites lynley said to him do the same with the register and the credit card purchases we may get some joy there what about camden lock market lynley looked towards barbara what did you get from that stall constable did you stop there this morning which was his way of saying i trust thats your reason for walking in here late barbara thought holy hell the runin with azhar had wiped every other consideration from her mind she fumbled round her head for an excuse but the course of wisdom brought her back from the brink at the last moment she opted for the truth i dropped the ball on that she admitted sorry sir when i was finished with colossus yesterday inever mind ill get on to it directly she saw the looks exchanged round her she saw lynleys lips get thin for an instant so she went on hastily in an attempt to smooth over the moment i think the direction we need to take is colossus anyway sir do you lynleys voice was even too even but she chose to ignore that she said i do weve got possibles and counting over there that need looking into aside from jack veness who seems to know something about everyone theres a bloke called neil greenham whos a bit overly helpful he had a copy of the standard that he was dead chuffed to show me by the way and that robbie kilfoylehe was in reception yesterday playing cards with that kidhe volunteers in the kit room he does lunch deliveries as a second job van lynley asked bike sorry barbara said regretfully but he admitted hes aiming for a real job at colossus if it expands across the river which gives him a motive to make someone else look killing off the customers is hardly going to get him that is it havers john stewart cut in acerbically barbara ignored the dig going on to say his competition could be a bloke called griff strong whos lost his last two jobs in stockwell and lewisham because according to him he didnt get along with female coworkers thats four possibles and theyre all in the age range of the profile sir well look into them lynley agreed and just as barbara thought shed redeemed herself lynley asked john stewart to hand out that assignment and he went on to tell nkata to dig round in the background of reverend bram savidge and to deal with the goingson at square four gym in swiss cottage and a car repair shop in north kensington while he was at it then he made additional assignments involving the taxi driver whod called about the body in the shand street tunnel and the abandoned car where that body had been deposited he took in a report about the cookery schools in londonno jared salvatore enrolled in any of thembefore he turned to barbara and said ill see you in my office constable he strode out of the incident room with a get on with it then to the rest of the team leaving barbara to follow she noted that no one looked at her as she trailed after lynley she found herself scurrying to keep up with him and she didnt like the dogandmaster feeling this evoked she knew shed muffed it by forgetting to check the stall in camden lock market and she supposed she deserved a dressingdown for that but on the other hand shed given them a new direction with strong greenham veness and kilfoyle hadnt she so that had to count for something once in the superintendents office however it seemed that lynley didnt see things this way he said shut the door havers and when she had done so he went to his desk instead of sitting however he merely leaned his hips against it and faced her he gestured her to a chair and he loomed above her she absolutely loathed the way this made her feel but she was determined that loathing would not rule her she said your picture was on the front page of the standard sir yesterday afternoon so was mine so was hamish robsons we were standing just outside of the shand street tunnel you were named thats not good it happens but with a serial killer lynley broke in constable tell me this are you deliberately attempting to shoot yourself in the foot or is all of this part of your unconscious all of this what you were given the assignment camden lock market on your route home for the love of god or for that matter on your route here do you realise how you appear to the others whenas you put ityou drop the ball if you want your rank back which i assume you do and which i also assume you know depends upon your being able to function as part of a team how do you expect to achieve that if youre going to make your own decisions about whats important in this investigation and what is not sir thats not fair barbara protested and this isnt the first time youve operated on your own lynley said as if she hadnt spoken if ever an officer had a professional death wishwhat the hell were you thinking dont you see i cant keep running interference for you just when i begin to think ive got you sorted you begin it all again all what your infernal bloodymindedness your taking the reins in your hands instead of the bit in your mouth your constant insubordination your unwillingness even to make a pretence of being part of a larger team weve been through this before time and again im doing my best to protect you but i swear to you if this doesnt stop he threw up his hands get over to camden lock market havers to wendys rainbow or whatever the hell it was called wendys cloud barbara said numbly but she may not be open because then you can bloody well track her down and until you do i dont want to see your face hear your voice or know you exist on the planet is that clear barbara stared at him her stare turned into an observation shed worked with lynley for long enough to know how wildly out of character his outburst was no matter how richly she deserved being sorted she did a mental riffling through the reasons he was on the edge another murder a row with helen a runin with hillier trouble with his younger brother flat tyre on the way to work too much caffeine not enough sleepbut then it came to her as easily as knowing who lynley was she said hes got in touch with you hasnt he he saw your name in the paper and he bloody got in touch lynley observed her for a moment before making his decision he moved round his desk there he took a paper out of a manila folder he handed it to her and barbara saw it was a copy of an original which she presumed was already on its way to forensics there is no denial only salvation was printed neatly in block letters on a single line across the page beneath this was not a signature but rather a marking that looked not unlike two squaredoff but separated sections of a maze howd it get here barbara asked returning it to lynley by post lynley said plain envelope same printing what dyou make of the marking a signature of sorts could be some bugger just wanting to play games couldnt it i mean he doesnt actually tell us anything to show he knows something only the killer would know except the salvation bit lynley said it suggests he knows that the boysat least the ones weve identifiedhave been in trouble with the law one way or another only the killer knows that plus everyone at colossus barbara pointed out sir that bloke neil greenham had a copy of the standard neil greenham and everyone else in london but you were named in the standard and thats the edition he showed me let me dig around his barbara lynleys voice was patient what youre doing it again it handle camden lock market ill deal with the rest she was about to protestbetter judgement be damnedwhen the phone rang and lynley picked it up he said yes dee to the departmental secretary he listened for a moment then said bring him up here if you will before ringing off robson barbara asked simon st james lynley replied hes got something for us he recognised that his wife at this point was his anchor his wife and the separate reality that she represented it was to lynley nothing short of miraculous that he could go home andfor the few hours he was therebecome if not consumed then at least diverted by something as ridiculous as the drama of trying to keep peace between their families over the idiotic question of christening clothes tommy helen had said from the bed as shed watched him dressing for the day an early morning cup of tea balanced on her growing bump did i mention your mother phoned yesterday she wanted to report that shed finally found the christening booties after spending days rooting round the apparently spiderandpoisonoussnakeinfested attics in cornwall shes sending them alongthe booties not the spiders and the snakesso be prepared to find them in the post she said a little yellowed with age im afraid she said but certainly nothing that a good launderer couldnt sort out of course i didnt know what to tell her i mean if we dont use your familys christening clothes will jasper felix even be a proper lynley she yawned lord not that tie darling how old is it you look like an etonian on the loose first free weekend across the bridge to windsor and trying to look like one of the lads wherever did you get it lynley unlooped it and replaced it in the wardrobe saying the astonishing thing is that as bachelors men actually dress themselves for years not knowing theyre completely incompetent without a woman at their sides he took out another two ties and held them up for her approval the green she said you know i love the green for work it makes you look so sherlockian i wore the green yesterday helen pooh she said no one will notice believe me no one ever notices mens ties he didnt point out to helen that she was contradicting herself he merely smiled he went across to the bed and sat on the edge of it whatve you got on for today he asked her ive promised simon to work a few hours hes overextended himself again when has he not well hes begging for help preparing a paper on a chemical whatsit applied to whosit to produce thisorthat its all beyond me i just go where he points and attempt to look decorative althoughand here she gazed fondly at her bumpthats soon going to be impossible he kissed her forehead and then her mouth youll always look decorative to me he told her even when youre eightyfive and toothless i plan to keep my teeth right to the grave she informed him theyll be perfectly white completely straight and my gums will not have receded so much as a millimeter im impressed he told her a woman she replied should always have some kind of ambition he laughed then she could always make him laugh it was why she was a necessity to him indeed he could have done with her this morning diverting his thoughts from what was clearly barbara havers death wish if helen was a miracle to him barbara was a puzzle every time he thought hed got her on the road to professional redemption at last she did something to disabuse him of that notion a team player she was not assign her to any action like any other member of an investigation and she was likely to go one of two ways embellish upon the activity until it was unrecognisable or drift her own way and ignore it altogether but right now with five murders demanding action before there was a sixth there was too much at stake for barbara to do anything but what she was told to do when she was told to do it still for all her maddening ways lynley had learned the wisdom of valuing barbaras opinion quite simply shed never been anyones fool so he allowed her to remain in his office as dee harriman went to fetch st james up from the lobby when the three of them were together and st jamess demurral to dees offer of coffee had sent her on her way lynley indicated the round conference table and they sat there as theyd done so often in the past in other locations lynleys first words were the same as well what do we have st james took a sheaf of papers from the manila envelope hed carried with him he made two piles of them one held autopsy reports the other consisted of an enlargement of the marking that had been made in blood on the forehead of kimmo thorne a photocopy of a similar symbol and a neatly typed albeit brief report it took a while st james said therere an inordinate number of symbols out there everything from universal road signs to hieroglyphics but on the whole id say its a fairly straightforward business he handed lynley the photocopy and the enlargement of the mark that had been made upon kimmo thorne lynley laid them side by side as he reached in his jacket for his reading glasses the parts of the symbol were all present in both of the documents the circle the two lines crisscrossing each other within and then extending beyond the circle the cruciform tips at the end of the two lines the same barbara havers said craning her neck to see the two documents what is it simon an alchemical symbol st james said what does it mean lynley asked purification he replied specifically a purification process achieved by burning out impurities id say thats why hes scorching their hands barbara gave a low whistle there is no denial only salvation she murmured and to lynley burning out their impurities sir i think hes saving their souls st james said whats this and looked to lynley who fetched him the copy of the note hed received st james read it frowned and gazed towards the windows in thought it could explain why theres no sexual component to the crime couldnt it is the symbol hes used on the note familiar to you lynley asked his friend st james studied it again youd think it would be after all the icons ive been looking at may i take this with me have at it lynley said weve other copies st james put the paper into his manila envelope he said theres something else tommy whats that call it professional curiosity the autopsies refer to a consistent bruiselike wound on each of the bodies on the left side between two and six inches beneath the armpit apart from one of the bodies where the wound also included two small burns in the centre the description is the same every time pale in the middle darkernearly red in the case of the body from st georges gardens kimmo thorne havers said right darker then round the edges id like to have a look at that wound a photograph will do although id prefer to see one of the bodies can that be arranged on kimmo thorne perhaps has his body been released to the family yet i can arrange it but where are you heading with this im not entirely sure st james admitted but i think it might have to do with how the boys were subdued theres no trace of any drug from toxicology so they werent sedated theres no evidence of a struggle prior to placing restraints round the wrists and ankles so there wasnt an initial assault assuming this isnt some sort of s and m rituala young boy being seduced into kinky sex by an older man who murders him ahead of the sex act and we cant discount that lynley noted right we cant but assuming this has no overt sexual component to it then there has to be a way your killer is managing to tie them up prior to the torture and the killing these are streetwise kids havers noted theyre not likely to have cooperated with some bloke wanting to tie them up for a lark thats very much the case st james agreed and the presence of this consistent wound suggests that the killer knew to expect that from the very first so not only must there be a connection among all the victims which weve already found havers cut in she was beginning to sound excited which lynley knew was never a good sign when it came to keeping her on track simon theres an outreach group called colossus dogooders working with innercity youth kids at risk young offenders its near elephant and castle and two of these dead kids were involved over there two of the identified bodies lynley corrected her one other identified body isnt connected to colossus and there are others still not identified at all barbara yeah but i say this havers argued dig through the records and find out which kids stopped showing up at colossus round the time of those other deaths were dealing with and id say bobs your mums little brother when it comes to identifying the other bodies this is a colossus situation sir one of those blokes has got to be our man theres a strong suggestion they knew their killer st james said as if in agreement with havers theres a good possibility that they trusted him as well and thats another key to what goes on at colossus havers added trust learning to trust sir griff strong told me thats even part of their assessment course and he leads the trust games that some of them do together bloody hell we ought to take a team over there and grill the hell out of him and those three other blokes veness kilfolye and greenham theyve all got a connection to at least one of the victims one of thems dirty i swear it that might be the case and i appreciate your enthusiasm for the task lynley said dryly but youve got an assignment already camden lock market i believe havers had the grace to look chastened she said oh right so perhaps now would be a good time to do it she didnt appear pleased but she didnt argue she got to her feet and plodded towards the door good to see you simon she said to st james cheers and you st james said as she left them he turned back to lynley trouble on that front when is there anything else when it comes to havers ive always thought you considered her worth it i do she is generally close to getting her rank back id give it back to her despite her bloodymindedness but im not the one making the decision hillier as ever lynley leaned back in his chair and took off his glasses he pigeonholed me this morning before i even got to the lift hes been trying to run the investigation through the machinations of the press bureau but the reporters arent being as cooperative as they were in the beginning grateful for the coffee croissants and the scraps of information hilliers been supplying them it seems theyve put it all together now three mixedrace boys murdered in a similar fashion prior to kimmo thorne and so far no appearance on crimewatch by anyone from the met whats that about they want to know what does that say to the community about the relative importance of these deaths to others in which the victim was white blond blueeyed and decidedly anglosaxon theyre starting to ask the hard questions and hes ruing his decision not to fight to keep the press bureau at a greater distance in all this hubris st james noted someones hubris run amok lynley added and things are about to get worse the last murdered boysean laverywas in care living up in swiss cottage with a communityactivist type whohillier told meis having a press conference himself round noon today one can only anticipate what thats going to do to the collective blood lust of the media making hillier his usual pleasure to work with amen the pressures on everywhere lynley looked at the photocopy of the alchemical sign considering the possibilities it offered of shedding light on the situation he said to st james im going to make a phone call id like you to listen in if youve time he looked for the number for hamish robson and found it on the cover sheet of the report that the profiler had given him when he had robson on the phone he switched it to the speaker and introduced him to st james he went through the information that st james had provided and to this he added an acknowledgement of robsons prescience he told him the killer had been in contact has he indeed robson said by phone by post lynley read him the note he said were concluding that the purification symbol on the forehead and the burning of the hands are connected and weve tracked down some information on ambergris oil which was found on the bodies evidently its used for works of wrath or vengeance wrath vengeance purity and salvation robson said id say hes broadcasting his message fairly clearly wouldnt you theres thought here that this is all coming from an outreach programme across the river lynley said its called colossus they work with troubled youth do you want to add anything at this point there was silence for a moment as robson thought this over he finally said we know hes above average intelligence but hes frustrated that the world doesnt see his potential if youve come close to him in the investigation hes not going to put a foot wrong to let you get any nearer so if hes taking boys from one source like colossus lynley added yes if hes taking boys from colossus i very much doubt hell carry on doing so when he sees you there asking questions are you saying the killings themselves will stop they might but only for a time killing provides him too much gratification to stop entirely superintendent the compulsion to kill and the pleasure it yields will always overwhelm the fear of capture but i expect hell take far more care now he may change ground move farther afield if he thinks the police are closing in st james said why get in touch by post ah thats part of the psychopaths sense of invincibility mr st james robson said its evidence of what he sees as his omnipotence the sort of thing that leads to his downfall st james said the sort of thing that convinces him he cant make the one mistake that will doom him its rather like brady attempting to bring the brotherinlaw into the fun and games he thinks hes so mighty a force of personality that no one who knows him would think of turning him in let alone dare to do it its the great flaw in the psychopaths already flawed personality your killer in this case believes you cant touch him no matter how close you get hell ask you outright what evidence you have against him should you question him and hes going to be careful not to give you any henceforth were thinking theres no sexual component to the crimes lynley said which rules out previous category a offenders this is about power robson agreed but so are sex crimes so you may well find something sexual down the line perhaps a sexual degrading of the body should the murder itself not continue to provide the killer his required degree of satisfaction and release is that normally the case st james asked in murders like these its a form of addiction robson said each time he indulges his fantasy of salvation via torture he needs a little bit more to satisfy him the body grows tolerant of the drugwhatever the drugand more is necessary to achieve nirvana so youre saying to expect more with possible variations on the theme yes thats exactly what im saying he wanted to feel it again the soaring that came from within he wanted the sense of freedom that engulfed him in the final moment he wanted to hear his soul cry yes even as the muted shriek below him strained out its last weak no he needed this more he was owed it but when the hunger rose in him as an exigent presence he knew that he couldnt be hasty this left him with the wanting and a bubbling mixture of necessity and duty that he could feel in his veins he was like a diver ascending to the surface too quickly the longing was fast transforming into pain he took some time to attempt a mitigation he drove to the marshes where he could walk the tow path along the river lea there he thought he could seek relief they always panicked when they regained their senses and found themselves strapped down to the board their hands and feet bound and their mouths taped silver as he drove them through the night he could hear them struggling vainly behind him some of them in terror others in anger by the time he reached the appointed place though they had all passed through their preliminary and instinctive reaction and theyd arrived at the bargaining table ill do what you want just let me live they never said this directly but it was there in their frenzied eyes ill do anything be anything say anything think anything just let me live he always stopped in the same safe spot where a dogleg in the ice rinks carpark protected him from view from the street there a spot was wildly overgrown with shrubbery and the security lamp above the area had long ago burnt out he switched off the lightsboth inside and outand climbed into the back he squatted next to the immobilised form and waited till his eyes adjusted to the darkness what he said then was always the same although his voice was gentle as well as regretful youve done wrong and then i shall remove thiswith his fingers on the tapebut only silence will keep you safe and ensure your release can you be silent for me they would nod always desperate to talk to reason to admit sometimes to threaten or to demand but no matter where they began or what they felt they were reduced to supplication they felt his power they could catch the strong scent of it in the oil hed used to anoint his body they saw it in the glint of the knife he brought forth they felt it in the heat from the stove they heard it in the crackle of the pan i dont need to hurt you he would tell them we must talk and if our talk goes well this can end in your freedom talk they would indeed they would babble his recitation of their crimes generally elicited nothing but anxious agreement from them yes i did this yes i am sorry yes i swearto whatever it is you will have me swear just let me go but they added to that mentally and he could read their thoughts you filthy bastard they concluded ill see you sent to hell for this so of course he could not possibly release them at least not in the way they hoped to be released but he was nothing if not a man of his word the burning came first just of the hands to show them his wrath as well as his mercy their declarations of guilt opened the door to their redemption but they had to suffer in order to be cleansed so he taped their mouths again and he held their hands to the whitehot heat till he smelled the odour of searing meat their backs arched for escape and their bladders and their bowels gave way some passed out and did not then feel the garrotte first slide and then tighten round their necks others did not and it was with these that fu felt himself truly exulting as their lives left their bodies and transported his and then he always meant to free their souls using the knife against their earthbound flesh opening them for their final release it was what he had promised them after all they merely had to admit their guilt and express a true desire for redemption but most of them did only the first most of them didnt begin to understand the second the last had done neither to the end hed denied i didnt do nothing you freaking bastard i didnt do nothing you got that straight fuck you motherfucker let me go release then was impossible for him freedom redemption anything fu offered the boy both spat upon and cursed he went unpurified with his soul unreleased a failure on the part of the creature divine but the infinite pleasure of the moment itselfthat had actually remained for fu and that was what he wanted again the seductive narcotic of utter command walking the river lea did not provide it nor did memory only one thing ever could chapter thirteen barbara havers was in a foul mood when she finally reached camden lock market she was angry with herself for having allowed personal considerations to get in the way of properly doing her job she was on edge having to drive all the way back to north london shortly after having already suffered through the morning traffic on the way into the centre of town she was irritated that parking restrictions made it impossible for her to get anywhere close to the market without engaging in a hike and she was selfrighteously positive that this entire engagement was an absolute waste of her time the answers resided within the walls of colossus not here despite the fact that at heart she believed the profiling report was rubbish she was willing to accept at least part of it and that part was the description of their serial killer since at least four men fitted that descriptionall of them employed across the thames at colossusshe knew that she was unlikely to find anyone else so described wandering round the stalls and the shops near camden lock and she certainly didnt expect to find any trace of a suspect at wendys cloud but she knew the wisdom of appearing to walk the straight and narrow for lynley at this point so she fought the traffic and found a distant parking space into which she crammed her mini like the foot of one of the ugly stepsisters then she hoofed it back in the direction of camden lock with its shops its stalls and its restaurants strung along the water and away from chalk farm road wendys cloud was not easy to find as it possessed no signage after reading a directional board and asking round barbara finally located it a simple stall within one of the permanent shops in the market the shop sold candles and candleholders greeting cards jewellery and handmade stationery wendys cloud had massage and aromatherapy oils incense soap and bath crystals on offer the eponymous owner of the establishment sat in a beanbag chair hidden from view behind the counter barbara thought at first she was keeping an eye out for lightfingered customers but when she called excuse me cn i have a word it turned out that wendy was nodding off on a substance that was probably not for sale on her stall her eyelids hung well below halfstaff she didnt so much stagger as claw her way to her feet using one of the legs of the counter and resting her chin for a moment among the bath crystals barbara cursed inwardly with her stringy grey hair and indian bedspread caftan wendy didnt look like a promising wellspring of information instead she looked like a refugee from the hip generation only the love beads round her neck were missing nonetheless barbara introduced herself showed her identification and attempted to stimulate the aging womans brain by mentioning new scotland yard and the words serial and killer in rapid succession she went on to talk about ambergris oil and she asked hopefully about wendys record keeping for a moment she thought that only a quick trip to a long cold shower would bring wendy round but just at the point when she was considering where she might find water with which to douse the woman wendy finally spoke cash n carry was what she said she followed this with sorry barbara took her comments to mean that she did not keep a record of purchases made wendy nodded she went on to add that when she had only one bottle of an oil left in stock she ordered another if of course she remembered to look over the stock at the end of the day when she closed fact was she often forgot to do that and it was only when a customer asked for something specifically that she sometimes realised she needed to place another order this sounded relatively hopeful barbara asked her if she could recall anyone asking for ambergris oil recently wendy frowned then her eyeballs went heavenward into her head as she apparently disappeared into the recesses of her own mind to sort this one out hello barbara called hey wendy you still with me dont bother with her luv someone said from nearby shes been doping up for thirtyodd years not much furniture left in her attic if you know what i mean barbara glanced round and saw that the speaker was sitting at the till of the larger shop in which wendy kept her stall as wendy herself disappeared in the direction of the beanbag chair once more barbara joined the other woman who introduced herself as wendys longsuffering sister pet short for petula she explained shed been allowing wendy to keep her stall in the shop forever but whether she showed up on a given day was something open to chance barbara asked what happened on a day when wendy didnt appear what if someone wanted to buy goods from her then did petbarbara hopedmake the sale for her sister pet shook her head grey like wendys but permed to such a point that it resembled steel wool no dearie shed long ago learned her lesson about enabling the abuser hadnt she wendy was welcome to her space in the shop as long as she paid for it but if she wanted to make money and keep herself out of the gutter in which shed apparently resided for a decade or two prior to wendys cloud she had to suit up show up open up and make the sales her baby sister wasnt about to do it for her so you wouldnt know if someones been purchasing ambergris oil from her barbara said she wouldnt pet told her people came and went all the time in camden lock market weekends as the constable might know were mad round here tourists teenagers dating couples families with small children looking for an inexpensive means of entertainment regular customers pickpockets shoplifters thievesone could hardly be expected to remember who purchased what from ones own shop let alone who was making a purchase from ones sisters establishment no truth of the matter was that if anyone could tell the constable who had made a purchase from wendys cloud it would be wendy herself the unfortunate circumstance was however that wendy spent most of her time in the cloudif the constable knew what petula meant barbara did further she knew there was nothing more to be gained from this useless trip across town she bade pet farewell leaving her mobile number in the unlikely event that wendy happened to descend to earth long enough to recall something pertinent and then she decamped so that the entire adventure would not be a waste barbara made two additional stops the first was at a stall along one of the passageways her collection of mottobearing tshirts always in need of expansion she inspected the offerings at pig co she rejected princess in training and my mum and dad went to camden lock market and all i got was a lousy tshirt and she settled on i brake for alien life forms which was printed below a caricature of the prime minister caught beneath the wheels of a london taxi she made her purchase and decided a quick meal was in order a pause at a stall selling jacket potatoes took care of this she chose a filling of coleslaw prawns and sweet cornone had to make sure ones basic food groups were being addressed at all timesand she took it along with a plastic fork back outside the market where she ate as she engaged in the hike back to her car this took her in the direction of her own home northwest along chalk farm road shed got barely yards from the entrance to camden lock market however when her mobile chimed deep in her shoulder bag forcing her to pause to balance her jacket potato on the top of a rubbish bin at the first street corner and to dig the mobile out perhaps wendy had come round and given her sister some useful information that pet wished to pass along one lived in hope barbara said havers encouragingly and she looked up in time to see a van drive past and park illegally at the side entrance to the stables market an old housing for artillery horses that had long since been put to commercial use just along the street from camden lock she watched it idly as lynley spoke where are you constable camden lock as commanded barbara said no result im afraid ahead of her a man clambered out of the van he was oddly garbed even by coldweather standards in a red elfinlike stocking cap sunglasses fingerless gloves and a bulky black coat dangling to his ankles too bulky a coat barbara thought and she watched him curiously it was the sort of coat one could hide explosives under she gave a closer inspection to his van as he came round to the back of it it was purpleodd enough colour that waswith white lettering on the side barbara positioned herself for a better look at it in her ear lynley continued to speak so get on that directly he was saying you may be right about colossus after all sorry barbara said hastily lost you for a moment sir bad reception bloody mobiles try again lynley said that someone on di stewarts team two had come up with some information on griffin strong evidently mr strong hadnt been as forthcoming as he might have been on the subject of leaving social services prior to his employment at colossus a child had died in care while strong was his social worker at his last posting in stockwell it was time to dig round strong a little deeper lynley gave her the mans home address and told her to begin there he lived in a housing estate on hopetown street east one lynley told her it would be a bit of a drive to get there he could send someone else but as havers had been the one who was most insistent about colossus did he sound regretful barbara wondered making amends suddenly realising that his bad day didnt have to become everyone elses as well it didnt matter shed take what she could get she told him a maddening zigzag down to whitechapel would be just the ticket shed get right on it she said she was in fact trotting back to her car even as they spoke fine lynley said see to it then he rang off before barbara could tell him what shed been considering as she watched the purple van ahead of her and the man at its rear unloading a few boxes from inside purple barbara had been thinking darkness illumination provided only by a streetlamp some yards away and a woman half asleep at a window above she walked over to the van and gave it a look lettering on the side indicated that the vehicle was operated by mr magic with a london phone number that would be the man in the overcoat barbara thought because in addition to concealing explosives the garment was surely suitable for hiding everything from doves to dobermans as shed been sauntering over jacket potato in hand the man had used his foot to slam home the rear doors of the van hed left his hazard lights on no doubt hopeful that this would prevent an enthusiastic traffic warden from ticketing him he saw barbara and said excuse me could i ask youill just be a minute inside taking thisnodding at the two boxes he had in his armsto the stall would you keep an eye out theyre heartless round here when it comes to parking sure barbara said youre mr magic he made a wry face barry minshall actually i wont be a tick cheers he went in the side entrance to the stablesone of at least four markets in the immediate areaand barbara took the opportunity to walk round his van it wasnt a ford transit but that didnt matter because she wasnt considering it as the one they were looking for she knew how long the odds were that an officer on the case would providentially in the street run into the serial killer she happened to be seeking but the idea of the vans colour intrigued her with all it suggested about misinformation wearing the guise of truth barry minshall returned expressing his thanks barbara took the opportunity to ask him what he sold on his stall he spoke of magic tricks videos and gag items he made no mention of any kind of oil barbara listened wondering about the sunglasses he wore considering the weather but after her interlude with wendy she knew the sky was the limit on what one could expect to see in the area she took herself off to her car thoughtful someone had said a red van so theyd been thinking in red throughout the investigation but red was only part of a larger spectrum of colour wasnt it why not something closer to blue it was definitely something they needed to consider when ds winston nkata went up to plugged inn to the lord he went prepared in advance he did the requisite digging round in the background of reverend bram savidge the information he found was enough to arm him to meet the man whod been called the champion of finchley road by both the sunday times magazine and the mail on sunday in special reports about his ministry a press conference was in full swing when nkata entered the shopfrontchurch cum soup kitchen the poor and the homeless usually served by the kitchen during the day had formed themselves into a dispirited queue outside along the pavement most of them had sunk onto their haunches with the sort of inevitable patience evidenced by people whod lived too long on the edge of society nkata felt a twinge as he passed them it was only a twist of circumstance he thought the stalwart love of his parents and the longago intervention of one concerned cop that had kept him from a life among them he experienced the same constriction in his chest that he always experienced when he had to carry out one duty or another among his own people he wondered if hed ever get over it the feeling that somehow hed betrayed them by following a course that most of them did not understand hed seen the same reaction in the eyes of sol oliver when hed walked into his ramshackle car repair shop less than an hour earlier it was part of a shantytown of buildings comprising the narrow street of munro mews in north kensington heavily marked by taggers and graffiti artists blackened with generations of soot and the residue of a fire which had gutted the structure next door the mews itself backed onto golberne road where nkata had left his escort there traffic trundled through a neighbourhood of dingy shops and grubby market stalls between cracked pavements and gutters littered with rubbish sol oliver had been working on an antique volkswagen beetle when nkata came upon him hearing his name the mechanic lifted himself from a contemplation of the cars minuscule engine his gaze had taken in nkata from head to toe and when shown the dss warrant card whatever sol oliver had suspected about nkata settled his features into a permanent expression of distrust yeah hed been put in the picture about sean lavery oliver told him in short order although he didnt sound particularly distressed about the news reverend savidge had phoned with the information he didnt have anything to tell the cops about sean in the days leading up to his death he hadnt seen his son in months when was the last time nkata asked oliver looked at a calendar on the wall as if to stimulate his memory it was hanging below a veritable hammock of cobwebs and above a grimy coffeemaker a mug sat next to this painted in a childs hand with footballs and the single word daddy end of august oliver said you sure nkata asked why you think i killed him or summick oliver set down the crescent wrench he was holding he wiped his hands on a limp blue rag that was bruised with stains look man i dint even know the kid i dnt even want to know him i got a family now and what went on wif me and his mum was just what happens i tol the kid im sorry cleos doing time but no way could i take him in no matter what he wanted thas how it is not like we were married or nuffink nkata did his best to keep his face dispassionate although the last thing he actually felt was disinterest oliver epitomised what was wrong with their men plant the seed because the woman was willing walk away from the consequences with a shrug indifference became the legacy that was passed along from father to son he said whatd he want from you then i cant think he was calling round just to chat like i said wanted to come live wif us dint he me the wife the kids i got two but i couldnt take him i dont got the room an even if i did he looked round as if seeking an explanation hidden within the pungent confines of the old garage we as strangers man him and me he was xpecting i just take him on cos we share blood but i couldnt do that see he needed to get on wif his life thas what i did thas what we all do he seemed to read censure on nkatas face because he went on with its not like his mum wanted me round innit shes in the club int she but its not like she tol me till i run into her on the street when shes bout ready to pop thas when she says its my kid right but how do i know anyways she never comes to me afer hes born either she goes her way i go mine then hes thirteen and comes round wanting me as a dad but i dont feel like his dad i dont know him oliver picked up his crescent wrench again obviously ready to go back to work like i say im sorry bout his mum getting herself locked up but its not like im responsible for it right nkata thought now as he entered plugged inn to the lord and took a position to one side of the room he felt certain they could cross sol oliver from whatever list of suspects they were generating the mechanic hadnt possessed enough interest in sean laverys life to have seen to his death the same however couldnt be said for reverend bram savidge when nkata had done his homework on the man hed found there were elements of his background that needed exploration not the least of which was why hed lied to superintendent lynley about the removal from his home of three boys whod once been in his care dressed in african garb of caftan and head covering savidge was at a lectern that held three microphones the bright lights needed by a television crew shone upon him as he spoke directly to journalists who occupied four rows of chairs hed managed to pull together a good audience and he was making the most of it so were left with nothing but questions he was saying theyre the reasonable questions of any concerned community but theyre also the questions that habitually go ignored in circumstances where the police response is defined by the communitys colour well we demand an end to that five deaths and counting ladies and gentlemen with the metropolitan police waiting until death number four to finally get round to setting up a task force to investigate and why is that his gaze swept over them only the metropolitan police can tell us he began to thunder at this point touching on every topic that any reasonable person of colour would be asking everything from why the earlier murders werent investigated thoroughly to why no warnings had been posted on the streets there was an appropriate murmur among the journalists in response to this but savidge didnt rest on any laurels instead he said and you lot for shame you are the whited sepulchres of our society for you have abnegated your responsibility to the public every bit as much as have the police these killings have ranked as news not worthy enough to merit frontpage attention so whats it going to take for you to acknowledge that a life is a life no matter its colour that any lifes worthy that its loved and mourned the sin of indifference should weigh on your shoulders every bit as heavily as it weighs on the shoulders of the police the blood of these boys cries out for justice and the black community will not rest till justice is done thats all i have to say reporters leapt to their feet of course the entire enterprise had been designed for that they clamoured for reverend savidges attention but he did everything save bathe his hands in their presence before he disappeared through a door leading to somewhere at the back of the establishment he left behind a man who stepped to the lectern and identified himself as the solicitor for cleopatra lavery the incarcerated mother of the fifth murder victim whose interests he was representing she too had a message for the media and he would read it to them forthwith nkata didnt remain to hear cleopatra laverys words instead he skirted round the side of the room and he made his way to the door bram savidge had used it was guarded by a man in hieratic black robes he shook his head at nkata and crossed his arms nkata showed him his identification scotland yard he said the guard took a moment to evaluate this before he told nkata to wait he went through to an office returning in a moment to say that reverend savidge would see him behind the door nkata found savidge waiting for him positioned in a corner of the small room on either side of him framed photographs hung savidge in africa one black face among millions the reverend asked to see his identification as if not believing what his bodyguard had told him nkata handed it over and inspected savidge much as savidge inspected him he wondered if the ministers background was sufficient explanation for his adoption of all things african nkata knew that savidge had grown up in ruislip the decidedly middleclass child of an airtraffic controller and a science teacher savidge handed nkatas id back to him so youre the sop are you he asked how stupid does the met actually think i am nkata met savidges eyes and he held them for five seconds before he spoke telling himself the other man was angry and with very good reason there was truth to what he was saying as well he said we got something wants clarifying mr savidge thought it best f i come to do it in person savidge didnt reply at once as if he were taking the measure of nkatas refusal to rise to his baiting he finally said what wants clarifying the boys you had in care you told my guv that you had three of the four boys you were foster dad to placed in other homes cos of your wife her not speaking good english or something i think you said yes savidge said although he sounded wary onis learning the language if youd like to see for yourself nkata moved his hand in a notwhatiwant gesture he said im sure shes learning english all right but fact is reverend you dint have the boys put somewhere else they were taken away by social services before you ever married your wife and what i dont unnerstan is why you lied bout that to superintendent lynley when you mustve figured wed be looking into you reverend savidge didnt answer at once a knock sounded at the door it opened and the guard stuck his head inside sky news want to know will you give them a word on camera with their reporter theyve had my word savidge replied clear the whole lot out of here weve people to feed the man said right and closed the door again savidge went to his desk and sat behind it he gestured to a chair for nkata nkata said you want to tell me about it arrest for lewd conduct was what the records said howd you get the matter settled without more in the files it was a misunderstanding what sort of misunderstanding ends up with n arrest for lewd conduct mr savidge the sort that comes from having neighbours whore waiting with bated breath for the black man to put a step wrong meaning i sunbathe in the nude in the summer when we actually have a summer a neighbour saw me one of the boys had come out of the house and he decided to join me that was it what two blokes lying starkers on the lawn or something not exactly then what savidge pressed his fingers together beneath his chin as if considering whether to go on he made his decision the neighbourit was ridiculous she saw the boy undressing she saw me helping him with his shirt or his trousers i dont know which she leapt to an hysterical conclusion and she made a phone call the result was an unpleasant few hours with the local authorities in the person of an aging police constable whose brains didnt equal the leaps his imagination was making social services swept in and took the boys off and i ended up explaining myself to a magistrate by the time the matter was officially sorted out the boys were in other homes and it seemed heartless to uproot them once again sean was my first placement since then thats it thats it a naked male adult a naked male adolescent a rare bit of sunshine end of story not quite of course nkata thought there was the reason as well but he reckoned he knew what it was savidge was black enough for a white society to label him a minority but he was far from black enough to be enthusiastically embraced by his brothers the reverend was hoping that the summer sun could give him briefly what nature and genetics had denied him and the rest of the year in a tanning bed could do much the same nkata thought about the irony of it and about how mankinds behaviour was so often dictated by the sheer and lunatic misperception that went by the name not good enough not white enough here not black enough there too ethnic for one group too english for another at the end of the day he believed savidges story of naked suntans in the garden it was just on the right side of madness to be true he said i had a word with sol oliver over in north kensington he says sean came asking to live with him that doesnt surprise me life wasnt easy for sean hed lost his mother to prison and hed been shuffled round the system for two years by the time i got him i was his fifth placement and he was tired of it all if he could talk his dad into taking him in at least hed be somewhere permanently thats what he wanted its hardly an unreasonable hope howd he find out about oliver from cleopatra i suppose his mum shes in holloway he visited her every chance he got when it could be arranged anyplace else he went aside from colossus bodybuilding theres a gym up finchley road just a bit square four gym i told your superintendent about it after colossus sean would stop here to check in with mesay hello and whateverand then hed head either home or to that gym savidge seemed to reflect on this piece of information for a moment then he went on reflectively i expect it was the men that drew him there although i didnt think about that at the time what did you think about just that it was good he had an outlet he was angry he felt hed been dealt a rotten hand in life and he wanted to change it but now i seethe gymit could have been how he was trying to make that change through the men who go there nkata sharpened to this in what way not in the way youre thinking savidge said then how how in the way of all boys sean had a hunger and a thirst for men that he could admire thats normal enough i just pray to god that wasnt what killed him hopetown road glided east off brick lane deep within a crowded area of london that had been through at least three incarnations within barbara havers lifetime the neighbourhood still held a multitude of grimylooking wholesale garment shops and at least one brewery belching the scent of yeast into the air but over the years its inhabitants had altered from jewish to caribbean to bengali brick lane was attempting to make the most of its current ethnicity foreign restaurants abounded and along the pavement and the streetlampsheralded at the bottom of the street by a fanciful archway wrought of iron with a vaguely mosquelike shapebore ornate fixtures suspended among filigreeiron decoration not what youd see in chalk farm barbara thought she found griffin strongs home directly across from a little green where hillocks offered children an area in which to play and a wooden bench offered their minders a place to sit the strong residence was one of a line of redbrick plain terraced houses their individuality expressed in their choice of front doors and front fences and in what theyd decided to do with their patch of front gardens the strongs had opted for a draughtsboard pattern of large tiles on the ground and theyd covered them with an array of pot plants that someone had been tending with devotion their fence was brick like the house and their door was oak with an oval of stained glass in the middle all very nice barbara noted when she rang the bell a woman answered she had a crying baby on her shoulder and magenta workout attire on her body she said yes over the sound of an exercise programme coming from within the house barbara showed her identification she said shed appreciate a word with mr strong if he was about are you mrs strong she added im arabella strong the woman said come in please just let me get tatiana settled and she carried the squalling infant into the reaches of the house leaving barbara to mouth tatiana and to follow in her wake in the sitting room arabella laid the baby on a leather sofa where a small pink blanket was topped by a smaller pink hotwater bottle she put the baby on her back wedged her in place with pillows and set the hotwater bottle on her abdomen colic she said to barbara over the noise the warm seems to help that proved to be true in a few moments tatianas screaming subsided to whimpering so that the remaining din in the room came only from the telly there via video and to the accompanying kaboomdiddyboom of music an impossibly sculpted woman was panting lower abs come on lower abs come on as she rhythmically thrust her legs and hips into the air from a supine position as barbara watched the woman suddenly leaped to her feet and gave the camera a sideways view of her stomach it was as flat as a dutch horizon gone vertical she was obviously someone who ignored the better things in life like poptarts kettle crisps battered cod and chips soaked in vinegar miserable cow arabella used the remote to switch off the television and the video recorder she said i expect shes at that at least sixteen hours a day what do you think rubens is rolling in his grave you ask me and she needs to be put out of my misery arabella chuckled she sank onto the sofa next to her baby and motioned to a chair for barbara she reached for a towel and pressed it against her forehead she said griff isnt here hes at the factory weve a silkscreen business where is it exactly barbara sat and dug her notebook from her shoulder bag she flipped it open to take down the address arabella gave it to herit was in quaker streetand watched as barbara wrote this down she said this is about that boy isnt it the one who was murdered griff told me about him kimmo thorne he was called and about the other boy whos gone missing sean seans dead as well his foster dads identified him arabella glanced at her baby as if in reaction to this im sorry griffs devastated about kimmo hell feel the same when he hears about sean not the first time someone died on his watch i understand arabella smoothed tatianas hairless head her expression soft before she replied as i said hes devastated and he had nothing to do with either boys death with any death at colossus or otherwise it makes him look a bit careless though if you know what i mean as it happens i dont careless with other peoples lives or bloody unlucky which do you reckon it is arabella stood she went to a metal bookshelf at one side of the room and took up a packet of cigarettes she lit one jerkily and just as jerkily inhaled virginia slims barbara saw that figured mental imaging or something and arabella needed it she had her work cut out for her getting back into shape she was pretty enoughgood skin nice eyes dark silky hairbut she looked as if shed gained a few stone too many during her pregnancy eating for two shed probably told herself if its alibis youre afterthat is what your sort look for isnt itthen griffs got one her name is ulrike ellis if youve been to colossus youve met her this was a truly interesting turn not the fact of ulrike and griff which barbara had already assumed was a probability but the fact that arabella knew about ulrike and griff and didnt appear upset about them what was that all about arabella seemed to read her mind my husbands weak she said but all men are weak when a woman marries she marries knowing this and she decides in advance what shes going to accept when it eventually crops up she never knows how the weakness is going to manifest itself but i suppose thats part of thethe journey of discovery will it be drink food gambling excessive work other women pornography football hooliganism addiction to sports addiction to drugs in griffs case it turned out to be an inability to say no to women but thats hardly a surprise considering how they throw themselves at him tough to be married to someone so barbara looked for the right word beautiful godlike arabella offered apollo narcissus whoever no its not difficult at all griff and i plan to stay married to each other were both from broken homes and we dont intend that for tatiana as it happens ive been able to put it all in perspective there are worse things than a man who gives in to womens advances griffs been through this before constable doubtless hell go through it again hearing this barbara wanted to shake the bewilderment out of her head she was used to the idea of women fighting for their men or women seeking revenge after an infidelity or women harming themselvesor others for that matterwhen faced with an adulterous spouse but this calm analysis acceptance and cest la vie barbara couldnt decide if arabella strong was mature philosophical desperate or simply mad as a hatter she said so hows ulrike his alibi compare the dates of the murders with his absences from home hell have been with her all night enough of it and wasnt that just bloody convenient barbara wondered how many phone calls had been placed among the three of them to cook this one up she also wondered how much of arabellas placid acceptance was placid acceptance and how much was actually the result of the vulnerability a woman felt once she had a child to care for arabella needed her man to bring home the bacon if she herself wanted to stay home and care for tatiana barbara flipped her notebook closed and thanked arabella for her time and her willingness to speak openly about her husband she knew that if anything more was to be gained from this journey to east london it wasnt going to turn up here back at her car she dug out the a to z and looked up quaker street luck was with her for once she found it was just south of the railway tracks leading to liverpool street station it appeared to be a short oneway thoroughfare that connected brick lane to commercial street she could walk there and work off at least one mouthful of her mornings poptart the jacket potato shed inhaled at camden lock would have to wait were having a devil of a time with all the phone calls tommy john stewart said the di had laid a neatly clipped document precisely in front of him as he spoke he lined up the corners of it within the curve of the conference table he straightened his tie checked his fingernails and gazed round the room as if to assess its condition reminding lynley as he always did that stewarts wife had probably had more than one reason for ending their marriage weve got parents clamouring from all over the country he went on two hundred with missing kids at this point we need more help on the phones they were in lynleys office trying to work out a change in the deployment of the personnel they didnt have enough manpower and stewart was right but hillier had refused to give them more without the magical production of a result lynley thought hed had that with the identification of yet another body fourteenyearold anton reid whod been the first victim of their killer his body left in gunnersbury park a mixedrace boy anton had disappeared from furzedown on the eighth of september hed been a gang member with arrests for malicious mischief trespassing petty theft and assault all of which had been relayed to new scotland yard earlier in the day by the mitcham road police station whod admitted having written anton off as yet another runaway when his parents first reported him missing the newspapers were going to be in a filthy uproar over that piece of data hillier had told lynley at some considerable volume on the phone when he was given the news so when the hell did the superintendent intend to have something to present to the press office other than a bleeding identity for another sodding body get on it had been the acs parting remark i dont expect you lot need me down there wiping your arses or do you lynley had held his tongue and his temper hed called stewart into his office and there they sat sorting through the action reports finally and definitively there was nothing from vice on any of the identified boys beyond kimmo thorne aside from kimmo none of them were engaged in illicit sex as rent boys transvestites or streetwalkers and despite their otherwise chequered histories none of them could be associated with either the sale or the purchase of drugs the interview with the taxi driver whod discovered sean laverys body in the shand street tunnel had given them nothing a background check on the man had shown a perfectly clean record without even a parking ticket to mar his reputation the mazda in the tunnel could be associated with no one even tangentially involved in the investigation with its number plates missing its engine gone and its body torched there was no way to tell whose it was and no witness could attest to how it had ended up in the tunnel in the first place or even how long it had been there thats a real nonstarter was how stewart put it were better off using the manpower elsewhere i suggest we have a rethink on those blokes surveilling the crime scenes as well nothing there sod all christ how can no one not have seen anything worth reporting lynley knew his question would be taken as rhetorical and it was he also knew the answer big city people on the underground and in the street all avoiding each others eyes the publics philosophy of see nothing hear nothing leave me alone was the very plague of their jobs as cops youd think someone would at least have seen a car being torched or a car on fire for the love of god as to that stewart flipped through his neatly assembled paperwork weve had a wee bit of joy from background to the point robbie kilfoyle and jack veness two of the blokes from colossus both of the colossus men as things turned out had juvenile records kilfoyles stuff was relatively minor stewart offered a list of truancy problems vandalism reported by neighbours and looking in windows where he didnt belong saying all meagre pickings except for the fact that he was dishonourably discharged from the army for continually going awol how does that relate i was thinking of the profile disciplinary problems failure to obey orders it seems to fit if you stretch it lynley said before stewart could take offence he added what else more on kilfoyle hes got a job delivering sandwiches by bicycle round lunchtime with an organisation called he referred to his notes mr sandwich thats how he ended up at colossus by the way he delivered there got to know them and started working as a volunteer after his sandwich hours hes been there for the last few years where is this place lynley asked mr sandwich its on gabriels wharf and when lynley looked up at this stewart smiled right you are home of crystal moon well done john what about veness even more joy hes a former colossus boy been there since he was thirteen years old a little arsonist he was started out with small fires in the neighbourhood but he escalated things to torching vehicles and then a whole squat got caught for that one did some time in borstal hooked up with colossus afterwards hes their shining example now trot him out to their fundraisers they do he gives the official spiel on how colossus saved his life after which the hats passed round or whatever his living situation veness stewart referred to his notes hes got a room over in bermondsey hes not far from the market as it happens kimmo thorne flogging stolen silver and all that if you recall as for kilfoylehes got digs in granville square islington smart part of town for a sandwichdelivery boy lynley remarked check on it get on to the other bloke neil greenham as well according to barbaras report she actually made a report stewart asked what miracle brought that about he taught at a primary school in north london lynley plunged on had a disagreement of some sort with his superior about discipline apparently it resulted in his resignation have someone get on to that will do stewart made a note a knock on the door brought barbara havers into the office then close on her heels was winston nkata with whom she was in terse conversation she looked excited nkata looked interested lynley grew momentarily heartened by the idea that progress might actually be about to occur havers said its colossus got to be listen to this griffin strongs silkscreening business just happens to be in quaker street sound familiar it did to me turns out hes got a smallish factory in one of the warehouses and when i asked round in the area to suss out which one an old bloke on the pavement shook his head made some grave mutterings like the ghost of christmas past and pointed out the spot whereas he put itthe devil made his presence known which meant lynley asked that one of the bodies was found not two doors down from our mr strongs secondary means of employment guv the third of the bodies as it turned out which sounded too bloody coincidental to be coincidental so i checked out the rest and listen to this she stuck half of her arm into her enormous shoulder bag and after some struggle pulled out her tattered spiral notebook she ran a hand through her hairdoing nothing to improve its overall dishevelled lookand went on jack veness number eight grange walk not even a mile from the shand street tunnel robbie kilfoyle sixteen granville square sneezing distance from st georges gardens ulrike ellis twofiveeight gloucester terrace just round two corners from a multistorey carpark the multistorey carpark if you know what i mean this has got to be a colossus situation start to finish if the bodies themselves didnt scream that at us where the bodies were put bloody well does the gunnersbury park body john stewart asked hed been listening with his head cocked and his face wore an expression of paternal indulgence which lynley knew that havers would particularly loathe i havent got to that one yet she admitted but odds are that body from gunnersbury park is someone else from colossus and bigger odds are that gunnersbury park is a hop and a jump from where a colossus employee lives so all we have to do is get the names and addresses of everyone who works there of volunteers as well because believe me sir someone insides trying to paint the place black john stewart shook his head i dont like it tommy a serial killer choosing his victims from within his immediate sphere i cant see how that plays with what we know about serial killers in general and this one in particular we know this is an intelligent bloke were dealing with and its damned lunacy to think hed work there volunteer there or do anything else there hed know wed twig it eventually and then what when were hot on his tail whats he going to do havers countered you cant be thinking its some major coincidence that every body weve been able to identify just happens to be associated with colossus stewart shot her a look and she added sir as an afterthought with respect that doesnt make sense she pulled out another notebook from her battered shoulder bag lynley saw it was the signingin register theyd taken surreptitiously from the reception desk at colossus earlier she opened it riffling through a few pages as she said and listen to this i had a look through this on my way back from the east end just now youre not going to believebloody hell what liars she leafed through the book and read aloud as she flipped through the pages jared salvatore eleven am jared salvatore twoten pm jared salvatore nineforty am jared bloody blooming salvatore three twentytwo pm she slapped the notebook down on the conference table it slithered across and knocked john stewarts neatly compiled notes to the floor am i right that no cookery school in london knows the first thing about jared salvatore well why would they when he was doing his cookery course at colossus all along our killers right there inside that place hes picking and choosing hes setting things up like a pro and he doesnt expect us to catch him at any of it that fits in with something robson pointed out lynley said the sense of omnipotence the killer must have how big a leap is it from putting bodies in public places to be working within the walls of colossus in both cases he doesnt expect to be caught we need to get every one of these blokes under surveillance havers said and we need to do it now we havent the manpower for that john stewart said then weve got to get it and weve also got to grill each one of them dig into their backgrounds ask them as ive said weve a manpower issue here di stewart turned away from havers he didnt look pleased to have her grabbing control of the meeting lets not forget that tommy and if our killers inside colossus as the constables suggesting then wed better start looking at everyone else who works there as well and at the other clients whore attached to the place the participants or patients whatever the hell they call themselves i expect there are enough juniorlevel villains running round that place to fuel a dozen killings thats a waste of our time havers insisted and sir listen to me to lynley he cut in your points are well taken havers what did you get from griffin strong about the child who died on his watch in stockwell the constable hesitated she looked abashed bloody hell di john stewart said havers did you not look when i heard about the body in the warehouse she began quickly only to be cut off by stewart so you havent looked into the other yet its a death on strongs watch in stockwell woman does that ring any damn bells for you im getting on to it i came straight back i went to the files for this other information first because i thought you thought you thought stewarts voice was sharp its not your job to do the bloody thinking when youre given an order his fist hit the table jesus what the hell is it that keeps them from giving you the sack havers id damn well like to know your secret because whatevers keeping you here isnt between your ears and i sure as hell dont think its between your legs havers face went completely white she said you completely sodding piece of thatll do lynley said sharply youre both out of order shes that bastard just said enough keep it out of this office and out of this investigation or both of you are permanently off the case christ but we have enough trouble already without you two going for each others throats he paused waiting for his blood to cool in the silence stewart shot havers a look that clearly assessed her as an impossible cow and havers herself seethed openly back at him a man with whom shed long ago managed to work for only three weeks before charging him with sexual harassment meanwhile winston nkata remained by the door in the position he nearly always adopted when placed in a room with more than two white colleagues he stood with his arms crossed and merely observed as he had been doing since hed walked in lynley turned to him wearily what have you got for us winnie nkata reported on his meetings first with sol oliver in his car repair shop then with bram savidge he went on with his visit to the gym where sean lavery did his workouts he concluded with something that diffused the tension in the room he might have found someone whod actually seen the killer there was some white bloke hanging round the gym not long before sean went missing nkata said he got noticed cause not many whites use the place seems one night he was lurking in the corridor just outside the workout room and when one of the lifters asked him what did he want he said he was new to the neighbourhood and just looking round for a place to work out he never did go in though not to the gym not to the locker room not to the steam room didnt ask about membership or anything like it just showed up in the corridor did you get a description arranging for an efit bloke at the gym thinks he might be able to come up with a drawing of this bugger right off he was able to tell me no way did the villain belong there not a lifter at all he said smallish and thin long face i think we got a chance here super well done winnie lynley said thats what i call good work john stewart put in pointedly ill have you on my team anytime winston and congratulations on the promotion i dont think i mentioned it earlier john lynley tried for patience he waited till he found it before he went on take the salt outside please phone hillier see if you can get manpower for surveillance winston weve got kilfoyle working at a place called mr sandwich back at gabriels wharf try to make a connection between him and crystal moon there was a general shuffling as the men went on their way leaving havers behind for lynley to deal with he waited till the door was shut to do so she spoke first her voice low but still hot i dont have to bloody put up with i know lynley said barbara i know he was out of order you were in the right to react but the other side of the coin whether you want to see it or not is that you provoked him i provoked him i provoked him to say she seemed unable to finish she sank into a chair sometimes i dont even know you sometimes he replied i dont know myself then you didnt provoke the words lynley interrupted they were inexcusable but you provoked the fact of the words their existence if you will he joined her at the table he was feeling exasperated and that was not a good sign exasperation meant he might soon run out of ideas on how to get barbara havers back into her position as a detective sergeant it also meant he might soon run out of the willingness to do so he said barbara you know the drill teamwork responsibility taking an action thats been assigned and completing it turning over the report waiting for the next assignment when you have a situation like this one in which thirtyodd people are relying upon you to do what youve been told to do he lifted a hand and then dropped it havers watched him he watched her and then it was as if a veil somehow lifted between them and she understood she said im sorry sir what can i say you dont need more pressure and i pile it on dont i she moved restlessly in her chair and lynley knew she was longing for a cigarette for something to do with her hands for something to jolt her brain he felt like giving her permission to smoke he also felt like allowing her to squirm something had to give somewhere in the damn woman or she was going to be lost for good she said sometimes i get so bloody sick of everything in life being such a struggle you know he said whats going on at home she chuckled she was slumped in her chair and she straightened her back no were not taking a stroll on that path youve enough to cope with superintendent all things considered a family dispute over two sets of christening clothes is hardly something to cope with lynley said dryly and ive a wife politically adept enough to negotiate a truce between the inlaws havers smiled it seemed in spite of herself i didnt mean at home and you know it he smiled in turn yes i know youre getting a platterful from upstairs i expect suffice it to say im learning how much malcolm webberly actually had to put up with to keep hillier and everyone else off our backs all these years hillier sees you hot on his tail havers said a few more steps up the ladder and whammoyoure heading up the met and hes pulling his forelock i dont want to head up the met lynley said sometimes he looked round the office hed agreed to inhabit temporarily the two sets of windows that ludicrously indicated a rise in rank the conference table at which he and havers sat carpet tiles on the floor instead of lino and outside beyond the door the men and women under his command for the moment it was meaningless really at the end of the day and it was far less important than what faced him now he said havers i think youre right of course im right she replied anyone watching i dont mean about hillier i mean about colossus hes choosing kids from there so he has to be connected somehow it flies in the face of what we usually expect from a serial killer but on the other hand how different is it really from peter sutcliffe picking up prostitutes or the wests going for hitchhiking girls or someone targeting women walking dogs across parks or on commons or someone else always choosing an open window at nighttime and an elderly woman he knows is alone within our mans doing whats worked for him and considering hes managed to pull it off five times without getting caughtwithout for the love of god even being noticedwhy shouldnt he simply keep on doing it so you think the rest of the bodies are colossus boys as well i do he said and since the boys weve identified so far have been throwaways to everyone but their families our killer hasnt had to worry about detection so whats next gather more information lynley rose and considered her disastrous of appearance and utterly headstrong maddening unto the death of him but she was quick as well which was why hed learned to value having her at his side he said heres the irony barbara what she said john stewart agreed with your assessment he said as much before you walked into the office he thinks it may be colossus as well you might have discovered that had i kept my mug plugged havers shoved her chair back preparatory to getting to her feet so am i supposed to crawl curry favour create my own forelock to pull bring in coffee at eleven and tea at four what try staying out of trouble for once lynley said try doing what youre told which is what at this point griffin strong and the boy who died while strong was with social services in stockwell but the other bodies havers no ones arguing with you about the other bodies but were not going to leapfrog through this investigation no matter how much youd like to do so youve won a round now see to the rest right she said although she sounded reluctant even as she picked up her shoulder bag to get back to work she headed for the door and then stopped turned back to face him which round was that she asked him you know which round he told her in reply no boys safe if he ends up getting assigned to a spell at colossus chapter fourteen anton what ulrike ellis said into the telephone could you spell the surname please on the other end of the line the detective whose name ulrike had already schooled herself to forget spelled out reid he added that the parents of anton reid whod gone missing from furzedown and had finally been identified as the first victim of the serial killer whod so far murdered five boys in london had listed colossus as one of the places that their son had frequented in the months leading up to his death could the director confirm that please and a list of all anton reids contacts within colossus would be necessary madam ulrike did not indulge in a misinterpretation of the courtesy behind the request but she temporised nonetheless furzedown is south of the river and as were well known here constable she waited for a name eyre he said constable eyre she repeated what im saying is that its a possibility that this boyanton reidmerely told his parents he was involved with colossus while using the time to do something else it happens you know he came to you through youth offenders according to the parents you should have the records youth offenders is it then ill have to check if you could give me your number ill go through the files we do know hes one of yours madam you may know that constable eyre he said yes of course you may know that constable eyre but at this moment i do not now i shall have to go through our files so if you give me your number ill get back to you he had no choice he could get a search warrant but that would take time and she was cooperating no one could claim otherwise she was merely cooperating within the structure of her schedule not within the structure of his the detective constable recited his phone number and ulrike took it down she had no intention of using itreporting to him like a schoolgirl hauled onto the headmistresss carpetbut she wanted to have it to wave in front of whomever turned up to gather information on anton reid because someone would definitely turn up at colossus her job was to develop a plan to handle things when the moment arrived off the phone she went to the filing cabinet she rued the system she had developed the hardcopy backup to computer files pressed to it she could have done something about material left upon hard drives even if shed had to reformat every miserable computer in the building but the cops whod come to colossus had already seen her fingering through files in an ostensible search for jared salvatores paperwork so theyd be highly unlikely to believe that some boys had electronic documents while others did not still antons folder could go the way of jareds the rest was easy enough to accomplish she had antons file halfway out of the drawer when she heard jack veness just outside her door he said ulrike could i have a word and he opened the door without further ado she said do not do that jack ive told you before i knocked he protested step one yes you knocked very nice now lets work on step two which is all about waiting for me to tell you to come in his nostrils moved white round the edges he said whatever you say ulrike and he turned to go always the manipulative petulant adolescent despite his age which was what twentyseven twentyeight damn the man she didnt need this now she said what do you want jack nothing he said just something i thought you might like to know games games games yes well if i might like to know why dont you tell me he turned back its gone thats all whats gone the signingin book from reception i thought i mustve misplaced it when i packed up last night but ive looked everywhere its definitely gone gone gone vanished disappeared abracadabra into thin air ulrike rested back on her heels her mind wheeled through the possibilities and she disliked every one of them jack said helpfully robbie might have taken it for some reason or maybe griff has it hes got a key to be in here after hours doesnt he this was too much she said what would robbie griff or anyone else want with a signingin book jack shrugged elaborately and drove his fists into the pockets of his jeans when did you notice it was missing not till the first kids got here today i went for the book but it wasnt there like i said i figured i misplaced it last night when i was packing up so i just started another one till i could find the one thats missing which i couldnt so i reckon someone nicked it off my desk ulrike thought about the previous day the police she said when you came to fetch me you left them alone in reception yeah thats what i reckoned s well only heres the thing i cant suss out what they want with our signingin book can you ulrike turned from his smug and comprehending face she said thank you for letting me know jack do you want me to thank you she repeated firmly is there anything else no then you can get back to work when jack left her after a little mock salute and a click of the heels that she was meant to take as amusing and did not ulrike shoved anton reids paperwork back into place she slammed the filing drawer home and went for the phone she punched in griffin strongs mobile number he was meeting with a new assessment group their first day together icebreaking activities he didnt like to be interrupted whenever the kids were in circle as they called it but this interruption couldnt be helped and he would know that when he heard what she had to say he said yeah impatiently what did you do with the file she asked him asordered she could tell he chose the word deliberately as mocking as was jacks sarcastic salute he hadnt yet twigged who stood in jeopardy here but he would presently he said that all dead silence in the background told her every member of his assessment group was listening to his end of the exchange she found a bitter satisfaction in that fine griffin she thought lets see how well you can carry on now no she told him the police know griff know what exactly that jared salvatore was one of ours they took the reception book yesterday theyll have seen his name silence then shit on a breath then a whisper god damn it why didnt you think of that i might ask the same of you whats that supposed to mean anton reid she said silence again griffin she told him you need to understand something youve been an exceptional fuck but i wont let anyone destroy colossus she replaced the phone carefully and quietly let him hang there she thought she turned to her computer on it she accessed the electronic information they had on jared salvatore it wasnt as extensive as had been the documents in his file but it would do she chose the print option then she picked up the number that detective constable eyre had given her only minutes ago he answered immediately saying eyre she said constable ive come up with some information youll probably want to pass this along nkata let the computer do the work for him on the postal codes amassed by the owner of crystal moon while gigithe shops ownerwould use them to prove the need for a branch of her business in a second location somewhere in london nkata intended to use them to make a match between the customers of crystal moon and the body sites after reflecting on what barb havers had said on the subject of body sites however he decided to expand his search to include a comparison between the postal codes gathered by crystal moon and the postal codes of all colossus employees this took him more time than hed expected at the colossus end of things giving out postal codes to the cops was not an idea that anyone immediately embraced when he finally had what he wanted he printed out the document and studied it contemplatively ultimately he passed it over to di stewart to relay along to hillier when he made his request for the manpower to run more surveillance he was donning his overcoat to head back out over to gabriels wharf to see to the next part of his assignment when lynley came to the door of the incident room and said his name quietly adding were wanted upstairs were wanted upstairs meant only one thing the fact that hillier was asking for them nowa few hours after the press conference called by reverend bram savidgesuggested the meeting was not going to be pleasant nkata joined lynley but he did not remove his overcoat i was heading to gabriels wharf he told the acting superintendent hoping this would be enough to get him off the hook this wont hold you up long lynley said it sounded like a promise they took the stairs nkata said as they climbed i think barbs right guv about colossus i got a match on one of the postal codes from crystal moon i passed it along to di stewart and robbie kilfoyle hes got the same postal code as someone who shopped in crystal moon does he indeed lynley stopped on the stairs he seemed to think about the information for a moment then he said still its only a postal code winnie he shares it withwhat how many thousand people and his employment is on the wharf as well isnt it directly next to crystal moon nkata admitted the sandwich shop then i dont know how much weight we can give it as much as wed like to its something i agree which is what we need nkata cut in something but unless we know what he boughtyou see the difficulty dont you yeah he works there on the wharf for god knows how long hes probly bought something off that shop and every other shop over time exactly but speak to them all the same in hilliers suite judi macintosh ushered them in at once hillier was waiting for them standing framed by the multiple panes of his windows and the view they offered of st jamess park he was studying this view as they entered at his fingertips on the credenza beneath the window a newspaper lay neatly folded hillier turned as if for an unseen camera he picked up the paper and let it fall open so that he held the front page like a towel that covered his genitals he said evenly how did this happen nkata saw it was the latest evening standard the story on the front page dealt with the press conference that bram savidge had called earlier in the day the headline spoke of a foster fathers anguish anguish had not been among the reactions to sean laverys death that nkata would have ascribed to savidge but he realised that anguish was more likely to sell copies of the paper than was justifiable fury at police incompetence although truth to tell it would have been close hillier went on tossing the standard onto his desk he said to lynley you superintendent are supposed to be managing the victims families not giving them access to the media its part of the job so why arent you doing it have you any idea what hes said to the press hillier stabbed at the paper as he made each following declaration institutional racism police incompetence endemic corruption all accompanied by calls for a thorough investigation by the home office a parliamentary sub committee the prime minister or anyone else whos willing to take up the subject of house sweeping which is what he accuses us of needing round here he brushed the paper off of his desk and into the rubbish basket next to it this buggers got their attention he said i want that changed there was something selfsatisfied about hilliers expression that was out of keeping both with his tone and with what he was saying it came to nkata as he observed this that hilliers look had to do with the performance that he was giving rather than with his outrage he wanted to dress lynley down in front of a subordinate officer nkata realised he had the excuse of making that subordinate officer nkata because of the press briefings that had gone before when nkata had sat obediently at his side second cousin to a performing dog he said to hillier before lynley could respond scuse me guv i was at that briefing truth to tell i dint even think to stop it my thought was he cn call the press whenever he wants to call the press his right to do it lynley glanced his way nkata wondered if lynleys pride would allow him to carry off an intervention like this he wasnt sure so before there was an opportunity for the acting superintendent to add something nkata went on i couldve stepped up to the mike right after f course when savidge was done with his piece could be thats what i shouldve done s well but i dint think itd be something youd really want me to do not without you being there he smiled affably at the end of this little black sambo come to london next to him lynley cleared his throat hillier shot him a look then one at nkata he said get things under control lynley i dont want every tom dick and harry running to the press over this well work on that angle specifically lynley said is that all sir the next press briefing hillier gestured rudely towards nkata i want you down there ten minutes prior got it nkata said tapping his skull with his index finger hillier started to say more but then he dismissed them lynley made no comment till they were out of the office beyond hilliers secretary and crossing to victoria block then it was only winston listen as his footsteps slowed dont do that again there was the pride nkata thought hed expected as much but then lynley surprised him theres too much risk for you in taking hillier on even obliquely i appreciate the loyalty but its more important for you to watch your back than to watch mine hes a dangerous enemy dont make him into one he wanted to make you look bad in front of me nkata said i dont like that just thought id return the favour and let him see how it feels that presupposes the ac might think he could ever look bad in front of anyone lynley said wryly they went to the lift lynley pushed the down button he examined it for a moment before he went on on the other hand he said its a suitable irony whats that guv that in giving the rank of sergeant to you and denying it to barbara hillier got more than he bargained for nkata thought about this the lift doors slid open they entered and punched for the floors they needed dyou spose he reckoned id yesguv him right to the grave he asked curiously yes i think thats what he assumed why because he has no idea who you are lynley replied but i expect thats something youve already realised they descended to the floor for the incident room where lynley got off leaving nkata to ride to the underground carpark before the doors closed upon him however the acting superintendent stopped them his hand holding one of them back winston he didnt say anything else for a moment and nkata waited for him to go on when he finally did it was to say thank you all the same he released the lift door and let it slide closed his dark eyes met nkatas for an instant then were gone it was raining when nkata emerged from the underground carpark daylight was fast fading and the rain exacerbated the gloom traffic lights gleamed against the wet streets taillights of vehicles winked in the prisms of the raindrops hitting his windscreen nkata worked his way over to parliament square and inched towards westminster bridge in a queue of taxis buses and government cars as he crossed the river heaved in a grey mass below him puckered with rain and rippled by the incoming tide there a single barge chugged its way in the direction of lambeth and in its wheelhouse a solitary figure kept the craft on its course nkata parked illegally at the south end of gabriels wharf and put a police placard in the window turning up the collar of his coat against the rain he strode into the wharf area where the overhead lights made a cheerful crisscrossing pattern above him and the owner of the bicycle rental shop was wisely wheeling his wares indoors at crystal moon it was gigi this time and not her grandmother who was perched on a stool reading behind the till nkata approached her and showed his police identification she didnt look at it however instead she said gran told me youd probably be back shes good that way a real intuitive in another time shedve been done for a witch did the agrimony work not sure what im meant to do with it is that why youre back then he shook his head wanted to have a word about a bloke called kilfoyle she said rob and closed her book it was he saw one of the harry potters what about rob you know him then yeah she said the word on two notes a combination of confirmation and question she looked wary how well im not sure how im meant to take this she said has rob done something he buy stuff here occasionally but so do lots of other people whats this about whats he buy off you then i dont know he hasnt been in in a while and i dont write down what people buy but you know he bought something because i know him i also know that two of the waitresses from riviera restaurant have made purchases as well so have the head cook at pizza express and a collection of shop assistants from the wharf but its the same as for rob i dont recall what they bought except for the bloke at pizza express he wanted a love potion for a girl he met i remember that because we got into the whole love thing know him how nkata asked her who you said you know kilfoyle im wondering how you mean is he my boyfriend or something nkata could see the colour deepen round the hollow of her throat no he isnt i mean we had a drink once but it wasnt a date is he in some sort of trouble nkata didnt reply to this it had always been a long shot anyway that the owner of crystal moon would remember what someone had bought but the fact that kilfoyle had indeed made a purchase gave the investigation grist to move forward which was what they needed he told gigi that he appreciated her help and he gave her his card and told her to phone should she remember anything particular about kilfoyle that she thought he should know he realised that chances were good shed hand over the card to kilfoyle himself the next time she saw him but he didnt see that as a problem if kilfoyle was their killer the fact that the cops were on to him would surely slow him down at this point that was nearly as gratifying as nabbing him they had enough victims on their hands already he headed for the door where he paused to ask another question of gigi howm i meant to use it then what the agrimony oh she said you burn or anoint meaning meaning burn the oil in her presence or anoint her body with it i take it its a her were talking about nkata thought about and then dismissed the likelihood of his being able to accomplish either task but he also thought about the serial killer burning and anointing he was doing both he thanked gigi and left the shop he went next door to mr sandwich the little eatery was closed for the day and the sign said that its hours of business were from ten till three he looked through the windows but could make nothing out in the semidarkness save the counter and on the wall behind it a list of sandwiches and their prices there was nothing more to be gained in this spot he decided it was time to go but he didnt head homeward instead he felt himself compelled to drive yet another time in the general direction of the oval weaving over to kennington park road as soon as he was able to do so he parked again in braganza street but rather than wait for her or enter doddington grove estate to see if she was already home he walked up to the dispirited patch of green that was surrey gardens from there he headed into manor place a spot still trying to make a choice between decrepitude and renaissance he hadnt been to her shop since november but there was no way he could have forgotten where it was he found her within just as shed been the last time he visited she was at a desk at the back her head bent over what looked like an accounts book she had a pencil in her mouth which made her look vulnerable like a schoolgirl having trouble doing her sums when she glanced up as he entered and the buzzer went off though she looked adult enough and equally unfriendly she set her pencil down and closed the book she came to the counter and made sure it seemed that it stood like a bulwark between them he said a black boy was killed this time his body got dumped near london bridge station we got an id on an earlier boy s well mixed race he was from furzedown thats two boys south of the river now yas wheres daniel she said if you think he cut her off impatiently yas daniel have anything to do with a group of kids meeting up at elephant and castle dan doesnt do gangs she protested isnt a gang this yas thiss an outreach group they offer kids activities kids atkids at risk he hurried on i know i know youll say dan int at risk and im not here to argue that the groups called colossus though and i need to know you ever talk to them about seeing to dan after school while youre still working giving him a place to go i dont let dan up at elephant and castle and he never said colossus to you he neverwhyre you doing this she demanded we dont want you round us youve done enough she was getting agitated he could see as much from the rise and fall of her breasts beneath her jersey it was cropped like all the jerseys hed ever seen her wear showing off her smooth stomach which was flat like a palm shed had her navel pierced he saw a bit of gold glittered against her skin his throat felt dry but he knew there were things that he had to say to her no matter how she was likely to receive them he said yasand he thought what is it about the sound of her nameyas would youve rather not known what was going on she was cheating on you had been from the first and you got to admit that no matter what you think of me you dint have the right would you ratherve been kept in the dark about her what goods that supposed to do then yas and you and i know youre not bent like that anyways she pushed away from the counter that all cos if it is i got work needs finishing before i go home no he returned not all theres this what i did was right and you know it somewhere you but he continued how i did it was wrong and hed come to the hard part now the tellthetruth part when he didnt want to admit that truth even to himself but he plunged forward and why i did it yasmin that was wrong s well and it was wrong that i lied to myself about why i did it too and im sorry for all of it im dead sorry i want to make things right she was silent there was nothing that could be called kind in her stare a car pulled up to the kerb outside and her eyes flicked to it then back to him then stop using daniel she said using yas im stop using daniel to get to me thas what you think i dont want you i had a man i married him an every time i look in the mirror i get to see what he did to me an i get to think what i did back to him an im never going to that place again shed begun to tremble nkata wanted to reach across the counter that separated them and offer her comfort and the assurance that not all menbut he knew she would not believe him and he wasnt sure if he believed himself and as he tried to think what to say to her the door opened the buzzer went off and another black man came into the shop his gaze lit upon yasmin made a quick assessment and flicked to nkata yasmin he said and he pronounced it differently yasmeen he said in a soft foreign voice is there trouble here yasmin are you here alone it was the way he talked to her it was the tone and the look that went with it nkata felt every which way a fool he said to the other man she is now and he left the two of them together barbara havers decided a fag was in order she considered it a little reward the carrot shed held out in front of herself during her long slog on the computer followed by her further slogs on the phone shed managed this spate of unwelcome work with what she liked to think of as extreme good grace when all the time what she really wanted to do was have a real slog over to elephant and castle so that she might engage the decidedly more pleasant slog of shaking things up at colossus during all this time shed done her best to ignore her feelings her outrage at di stewarts remarks her impatience with the grunt work she was being assigned her schoolgirl envybloody hell was that what it really wasseeing winston nkata chosen by lynley to accompany him to duel with the assistant commissioner so as far as she was concerned at this late hour of the day she was owed the metaphorical rosetteonherlapel which she decided a fag would represent on the other hand she had to admit however much she disliked doing so that the computer and telephone slog had actually produced more ammunition for her to use when she made her next appearance across the river so she gave grudging acknowledgement to the wisdom of completing activities assigned to her and she even considered writing up her report in a timely manner as a way of admitting her earlier error in judgement but she discarded that notion in favour of a fag she told herself that if she had her smoke surreptitiously in the stairwell shed be that much closer to the incident room and thus that much closer to a location in which she could fill out the appropriate paperworkonce she had the shotintheeyeball of nicotine for which her body was crying out so she decamped to the stairwell plopped down lit up and inhaled bliss not the plate of lasagne and chips she would have preferred at this hour but a decent second havers exactly what are you doing bloody hell barbara scrambled to her feet lynley had just come through the doorway preparatory to climbing or descending the stairs he had his overcoat slung over one shoulder so she assumed descending was the order of the day it was something of a journey down to the carpark but the stairwell always gave one time to think which was probably what hed planned unless his intention had been to escape without detection which was also an option that the stairwell afforded she said composing my thoughts i did the griffin strong stuff and i was sorting through how best to present the information she offered him the notes shed taken from both the computer and the telephone calls shed begun scribbling them in her spiral book but unfortunately had run out of paper shed been reduced to using whatever lay at hand which had turned out to be two used envelopes from the wastepaper basket and a paper napkin shed rummaged out of her bag lynley looked from all this to her she said hey before you give me aggro im beyond it he said what have you got barbara happily settled in for a natter fag dangling from her lips as she spoke first of all according to his wife griffin strongs doing the mattress polka with ulrike ellis arabellathats the wifeputs him with ulrike for every killing no matter when it was without a second to think it over mind you i dont know about you but that tells me shes dead desperate to keep him bringing home the dosh while she cares for the baby and does jumping jacks in front of the telly all day fine thats understandable i suppose but it turns out our griff has a history of taking up with the ladies at all his places of employment getting in too deepif youll pardon the punthen losing his way and letting the ball drop with reference to his responsibilities lynley leaned against the stair rail listening tolerantly to her metaphor mixing he had his eyes fixed on hers so she entertained the idea that she might actually be on the way to resurrecting something of her reputation not to mention something of her career she waxed enthusiastic on her topic turns out he was sacked from social services in lewisham for falsifying his reports thats an interesting twist he was supposedly checking up on kids in care but in reality only managing to get to one in ten why the obvious he was too busy bonking his cubicle mate he got warned off once and written up twice before the axe finally fell and it seems the only reason he got taken on over in stockwell was that none of the kids on his roster at lewisham actually suffered from his neglect in this day and age thoughthere were no repercussions not a whisper i talked to his lewisham supervisor whod got convinced by someoneand for that i wager you can read griffin strongthat griff was far more pursued than pursuer beating this bird off with a nailstudded stick for months on end to hear the way strongs guv told the tale anyone would have succumbed to her eventually was how he put it his supervisor being male i take it naturally and you shouldve heard him talk about this bird like she was the sexual equivalent of the bubonic plague what about at stockwell lynley said the kid that died under strongs care was attacked by whom a gang with an initiation rite involving chasing down twelveyearolds and cutting them up with broken bottles they caught him crossing angell park and what was sposed to be a cut on the thigh hit an artery and he bled to death before he could get home christ lynley said but that was hardly strongs fault was it when you consider the kid who cut him up was his own foster brother lynley raised his head heavenward he looked done in how old was the foster brother then barbara glanced at her notes eleven she said what happened to him she continued to read psychiatric lockup till hes eighteen for all the good itll do she knocked the growing tube of ash from her fag it all made me think about the killer seems to me that he sees himself ridding the flock of black sheep like its sort of a religion to him when you think of all the aspects of ritual thatre part of the killings she let him finish the thought for himself lynley rubbed his forehead and leaned against the handrail of the stairs he said barbara i dont care what hes thinking these are children were talking about not genetic mutations children need guidance when they go wrong and they need protection the rest of the time full stop end of story sir were on the same page barbara said start to finish she dropped the nub of her cigarette on the stairs and crushed it out to cover the trace of her malefaction she picked up the dog end and placed it along with her notes in her shoulder bag she said trouble upstairs with reference to lynleys meeting with hillier no more than usual lynley said winston isnt turning out to be the blueeyed boy the ac thought hed be though now thats gratifying barbara said to an extent yes he studied her a little silence lingered between them during which barbara looked away picking at a fuzz ball that needed removing from the arm of her baggy pulloveralong with all the other fuzz balls that adorned the garment barbara lynley finally said i wouldnt have it this way she looked up what i think you know have you ever considered youd make better progress towards reinstatement if you worked with someone lessless objectionable to people in power like who for example john stewart now that would be chummy macpherson possibly or philip hale even out of here altogether in one of the borough stations because as long as youre in my spherenot to mention in hillierswith webberly no longer here to be a buffer for either one of us he made a gesture it said finish the thought in a logical manner she didnt need to she heaved her bag higher on her shoulder and began to head back up to the incident room she said thats not how this is going to play out at the end of the day i know whats important and what isnt which means she paused at the door to the corridor she offered him the response hed given her i think you know sir have a good night ive got work to do before i can go home chapter fifteen in his mind he put a body before him lying on the floor crucified by restraints and the board it was a soundless but not a lifeless body and when its senses returned what it knew was that it was in the presence of a power it could not hope to escape so fear descended in the guise of anger and in the presence of that fear fus heart grew large blood engorged his muscles and he rose above himself it was the kind of ecstasy that only came from being a god having had it that way he wanted it again once he had experienced the sensation of who he actually was bursting from the chrysalis of who he only appeared to be it could not be laid aside it was forever he had attempted to hold on to the feeling for as long as possible once the first boy died time and again he had put himself into darkness and there he slowly relived each moment that had taken him from selection to judgement and from there to admission onward to punishment and then to release but still the sheer exultation of the experience had faded as all things do to recapture it he had no choice but to make another selection to perform once again he told himself that he was not like the others who had gone before him swine like brady sutcliffe and west they had all been cheap thrill seekers coldblooded killers who preyed on the vulnerable for no other reason than to shore themselves up they shouted their insignificance to the world through acts the world was not likely to forget but for fu things were different not for him were innocent children at play streetwalkers chosen at random off the pavement female hitchhikers taking a fatal decision to climb into a car with a man and his wife in the sphere of those killers the possession the terror and the slaughter were all but fu trod a different path to theirs and that was what made his current state far more difficult to cope with had he been willing to join the swine he knew that he would be resting easier now hed have only to scour the streets and within hoursecstasy once again because that wasnt who he was fu sought the darkness as an aid to relief once he was there though he discerned intrusion he drew a breath and held it his senses alert he listened he thought of impossibility but there was no mistaking what his body told him he dispelled the gloom he looked for the evidence the light was dim as he preferred it but enough to show him that there were no obvious signs of intrusion into this place yet still he knew he had learned to trust the nerve endings at the nape of his neck and they were murmuring caution a book lay discarded on the floor near a chair a magazine had its cover wrinkled a stack of newspapers crisscrossed one on top of the other words words words upon words all of them chattered all accused a maggot they chorused here here the reliquary fu realised that was what he wanted for only through the reliquary would it be possible for the maggot to speak once more and what he would say dont tell me youve not bought brown sauce cow what else have you got to think about all day dear please the boy are you trying to tell me get your arse down to the shops for that sauce and leave the boy i said leave him something wrong with your ears as well as your brain now dearest as if the tone and the words could somehow make a difference to the walking lightly and the looseboweled fear both of which would return if he lost possession of the reliquary or its contents yet he could see that the reliquary stood where he had left it in its hiding place that was no place of hiding at all and when he carefully removed the top he found that the contents seemed to be undisturbed even the contents within the contentscarefully buried preserved and treasuredwere as hed left them or so they appeared he went to the pile of crisscrossed papers he loomed above them but they spoke only what he could see a man in african garb a headline declared the man foster dad in anguish and the story that accompanied the headline told the rest all the deaths round london and theyd finally sussed out that there was a serial killer at work fu felt himself relax he felt his hands warm and the sickness within him began to recede as he fingered fondly through the stack of tabloids perhaps he thought they would suffice he sat he drew the entire stack closer like father christmas embracing a child how odd it was he thought that only with the last boythe lying denying and accusing sean who had forfeited redemption and release because hed stubbornly refused to admit his guilthad the police realised they were dealing with something superior to and larger than what they were used to he had been giving them clues all along but theyd refused to see now though they knew not his purpose of course but the fact of him as a single and singular force of justice always a step ahead of those who sought him supreme and supreme he lifted the most recent copy of the evening standard and set it aside he went down the stack till he found the mirror which featured a photo of the tunnel in which hed left the last body he laid his hands on the photograph of the scene and he dropped his gaze to encompass the other pictures on the page cops because who else could they be and one of them named so that now he knew who wished to thwart him who fruitlessly directed everyone else to turn him from the course he followed lynley detective superintendent the name would be easy enough to remember fu closed his eyes and conjured up the image of himself and this lynley in confrontation but not the sort in which he faced him alone instead the image displayed a moment of redemption in which the detective watched helpless to do anything to stop the cycle of punishment and salvation as it played out before his eyes that would indeed be something fu thought that would be a statement that no oneno brady no sutcliffe no west no anyone elsehad ever been able to make fu took in the pleasure of the thought in the hope it would bring him close to the heady sensationwhat he called the very yesnessof those final moments of the act of redemption wanting the swelling of success to possess him wanting the knowledge of fully being to fill him wanting wanting wanting to feel the emotional and sensual explosion that occurred at the impact of desire and accomplishmentplease but nothing happened he opened his eyes every nerve alive the maggot had been here defiling this place and that was why he could not recapture any of the moments in which hed been most fully alive he could not afford the despair that threatened so he turned it to anger and the anger itself he lasered on the maggot keep out of here wanker keep out keep away but his nerves still tingled telling a tale that revealed he would never have peace in this way peace could now be generated only by the act that brought another soul to its redemption the boy and the act itself he thought what was needed was what would be rain fell for the next five days a heavy midwinter rain of the sort that generally made one despair of ever seeing the sun again by the sixth morning the worst of the storm had passed but the glowering sky heralded the arrival of yet another as the day wore on lynley didnt go directly into the yard as he normally would have done instead he drove in the opposite direction working his way over to the a heading out of central london helen had suggested this journey to him shed gazed at him over a glass of breakfast orange juice and said tommy have you considered going out to osterley i think its what you need hed said in reply is my selfdoubt becoming that obvious i wouldnt call it selfdoubt and i think youre being too hard on yourself if thats what youre calling it by the way what would you call it then helen thought about this head cocked to one side as she observed him she hadnt yet dressed for the day hadnt even bothered to comb her hair and lynley found he liked her tousled like this she lookedshe looked wifely he thought that was the word although hed have cut out his tongue before telling her that she said id call it a ripple on the surface of your peace of mind courtesy of the tabloids and the assistant commissioner of police david hillier wants you to fail tommy you ought to know that by now even as he blusters on about bringing in a result youre the last person on earth he wants to do that lynley knew she was right he said which makes me wonder why he put me in this position in the first place acting superintendent or heading this investigation both its all to do with malcolm webberly of course hillier told you himself that he knows what malcolm would have wanted him to do so hes doing it its hishis homage to him for want of a better word its his way of doing his part to ensure malcolms recovery but his own willhilliers i meangets in the way of his intention of helping malcolm so while you have the elevation to acting superintendent and you have the assignment to head this investigation you also have hilliers bad wishes to go along with both lynley considered this there was good sense to it but that was helen scratch the surface of her habitual insouciance and she was both sensible and intuitive to her core id no idea youd become so adept at instant psychoanalysis he told her oh lightly she saluted him with her teacup it all comes of watching chat shows darling really id never have thought of you as a covert chatshow viewer you flatter me im becoming quite fond of the american ones you know the sort someone sits on a sofa pouring out his heart to the host and half a billion viewers after which hes given advice and sent off to slay dragons its confession catharsis resolution and renewal all in a tidy fiftyminute package i adore the way they solve lifes problems on american television tommy its rather the way americans do most things isnt it that gunslinger approach draw the gun blast away and the difficultys gone supposedly you arent recommending i shoot hillier are you only as a last resort in the meantime i suggest a trip to osterley so he took up her suggestion it was an ungodly hour for visiting a convalescent hospital but he reckoned his police identification would be enough to get him inside it was most of the patients were still at their breakfasts but malcolm webberlys bed was empty however a helpful orderly directed him to the physiotherapy room there lynley found detective superintendent webberly working his way between two parallel bars lynley watched him from the doorway the fact that the superintendent was alive was miraculous hed survived a laundry list of injuries all of them brought about by a hitandrun driver hed endured the removal of his spleen and a good portion of his liver a fractured skull and the removal of a blood clot on his brain nearly six weeks of druginduced coma a broken hip a broken arm five broken ribs and a heart attack in the midst of his slow recovery from everything else he was nothing if not a warrior in the battle to regain his strength he was also the one man at new scotland yard with whom lynley had long felt he could be unguarded webberly inched along the bars encouraged by the therapist who insisted upon calling him luv despite the scowls webberly sent in her direction she was approximately the size of a canary and lynley wondered how she would approach supporting the burly superintendent should he begin to topple but it appeared that webberly had no intention of doing anything other than making his way to the end of the apparatus when hed managed that he said without looking in lynleys direction youd think theyd let me have a bloody cigar on occasion wouldnt you tommy their idea of a celebration round here is an enema administered to the sound of mozart how are you sir lynley asked coming farther into the room have you lost a few stone are you saying i needed to webberly looked shrewdly in his direction he was pale and unshaven and he looked quite tentative about the titanium acting the part of his new hip he wore a tracksuit instead of hospital garb the words top cop decorated its jacket just a casual observation lynley said to me you were always a picture needing no revision what cock webberly grunted as he reached the end of the bars and made the turn that was necessary for his descent to the wheelchair which the therapist brought to him wouldnt trust you as far as i could throw you cup of tea luv webberlys therapist asked him once hed lowered himself to his chair nice ginger biscuit you did very well she thinks im a performing dog webberly informed lynley he said to the woman bring the whole damn tin of biscuits thank you she smiled serenely and patted his shoulder cup of tea and a biscuit it is and for you this last was directed to lynley who told her hed do nicely with nothing she disappeared into an adjoining room webberly wheeled himself over to a window where he raised the blinds and looked out at the day bloody weather he growled im that ready for spain tommy the thought of itthats whats keeping me going taking your pension then lynley tried to make the question light not a reflection of what he felt at the thought of the superintendents permanent removal from the force he didnt fool webberly with his tone however the superintendent gave him a look cast over his shoulder from his perusal of the day david behaving badly is he youve got to come up with a strategy for coping with him thats all i can tell you lynley joined him at the window there they both looked morosely out at the grey day and what the window offered of it which was a distant view of bare branches the supplicant winter arms of trees in osterley park closer in they had the carpark to gaze upon for myself i can do it lynley said thats all anyone asks of you its the others im worried about barbara and winston mostly ive not done either of them any favours taking on your position it was madness to think i could webberly was silent lynley knew that the other man would see his point havers boat of dreams at the yard would doubtless continue to take on water as long as she maintained her association with him as for nkatalynley knew that any other officer elevated to the rank of acting superintendent would have done a better job of keeping winston out of hilliers clutches instead havers was looking more professionally doomed every day while nkata knew he was being used as a token and might end up carrying round a load of bitterness that could blight his career for years no matter how he looked at the matter lynley felt it was all down to him that nkata and havers were in the positions they were in at the moment tommy webberly said as if lynley had spoken all this you dont have that power dont i you did you do i ought to be able stop im not talking about the power to be a buffer between david and his targets im talking about the power to change him to undavid him which is what youd like to do if youll admit it but he has his own set of demons just like you and theres not a thing in the world that you can do to remove them from him so how do you cope with him webberly rested his arms on the windowsill he was looking lynley saw much older these days his thin haironce the faded sand of the redhead going greyhad now reached that destination while the flesh under his eyes was baggy and the skin beneath his chin was wattled seeing this lynley was reminded of ulysses rumination faced with knowledge of his mortality old age hath yet his honour and his toil he wanted to recite it to webberly anything he thought to postpone the inevitable its down to the knighthood i reckon webberly said you think david wears it comfortably i believe he wears it like a suit of armour which as we both know has comfort as the least of its purposes he wanted it and he didnt want it he schemed to get it and now he has to live with that the scheming but thats what he does best too right so think about having that on your gravestone tommy you know all this and if you can let the knowledge just get past that nasty temper of yours youll be able to deal with him there it was lynley thought the dominant truth of his life he could hear his father comment upon it though the man had been dead nearly twenty years temper tommy youre allowing passion not only to blind you but to rule you son what had it been at the time a football match and a wild disagreement with a referee a call in rugby he hadnt liked a row with his sister over a board game what and what did it matter now but that had been his fathers point that full stop the black passion of the moment did not matter once the moment passed he merely failed to see that fact over and over again resulting in everyone else having to pay for his fatal flaw he was othello without the excuse of iago he was hamlet sans ghost helen was right hillier set traps and he walked right into them it was all he could do not to groan aloud webberly looked at him theres a learning curve involved with the job the superintendent said kindly why dont you let yourself travel it easier said than done when at the other end of the curve is someone waiting with a battleaxe webberly shrugged you cant stop david from arming himself who you have to become is the person who can dodge the blows the canary therapist came back into the room tea in one hand and paper napkin in the other on this rested a lone ginger biscuit the superintendents reward for managing the parallel bars here you go luvvie she said to webberly nice hot cuppa with milk and sugarive made it just the way you like it i hate tea webberly informed her as he took the cup and the biscuit oh go on with you she replied youre being quite naughty this morning is that because of your visitor she patted his shoulder well its good to see you showing some life but stop pulling my leg luv or ill give you what for youre the reason im trying to get the hell out of here woman webberly told her that she said placidly is my whole objective she wagged her fingers and headed out of the room scooping up a medical chart on her way youve got hillier ive got her webberly groused as he bit into his biscuit but at least she offers refreshments lynley said nothing was resolved in the visit to osterley but helens prescription did work as shed thought it would when lynley left the superintendent back in his room he felt ready for another round of his professional life what that round brought was information from a number of sources he met the squad in the incident room where phones were ringing and constables were typing information into the computers stewart was compiling action reports from one of his teams andmirabile dictu as things turned outbarbara havers had in his absence apparently managed to take direction from the di without episode when lynley called the group together the first thing he learned was that upon stewarts orders havers had traveled across the river to colossus for another setto with ulrike ellis its amazing how quickly she was able to locate information on jared salvatore once she twigged we had the book from reception with his name blazed all over it havers reported and shes managed to unearth all sorts of useful details on anton reid shes onboard now sir cooperation incarnate shes provided the name of every kid whos dropped out of colossus for the last twelve months and ive been seeing if we can match any of them with the rest of the bodies what about the other two boys personal connections to anyone at colossus jared and anton griffin strong was their assessment leader surprise surprise anton reid also did some time on greenhams computer course what about kilfoyle and veness any relationship between the boys and them havers consulted her report whichperhaps as evidence of her dubious intention of being a model cop from this moment forwardappeared to be typed for once both of them knew jared salvatore evidently he was quite the whiz at creating recipes he couldnt read so he couldnt follow cookbooks but hed manage to whip up something without instructions and serve it round with the staff at colossus doing the guineapig thing everyone knew him as things turn out my mistake earliershe shot a look round the room as if anticipating a reaction from someone to her admissionwas asking only ulrike ellis and griff strong about jared when they said he wasnt one of theirs i believed them because theyd admitted to kimmo thorne right up front sorry what are kilfoyle and veness saying about anton reid then kilfoyle says he doesnt remember anton veness is vague about it thinks he may he says neil greenham remembers him well enough as to greenham tommy john stewart weighed in hes got a real temper according to the head teacher up in kilburn where he taught he lost it with kids a few times and he shoved one against the blackboard once he heard about that from the parents straightaway and he apologised for it but that doesnt mean he was genuine about the apology so much for his theories on discipline havers noted have we laid on surveillance for these blokes lynley asked were stretched too thin tommy hilliers not authorising any more men till weve got a result god damn but weve done some snooping so weve got an idea of their nighttime activities which are stewart gave the nod to his team three officers so far very little looked suspicious after his day at colossus jack veness evidently went regularly to the miller and grindstone his local in bermondsey where he also had a second job behind the bar at the weekends he drank smoked and made the occasional call from a phone box outside that sounds promising someone pointed out but that was it then he went home or to a takeaway curry shop near bermondsey square griffin strong on the other hand seemed to alternate between his silkscreening business in quaker street and his home he also however appeared to have a liking for a bengali restaurant in brick lane where he went to dine alone occasionally as for kilfoyle and greenham team three were gathering information telling them that kilfoyle spent many of his evenings in the othello bar of the london ryan hotel which was at the base of the gwynne place steps these led up to granville square otherwise he was at home in the square living with whom lynley asked do we know deed poll says the property belongs to victor kilfoyle his dad i reckon what about greenham the only thing hes done of interest is take mummy to the royal opera house and he apparently has a lady friend he meets on the side we know theyve done cheap chinese in lisle street and a gallery opening in upper brook street other than that hes at home with mummy stewart smiled in gunnersbury by the way is anyone surprised by that lynley commented he glanced at havers she was doing her best he saw not to crow i was right and he had to give her marks for that shed made the connection between employees at colossus and the dump sites of bodies from the start nkata joined them then fresh from a meeting with hillier they were set to film crimewatch he reported and he scowled at the goodnatured comments about a star being born which rose when he made this announcement theyd be using the efit of the interloper seen at square four gym he informed them which had been developed in concert with the bodybuilder whod seen their potential suspect to this they would add the photographs of all identified victims as well as a dramatic reconstruction of what they now presumed to be kimmo thornes manner of encountering his killer a red ford transit stopping a bicycle rider with stolen goods in his possession the vans driver helping to load the bicycle and the goods into the vehicle weve something to add to that as well stewart put in when nkata was done he sounded pleased cctv footage i wont say weve hit gold but weve had a little luck at last with a cctv camera mounted on one of the buildings near st georges gardens the image of a van driving down the street time and date matching up with kimmo thornes death christ in heaven john whys it taken this long to get to it we had it early on stewart said but it wasnt clear we needed an enhancement and that took time but the wait was worth it youd better have a look and give the word on how you want it used crimewatch might get some mileage from it ill look at it straightway lynley told him what about surveillance at the body sites anything nothing as it turned out if their killer was considering a nocturnal visit to the shrine of his criminal accomplishmentas contended in hamish robsons remarks about himhe had not yet done so which brought up the profile itself barbara havers said shed had another look at it and she wanted to point out part of robsons description the section which claimed the killer probably lived with a dominant parent they had two suspects so far with parents in the home kilfoyle and greenham one with dad one with mum and wasnt it dodgy that greenham was taking mum to the royal opera house but the woman friend only got cheap chinese and a gratis gallery opening what did that mean it was worth looking at lynley told her and he said whos got the information on who veness lives with john stewart responded theres a landlady mary alice atkinsward a distant relation do we tighten up on kilfoyle and greenham then a dc asked pencil at the ready let me look at the cctv film first lynley told them to get back to their assigned actions he himself followed john stewart to a video recorder he signaled nkata to accompany them he saw havers glower at this but chose to ignore it he had high hopes of the cctv footage the efit had provided little enough inspiration to him it looked like everyman and no man the suspect had worn a cap of some sortdidnt they alland while upon an initial glimpse of it barbara havers had pointed out gleefully that robbie kilfoyle wore a eurodisney cap that was hardly a damning piece of evidence for lynleys money the efit was on the borderline of worthless and he reckoned crimewatch would prove him right on that stewart snatched up the remote for the video recorder and switched on the television onto the corner of the screen the time and date popped up along with a section of mews beyond which the wall of st georges gardens curved as they watched the front of a van pulled into the picture at the end of the mews which appeared to be some thirty yards from the cctv camera guarding the mews itself the vehicle stopped lights out and a figure emerged he carried a tool and disappeared round the curve of the wall presumably to apply his implement to something out of sight of the camera this would lynley thought be the padlock on the chain that held the gate closed at night as they watched the figure came back into view too distant and even on the enhanced film too grainy to be distinguishable he climbed into the van and it rolled smoothly forward before it disappeared behind the wall stewart paused the film he said have a look at that lovely little picture tommy he sounded pleased as well he might lynley thought for on the film theyd managed to capture writing on the side of the van the miracle would have been a complete identification which was more than they got but half of a miracle would do three partial lines of faded printing were visible waf bile chen below them a number was rendered that last looks like part of a phone number nkata said my money says the rest is the name of a business stewart added question is do we go with it on crimewatch whove you got working on the van right now lynley asked what are they doing trying to get something on that partial phone number from bt checking business licences to see if we can find a match for those letters we can see in the name running things through swansea another time thatll take a century nkata pointed out but how many million people see this f we put it on the telly lynley considered the ramifications of running the video on crimewatch millions watched the show and it had been useful on dozens of occasions in accelerating the speed of an investigation but there were inherent risks in broadcasting the film countrywide not the least of which was tipping their hand to the killer for there was every chance that their man would be watching and would put the van through such a highpowered cleaning and scouring that all evidence of any of their dead boys having been in it would be forever obliterated and there was the additional chance that their man would dump the van immediately taking it to one of a hundred places far out of london where it wouldnt be found for years or he might put it in a lockup somewhere with the same result it was lynleys decision he decided to hold off making it he said i want to think about this and to winston tell crimewatch we may have something for them but were working on it nkata looked uneasy but he went for the phone stewart looked pleased as he returned to his desk lynley nodded to havers an illseeyounow look she grabbed up what looked like a pristine notebook and followed him out of the incident room good work he told her he noted that shed even dressed more suitably today in a tweed suit and brogues the suit had a stain on the skirt and the brogues werent polished but it was otherwise a remarkable change in a woman who usually favoured drawstring trousers and tshirts bearing groaninducing puns she shrugged im capable of taking the hint when im clubbed with it sir im glad to hear that get your things and come with me her face altered its hopeful brightness betraying her even as it deeply touched him he wanted to tell her not to wear her professional heart on her sleeve but he held his tongue havers was who havers was she didnt ask where they were going till they were in the bentley and heading in the direction of vauxhall bridge road then she said are we doing a runner sir he said believe me ive thought about it more than once but webberly tells me theres a route to dealing with hillier ive just not discovered it yet that must be like searching for the holy grail she examined her brogues and appeared to note their sad condition she wet her fingers on her tongue and rubbed the damp against a scuff without result she said how is he then webberly slow progress but progress well thats good isnt it everything but the slow part we need him back before hillier selfdestructs and takes us all down with him dyou think itll come to that sometimes he said i dont know what to think at their destination parking was its usual nightmare he squeezed the bentley in front of the entrance to the kings head and eight bells pub directly beneath a do not block this entrance sign to which you will die if you do had been added havers raised her eyebrow whats life without risk lynley asked but he put a police placard prominently on the dashboard now thats living dangerously havers noted they walked the few yards up cheyne row to the house at the corner of lordship place where they found st james being regaled by both deborah and helen who were leafing through magazines as they chatted about the absolute solution to everything simon youve married a genius they were all in the lab logic deborah replied it was nothing more she looked up and saw lynley and havers in the doorway she said just in time look whos here you wont even have to go home to talk him into it helen talk me into what lynley went to his wife tilting back her chin to examine her face youre looking tired dont be a mother hen she chided youve got worry lines coming out on your forehead thats down to hillier havers said well all look ten years older in another month isnt he due to retire deborah asked assistant commissioners dont retire my love st james told his wife not until the last hope of being made commissioner is finally beaten out of them he looked at lynley i take it that doesnt seem likely to happen soon you take it correctly have you got anything for us simon i expect you mean information and not whisky st james said he added fu phoo havers said as inwhat phooey typhoo tea as in the letters f and u on a china board st james had been working on a diagram with splotches of faux blood but he left it and went to his desk where he took from the top drawer a paper on which was drawn the same symbol that had been on the bottom of the note theyd received at the yard purporting to be from the serial killer its a chinese symbol st james explained it means authority divine power and the ability to judge it stands in fact for justice and its pronounced fu helen said is that helpful tommy its in keeping with the message of the note he sent and to some extent with the mark on kimmo thornes forehead as well because it is a mark havers asked i expect that would be dr robsons point even if the other marks from alchemy deborah asked the last question of her husband its the fact of the marking i daresay st james replied two distinct symbols with interpretations readily available is that what you mean tommy hmm yes lynley studied the piece of paper on which the mark had been reproduced and an explanation of the mark appeared he said simon where did you get the information internet search he said it wasnt difficult so our boys got access to a computer as well havers noted that narrows it down to half the population of london lynley said grimly i think i can eliminate at least a portion of that group theres something else st james had moved to a worktable where he was laying out a line of photographs lynley and havers joined him while deborah and helen remained at the other worktable a selection of magazines open between them i had these from so st james said in reference to the pictures which lynley saw were of each of the dead boys along with respective enlargements of one small portion of each boys torso dyou recall the autopsy reports tommy how they all mention a specific area of what they called woundlike bruising on every one of the bodies well have a look at this deborah did the enlargements for me last night he reached for one of the larger photos lynley examined it havers looking over his shoulder in the picture he saw the bruising that st james was talking about he discerned that it was actually more of a pattern than a bruise most distinguishable on kimmo thornes body because he was the only white youth on kimmo a central pale area was ringed by dark bruiselike flesh in the centre of the pale portion of this two small marks had the look of burns with variations due to the pigment of each boy this distinctive mark was the same on every successive photograph that st james handed over lynley looked up once hed seen them all did so actually miss this he asked what he thought was christ what a bloody cockup they mention it in the autopsies the problem was in their term of reference calling it a bruise what do you make of it yourself it looks something between a bruise and a burn i had a good idea but i wasnt entirely sure initially so i scanned the photos and sent them over to a colleague in the states for a second opinion why the states havers had taken up one of the pictures and had been frowning down at it but now she looked up curiously because like nearly anything else you might imagine as a weapon theyre legal in america what stun guns i think thats how hes incapacitating the boys before he does the rest st james went on to explain how the characteristics of the bruiselike wounds on the bodies compared point by point to the kind of bruise that was the result of being jolted by the fifty thousand to two hundred thousand volts of electricity that such a weapon discharged each of the boys was hit in relatively the same place on the body on the left side of the torso that tells us that the killers using the gun in the same way each time if youve got something that works why mess about with it havers said exactly st james agreed the electricity from the stun gun scrambles the bodys nervous system leaving the victimas the name impliesliterally stunned unable to move even if he wants to his muscles work rapidly but without any efficiency his blood sugar is converted to lactic acid which depletes him of energy his neurological impulses are interrupted hes weak confused and disoriented while hes in that condition the killer has time to immobilise him lynley added and if he starts to come round havers said the killer uses the gun on him again by the time hes back to normal hes gagged and restrained and the killer can do what he wants with him lynley handed the pictures back to st james yes i think thats exactly whats happening except havers handed her own photograph back to st james although she spoke to lynley these are streetwise kids youd think theyd notice someone about to shove a gun in their ribs wouldnt you as to that barbara st james dug out a few sheets of paper from an in basket on the top of a filing cabinet he handed over to lynley what first appeared to be an advertisement on closer inspection however lynley saw that the document had come from the internet on a site called personalsecuritycom stun guns were offered for sale but these were stun guns of an entirely different order from the pistolshaped weapon one might associate with the name indeed these didnt appear to be guns at all which was probably the point of owning one of them some of them were manufactured to look like mobile phones others looked like torches all of them worked identically however the user had to make physical contact with the victim in order for the electrical charge to pass from the gun into the victims body havers gave a quiet whistle im impressed she said and i reckon we can suss out how these things get into the country in the first place no difficult feat to smuggle them into the uk st james agreed not looking like that and from there on to the black market lynley said well done simon thank you progress i feel moderately encouraged we cant give this to hillier though havers pointed out hell put it on crimewatch or hand it over to the press before you could say kiss my arse not she added hastily that youd say that sir not lynley said that i wouldnt want to although i tend to like something a little more subtle then we may have a difficulty with our plan helen spoke from the table where she and deborah had been flipping through their magazines she held up one of them and lynley saw that it featured clothing for infants and children she said i have to say its not subtle at all deborahs suggested a solution tommy to the christening situation ah that yes ah that shall we tell you then or shall i wait till later you could consider it a break from the grim realities of the case if youd like by switching to the grim realities of our families you mean lynley asked now thats diverting dont tease helen said frankly id christen our jasper felix in a dishcloth if i had my way but since i dontcertainly not with two hundred and fifty years of lynley history bearing down on meive wanted to come up with a compromise that will please everyone hardly likely to happen with your sister iris marshalling the rest of the girls to her side in favour of clyde family history lynley said well yes of course iris is rather daunting when she sets her mind to something isnt she which is what deborah and i were discussing when deborah made the most obvious suggestion in the world dare i ask lynley looked at deborah new clothes she said but not just new helen added and not the usual gown blanket shawl and whatever the point is to get something that announces itself as a new tradition being established by you and me so naturally thats going to take a bit more effort no simple dash through peter jones thatll be a crushing blow to you darling lynley said hes being sarcastic helen told the rest of them and then to lynley you do see its the answer dont you something new something different something that we can pass alongor at least claim were going to pass alongto our children so that they can use it as well and you know its out there what were looking for deborahs actually volunteered to help me find it thank you lynley said to deborah dyou like the idea she asked him i like anything with the promise of peace he said even if its only momentary now if we can only resolve his mobile chirped as he reached for it in the breast pocket of his coat havers mobile went off as well the rest of them watched as the information was passed from new scotland yard to lynley and havers simultaneously it wasnt good news queens wood in north london someone had found yet another body chapter sixteen helen went down to the car with them she stopped lynley saying only tommy darling please listen to me before he got inside she cast a look towards havers who was already buckling herself into the passenger seat and then said quietly to lynley youll solve it tommy please dont be so hard on yourself he let out a breath how well she knew him he said just as quietly how can i be otherwise another one helen you must remember youre only one man im not im more than thirty men and women and weve done bloody sod all to stop him hes one man thats not true which part you know which part youre doing this the only way possible while boysyoung boys helen children barely into their teensare dying out here in the street no matter what theyve done no matter what their crimes if theyve even committed any they dont deserve this i feel as if were all asleep at the wheel without knowing it i know she said lynley could see the love and concern on his wifes face he was momentarily comforted by it still as he got into the car he said bitterly please god dont think so well of me helen i cant think anything else go carefully please and then to havers barbara will you see that he has a meal sometime today you know him hes likely not to eat havers nodded ill find him a decent fryup somewhere lots of grease thatll set him up proper helen smiled she touched lynleys cheek and then stepped away from the car lynley could see her through the rearview mirror still standing in place as they drove away they made fairly good time by using park lane and the edgware road heading northwest initially they skirted regents park on its north side shooting towards kentish town they were approaching queens wood from highgate station when the days promised rain finally began to fall lynley cursed rain and a crime scene a recipe for forensic nightmares queens wood was an anomaly in london a bona fide woodland that had once been a park like any other park but had long ago been left to grow thrive or fail as it might the result was acres of unbridled nature in the middle of urban sprawl houses and the occasional block of flats backed onto it but within ten feet of the fences and walls of their back gardens the woods burst out of the earth in an eruption of beech trees bracken shrubs and ferns all struggling with each other to survive just as they would in the countryside there were no lawns no park benches no duck ponds no swans floating serenely on a lake or river there were instead illmarked paths overfull rubbish bins sprouting everything from takeaway containers to nappies the odd signpost pointing vaguely to a route to highgate station and a hillside down which the woodland dropped towards a bank of allotments to the west the easiest access to queens wood lay beyond muswell hill road there wood lane veered to the northeast bisecting the southern portion of the park the local police made a strong presence at the scene having blocked off the end of the street with sawhorses where four police constables kitted out in rain gear held back the curious who were bobbing round beneath their umbrellas like a collection of mobile mushrooms lynley showed his id to one of the constables who signaled to the others to move the roadblock long enough for the bentley to pass before he did so lynley said to the man dont let anyone other than soco inside anyone i dont care who they are or what they tell you no one passes who isnt police with proper police id the constable nodded the flash of camera lights told lynley that the press was already hot on the story the first stretch of wood lane comprised housing an amalgamation of nineteenth and twentiethcentury buildings that consisted of conversions apartments and single homes perhaps two hundred yards along however the buildings stopped abruptly and on either side of the street the woods spread out completely unfenced utterly accessible looking in this weather both brooding and dangerous good choice havers muttered as she and lynley alighted from the car he has a way hasnt he youve got to give him that she turned up the collar of her donkey jacket against the rain like a set from a thriller film this is lynley didnt disagree in the summer the area was probably a paradise a natural oasis that afforded an escape from the prison of concrete stone brick and tarmac that had long ago enveloped the rest of the native environment but in the winter it was a melancholy spot in which everything was in the process of decay layers of decomposing leaves covered the ground and sent forth the odour of peat beeches toppled by storms over the years lay in various stages of rot right where they had fallen while branches severed from trees by the wind punctuated the slope growing moss and lichen activity centred on the south side of wood lane where the park dipped down towards the allotments and then up again towards priory gardens which was the street beyond them a large square of translucent plastic suspended from poles formed a rough shelter for an area perhaps fifty yards to the west of the allotments there an enormous beech had been torn from the ground more recently than the others for where its roots had been there was still a hollow that time earth wind small creatures ferns and bracken had not yet filled in the killer had placed the body in this hollow at the moment a forensic pathologist was attending it while a soco team worked with silent efficiency in the immediate area beneath a tall beech some thirty yards away an adolescent boy was watching the activity one trainershod foot up on the trunk behind him to prop him up and a rucksack at his feet a gingerhaired man in a trench coat stood with him and he jerked his head at lynley and havers in a signal to come over and join him ginger hair introduced himself as di widdison from the archway police station his companion he said was ruff ruff lynley glanced at the boy who glowered at him from beneath the hood of a sweatshirt that was covered by an outsize anorak no surname at present widdison walked five paces away from the boy and took lynley and havers with him found the body he said hes a tough little bugger but its shaken him up sicked up on his way to get help where did he go for that lynley asked widdison tossed a nonexistent ball back in the direction of wood lane walden lodge eight or ten flats in there he leaned on the bells till someone let him inside to use the phone what was he doing here anyway havers asked tagging widdison told her course he doesnt want us to know that but he was shaken up and gave us his tag by mistake which is why he doesnt want to give us his real name now weve been trying to catch him for some eight months hes put ruff on every available surface round here signs dustbins trees silver silver his tagging colour silver hes got the cans of paint in that rucksack of his didnt have the presence of mind to chuck them before he phoned us lynley said whats he given you sod all you can talk to him if youd like but i dont think he saw a thing i dont think there was anything to see he tilted his head in the direction of the intense circle of work surrounding the body ill be over there when youre ready he strode off lynley and havers returned to the boy havers digging into her bag lynley said to her i expect hes right barbara i dont imagine taking notes not going for the notes sir she replied and she offered the boy her crumpled packet of players when they joined him ruff looked from the cigarettes to her back to the cigarettes he finally mumbled cheers and took one which she lit for him with a plastic lighter anyone about when you found the body lynley asked the boy once hed had time to suck hungrily on the cigarette his fingers were dirty with grime crusted beneath the nails and the cuticles his face was spotty but otherwise pale ruff shook his head someone in the lotments is all he said old bloke turning the earth with a shovel like hes looking for something i seen him when i come down through priory gardens on the path thas all innit were you by yourself tagging lynley asked the boys eyes flashed hey i dint say sorry did you come into the park by yourself yeah see anything unusual a car or van that didnt look right up on wood lane perhaps when you went to phone for help i dint see fuck ruff said anyways theres lots f cars parked up there all the time in daytime cos people come into town from outside and they take the tube rest of the way dont they cos tubes just over there highgate station look i tol the dibble all this they ack like i did summat an they wont let me go that might have something to do with your not giving them your name havers told the boy if they want to talk to you again they wont know where to find you ruff looked at her suspiciously a bloke trying to suss out a trick from among her words she said reassuringly were from scotland yard were not going to drag you to the nick for spraying your name about weve bigger fish to fry he sniffed wiped his nose on the back of his hand and relented he was called elliott augustus greenberry he finally admitted eyeing them sharply as if watching for incredulous expressions to cross their faces double ell double tee double ee double ar an don tell me how fuckin stupid it is i know don i look cn i go now in a moment lynley said did you recognise the boy ruff brushed a greasy lock of hair off his face tucking it into the hood of the sweatshirt wha him you mean theit the dead boy yes lynley said do you know him i never ruff said nobody i ever seen could be hes from round here somewheres like up on the street over there behind the lotments but i dont know him like i said i dont know fuck cn i go once we have your address havers said why because well want you to sign a statement eventually and we need to know where to find you dont we but i said i dint its routine elliott lynley said the boy scowled but cooperated and they released him he shed the anorak handed it over and took off down the slope west towards the path that would lead him up again to priory gardens anything from him di widdison said when lynley and havers joined him nothing lynley said handing over the anorak which widdison passed to a sodden constable who donned it gratefully aman digging in the allotments thats what he told me as well widdison said weve got a doortodoor going on up there now and along wood lane the same im reckoning our best bet is walden lodge once again widdison indicated a modern and solidlooking block of flats that squatted at the edge of the woods it was the last building on wood lane before the park and on every side it presented balconies most of them were empty save for the occasional barbecue and garden furniture covered for the winter but on four of them watchers stood one of them held up binoculars i cant think the killer brought the body down here without a torch widdison said someone up there might have seen that unless he brought it just after dawn havers pointed out too risky widdison said commuters park on the lane and use the underground to get into town from here hed have to know that and plan accordingly but hed still run the risk of being seen by someone who decided to make the journey earlier than usual he does his homework though havers pointed out we know that from where hes left the rest of them widdison looked unconvinced he took them under the shelter and over to the body it lay on its side but was otherwise dumped carelessly in the hollow created by the unearthed roots of the fallen beech its head was tucked into its chest its arms windmilled out like someone frozen in the act of giving a signal this boy lynley saw seemed younger than the others although not by much he was white as well blond and extremely fair skinned small and not particularly developed at first glance lynley concludedwith reliefthat he wasnt one of theirs at all that he and havers neednt have come this distance across london on someones whim but when he squatted to have a better look he saw the postmortem incision running down the boys chest and disappearing into the fold of his waist while on his forehead a crude symbol had been drawn in blood brother to the symbol found on kimmo thorne lynley glanced at the forensic pathologist who was speaking into the microphone of a handheld tape recorder id like a look at his hands he said the man nodded ive done my bit were ready to bag him and one of the team came forward to do so theyd start by bagging the hands in paper preserving any trace evidence from the killer that might be under the boys fingernails from there theyd do the rest and when they moved the body lynley reckoned hed get a better look at it that turned out to be the case rigor was present but enough of the surface of the hands became visible when the body was lifted out of the hollow for lynley to see that the palms were blackened from having been burnt the navel was missing as well chopped crudely out of the body the z that stands for zorro havers murmured she was right they were indeed the signatures of their killer despite the differences that lynley could see were present on the body there were no restraint marks on the wrists and the ankles and the strangulation had been manual this time leaving ugly dark bruises round the boys neck there were other bruises as well on the upper arms extending down to the elbows and along the spine the thighs and the waist the largest bruise coloured the flesh from the temple down to the chin as well unlike the others lynley concluded this one boy had not gone gentle which told him the killer had made his first error in his choice of victim lynley could only hope that the miscalculation left behind him a pile of evidence he put up a fight lynley murmured no stun gun this time havers asked they checked the body for the signature of that weapon as well lynley said it doesnt appear so what dyou reckon that means would it be out of juice do they run out of it they must no perhaps he said or perhaps there wasnt the chance to use it it looks like things might not have gone according to plan he stood nodded to those who stood waiting to bag the body and returned to widdison anything in the area he asked two footprints beneath the boys head he said protected from the rain could have been there earlier but were taking casts anyway were doing a perimeter search but i reckon our real evidence is going to come from the body lynley left the di with the instruction to get every statement from every house on wood lane over to him at new scotland yard as soon as possible that block of flats especially he said i agree with you someone has to have seen something or heard something and have constables in place the rest of the day on either end of the street to grill commuters who come down from the underground station to fetch their cars dont expect to get much joy from that widdison warned anything goes for joy at this point lynley told him he added the information about the van they were looking for someone may have seen it he said then he and havers set off up the slope back on wood lane they could see that the housetohouse was well in progress uniformed police were knocking on doors others were standing in the shelter of porches talking to inhabitants otherwise no one else was on the pavement or in any front garden the persistent rain was keeping everyone inside that was not the case at the barricade however more gawkers had gathered lynley waited while the sawhorse was moved once more and he was thinking about what theyd seen in queens wood when havers muttered bloody hell sir he did it again and roused him from his thoughts he quickly saw what she was talking about just to the other side of the barricade hamish robson gestured to them at least lynley thought grimly theyd managed to thwart ac hillier in this the constable standing watch had followed lynleys orders to the letter robson had no police identification he would not be allowed beyond the barrier no matter what sir david hillier had told him to do lynley lowered the window and robson worked his way over to the car he said the constable here wouldnt those were my orders you cant go onto this crime scene dr robson you shouldnt have been allowed onto the last one but the assistant commissioner ive no doubt he rang you but its just not on i know you mean well i also know youre caught in the middle one of us a rock and the other a hard place i apologise for that for that and the inconvenience to you coming all this way but as it is superintendent robson shivered shoved his hands into his pockets hed obviously come in a hurry without umbrella or raincoat great patches of damp extended across his shoulders his spectacles were spotted with rain and what little hair he had was sagging wetly round his face and into his forehead let me help he said urgently its completely pointless to send me back to dagenham when im already here available to you thats something youll have to take up with ac hillier lynley said the pointlessness of it it doesnt have to be that way robson glanced round and nodded a few yards down the road will you pull over there for a moment so we can talk about this i have nothing more to say understood but i have you see and id very much like you to hear me out he stepped back from the car in what seemed like a gesture of goodwill one that left the decision up to lynley drive off or cooperate robson said a few words thats all and he gave a wry smile i wouldnt mind getting out of this rain if youll let me get in the car i promise to be gone the moment ive said my bit and heard your response to it and if i have no response youre not that sort so may i lynley considered then nodded sharply once havers said sir in that uncharacteristically beseeching manner she used when she disapproved of a decision hed taken he said we may as well barbara hes here he may have something we can use crikey are you she bit off her words as the back door opened and hamish robson sank into the car lynley drove a short distance away beyond the crowd he pulled to the kerb the engine still running and the wipers still moving rhythmically across the windscreen robson didnt fail to take notice of this he said ill be quick then id expect this crime scene to be different to the others not in all ways but in some am i right why lynley asked were you anticipating as much is it different robson persisted because you see with profiling we often see with respect dr robson your profiling has got us nowhere so far nowhere important and not one step closer to the killer are you sure before lynley could answer robson leaned forward in his seat he went on his voice kind i cant imagine having your job it must be more draining than anyone can picture but you must not blame yourself for this death superintendent youre doing your best no one could ask more of you than that so you mustnt ask more than your best of yourself thats the road to madness professional opinion lynley asked sardonically robson took the two words at their face value and ignored lynleys tone saying completely so let me give you a fuller opinion let me see the crime scene let me give you some guidance that youll be able to use superintendent in a psychopath the compulsion to kill only grows stronger with each crime it escalates it does not subside but each time to achieve pleasure it takes more and more of whatever the killers been doing during the commission of the crime to fulfill himself so understand me theres profound danger here to young men to boys to little children towe dont know for sure so for gods sake let me help you lynley had been watching robson through his rearview mirror havers from her seat where shed turned to observe the psychologist as he spoke the man looked as if hed shaken himself with the passion of his words and he turned from them to look out of the window when hed finally finished speaking lynley said whats your own background dr robson robson was gazing to his left in the direction of a yew hedge dripping small pools of water onto the pavement he said sorry i cant abide whats done to children in the name of love or play or discipline or whatever then he was silent only the soft whirr of the wipers brushing off the windscreen and the purr of the bentleys engine broke the quiet he finally said for me it was my maternal uncle wrestling he called it but it wasnt that sort of thing rarely is between an adult and a male child when its the adults idea but the child of course never understands im sorry lynley said he too turned in his seat then and looked at the psychologist directly but perhaps that makes you less objective than no believe me it makes me someone who knows exactly what to look for robson said so let me see the crime scene ill tell you what i think and what i know the decision to act is up to you im afraid thats not possible god damn it the bodys been moved dr robson lynley cut in the only crime scene for you to look at is a fallen beech tree and a hollow beneath it robson sank back into the seat he gazed out at the street where an ambulance had come along wood lane up to the barrier erected by the police it drove without lights whirling or siren blaring one of the constables went out into the street and halted trafficalready slowed to a curious crawl anywaylong enough for the ambulance to pass it did so unhurriedly there was no urgency to get its burden to hospital quickly this gave the photojournalists time to record the moment for the newspapers perhaps it was the sight of them that prompted robson to ask his next question will you let me look at the photos then lynley considered this the police photographer had completed his work by the time he and havers had arrived on the scene and a videographer had been recording the body the site and the ensuing activity round the body and the site when theyd descended the slope the incident caravan was not that far from where they were sitting at this moment doubtless in that caravan there would be a visual record of the crime scene already suitable for robsons viewing it wouldnt hurt at this point to let the profiler look at what they had video footage digital pictures or whatever else the murder squad had so far produced it would also act as a compromise between what hillier wanted and what lynley was determined not to give him on the other hand the psychologist wasnt wanted here no one at the scene had requested him and it was only down to hilliers interference and his desire for something to feed to the media that had brought robson here in the first place if lynley gave in to hillier now the ac would probably bring in a psychic next and after that what someone to read tea leaves or the entrails of a lamb it couldnt be allowed to happen someone had to gain control over the lurching runaway wagon of this entire situation and this was the moment to do it lynley said im sorry dr robson robson looked deflated he said your last word on the subject yes are you certain thats wise im not certain of anything thats really the hell of it isnt it robson got out of the car then he headed back towards the barricade he passed di widdison on his route but he made no attempt to speak to him for his part widdison saw lynleys car and raised a hand as if to stop him from leaving the scene lynley lowered the window as the di hurried over weve had a call from the hornsey road station widdison said when he reached the car a boys gone missing reported by his parents last night he fits the general description of our victim well take it lynley said as havers emptied her shoulder bag on the floor to find her notebook and take down the address it was in upper holloway on a small housing estate just off junction road there round the corner from william beckett funeral directors and yildiz supermarket they found a serpentine stretch of tarmac splendidly called bovingdon close it was a pedestrian precinct so they left the bentley on hargrave road where a bearded vagrant with a guitar in one hand and a wet sleeping bag dragging on the pavement behind him offered to keep an eye on the car for the price of a pint or a bottle of wine if they felt so inclined and he did a good job of keeping the local riffraff away from sch a fine motor as yairs is master he wore a large green rubbish bag as a mackintosh in the rain and he sounded like a character from a costume drama someone whod spent far too much of his youth tuned in to bbc theys ferrinners plenty round here he informed them you cant leave nothin lying bout what they dont put their mitts on it sir he appeared to search vaguely in the direction of his head for something to tug respectfully as he concluded when he spoke the air became heavy with the scent of teeth in need of extraction lynley told the man he was welcome to keep his eyes glued to the car the vagrant hunkered down on the nearest stairs to one of the terrace houses andrain or nothe began to pluck at the three strings remaining on his guitar sourly he eyed a pack of young black kids wearing rucksacks on their backs trotting along the pavement across the street lynley and havers left the man to it and set off into bovingdon close they accessed this by means of a tunnellike opening in the cinnamoncoloured brick buildings that comprised the housing estate itself they were looking for number and they found it not far from the estates sole recreational area a triangular green with dormant rosebushes languishing in each of the three corners and a small bench set against one side other than four saplings struggling for life in the greens patch of lawn there were no trees in bovingdon close and the houses that didnt face the tiny recreational area faced each other across a width of tarmac that didnt measure more than fifteen feet in the summer when the windows were open everyone would doubtless be into everyone elses business each of the houses had been given a sandwichsize plot of earth in front of its door that the more optimistic inhabitants were treating as their gardens in front of number the patch of earth in question was a rough triangle of dying grass and a childs bike lay on its side upon it next to a green plastic garden chair near this a tattered shuttlecock looked as if a dog had been chewing on it the accompanying racquets leaned against the wall by the front door most of their strings broken when lynley rang the bell a man in miniature opened the door he was not even eye to eye with havers top heavy with the look of someone who weight trained to compensate for his lack of height he was red eyed and unshaven and he glanced from them to the tarmac beyond them as if expecting someone else he said cops like the answer to a question no one had asked thats who we are lynley introduced himself and havers and waited for the manthey knew only that his name was bentonto ask them in beyond him lynley could see the doorway to a darkened sitting room and the shapes of people seated inside a childs querulous voice asked why couldnt they open the curtains why couldnt he play and a woman shushed him benton said harshly over his shoulder in that direction you mind what i told you then he gave his attention back to lynley wheres the uniform lynley said they werent part of the uniformed patrol but rather they worked in a different department and were from new scotland yard may we come in he asked its your son thats gone missing didnt come home last night bentons lips were dry and flaky he licked them he stepped back from the door and led them into the sitting room at the end of a corridor of no more than fifteen feet in the semidarkness there five people were arrayed on chairs the sofa a footstool and the floor two young boys two adolescent girls and a woman she was bev benton she said her husband was max and these were four of their children sherry and brenda the girls rory and stevie the boys their davey was the one gone missing all of them lynley noted were uncommonly small to one degree or another all of them also resembled the body in queens wood the boys were meant to be at school bev told them the girls were meant to be at work in the food stalls at camden lock market max and bev themselves were meant to be serving the public from their fish van in chapel street but no one was going anywhere from this house till they had word about davey somethings happened to him max benton said they wouldve sent regular coppers otherwise were none of us so thick s we dont know that much what is it then it might be best for us to speak without the children here lynley said bev benton keened two words oh god max barked at her well have none of that and then said to lynley they stay if its an object lesson theyre about to have then i by god want them having it mr benton therell be no mr benton about it benton said give us the brief lynley wasnt about to go at it that way he said have you a photograph of your son bev benton spoke sherry pet fetch daveys school picture from the fridge for the officer one of the two girlsblonde like the body in the woods and identically fair skinned delicate featured and small bonedleft them quickly and just as quickly returned she handed over the picture to lynley her eyes cast down to his shoes and then returned to the footstool which she shared with her sister lynley dropped his gaze to the picture a cheekylooking boy grinned up at him his fair hair darkened by the gel that formed it into little spikes he had a sprinkling of freckles across his nose and headphones slung round his neck above his schooluniform pullover slipped them on at the last minute he did bev benton commented as if in explanation of the headphones which were hardly part of his regulation school attire likes his music davey rap music mostly those blacks from america with the pculiar names the boy in the photo resembled the body they had but only an identification made by one of the parents could confirm this still no matter what sort of lesson max benton wanted the rest of his children to have lynley had no intention of offering it to them he said when was the last time you saw davey yesterday morning max was the one to answer he got off to school like always didnt come home when he was due though bev benton said he was meant to mind rory and stevie here i went to tae kwon do to see was he there max added last time he bunked off doing something he was meant to do thats where he claimed he went instead claimed barbara havers asked shed remained in the doorway and she was writing in her new spiral notebook he was meant to come to our fish stall in chapel market one day bev explained to help his dad when he didnt come he said hed gone to tae kwon do and lost the time theres a bloke hes had some trouble with andy crickleworth max put in little sods trying to sort davey out and set himself up as head of the crew davey runs with not a gang bev added hastily just boys they been mates for ages but this crickleworths new when davey said he wanted to see the tae kwon do i thought max had been standing but now he went to the sofa to join his wife he dropped down onto it and scrubbed his hands across his face the smaller children reacted to this evidence of their dads upset by huddling together at the knees of one of their sisters who put her hands on their shoulders as if to comfort them max brought himself under control saying tae kwon do people they never heard of davey never seen him didnt know him so i phoned the school to see had he been going truant without them telling us only he hadnt see todays the only day he didnt show up all term has he been in trouble with the police before havers asked ever face the magistrates ever been assigned to a young peoples group for straightening him out our davey doesnt need straightening out bev benton said he never even misses school and hes that good in his classes he is doesnt like anyone to know that mum sherry murmured as if believing her mother had betrayed a confidence in her final remark max added to this he was meant to be tough tough louts dont care much for school so davey acted the part bev explained but he wasnt like that and hes never been in trouble with the police never had a social worker why dyou keep asking that max bev turned to her husband as if for explanation lynley intervened have you phoned his friends the boys you mentioned no ones seen him bev replied and this other boy this andy crickleworth no one in the family had met him no one in the family even knew where to find him any chance davey mightve made him up havers asked looking up from her notebook covering for something else he was up to there was a little silence at this either no one knew or no one wanted to answer lynley waited curious and saw bev benton glance at her husband she seemed reluctant to say anything else lynley let the silence continue till max benton broke it bullies dint ever go after him did they they knew our daveyd sort them if they picked a fight he was small and benton seemed to realise hed slipped into the past tense and he stopped himself looking shaken his daughter sherry supplied the conclusion to his thought pretty she said our daveys dead pretty they all were that lynley thought pretty and small very nearly dolllike the boys especially would have to do something to compensate for that like fight back furiously if someone tried to harm them like end up getting bruised and banged about before they were throttled sliced and discarded in the woods lynley said may we see your sons bedroom mr benton why there might be some indication where hes gone off to havers said sometimes kids dont tell their parents everything if theres a mate you dont know about max exchanged a look with his wife it was the first time hed seemed anything but master of the family bev nodded encouragingly max told lynley and havers to come with him then he took them upstairs where three bedrooms opened onto a simple square landing in one of the rooms two sets of bunk beds stood against opposite walls a chest of drawers between them over one of the bed sets a shelf high on the wall held a collection of cds and a small neat stack of baseball caps beneath the upper bed the lower one had been removed altogether and in its place a private lair had been fashioned part of it was given over to clothes baggy trousers trainers jumpers and tshirts featuring graphics of the american rap artists bev benton had spoken about part of it contained a set of cheap metal bookshelves that upon inspection held all fantasy novels at the far end of the lair stood a small chest of drawers all of this max benton told them was daveys as lynley and havers ducked within each of them making for a different part max said in a voice no longer authoritarian but instead desperate and very much afraid you got to tell me wouldnt be here would you unless there was something more course i see why you dint want to say in front of the wife and the little ones but nowthey wouldve sent uniforms not you lot lynley had slid his hands into the pockets of the first pair of trousers as max benton was speaking he stopped though and came back out of the lair as havers continued searching within it he said youre right we have a body mr benton it was found in queens wood not far from highgate station max benton sagged a little but he waved lynley off when lynley would have taken his arm and led him to the lower of the two beds across the room he said davey were going to ask you to look at the body its the only way to be absolutely sure im terribly sorry he said again davey mr benton it may not be davey but you thinkelse why would you be troubling to come up here wanting to see his things sir from within the lair havers spoke lynley turned to see that she was holding out something for his inspection it was a set of handcuffs but not ordinary ones they were not metal but formed from heavy plastic and in the dim light beneath the upper mattress the handcuffs glowed havers said could be but she was cut off by max benton who said harshly i told him to return them things he said he did swore to me because he dint want me taking him along to make sure he handed them over to who havers asked he got em off a stall in the stables market dint he over by camden lock he said they were a present from a vendor there but what vendor hands out goods to kids hanging about you tell me so i reckoned he nicked them and i told him to take them back straightaway little bugger mustve hid them instead what stall in the market did he tell you lynley asked magic stall he said i dont know the blokes name he never said and i dint ask i just told him to take the handcuffs back and to bloody well stop pinching clobber not belonging to him magic stall barbara havers asked are you sure about that mr benton thats what he said havers came out of the lair then she said to lynley could i have a word sir she didnt wait for him to reply she left the bedroom and went onto the landing she said to lynley in a quiet terse voice bloody hell i mayve been wrong tunnel vision whatever you want to call it havers this isnt the moment for sharing your epiphanies lynley said wait ive been thinking all along of colossus but i never thought of magic what kid fifteen and under doesnt like magic no sir wait as lynley was about to leave her to her streamofconsciousness monologue wendys cloud is in camden lock market right next door to the stables now shes hopped up on something much of the time and she cant say what shes selling or when shes selling it but shes carried ambergris oil in the pastwe know thatand when i finished talking to her the other day and was hiking back to my car i saw this bloke at the stables what bloke he was unloading boxes he was taking them into a magic stall or something like a magic stall and he was a magician thats what he said there cant be more than one of them at the stables can there and listen to this sir he was driving a van red purple but in the light of a streetlamp at three am or wheneveryoure at your window you catch a glimpse you dont even think about it because after all this is a huge city were talking about and why would you think you were meant to notice everything about it if a vans on the street at three am lettering on the van yeah it was a magician advert thats not what were looking for havers thats not what we saw on the cctv tape from st georges gardens but we dont know what that van was the st georges gardens one it could have been the warden opening up or someone there to make a repair at three in the morning carrying a suspiciouslooking tool that very well could have cut the lock from the gate havers just hang on please for all we know that could have a logical explanation thatll be sorted out in another hour bloody hell the bloke couldve had legitimate business in the garden and what you thought was a tool was something to do with that business he could have been doing anything making a repair taking a piss making an early newspaper delivery testing out a new sort of milk float anything my point is all right yes i see she went on as if lynley were still not onboard and i talked to this bloke this magician i saw him so if this body in queens wood is davey and if this bloke i saw is the one who had the handcuffs nicked by davey she let him finish her thought which he did in short order he damn well better have an alibi for last night yes all right barbara i see how youre putting it together and its him sir davey you know it the body yes i think it is but we cant go further without the formality ill deal with that and shll i get on to the stables market make the connection between davey and this magician if you can once you do that get him in for questioning i think weve got our first real break sir i hope youre right lynley replied chapter seventeen barbara havers took the glowinthedark handcuffs with her to the stables market which was as suggested by its name an enormous old artillery stable of grimy brick it ran along a section of chalk farm road but she entered by means of camden lock place and began asking the whereabouts of the magic stall at the very first shop this was an establishment selling furniture and fabrics from the subcontinent the air was acrid with the scent of patchouli and sitar music blared forth from speakers insufficient to handle the volume the shop assistant didnt know anything about a magic stall but she reckoned tara powell over at body piercing could direct barbara wherever she needed to go does fine work tara the shop assistant said she herself had a silver stud beneath her lower lip barbara found the bodypiercing stall without any trouble tara powell turned out to be a cheerful twentysomething girl with appalling teeth her bow to her employment consisted of half a dozen holes from the lobe to the top of her right ear as well as a thin gold ring through her left eyebrow she was in the middle of driving a needle through the septum of an adolescent girls nose while her boyfriend stood by with the chosen piece of jewellery in his palm it was a thick ring not unlike those used on cows that barbara thought was going to be attractive tara was nattering on aboutof all thingsthe prime ministers hairline she apparently had done some considerable research into the subject of the burden of power and responsibility and its effect on hair loss she could not however apparently apply much of her theory to lady thatcher it turned out that tara did indeed know where the magic stall was she said that barbara would find it in the alley when barbara asked what alley she said the alley and rolled her eyes in such a way as to communicate that the information ought to be sufficient then she turned to her customer and said thisll pinch a bit luv and with one deft thrust she drove the needle through the girls nose barbara beat a hasty retreat as the girl screamed slumped over and tara cried smelling salts quick to someone it was barbara thought an edgy kind of employment although barbara lived not far from camden high street and its markets and although shed been in the stables many times she hadnt known that the narrow passage in which she finally found the magic stall had a name it wasnt so much an actual alley as it was a gap lined on one side by the brick wall of one of the old artillery buildings and on the other by a long row of holdings from which vendors sold their wares everything from books to boots the place was dimly lit by bare bulbs dangling from a cord that ran the length of the alley they broke into a gloom that was accentuated by the sooty stable wall and the darkly stained stalls opposite not all of them were open this being a weekday but the magic stall was as barbara approached it she could see the same oddly dressed man shed earlier seen unloading his van in the street he was doing a rope trick to entertain a group of enthralled young boys who instead of being at school were gathered round his stall they were just about the sizeand the ageof the dead boy in queens wood barbara noted she stood at the side of the group watching the magician interact with the boys at the same time as she studied his stall it wasnt largeabout the size of a wardrobebut hed managed to cram it with magic tricks with practical jokes along the lines of artificial vomit suitable for laying on mums new carpet with videos of magic acts books on illusions and old magazines among the items for sale were handcuffs identical to those barbara had in her pocket they were part of a sideline in saucy bedroom toys that were on offer as well barbara worked her way round to the back of the group to have a better look at the magician he was dressed as hed been when shed last seen him and she noted that his red stocking cap not only covered his head completely but also came down over his eyebrows as well with the addition of his dark glasses to complete the ensemble the magician had successfully obscured the upper half of his face and head under normal circumstances barbara wouldnt have thought too much about this detail under the conditions of a murder inquiry however a quirky costume going along with a pair of handcuffs a dead boy and a van made the bloke doubly suspicious barbara wanted to get him alone she eased her way round to the front of the group and began to look over the magic tricks for sale the goods here seemed suitable for kids magic colouring books linking rings flying coins and the like this put barbara in mind of hadiyyah and hadiyyahs solemn little face and sorrowful wave behind the french windows whenever barbara passed the groundfloor flat in eton villas and that put barbara in mind of azhar of the unpleasant words theyd exchanged the last time theyd seen each other theyd been scrupulously avoiding each other ever since a peace offering was called for but barbara wasnt sure which one of them ought to be offering it she picked up the pencilpenetration kit and read the scanty directions borrow a fivepound note from someone in your audience push the pencil into its centre rip it sideways and taduh the fivepound note remained intact she was reflecting on its suitability as a peace offering when she heard the magician say thatll be all for now run along you lot ive work to do a few of the children protested asking for just one more trick but he was adamant next time he said and shooed them off he wore barbara saw fingerless gloves on his pasty hands the kids departedalthough not before mr magic separated one boy from the flying coin trick hed attempted to pinch as he drifted awayand then the magician was all barbaras was there something he could help her with he asked barbara purchased the pencilpenetration kit an investment of less than two quid in the cause of neighbourly peace she said youre good with the kids you must have them hanging round all the time magic he said with a shrug as he put the kit neatly into a small plastic bag magic and boys they seem to go together just like marmite and toast his lips curved in an icanthelpmyownpopularity smile barbara said they must get on your nerves after a time all these little blokes hanging about and wanting you to perform for them its good for business he said they go home talk to mum and dad about what theyve seen and when a birthday party comes up they know what they want for the entertainment a magic show he swept off the stocking cap and bowed mr magic at their service or yours birthday parties bar mitzvahs the odd christening new years eve et cetera barbara blinked then made a quick recovery as the man drew his cap back over his head he was using it she saw for the same reason he was probably also using the dark glasses and the gloves he appeared to be an albino dressed as he was at the moment he would garner the occasional look in the street dressed otherwisewith the colourless hair revealed and the eyes unshadedhed have been gawped at not to mention tormented by the very kids who admired him now he handed his business card over to barbara she did him the same courtesy and watched what she could see of his face to note a reaction he said police new scotland yard at your service ah well they cant be wanting a magic show there good recovery barbara thought she brought the glowinthedark handcuffs out of her shoulder bag they were encased in a plastic evidence bag on their way to be fingerprinted these came from your stall i understand barbara said recognise them i sell something like the magician replied you can see for yourself i keep them over with the saucy items a kid called davey benton had these off you according to his dad when we called at his house pinched them he did he was meant to bring them back and turn them over to you the dark glasses prevented barbara from reading any reaction in the magicians eyes she was reliant on the tone of his voice which was perfectly even as he said pleasantly obviously he dropped the ball on that which part barbara asked pinching them or returning them since you found them in his things i expect we can say he dropped the ball on returning them yeah i expect barbara said only i didnt quite say id found them among his things did i the magician turned his back and coiled the rope from the rope trick into a neat and snakelike mound barbara smiled inwardly when he did this gotcha she thought in her experience every smooth customer had a rough edge somewhere mr magic gave his attention back to her the handcuffs may have come from me you can see i sell them but im hardly the only person in london with saucy items for purchase or for pinching no but i expect youre the closest to daveys home arent you id hardly know has something happened to this boy somethings happened to him yes barbara said hes pretty much dead dead dead but lets not play echoes when we went through his things and came up with these and his dad told us where theyd come from because davey told himyou can see how i ended up wanting to know if they look familiar to you mr whats your real name i know its not magic weve met before by the way he didnt ask where his name was minshall he said it was barry minshall and yes all right it seemed that the handcuffs had come from his stall if the boy had claimed as much to his dad but the fact was that kids pinched things didnt they kids always pinched things it was part of being kids they pushed the envelope nothing ventured nothing gained and since all the cops seemed to do round here was give them a talking to if they were caught misbehaving what did they stand to lose by having a go eh oh he tried to keep an eye out for that sort of thing but sometimes he missed a set of sticky fingers adhering to an article like glowinthedark handcuffs sometimes he said a kid was just too bloody good a regular artful dodger barbara listened to all this nodding and doing her best to look thoughtful and openminded but she could hear the slow building of anxiety in barry minshalls voice and it acted on her the way the scent of fox acts on a pack of hounds this bloke was lying through his teeth and out of his nostrils she thought he was the sort who saw himself cool as a lettuce leaf which was just how she liked it since lettuce was always so easy to wilt she said youve got a van somewhere i saw you unloading it last time i was here id like to have a look at it if you dont mind why lets call it curiosity i dont think im obliged to show it to you not without a warrant at least right you are but if we go that routewhich of course is your rightim going to wonder like hell if youve got something in that van that you dont want me finding ill be wanting to ring my solicitor about this ring away barry here ive got a mobile you can use she thrust half of her arm into her capacious bag and dug round enthusiastically minshall said i have my own look i cant leave the stall youll need to come back later no need for you to leave the stall at all mate barbara said hand over the keys to the van and ill have a browse through it on my own he thought this one over behind his dark glasses and beneath the dickensian stocking cap barbara could imagine the wheels turning furiously in his head as he tried to decide which route to take demanding both a solicitor and a search warrant was the sensible and the wise thing to do but people were seldom either sensible or wise when they had something to hide and the cops turned up unexpectedly asking questions and wanting answers on the spot that was when people made the foolish decision to bluff their way through a few difficult moments mistakenly assuming that inspector plod had come calling and concluding they were more than a match for him they thought that if they asked for their solicitor immediatelydoing what those american police dramas always called lawyering uptheyd be marking themselves forever with a scarlet g for guilty across their chests truth was theyd be marking themselves with the scarlet i for intelligent but they seldom thought that way under pressure which was what barbara was depending upon now minshall reached his decision he said this is a waste of your time worse its a waste of mine but if you believe its necessary for whatever reason barbara smiled trust me im one of the lot who serve protect and do no ill fine all right but youll have to wait while i close up the stall and then ill take you to the van itll take a few minutes im afraid i hope you have the time mr minshall barbara said you are one lucky sod because time is exactly what i have today when lynley arrived back at new scotland yard he discovered that the media were already gathering setting up shop in the little park that covered the corner where victoria street met broadway there two distinct television crewsrecognisable by the logos on their vans and on their equipmentwere in the process of constructing what appeared to be a broadcasting point while nearby beneath the dripping trees in the park several reporters milled about distinguishable from the crew by their manner of dress lynley observed this with a hollow heart it was he knew too much to hope for that the media were here for any reason other than the killing of a sixth adolescent boy a sixth killing warranted their immediate attention it also made them unlikely to go along with how the dpa wanted them to cover the situation he negotiated the confusion in the street and pulled into the entrance that would take him down to the carpark there however the officer in the kiosk didnt employ his usual one finger acknowledgement and lift the barrier for him instead he sauntered out to the bentley and waited while lynley lowered the window he bent to the interior message for you he said youre to go straight to the assistant commissioners office do not pass go and all the trappings if you know what i mean ac made the call personally making sure there was no ifs ands and buts about it im to phone to tell him youve arrived s well question is how much time dyou want we can make it anything only he doesnt want you stopping to talk to your team on the way lynley muttered christ then after a moments thought wait ten minutes right you are the officer stepped back and admitted lynley to the carpark in the subdued light and the silence lynley used the ten minutes to close his eyes remaining in the bentley with his head pressed against the headrest it was never easy he thought you believed it might become so eventually if you were exposed to enough of horror and its aftermath but just at the point where you thought you had mastered insentience something occurred to remind you that you were still fully human no matter what youd previously thought that had been the case while standing alongside max benton as hed identified the body of his oldest son no polaroid picture would do for him no viewing from behind a glass partition a safe distance from which there would always be certain aspects of the boys death that he would not have to know or at least not have to see firsthand instead hed insisted upon seeing it all refusing to say whether it was his missing boy until hed been a witness to everything that marked the way davey had gone to his death then what hed said was he fought him then like he was meant to like i taught him he fought the bastard this is your son mr benton lynley asked the formality not only an automatic question but also a way to avoid the onslaught of restrained emotionthat could never actually be adequately restrainedthat he felt trying to burst from the other man said from the first that the world cant be trusted benton replied said from the first its a brutal place but he never wanted to listen like i tried to get him to listen did he and this is what happens this i want em here the rest f em i want em to see his voice broke then and he went on in anguish bloke tries his best to teach his kids whats what out there bloke lives to make them understand that they got to take a care be on their guard know what could happenthas what i told him our davey and no coddling from bev either cause theyre meant to be tough the lot of them you look like that and you got to be tough you got to be aware you got to knowyou got to understandlisten to me you little sod why dont you see its for your own bloody good he wept then collapsing against a wall and then hitting that wall with his fist saying damn you to hell with his voice catching as his sobbing trapped the words in his throat there was no comfort and lynley honoured max bentons grief by not offering him any he just said im so sorry mr benton before he guided the broken man away now in the carpark lynley took the time he needed to recover knowing he had been touched more deeply than ever before in the face of a parents loss of a child because he too would soon join the ranks of men with sons in whom their fathers sometimes unwisely invest their dreams benton was right and lynley knew it a mans duty was to protect his offspring when he failed in that dutyfailed spectacularly as was the failure felt by any parent who lost a child to murderhis guilt was second only to his grief marriages broke down as a result loving families were torn asunder and everything once held dear and secure was shattered by the advent of an evil every parent feared might alight upon his child but one that no one could anticipate there was no recovering from such an event there was no waking up some future morning having successfully swum all night in the lethe that did not happeneverto the parents of a child whose life was taken by a killer six now lynley thought six children six sets of parents six families six and all the media counting he went as requested up to ac hilliers office by now robson would have informed the assistant commissioner of lynleys refusal to allow him onto the crime scene and hillier would doubtless be in a state about that the ac was in a meeting with the head of the press bureau so hilliers secretary informed lynley however the ac had left explicit orders that on the off chance that acting superintendent lynley put in an appearance whilst the meeting was ongoing he should join them at once hes bearing judi macintosh hesitated it seemed more for effect than out of the necessity to find the perfect words hes bearing a certain degree of animosity towards you at the moment superintendent forewarned and so on lynley acknowledged her with a polite nod he often wondered how hillier had managed to acquire a secretary so perfectly matched to his style of leadership stephenson deacon had brought two young assistants with him to his meeting with hillier lynley discovered when he joined them one male and one female they both looked like interns fresh scrubbed eager and solicitous neither hillier nor the acidulous deaconwhod come along from the directorate of public affairs bearing a litre of soda water for some reasonoffered any introductions youve seen the circus i take it hillier said to lynley without preamble the established briefings arent giving satisfaction were countering with something to head them off the male intern lynley noted was religiously writing down hilliers every word the female on the other hand was studying lynley with a discomfiting intensity giving the job the rapt attention of a predator i thought you were doing crimewatch sir lynley said the crimewatch decision was before all this obviously its not going to suffice by itself then what lynley hadnt given the assistant commissioner the information about the cctv footage and he didnt do so now he wanted to wait till he heard from havers about her interview at the stables youre not going to feed them misinformation i hope hillier didnt look pleased with this remark and lynley realised it had been ill advised thats not my habit superintendent the ac said and then to the head of the press bureau tell him mr deacon embedding deacon uncapped his soda water and took a swig buggersll have sod all to complain about then begging your pardon miss clapp he added to the young woman who looked nonplussed to be on the receiving end of this social nicety lynley thought he understood but he didnt want to he said i beg your pardon embedding deacon repeated his tone impatient placing a journalist inside the inquiry a firsthand witness to how the police investigate on crime of this scale the sort of thing they sometimes do in wartime if you know what i mean surely youve heard of this superintendent hillier asked lynley had of course he merely couldnt believe that the press bureau was considering adopting something so foolhardy he said to hillier we cant do that sir endeavouring to be as polite as possible which was something of an effort its unheard of and certainly its never been done superintendent stephenson deacon said with a specious smile but thats not to say that it cant be done we have in the past after all invited the media along on coordinated arrests this merely takes it one step further placement of a diligently chosen reporterfrom a broadsheet mind you well draw the line at tabloid journalistscan turn the tide of public opinion not only towards this particular investigation but also towards the entire met i dont have to point out to you how agitated the public are becoming over this case the front page of todays daily mail for example will be used to line someones rubbish bin tomorrow lynley said he addressed his next remarks to hillier and he tried to sound as rational as deacon sir this sort of thing could create unimaginable difficulties for us how could the teamat a morning meeting for examplespeak freely when they know that any word they say might end up on the front page of the next edition of the guardian and how do we address the problem of the contempt of court act if a journalists among us that hillier said quite evenly although he was keeping his eyes on lynley and had been doing so from the moment lynley had entered the room is the journalists problem not ours have you any idea how often we toss about names although lynley could feel himself losing the edge he had on his temper he believed the issues involved were more important than his ability to express them with holmesian dispassion can you imagine what the reaction is going to be from an individual who finds himself named as helping with police inquiries when that isnt the case at all that would be down to the broadsheet involved superintendent deacon said smugly and in the meantime if the individual named is actually the killer were looking for if he then goes to ground surely youre not suggesting that you wish him to keep on killing so that you might find him deacon said what im suggesting is that this isnt a bloody game ive just been with the father of a thirteenyearold boy whose body we need words about that hillier interrupted he finally took his gaze off lynley and directed it to deacon he said come up with the list of names stephenson id like cvs on them all sample articles as well ill have a decision for you in he looked at his watch and then consulted the diary on his desk i should think fortyeight hours will be sufficient dyou want a word leaked to the proper ears this came from the male minion whod finally looked up from his note taking the female continued to say nothing and her inspection of lynley did not shift not at the moment hillier said ill be in touch thats that then deacon said lynley watched as the three of them gathered up notebooks manila folders briefcases and bags they left the room in a line with deacon at the head lynley didnt follow but rather used the time in an attempt to marshall tranquility he finally said malcolm webberly was a miracle worker hillier sat behind his desk and observed lynley over steepled fingers dont lets talk about my brotherinlaw i think we need to lynley went on its only just come to me the lengths he must have gone to to keep you under wraps watch yourself i dont think it benefits either of us if i do you can be replaced which you couldnt do to webberly because hes your brotherinlaw and there was no way on earth that your wife would see you sacking her sisters husband not when she knew her sisters husband was the only thing standing between you and the end of your career thats quite enough youve got everything the wrong way round in this investigation youve probably always been like that with only webberly standing between you and the discovery of hillier surged to his feet i said thats enough but now hes not here and youre exposed and im left with the option of seeing you hang us all or just yourself so which course do you expect me to take i expect you to obey the orders youre given as theyre given and when theyre given not when theyre senseless lynley tried to calm himself he managed to say in a quieter tone sir i cant let you interfere any longer im going to have to demand that you either stop meddling in the investigation or ill have to and there lynley stopped halted in midstride by the satisfied expression that flitted briefly across hilliers face he suddenly realised that his own myopia had propelled him into the acs trap and that realisation prompted his understanding of why superintendent webberly had always made it known to his brotherinlaw which of his officers ought to succeed him even if such succession were only to be a temporary measure lynley could walk off the job at the drop of a hat without suffering a moments hardship the others couldnt he had an income independent of the met for the other dis the met put food on their families table and a roof over their heads circumstances would force them time and again to submit to hilliers directives without argument because none of them could afford to be sacked webberly had seen lynley as the only one of them with the slightest chance of keeping at least some kind of rein on his brotherinlaw god knew he owed the superintendent that favour lynley thought webberly had often enough been willing to do the same for him or hilliers voice was deadly lynley sought a new direction sir weve got another killing to contend with we cant be asked to contend with journalists as well yes hillier said another killing youve acted in direct defiance of an order superintendent and youd better have a good explanation for that they were finally down to it lynley thought his refusal to let hamish robson view the scene of the crime he didnt obfuscate by getting on to something else he said i left word at the barrier no one without id onto the crime scene robson had no id and the constables at the barrier hadnt a clue who he was he might have been anyone and specifically he might have been a reporter and when you saw him when you spoke to him when he made the request to see the photos the video what remained of the scene or anything else i refused lynley said but you know that already or we wouldnt be talking about it now thats right and now youre going to listen to what robson has to say sir if youll excuse me ive a team to see and work to be getting on with this is more important than my authority trumps yours hillier said and youre facetoface with a direct order now i understand that lynley said but if he hasnt seen the photos we cant waste time while he hes seen the video hes read the preliminary reports hillier smiled thinly when he saw lynleys surprise as i said my authority trumps yours superintendent so sit down youre going to be here awhile hamish robson had the grace to look apologetic he also had the grace to look as uncomfortable as any intuitive man might have looked in the same situation he came into the office with a yellow legal pad in his hand and a small stack of paperwork the latter he handed over to hillier he cocked his head at lynley and raised one shoulder in a quick diffident movement that said not my idea lynley nodded in turn he bore the man no animosity as far as he was concerned both of them were doing their jobs under extremely difficult conditions hillier obviously wanted dominance to be the theme of the meeting he did not move from behind his desk to go to the conference table at which hed held his colloquy with the press chief and his cohorts and he motioned robson to join lynley in sitting before him together they ended up resembling two supplicants come before the throne of pharaoh only the prostration was missing what have you come up with hamish hillier asked eschewing any polite preliminaries robson used his thumbs to hold his legal pad across his knees his face appeared feverish and lynley felt a momentary surge of sympathy for the man it was the rock and the hard place for him once again with the earlier crimes robson said and he sounded unsure about how exactly to negotiate the landscape of tension between the two met officers the killer achieved the sense of omnipotence he was after through the overt mechanics of the crime i mean the abduction of the victim the restraining and the gagging the rituals of burning and incising but in this case in queens wood those earlier behaviours werent enough whatever he gained from the earlier crimeslets continue to posit it was powerwas denied to him with this one that triggered a rage within him that he hasnt so far felt and it was a rage that surprised him i expect since hes no doubt come up with an elaborate rationale for why hes been murdering these boys and rage has never come into the equation but now he feels it because hes being thwarted in his desire for power so he feels the full brunt of a sudden need to punish what he sees as defiance in his victim this victim becomes responsible for not giving the killer what hes got from every other victim so far robson had been looking at his notes as he spoke but now he raised his head as if needing to be told he could continue lynley said nothing hillier nodded curtly so he turns to physical abuse with this boy robson said in advance of the killing and he feels no remorse for the crime afterwards the bodys not laid out and arranged like an effigy instead its dumped and its placed where it might have been days before anyone stumbled upon it so we can assume the killers keeping watch over the investigation and making an effort now not only to leave no evidence at the scene but also to run no risk of being seen i expect youve talked to him already he knows youre closing in and he has no intention of giving you anything henceforth to connect him to the crime is that why there are no restraints this time round lynley asked i dont think so rather prior to this particular murder the killer thought hed achieved the degree of omnipotence hes been seeking for most of his life this delusional sense of power led him to believe he didnt even need to immobilize his next victim but without the restraints as things turned out the boy fought him and that required a personal means of dispatching him so instead of the garrotte the killer uses his hands only through this personal means can he regain the sense of power the need for which motivates him to kill in the first place your conclusion then hillier asked youre dealing with an inadequate personality hes either dominated by others or he pictures himself as dominated by others he has no idea how to get out of any situation in which he perceives himself as less powerful than the people round him and he particularly has no idea how to get out of the situation hes currently in the situation of the killing you mean hillier clarified oh no robson said he feels perfectly capable of leading the police on a merry chase when it comes to murder but in his personal life hes caught by something and in such a way as to perceive no escape this might be employment a failing marriage a parental relationship in which he has more responsibility than he likes a parental relationship in which he has long been the underdog some sort of financial failure hes hiding from a wife or life partner that sort of thing but you say he knows were on to him hillier said weve spoken to him been in touch in some way robson nodded any one of those is possible he said and this latest body superintendent this last he said to lynley alone everything about this body suggests youve come closer to the killer than you realise chapter eighteen barbara havers watched as barry minshallaka mr magicclosed up his stall in the alley he took his time about it every movement designed to communicate how much trouble the rozzers were causing him down came the display of saucy playthings all of which had to be placed with undo gentleness in collapsible cardboard boxes that he kept stashed in a pile in a cubbyhole designed for this express purpose above the stall put away were the gag items in a similar fashion as well as a number of the magic tricks every object had its particular storage spot and minshall made certain it was deposited there in an exact position known only to him through all this barbara waited in ease she had all the time he was intent upon demonstrating that he needed and if he happened to be using that time to concoct a story about davey benton and the handcuffs she herself used it to note those features about the alley that promised to assist her in the coming exchange with mr magic for there would be an exchange she knew this bloke didnt look the type to stand by idly as she rooted through his van he was heading for too much trouble for that so in the minutes he took to shut up shop she saw what could help her when the time came to put the thumbscrews on the magician the cctv cameras mounted at the mouth of the alley near a chinese food stall and a bathsalts vendor some six yards away who was watching minshall with a great deal of interest even as the vendor devoured a samosa the grease from which dripped down his hand and into the cuff of his shirt that bloke barbara decided looked like someone with a tale to tell he did in a manner of speaking when they passed him a few minutes later on their way out of the alley he said gotcherself a lady friend bar now thats a change innit i thought you liked the boys minshall said pleasantly do go fuck yourself miller and passed by the stall barbara said hang on and paused she showed her id to the bathsalts vendor think you could identify some pictures of boys who mightve hung about his stall in the past few months she asked him miller was suddenly cautious what sort of boys the sort whove turned up dead all round london he flicked a glance at minshall i dont want no trouble i dint know you were a cop when i said what difference does that make i dint see anything he turned and busied himself with his wares its dim along here wouldnt know one boy from another anyway sure you would john minshall said you spend enough time ogling them dont you and then to havers constable you were interested in my van he continued on his way barbara took note of the vendors name she knew that his remarks about barry minshall could mean nothing as could minshalls remarks about him just the natural animosity that males sometimes have for each other or they could have been the result of minshalls oddity of appearance and millers schoolboy reaction to that but in either case they were worth looking into barry minshall led her in the direction of the main entrance to the stables market they emerged into chalk farm road as a train rumbled by on the overhead tracks in the fading light of the late afternoon the streetlamps glowed against the wet pavement and the diesel fumes of a passing lorry scented the air with the heavy bouquet that was quintessentially winter london in the rain because of the cold and the damp the usual suspectsgoths head to toe in black and oldage pensioners wondering what the hell had happened to the neighbourhoodwere absent from the pavements in their places commuters hurried home from work and shop owners began to move their wares inside barbara noted the looks that barry minshall got as they passed these people even in an area of town known for the general weirdness of its inhabitants the magician stood out either for the dark glasses long coat and stocking cap he wore or for an emanation of malevolence that formed an aura round him barbara knew which she believed it was stripped of the patina of purity suggested by the innocence of his magic tricks barry minshall was a nasty piece of business she said to him tell me mr minshall what sorts of places do you usually perform the magic i mean cant be you only use it to entertain the kids who stop at your stall i expect youd get a little rusty round the fingers if you left it to that minshall shot her a glance she reckoned he was evaluating not only the question but also the various reactions she might have to his answers she offered him options cocktail parties for example ladies clubs private organisations he made no reply birthday parties she went on i expect youre quite the thing at them what about at schools as a special treat for the kids church functions boy scouts girl guides he plodded onward what about south of the river mr minshall ever do anything there round elephant and castle what about youth organisations trips to borstal in the holidays he gave her nothing he didnt intend to phone his solicitor about her request to see his van but he clearly wasnt going to say a word that might put him in further jeopardy so he was only half a fool she decided no problem half was probably enough his van turned out to be on jamestown road parked with one tyre on the kerb facing the oncoming traffic fortunately minshall had left it beneath a streetlamp and a pool of yellow light fell directly upon it enhanced by a security system that switched on brightly at the front of a house some fifteen feet away that in addition to the daylight still lingering made further illumination unnecessary lets have a look then barbara said with a nod at the vans rear doors dyou want to do the honours or shall i she dug round in her bag and brought out a pair of latex gloves as she spoke this it seemed prompted him to speak i hope you see my cooperation for what it is constable and what would that be a fairly good indication that i wish to be helpful i havent done anything to anyone mr minshall im dead chuffed to hear it barbara said open her up please minshall fished a set of keys out of his overcoat he opened the van and stepped back to let barbara inspect its contents these comprised boxes boxes upon boxes the magician in fact appeared to be keeping the entire cardboard industry in business feltpen markings identified the putative contents of what seemed like three dozen containers cards coins cups dice hankie scarf rope videos books mags sex toys gags beneath all of these however barbara could see that the floor of the van was carpeted the carpet was frayed and a curious dark stain shaped like antlers reached out from beneath the cards and coins box suggesting not only more of a stain beneath but alsopossiblyan attempt to hide it in the first place barbara stepped back she swung the doors closed minshall said satisfied and he soundedto her earslike a man relieved she said not quite lets have a look up front he seemed as if he wanted to protest but thought better of it with a mutter he unlocked the drivers door and opened it barbara said not that one and indicated the passengers door instead inside the front of the van was a mobile rubbish tip and barbara sifted her way through food wrappers coke cans ticket stubs carpark stubs and handouts of the sort one found placed beneath windscreen wipers after a stint of parking on a public street it was in short a treasure trove of evidence if davey bentonor any one of the other dead boyshad been in this van there were going to be dozens of signs indicating that barbara slid her hand under the passenger seat to see if there were more goodies hidden from the eye she brought forth a plastic disk of the sort one gets when checking a coat somewhere along with a pencil two biros and an empty videocassette case she moved round to the other side of the car where minshall stood at the drivers door perhaps mistakenly thinking she intended to let him drive off into the sunset she gave him the nod and he opened it for her she slid her hand under the drivers seat her fingers made contact with several objects here as well she brought out a small pocket torchoperationaland a pair of scissorsdull and suitable for cutting only butter and finally a blackandwhite photograph she looked down at this and then up at barry minshall she turned it round facing him and held it to her chest dyou want to give me the story on this bar she asked him amiably or shall i guess his reply was immediate and she could have laid money on its coming he said i dont know how that barry save the line for later youre going to need it she told him to hand over his keys and she pulled her mobile phone from her bag she punched in the numbers and waited for lynley to take the call until we find that van from the cctv film lynley said and until we know why it was going into st georges gardens in the middle of the night i dont want it broadcast winston nkata looked up from the notes he was taking in his small leatherbound book he said hilliers going to blow thats the risk well have to take lynley cut in we run a bigger riska double riskif the news of that van goes out prematurely we tip our hand to the killer or if that van on the tape does have a reason for being there weve just predisposed the public to be thinking in terms of a red van when the actual vehicle could be something else that residue on the bodies though nkata said it says ford transit doesn it but not the colour so id like to avoid the whole matter for now nkata still didnt look convinced hed come to lynleys office for the final word on what was going to be broadcast on crimewatchhaving been entrusted with the task by ac hillier who it appeared had given up micromanaging the investigation for the time it was probably going to take him to decide what he wanted to wear on television in a few hoursand he looked down at his meagre notes and no doubt wondered how he was going to relay this information to their superior officer without raising his ire that lynley decided could not be his worry theyd given hillier plenty of details to use on the programme and he trusted that hilliers need to seem liberal in matters of race would keep him from taking out whatever frustration he had on nkata nonetheless he said ill take the heat on this winnie and added as a means of giving the ds further ammunition until we hear from barbara about that van she saw the magician driving we hold back so go with that efit from square four gym and the reconstruction of kimmo thornes abduction i expect well get a result from that a sharp knock on the door and di stewart popped his head inside lynleys office he said a word tommy and nodded a hello to nkata adding got your face powdered for the cameras word has it your fan mails doubling every day nkata took the teasing with resignation he said im forwarding it all on to you man since the wifes had enough youll need a dating service right fact theres a special letter come from a bird in leeds twenty stone she says but i xpect you can handle that much woman stewart didnt smile sod you he said honours returned nkata got to his feet and headed out of the office stewart took his place in one of the two chairs in front of lynleys desk he tapped his fingers against his thigh in the rhythmical pattern he adopted whenever he didnt have something in his hands to play with he was lynley knew from experience a man who could dish it out but not take it that was a bit below the belt stewart said were all losing our sense of humour john i dont like my personal life no one does have you got something for me stewart appeared to consider this before he spoke pinching the crease in his trousers and removing a speck of lint from his knee two pieces of news an id on the quaker street body courtesy of ulrike elliss list of missing colossus kids he was called dennis butcher fourteen years old from bromley did we have him on the list of missing persons stewart shook his head parents are divorced dad thought he was with mum and her lover mum thought he was with dad dads girlfriend her two kids and their new baby so he was never reported missing at least thats the story they tell whereas the truth is good riddance as far as they were concerned we had the devil of a time getting either one of them to help id the body tommy lynley looked away from stewart and out of the window through which the lights of nighttime london were beginning to glow id very much like someone to explain the human race to me fourteen years old why was he sent to colossus assault with a flick knife he went to youth offenders first another soul needing purification then he fits the mould lynley turned back to the di and the other piece of news weve finally come up with the boots where kimmo thorne bought his makeup have you indeed where is it southwark stewart shook his head we watched every tape from every boots in the vicinity of his home and then in the area of colossus we got nothing so we had another look at the paperwork on kimmo and saw he hung round leicester square it didnt take long from there plotted out a quartermile radius from the square and found a boots in james street there he was buying his slap in the company of some bloke looking like the grim reaper gone gothic that would be charlie burov lynley said blinker as hes commonly called a mate of kimmos well he was there big as life both of them quite the pair kimmo and charlie hard to miss the person at the till was female by the way and there was a queue four people waiting to be served anyone matching our efit from square four gym not so you could tell but its cctv film tommy you know what thats like what about the profilers description what about it its vague enough to match threequarters of the underforty male population of london the way i see it were dotting and crossing enough is and ts and we may stumble across what were looking for there was truth to that the endless slog that left no stone unturned for it was often the least expected stone that upended revealed a vital piece of information lynley said well want havers to have a look at the film then stewart frowned havers why shes the only person so far whos seen everyone were interested in at colossus so youre taking her theory on board stewart asked the question casuallyand it wasnt an illogical inquirybut there was something in the tone of it as well as in the attention stewart suddenly gave to a thread on the seam of his trousers that made lynley look more sharply at the di im taking every theory onboard he replied have you a problem with that no problem no stewart said then the di moved restlessly in his chair he seemed to consider how best to answer and he finally decided saying theres some muttering about favoritism tommy among the rest of the team and theres also the matter of he hesitated and lynley thought for a moment that stewart was going to suggest ludicrously that there was talk of his having some sort of personal interest in barbara havers but then stewart said its the championing of her thats misunderstood by everyone lynley asked or just by you he didnt wait for an answer he knew how deep di stewarts dislike of havers ran he said lightly john im a glutton for punishment ive sinned and barbaras my purgatory if i can mould her into a cop who can work as part of a team im saved stewart smiled in spite of himself it seemed shes clever enough if she werent so bloody maddening ill give you that and god knows shes tenacious theres that lynley said its a case of her good points outweighing her bad hell of a dress sense though stewart pointed out i think she shops at oxfam ive no doubt shed say there are worse places lynley said the phone on his desk rang as he was speaking and he lifted the receiver as stewart stood to go it was he found a case of speak of the devil minshalls van havers said without preamble its a soco wet dream sir lynley nodded at stewart as he left the office he gave his attention to the telephone whatve you got he asked havers treasure theres so much lumber in his van that itll take a month to sort it all out but theres one item in particular thats going to ring your chimes it was under the drivers seat and child porn sir dodgy photo of a naked kid with two blokes taking at one end and giving at the other you fill in the blanks i say we get a warrant to search his place and another to tear his van apart get a soco team over here with finetooth combs where is he now where are you still in camden town take him to the holmes street station then put him in an interview room and get his address ill meet you at his digs the warrants thats not going to be a problem the meeting had gone on far too long and ulrike ellis was feeling the strain every extremity in her body tingled with buzzing little impulses on the nerve endings running up and down her arms and her legs she was trying to stay calm and professionalthe personification of leadership intelligence foresight and wisdom but as the discussion among the board droned on she grew ever more desperate to get out of the room this was the part she hated about her work having to put up with the seven dogooders who constituted the board of trustees and who absolved whatever guilty consciences they had about their obscene wealth by writing out the occasional cheque to the charity of their choicein this case colossusand corralling their equally wellheeled friends to do the same because of this they tended to take their responsibility more seriously than ulrike would have liked so their monthly meetings in the oxo tower dragged on for hours as every penny was accounted for and tedious plans for the future were laid today the gathering was worse than usual they were all teetering on the edge without knowing it while she attempted to hide that fact from them for meeting their longterm goal to raise enough money to open a branch of colossus in north london was going to come to nothing if any scandal became associated with the organisation and the need for colossus was truly desperate across the river kilburn cricklewood shepherds bush kensal rise disenfranchised youth lived lives exposed to drugs shootings muggings and robberies every day over there colossus could offer them an alternative to a lifestyle that doomed them to addictions sexual diseases incarceration or an early death and they deserved the opportunity to experience what colossus had to offer in order for any of this to happen though it was essential that no connection exist between the organisation and a killer and no connection did exist save the coincidence of five troubled boys dying at the same time as they ceased coming to classes and activities near elephant and castle ulrike was convinced of this for there was no other path she could take and continue to live with herself so she put on a show of cooperation during the endless meeting she nodded took notes murmured things like excellent idea and ill get on to that straightaway through this means she eked out yet another successful encounter with the trustees until one of them finally made the blessed motion to adjourn shed ridden her bicycle to the oxo tower so she hurried down to it it wasnt far to elephant and castle but the narrow streets and the growing darkness made the way treacherous by rights she should have missed the news vendors placard altogether as she passed down waterloo road but the phrase sixth murder leapt out at her in front of a tobacconists shop and she ground to a halt and pulled her bike onto the pavement heart seizing up she went inside and snatched up the evening standard she read as she scraped a few coins out of her purse and handed them over at the till my god my god she couldnt believe it another body another boy queens wood north london this time found that morning he hadnt yet been identifiedat least no name had been given out by the policeso there was still the hope that this was a coincidental killing bearing no relationship to the other five murdersexcept that ulrike couldnt quite bring herself to believe that the age was similar the paper used the term young adolescent to refer to the victim and obviously they knew he hadnt died of natural causes or even accidentally since they were calling it a murder but still couldnt it be she needed this killing to be unrelated to colossus she was desperate for that if it was not then she needed to be clearly seen as assisting the police in any way she could there was absolutely no middle ground in this situation she could temporise or outright prevaricate but all that would do was prolong the inevitable if shed accidentally hired a murderer as an employee and then refused to take action to root him out if that was the case she was done for and so probably was colossus back at elephant and castle she went straight to her office she riffled through the contents of the top drawer in her desk for the card that the scotland yard detective had given to her she punched in the numbers but was told that he was in a meeting and could not be interrupted was there a message or could someone else help her yes she told the dc on the line she identified herself she mentioned colossus she wanted the dates when each of the bodies had been found it was a matter of connecting the dead boys with activities at colossus and the individuals who led those activities she wanted to provide superintendent lynley with a fuller report than shed previously given him and those dates were the keys to meeting that selfimposed obligation the dc put her on hold for several minutes no doubt seeking a superior officer to approve this request when he came back it was with the dates she wrote them down doublechecked them against the names of the victims and then rang off then she looked at them thoughtfully and she considered them in the light of someones desire to discredit and ruin colossus if there was a connection between colossus and the dead boys aside from the obvious one she thought it would have to be about reducing the organisation to rubble so perhaps someone inside this place hated these types of kids in their every manifestation or perhaps someone inside had been thwarted in his desire to advance to make a change in the workings of the programme to succeed at a high level with a previously unheard of number of clients toanything or perhaps someone wanted to take her place and this was the route to get there or perhaps someone was mad as a hatter and only posing as a normal human being or perhaps ulrike she looked up from the list of dates shed taken a calendar out of her drawer in order to compare those dates with scheduled activities and the location of those activities neil greenham was standing there his odd round head poked just inside her door looking deferential ulrike said yes neil may i help you he blushed for some reason his pudgy face going an unattractive shade that climbed all the way to his scalp and highlighted the scarcity of his hair what was that all about wanted you to know ill need to leave early tomorrow mums got to see the doctor about her hip and im the only one who can drive her ulrike frowned she cant go by cab neil looked markedly less deferential at this as it happens she cant its too expensive and i wont have her taking the bus ive already told the kids to come two hours earlier and then he added if thats okay with you although he didnt sound like someone who was going to alter his plans if they werent okay with his superior ulrike thought about this neil had been manoeuvring for an administrative position since hed come to work for them he had to prove himself first but he didnt want to his sort never did he needed putting in his place she said its fine neil but in future please check with me before you alter your schedule will you she looked back down at her list dismissing him he didnt get the message or he chose to ignore it he said ulrike she looked up again what else she knew she sounded impatient because she was impatient she tried to temper that with a smile and a gesture to her paperwork he observed this solemnly then raised his gaze to her sorry i thought you might want to know about dennis butcher who dennis butcher he was doing learn to earn when he disneil made an obvious correction in coursewhen he stopped coming jack veness told me the cops called while you were at the board meeting that body found over in quaker street it was dennis ulrike breathed only one word in reply god and now theres another today so i was wondering what what were you wondering if youve considered his significant pauses were maddening what she said what what ive got a load of work to do so if youve something you need to say neil then say it yes of course i was just thinking its time we called in all the kids and warned them isnt it if victims are being chosen from colossus it seems that our only recourse nothing indicates that victims are being chosen from colossus ulrike said despite what she herself had been thinking a moment before neil greenham interrupted her these kids live their lives on the edge they take and sell drugs theyre involved with street muggings burglaries robberies prostitution they meet and mingle with the wrong sort of people every single day so if they end up dead its because of that and not because theyve spent time with us he was looking at her curiously he let a silence hang between them during which ulrike heard griffs voice coming from the shared office of the assessment leaders she wanted to be rid of neil she wanted to look at her lists and make some decisions neil finally said if thats what you think its what i think she lied so if theres nothing else again that silence and that look speculative suggestive wondering how best to use her obduracy to his own advantage well he said i suppose thats all ill be off then still he looked at her she wanted to slap him safe trip to the doctor tomorrow she told him evenly yes he said ill make sure it is wont i that said he left her when he was gone she rested her forehead in her fingers god god dennis butcher she thought five of them now and until kimmo thorne she hadnt even been aware of what was happening under her very nose because the only thing her nose could even begin to smell was the scent of griff strongs aftershave and then he was there too not hesitating at the door as neil had done but barging right in he said ulrike youve heard about dennis butcher ulrike knotted her eyebrows did he actually sound pleased neil told me just now did he griff sat on the only chair in the room besides her own he wore that ivory fishermans sweater that set off his dark hair and the blue jeans that emphasised the michelangelo shape of his thighs how typical im glad you know he added it cant be what we thought then can it we she thought what we thought she said about what what what did we think about what that its to do with me with someone wanting to set me up by killing these boys dennis butcher didnt go through assessment with me ulrike he belonged to one of the other leaders griff offered a smile its a relief with the cops breathing down my neckwell i didnt want that and i cant think you did either why why what the police breathing down someones neck are you suggesting ive been involved in the deaths of these kids or that the police will think ive been involved jesus no i just meantyou and i he made that gesture of his that was meant to seem boyish the hand through the hair it tousled nicely he no doubt had it cut to do so i cant think you want it getting about that you and isome things are best left private so he flashed her that smile again he looked over the top of her desk to the dates and the calendar whatre you up to howd the board meeting go by the way youd better leave she told him he looked confused why because ive work to do your day may have ended but mine has not whats wrong the boyish handtohair again shed once thought it charming shed once seen it as an invitation to touch his hair herself shed reached to do so and shed actually grown wet at the contact her humble fingers his glorious locks prelude to both the kiss and the hungry pressure of his body against hers she said five of our boys are dead griff possibly six because theres another been found this morning thats whats wrong but theres no connection how can you say that five boys dead and what they all have in common besides trouble with the law is enrollment here yes yes he said i know that i meant this dennis butcher thing theres no connection he wasnt one of mine i didnt even know him so you and iwell no ones going to need to know she stared at him she wondered how she had failed to seewhat was it about physical beauty she asked herself did it make the beholder stupid as well as blind and deaf she said yes well and added have a nice evening wont you and picked up her pen and bent her head to her work he said her name once more but she didnt respond and she didnt look up as he left the office but his message remained with her after he was gone these murders had nothing to do with him she thought about this couldnt it also be the case that they had nothing to do with colossus and if that was the case wasnt it true that by attempting to root out a killer from the organisation ulrike was turning a spotlight upon all of them encouraging the police to dig deeper into everyones background and movements and if she did that wasnt she also thereby asking the police to ignore everything that could point to the real killer who would go on killing as the fancy took him the truth was that there had to be yet another connection among the boys and it had to be a connection beyond colossus the police had so far failed to see this but they would they definitely would just so long as she held them off and kept their noses out of elephant and castle not a soul was on the pavement when lynley made the turn into lady margaret road in kentish town he parked in the first available space he came to in front of an rc church on the corner and he walked up the street in search of havers he found her smoking in front of barry minshalls home she said he called for the duty solicitor straightaway once i got him to the station and handed over a photo in a plastic evidence bag lynley looked at it it was much as havers had picturesquely described it on the phone to him sodomy and fellatio the boy appeared to be about ten lynley felt ill the child could be anyone anywhere anytime and the men taking their pleasure from him were completely unidentifiable but that would be the point wouldnt it satisfying the urge was all there was to monsters to them it was merely a case of hunter and prey he gave the picture back to havers and waited for his stomach to settle before he gazed at the house number lady margaret road was a sad affair a brickandmasonry building of three floors and a basement with every inch of its masonry and wood in need of paint it had no formal house number attached to its door or to the squaredoff columns that defined its front porch rather had been scrawled in marking pen on one of these pillars along with the letters a b c and d and the appropriate up and down arrows indicating where those respective flats could be found in the basement or in the house proper one of londons great plane trees stood along the pavement filling the small front garden with a covering of dead and decomposing leaves as thick as a mattress the leaves obscured everything from the sagging low front wall of brick to the narrow path leading up to the steps to the steps themselves five of them which climbed to a blue front door two panels of translucent glass ran vertically up the middle half of this one of them badly cracked and asking to be broken altogether there was no knob only a dead bolt surrounded by wood worn down by thousands of hands having pushed the door inward minshall lived in flat a which was in the basement its means of access was down a flight of steps round the side of the house and along a narrow passage where rainwater pooled and mould grew at the base of the building just outside the door was a cage holding birds doves they cooed softly at the human presence lynley had the warrants havers had the keys she handed them over and let him do the honours they stepped inside into utter darkness finding a light was a matter of stumbling through what seemed to be a sitting room that had been thoroughly turned over by a burglar but when havers said got a light here sir and switched on a dim bulb on a desk lynley saw that the condition of the place was due only to slovenly housekeeping what dyou reckon that smell is havers asked unwashed male dodgy plumbing semen and poor ventilation lynley donned latex gloves she did the same that boy was here he said i can feel it the one in the picture davey benton whats minshall claiming hes plugged it i thought wed get him on the cctv cameras in the market but the cops in holmes street told me theyre just for show no film inside them theres a bloke therehes called john millerwho could probably id a photo of davey though if hell talk at all why wouldnt he i think hes bent himself towards underage boys i got the impression if he fingers minshall minshall fingers him scratch mine scratch yours wonderful lynley murmured grimly he worked his way across the room and found another light by a sagging sofa he switched it on and turned to look at what they had pay dirt in a saucepan havers said he couldnt disagree a computer that doubtless had an internet connection a video player with racks of tapes beneath it magazines with graphic pictures of sex others filled with s m photos unwashed crockery the paraphernalia of magic they picked through this at different parts of the room till havers said sir do you make of these what i make of these they were on the floor beneath the desk she was holding up what appeared to be several tea towels they were stiffened in spots as if theyd been used while sitting at the computer for matters having nothing to do with drying plates and glasses hes a piece of work isnt he lynley moved into what was a sleeping alcove where a bed bore sheets of much the same appearance and condition as the tea towels the place was a treasure trove of dna evidence if minshall had engaged in his frolics with anyone other than his computer and the palm of his hand there was going to be enough indication of that here to send him away for decades if the anyone in question was an underage boy on the floor next to the bed was yet another magazine limp with someones continual inspection of it lynley picked it up and leafed through it quickly raw photos of women nude legs splayed comehither looks wet lips fingers stimulating entering caressing it was sex reduced to base release and nothing else it depressed lynley to his core sir ive got something lynley returned to the sitting room where havers had been going through the desk shed found a stack of polaroid pictures which she handed over they were not pornography instead in each of them a different young boy was kitted out in magicians togs cape top hat black trousers and shirt occasionally a wand under the arm for effect they were all engaged in what seemed to be the same trick something with scarves and a dove there were thirteen of them altogether white boys black boys mixedrace boys davey benton was not among them as for the others the parents and relatives of the dead boys would have to look them over whats he said about that photo in his van lynley asked when he had flipped through the polaroids a second time doesnt know how it got there havers said wasnt him put it there hes completely innocent its some mistake yadda yadda more yadda he could be telling the truth youre joking lynley looked round the flat so far theres no child pornography in here so far havers said she indicated the vcr and its accompanying cassettes you cant tell me those videos are by disney sir ill give you that but tell me why would he have a photo in his van and none where its infinitely safer for him to have it here inside his flat and why would all indication of what hes been up to sexually be referenced to women because he wont take a trip to the nick for that and hes smart enough to know it she replied as for the rest give me ten minutes to find it on that computer if it takes that long lynley told her to have at it he went down a corridor beyond the sitting room and found a grimy bathroom and beyond it a kitchen more of the same in both of the locations a soco team would have to delve into it there were going to be fingerprints galore in addition to trace evidence deposited by anyone whod been inside the place he left havers to the computer and went back outside following the path to the front of the house there he climbed the steps to the porch and rang each of the bells for the flats within only one yielded an answer flat c on the first floor was occupied and the voice of an indian woman told him to come up she would be happy to talk to the police as long as he had identification that he would be willing to slide under her door when he got there this sufficed to gain him entry to a flat with a view of the street a sariclad middleaged woman admitted him handing back his warrant card with a formal little bow one cannot be too careful i find she told him it is the way of the world she introduced herself as mrs singh she was a widow she revealed of no children straitened circumstances and little opportunity to marry again alas my childbearing years are over i would serve only to care for someone elses children now would you have tea with me sir lynley demurred winter was long and she was lonely and he otherwise would have stopped long enough to give her a pleasant half hour or so but the temperature in her flat was tropical and even if that hadnt been the case what he needed from her was a matter of a few minutes conversation and he could afford no more time than that he told her hed come to inquire about the gentleman in the basement flat barry minshall by name did she know him the odd man with the stocking hat oh yes mrs singh replied has he been arrested she asked the question as if the word finally were understood between them why do you ask that lynley said the young boys she said they came and they went from that basement flat day and night i did phone the police three times about it i believe you must investigate this man i told them something clearly is not right but i fear that they saw me as a meddlesome woman getting into business that was not my own lynley showed her the picture of davey benton hed had from the boys father was this boy one of them she studied it she carried it to the window overlooking the street and she gazed from the picture to the ground below as if trying to see davey benton in memory as he might have been entering the front garden and going down the steps to the path to the basement flat she said yes yes i have seen this boy one day that man met him out there on the street i saw this he wore a cap this boy but i saw his face i did youre sure of that oh yes i am certain it is the headphones in this picture you see he had them as well from a player of some kind he was quite small and very pretty just like this boy in the picture did he and minshall go into the basement flat they went down the stairs and round the side of the house she told him she hadnt seen them go into the flat but one could assumeshe had no idea how long they were there she didnt spend all of her time at the window she explained with an apologetic laugh but what shed said was enough and lynley thanked her for it he turned down yet another offer of tea and descended the outer stairs to the basement flat once more havers met him at the door she said got him and led lynley to the computer on the screen was a list of the sites that barry minshall had visited it didnt take a degree in cryptology to read their titles and know what they were all about lets get soco over here lynley said what about minshall let him languish till morning i want him to think about us crawling round his flat uncovering the slime trail of his existence chapter nineteen winston nkata was in no hurry to get to work the next morning he knew he was going to take goodhumoured heat from his colleagues over his appearance on crimewatch and he didnt feel like facing it yet nor did he really have to because crimewatch had actually produced a possible break in the case and he would be tracking that break down before he headed over the river for the day from the sitting room his mothers usual morning farebbc breakfastwas doing its regular bit of recycling the news traffic weather and special reports every thirty minutes on the telly theyd reached the part where they were informing the public of what was on the front page of every national broadsheet and tabloid from this he was able to assess the temperature of the press regarding the serial killings according to bbc breakfast the tabloids were making the most of the queens wood body which at least had driven bram savidge and his accusations of institutional racism off their front pages but savidge still had a spot relegated to him and those reporters not attempting to unearth more data about the body in the woods appeared to be conducting interviews wherever they could find them with people bearing grievances against the police navina cryer shared space with the queens wood body on the front of the mirror telling her tale of being ignored when she reported jared salvatore missing shortly after his disappearance cleopatra lavery had managed to conduct a telephone interview from inside holloway prison with news of the world and she had much to say on the subject of the criminaljustice system and what it had done to her lovely sean savidge and his african wife had been interviewed at home by the daily mail complete with halfpage photos of the wife playing a musical instrument of some sort under the fond eye of her husband and according to what he was able to pick up from the presenters comments on the telly as they nattered on about the other papers nkata could tell that the rest of the press were not going softly on the met in the face of another boys murder one killer and how many cops was the rhetorical question being asked by the news media with lofty irony which was why crimewatch and the manner in which the programme depicted the mets endeavours in the investigation had been so crucial which was also why ac hillier had attempted to usurp the directors job prior to the broadcast on the previous evening he wanted a splitscreen effect hed told the men in the studio ds nkata would be identifying the dead boys by name and by photograph during the course of the programme and having a head shot of nkata speaking on one side of the screen while he identified photos of the victims of the serial killer on the other side of the screen would drive home to the viewersby means of ds nkatas sombre demeanourhow seriously the met was taking the situation and the pursuit of this killer that of course was utter cock what hillier wanted front and centre was what he and the directorate of public affairs had wanted front and centre from the first a black face attached to a rank senior to that of detective constable the assistant commissioner didnt get his way they didnt go for anything fancy on crimewatch hed been told just video footage if it was available efits photographs dramatic reconstructions and interviews with investigators the people in makeup would buff away the shine on the face of anyone in front of the camera and the sound blokes would clip a microphone onto the lapel of a jacket so it looked like something other than an insect about to crawl onto the presenters chin but steven spielberg this group was not this was a lowbudget operation thank you very much so who was going to say what to whom and in what order please hillier wasnt happy but he could do nothing about it he made sure that ds winston nkata was introduced by name however and he made doubly certain he repeated that name during the course of the broadcast other than that he explained the nature of the crimes gave the relevant dates showed the locations where the bodies had been found and sketched out a few details of the ongoing investigation in a manner that suggested he and nkata were working it shoulder to shoulder that plus the efit of the square four gym mystery man the reconstruction of kimmo thornes abduction and nkatas recitation of the names of the dead boys comprised the programmes entirety the endeavour bore fruit this at least made the whole enterprise worthwhile it even made the prospect of having the piss taken out of him by his fellow officers somewhat bearable since nkata intended to enter the incident room with solid information later that morning he finished his breakfast as the bbc was doing yet another traffic roundup he ducked out of the flat to his mums mind how you go jewel and his dads chin nod and soft proud of you son and he made his way along the outdoor corridor and down the stairs as he buttoned his overcoat against the chill across the grounds of loughborough estate he met no one save a mum shepherding three small children in the general direction of the primary school he made it to his car and began to climb inside only to see that the right front tyre had been slashed he sighed it was not just flat of course that could have been ascribed to anything from a slow leak to a nail picked up in a street somewhere and dislodged after the damage was done that sort of disagreeable start to his day would have been an irritant but it wouldnt have had the cachet that a knifing had a knifing suggested that the cars owner ought to watch his back not only right now when he had to break out the jack and the spare but also anytime he was on the estate nkata looked round automatically before he set to changing the tyre naturally there was no one about this damage had been done on the previous night sometime after hed arrived home post crimewatch whoever had done this didnt have the bottle to face him squarely at the end of the day while he was a cop to them and consequently the enemy he was also an alumnus of the brixton warriors among whom hed spilt his own blood and the blood of others fifteen minutes later and he was on his way his route took him past the brixton police station whose interview rooms he knew only too well from his adolescence and he made a right turn into acre lane with little traffic moving in the direction he was traveling this was towards clapham for it was from clapham that the phone call had come at the end of crimewatch the caller was ronald x ritucciits for xavier hed saidand he thought he had some information that might help the police in their investigation of the death of that kid with the bicycle in the gardens he and his wife had been watching the show without thinking how it might relate to them when gailthats the wifepointed out that the night theyd been burgled corresponded to the night of that boys death and heronald xhad had a glimpse of the little thug just before he leapt out of the firstfloor bedroom window of their house hed definitely worn makeup so if the police were interested they were someone would call in the morning that someone was nkata and he found the ritucci home not far to the south of clapham common it was in a street of similar postedwardian houses distinguished from so many of those north of the river by being detached dwellings in a city where land was at a premium when he rang the bell he heard the sound of a child clattering along a corridor to the door the inside bolt was messed about a bit unsuccessfully while a little voice called out mummy the doorbell did you hear in a moment a man said gillian get away from there if ive told you once about answering the door ive told you a thousand he jerked it open a small girl in patentleather tap shoes tights and a ballerinas tutu peered round his leg one arm clinging to his thigh nkata had his identification ready the man didnt look at it saw you on the telly he said im ronald x ritucci come in dyou mind the kitchen gails still feeding the baby au pairs down with flu unfortunately nkata said he didnt mind and he followed ritucci after the man had closed bolted and tested the security of the front door they went to a modernised kitchen at the back of the house where a glassedin nook held a pine table and matching chairs there a harriedlooking woman in a business suit was trying to spoon something into the mouth of a child perhaps one year old this would be gail making a heroic attempt in the absence of her au pair to do the mother thing before she dashed off to work she said like her husband you were on the television the child gillian put in a clear belllike observation hes a black man daddy isnt he ritucci looked mortified as if the identification of nkatas race were akin to mentioning a social disease that polite individuals would know to ignore he said gillian thats quite enough and to nkata tea then i can brew you a cup in a tick no problem nkata told him no thanks hed just had his own breakfast and wanted nothing he nodded towards one of the pine chairs and said cn i of course gail ritucci said gillian said what did you eat then i had boiled egg n soldiers her father said to her gillian what did i just say nkata said to the child eggs but no soldiers my mum thinks im too old for them but i xpect shed make them if i asked nice enough i had sausage s well some mushrooms and tomatoes all that the child asked im a growing boy cn i sit on your lap this was apparently the limit the parents said gillians name in simultaneous horror and the father swept her into his arms and out of the room the mother shoved a spoonful of porridge into the gaping mouth of the toddler and said to nkata shesits not you sergeant were trying to teach her about strangers nkata said mums and dads cant ever be too careful in that department and geared up his pen to take down notes ritucci returned almost immediately having deposited his older child somewhere in the house out of sight like his wife he apologised and nkata found himself wishing there were actually something he could do to make them more comfortable he reminded them that theyd phoned the crimewatch number theyd reported a boy wearing makeup whod burgled them gail ritucci was the one who told the first part of the story handing over the spoon and the porridge to her husband who took up feeding their other child theyd been out for the evening she explained having dinner in fulham with old friends and their children when they got back to clapham they found themselves behind a van in their street it was moving slowly and at first theyd thought it was looking for a space to park but when it passed one space and then another they became uneasy wed got a notice about breakins in the neighbourhood she said and turned to her husband when was that ron he paused in his feeding of the toddler spoon poised in the air early autumn he said i think thats right she went back to nkata so when the van crept along it looked suspicious i took down its number plates well done nkata told her she said then we got home and the alarm was going off ron ran upstairs and saw the boy just as he went out of the window and onto the roof of course we phoned the police at once but he was long gone by the time they got here took them two hours her husband said grimly makes you wonder gail looked apologetic well naturally there must have been other thingsmore importantan accident or serious crimenot that it wasnt serious to us to come home and find someone inside our house but to the police dont make excuses for them her husband told her he set down the porridge bowl and the spoon and used the edge of a tea towel to wipe the residue from his young childs face law enforcements going down the toilet has been for years ron no offence intended he said to nkata its probably not down to you nkata said no offence was taken and he asked them if theyd given the number plates of that van to their local police they had done they said the very night they phoned when the police finally showed up on their doorstepmust have been two am then ritucci saidit was in the person of two female constables they took a report and tried to look sympathetic they said they would be in touch and in the meantime to come down to the station in a few days and pick up their report for insurance purposes that was the end of it gail ritucci told nkata cops didnt do a bloody thing her husband added on her way to meet lynley in upper holloway barbara havers stopped by the groundfloor flat which shed been passing assiduously with her eyes directed forward for ages by this point she carried with her the peace offering shed bought off barry minshalls stall the pencilthroughthefivepoundnote trick meant to amuse and delight ones friends she missed both taymullah azhar and hadiyyah she missed the casual friendship they shared dropping by one anothers digs for a chat whenever the fancy took them they werent family she couldnt even say they were the next best thing to family but they weresomething a piece of familiarity and a comfort she wanted both back and she was willing to eat humble pie if that was what it was going to take to put things right between them she knocked on their door and said azhar its me have you got a few minutes then she stood back a dim light shone through the curtains so she knew they were up and about perhaps shrugging into dressing gowns or something no one answered musics on she told herself a radio alarm that hadnt been shut off after it awoke the sleeper shed been too quiet in her attempt so she knocked again harder this time she listened and tried to decide if what she heard behind the door was the rustle of someone disturbing the curtains to see whod come calling so early in the morning she looked towards the window she studied the panel of material that covered the panes of the french door nothing then she felt embarrassed she stood back another step she said more quietly well all right then and she moved off to her car if that was the way he wanted itif shed hit him so far below the belt with her remark about his wife taking offbut shed said nothing but the truth hadnt she and anyway theyd both played dirty and he hadnt been trotting to the bottom of the garden to apologise to her she forced herself to shrug the matter off and she used even more determination to leave the vicinity without looking back to see if one of them was watching her from a parted curtain she went to where shed left her car all the way over in parkhill road which was the closest space shed been able to find upon her return the previous night from there she drove to upper holloway and found the comprehensive whose address lynley had phoned to her while shed still been in bed trying to make herself rise to the irresistible oldies beat of diana ross and the supremes ordering someone to set me free why doanchew babe on her radio alarm shed reached for the phone attempted to sound chipper and taken down the information on the inside bodiceripping cover of torn by desire which had kept her awake far into the night with the burning question of whether the hero and heroine would give in to their fatal passion for each other that would take some heavy guesswork shed told herself sardonically the comprehensive in question wasnt too far from bovingdon close where davey bentons family lived it looked like a minimumsecurity prison one whose occasional visual relief had been supplied courtesy of a david hockney wannabe despite the distance hed had to travel to get there in comparison with her own lynley was already waiting for her he looked dead grim hed been to call upon the bentons he explained howre they doing as youd expect as anyone would be doing in the same situation lynleys words were terse even more than she would have expected them to be she looked at him curiously and was about to ask him what was up when he nodded at the front of the school ready then he asked her barbara was they were there to talk to one andy crickleworth supposed mate of davey benton lynley had said on the phone that he wanted as much ammunition as possible when they finally spoke to barry minshall in an interview room at the holmes street police station and he had a feeling that andy crickleworth would be the person to supply it hed phoned ahead so the comprehensives administrators would be aware of the police interest in one of their pupils thus it was a matter of a few minutes only before lynley and barbara found themselves in the company of the schools headteacher his secretary and a thirteenyearold boy the secretary looked grey and defeated and the headteacher had the usedup appearance of a man for whom a pension couldnt come too soon for his part the boy had braces on his teeth spots on his face and hair slicked back in the manner of a s gigolo by raising one half of his upper lip as he entered the room he managed to look scornful about the whole matter of meeting the police but the rehearsed snarl couldnt stop the fidgeting of his hands which pressed down into his groin throughout the interview as if they wished to stop him from wetting himself the headteachermr fairbairnmade the introductions they held their meeting in a conference room round an institutional table that was itself surrounded by uncomfortable institutional chairs his secretary sat in a corner taking notes furiously as if theyd need to be compared to barbaras in an eventual lawsuit lynley began by asking andy crickleworth if he knew that davey benton was dead daveys name was due to be released to the press that morning but the grapevine is a powerful plant if the school had been informed of the murder via daveys parents there was a high probability the word was out andy said yeah everyone knows least everyone in year eight knows he didnt sound regretful about the matter he clarified this by saying he got murdered right and the tone of the question suggested being murdered was a higher form of leaving life than falling ill or dying in an accident achieving a coolness unavailable to the others that belief would be typical of almost any thirteenyearold boy barbara thought sudden death was a sevenday wonder to them happening to someone else and never to you she said lightly throttled first discarded second andy to see if that would shake him you know theres a serial killer working round london dont you he got davey if anything andy sounded impressed not chastened you want me to help you catch him or summat mr fairbairn said to the boy youre to answer their questions crickleworth that will be the limit to the matter andy gave him a sod you look lynley said tell us about the stables market andy looked wary wha about it then were told by his parents that davey went there and if he went i expect his whole crew went as well you were part of his crew werent you andy shrugged mightve gone there but it wouldntve been to do nothing wrong daveys dad says he nicked a pair of handcuffs off a magic stall there do you know about that i didnt nick nothing andy said if davey did he did wouldnt surprise me though davey liked nicking things videos from the shop in junction road sweets off the newsagent banana from the market he thought it was cool i told him he was asking to be caught sometime and dragged off to the nick but he wouldnt listen tha was davey all over he liked the lads to think he was hard what about the magic stall barbara put in wha about it then did you go there with davey hey i said i never nicked this isnt about you lynley cut in it isnt about what you did or did not steal and where you might or might not have stolen it are we clear on that we have the word of daveys parents that he visited a magic stall in the stables market but thats all we have aside from your name which they also gave us i dint even know them andy sounded panicked we realise that we also realise that you and davey had some difficulty getting on with each other superintendent mr fairbairn said in a monitory tone as if understanding how easily difficulty getting on could lead them into an accusation he did not intend to allow spoken in his conference room lynley held up his hand stopping him from saying anything further but none of that is important now andy do you understand what is important is what you can tell us about the market the magic stall and anything else that might help us find davey bentons killer is that clear enough for you andy said reluctantly that it was although barbara doubted it he seemed more fixed on the drama of the situation than on the grim reality behind it lynley said did you ever accompany davey to the magic stall in the stables market andy nodded once he said we all went down there wasnt my idea or nothing mind you i cant remember who said lets go but we did and barbara asked and davey tried to pinch some handcuffs off that weird bloke runs the magic stall he got caught and the rest of us scarpered who caught him the bloke the weird one dead weird he is he wants sorting you ask me andy seemed to make a sudden connection between the questions and daveys death he said dyou think that wanker killed our davey did you ever see them together after that day lynley asked davey and the magician andy shook his head i never he frowned and then added after a moment cept they mustve must have what barbara asked mustve seen each other he squirmed in his seat to look at lynley and he told the rest of his tale to him davey he said did some magic tricks at school they were deadstupid tricksprobly anyone couldve done them reallybut daveyd never done any tricks before the day the crew went to that stall in the stables market after though he did a trick with a ball making it disappear although anyone with a brain bigger than a pea couldve seen how he did it and then he did a trick with a rope he cut it in half and then produced it uncut he mightve taught himself off the telly or something or even out of a book but prhaps that wanker magiciand taught him the tricks in which case davey had probly seen him more than once andy sounded proud of this deduction and he looked round as if waiting for someone to shout holmes you amaze me instead lynley said had you ever been to the magic stall before that day andy said no i never never but as he spoke he pressed his hands down into his crotch and held them there and his glance went to barbaras biro lying she thought she wondered why do you like magic yourself then andy s all right but not that baby stuff with balls an ropes i like the sort makes jets disappear or tigers not th other shit crickleworth mr fairbairn said in warning andy shot him a look sorry i dont like the sort davey did thas for little kids innit it dont suit me but it suited davey lynley said davey andy said was a little kid just the sort barbara thought to appeal to a sod like barry minshall there was nothing more that andy could tell them they had what they needed confirmation that minshall and davey benton had had an interaction even if the magician claimed that his prints were on the handcuffs because they had belonged to him although he hadnt seen davey steal them off his stall the police would be able to thwart him there not only had he seen davey attempt to steal the handcuffs but hed also caught the boy in the act as far as barbara could see they had minshall coming and going as she and lynley left the comprehensive she said ladeedahdah superintendent barry minshalls about to become our breakfast if it were only that easy lynleys voice sounded heavy not at all as shed expected it to sound why wouldnt it be barbara asked him weve the kids statement now and you know we can get the rest of daveys crew onboard if we need them weve got the indian woman putting davey at minshalls flat and his prints are going to be all over it so id say things are looking up what would you say she looked at him closely has something else happened sir lynley paused by his car hers was farther along the street he didnt say anything for a moment and she was wondering if he would when he uttered one word sodomised she said what davey benton was sodomised barbara she muttered hell its just like he said who robson told us things would escalate that whatever gave the killer his kicks at first would fail after a while hed need more now we know what it was lynley nodded we do then he roused himself to add i couldnt bring myself to tell the parents about it i went to do sothey have a right to know what happened to their sonbut when it came down to it he glanced away from her across the street to an oldage pensioner who was hobbling along pulling a wheeled grocery trolley behind him it was his fathers worst fear i couldnt realise it for him i didnt have the heart theyre going to have to know eventually if nothing else itll come out during the trial but when i looked at his face he shook his head im losing the will to keep doing this havers barbara found her players and brought the packet out she offered him one and hoped hed hold firm and refuse which he did she lit up herself the smell of burning tobacco was sharp and bitter in the cold winter air it doesnt make you less of a cop she said just because youve become more of a human being its the marriage thing he said to her its the fatherhood business it makes one feel he corrected himself it makes me feel too exposed i see how fleeting life can be it can go in an instant and thiswhat you and i are doingit underscores that andbarbara heres what i never expected to feel what that i cant bear it and that dragging someone by his bollocks to justice isnt going to change that for me any longer she took a deep hit on the fag and held it long it was all a crap shoot she wanted to tell him life had strings but no guarantees but he knew that already every cop knew it just as every cop knew that one didnt safeguard a wife a husband or a family just by working every day on the side of good guys kids still went bad wives committed adultery husbands had heart attacks everything one possessed could easily be wiped out in an instant life was life she said lets just muddle through today thats what i say we cant take care of tomorrow till it gets here barry minshall didnt look as if hed had an easy night of it which was what lynley had had in mind when hed decided to wait until morning to interview the magician he was disheveled and stooped he came into the interview room in the company of the duty solicitorjames barty he said his name was as he led minshall to the table and lowered him into a chairand when the magician sat he squinted in the bright lights and asked if he could have his dark glasses returned to him youll get nothing of use from looking at my eyes if thats what you hope he informed lynley and to make his point he raised his head and gave an illustration of his meaning his eyes were slightly darker than the colour of smoke when dry wood burns and they moved back and forth rapidly and incessantly he took only a moment for this before he lowered his head nystagmus and photophobia he said thats what its called or do i need a note from my doctor to prove it to you lot i need those glasses all right i cant cope with the lights and i cant bloody see without them anyway lynley nodded at havers she left the room to fetch minshalls glasses lynley took the time to make ready the tape recorder and to study their suspect hed not seen albinism in the flesh before it wasnt what in his ignorance hed thought it would be no pink eyes no snowwhite hair rather the greyish eyes and a dense look to the hair as if a buildup of deposits had been laid upon it over time causing it to bear a yellow tint he wore this hair long although it was drawn back from his face and banded at his neck his skin was completely without pigmentation not even a freckle dotted its surface when havers returned with minshalls dark glasses he put them on at once this allowed him to raise his head although he kept it tilted throughout their interview perhaps the better to control the dancing movement of his eyes lynley began with the preliminaries spoken for the sake of the tape recording that was being made he went on to give the formal caution in order to snare minshalls complete attention and in case the magician did not understand the extent of his jeopardy which was unlikely then he said tell us about your relationship with davey benton as next to him havers took out her notebook for good measure considering the present circumstances i dont think ill be telling you anything barry minshalls words were even sounding well rehearsed his solicitor rested back in his chair apparently at ease with that answer he would have had the entire night to advise his client of his rights had minshall asked for them daveys dead mr minshall lynley said as you know id advise you to take a more cooperative approach will you tell us where you were two nights ago there was a marked hesitation as minshall thought about all the ramifications of remaining silent or offering an answer to this question he finally said at what hour superintendent and gestured to his solicitor when barty made a move as if to stop him from speaking at all at all hours lynley told him you cant be more specific than that are you that much in demand in the evenings minshalls lips curved lynley found it was disconcerting to interview someone whose eyes were protected by dark lenses but he schooled himself to look for other signs in the movement of the adams apple the twitch of fingers the alteration in posture i closed my stall at the usual hour of half past five no doubt john millerthe bathsalts vendorwill confirm that as he spends an inordinate amount of time observing the children who dawdle round me i went from there to a café near my home where i regularly eat my dinner its called sofias cupboard although theres no sofia and the coziness implied by cupboard is absent but the price is reasonable and they leave me alone which is how i prefer it i went from there to my home i went out again briefly to buy milk and coffee that was it and while you were home during the evening lynley said what about it what did you do watch your videos surf the internet read a few magazines entertain visitors practise your magic this took him some time to think about he said well as i recall and then spent a long while doing his recalling too long for lynleys liking doubtless what minshall was doing was trying to assess how much the police would be able to confirm depending upon what he claimed to have been doing phone calls there would be records of them mobile phone the same internet use the computer would show it visits to the local pub there would be witnesses considering the state of his digs he could hardly claim to have been cleaning the house so it was down to televisionin which case hed have to name the programmeshis magazines or his videos he finally said i had an early night i had a bath and went straight to bed i dont sleep well and occasionally it catches up with me so i turn in early alone havers asked the question alone minshall said lynley took out the polaroid photos theyd found in his flat he said tell us about these boys mr minshall minshall glanced down after a moment he said those would be the prize winners the prize winners minshall pulled the plastic case of polaroids towards himself birthday parties theyre part of how i make my living along with the stall in the market i tell the hosts to have a game prepared for the children to play and youre looking at the prize which is a magicians costume i have them made in limehouse if youd like the address the names of these boys and why is the winner always a boy are there no girls where you perform one doesnt actually find many girls whore interested in magic it doesnt attract them as it does boys minshall made much of examining the photos again he held them closer to his face than was normal he shook his head and put the pictures down i may have known their names at one time but theyre gone now in some cases i dont think i ever caught names at all i didnt think to i never thought id have to name them to anyone and certainly not to the police why did you photograph them at all to show parents when arranging the next party he said its advertising superintendent nothing more sinister than that smooth lynley thought he had to give minshall credit it was not in vain that the magician had spent his night locked up in the holmes street station but all his smoothness wrote guilt large upon his person the job now was to discover a crack in the confident persona lynley said mr minshall we have davey benton placed at your stall we have him stealing handcuffs from you we have a witness to your catching him in the act so ill ask you again to explain your relationship with the boy catching him in the act of pinching something from the stall doesnt constitute a relationship minshall said children try to pinch things from me all the time sometimes i catch them sometimes i dont in the case of this boythe constable herewith a nod at barbaradid tell me youd come across some handcuffs related to him and they might have come from my stall at some point in time but if they did doesnt that suggest to you that i didnt catch him in the act of pinching them at all because why would i catch him in the act and then let him go off with the handcuffs afterwards you may have had a very good reason for that what would that be lynley was not about to allow the suspect to start asking his own questions at this point or any other point in the interview he knew theyd got all they were going to get from minshall but not all that was available so he said a soco team is taking evidence from your flat as we speak mr minshall and i daresay you and i both know whats going to be found inside that place another officer has your computer in hand and ive little doubt what sort of pretty pictures are going to turn up on it in short order when we begin logging on to the web sites youve visited in the meantime forensic specialists are examining your van your neighbouri expect you know mrs singhpositively identified davey benton as a child who visited you in lady margaret road and when she has a look at photos of some other dead boyswell i expect you can fill the blanks there yourself and this doesnt begin to address the manner in which your fellow vendors in the stables market are going to dig your grave for you when we talk to them about what minshall said although he sounded less full of himself now and he glanced at the solicitor as if for some kind of support about whats about to happen now mr minshall im arresting you on a charge of murder one charge and counting this interview is concluded for the moment lynley leaned forward gave the date and the time and switched off the recorder he handed over his card to james barty and said to the solicitor im available should your client wish to expatiate on any answers mr barty in the meantime weve got work to do im sure the duty sergeant will make mr minshall quite comfortable here before hes moved to a remand centre outside lynley said to havers we need to find the boys in those polaroids if theres a tale to be told about barry minshall one of them is going to tell it we need to compare them to the photos of the dead boys as well she looked back at the station hes dirty sir i can feel it can you hes what robson told us to look for isnt he that air of confidence hes up against it and hes not even worried check into his background go back as far as you can manage if he was warned off biking on the pavement when he was eight years old i want to know about it lynleys mobile rang as he was speaking he waited till havers had her actions jotted down in her notebook before he answered the caller was winston nkata and his voice had the sound of someone who was being careful to control his excitement we got the van guv night of kimmo thornes last breakin a van was cruising down the street too slow like it was doing a recce of the area cavendish road station took the information but nothing came of it couldnt relate it to the breakin they said they said the witness had to be mistaken on the number plates why cause the owner had an alibi confirmed by nuns from that mother teresa group an unimpeachable source id say but listen to this van belongs to a bloke called muwaffaq masoud his phone number matches the numbers we cn see on the video of that van in st georges gardens too where can we find him hayes in middlesex give me the address ill meet you there nkata did so lynley motioned to havers to hand over her notebook and biro and he jotted the address down in it he ended the call from nkata and thought about what this new development implied tentacles he concluded they were reaching out in all directions he said to havers get on to minshall and the rest at the yard are we close to something sometimes i think so he answered honestly and other times i think weve barely begun chapter twenty lynley used the a to make his way out to the address in middlesex that nkata supplied him it wasnt easy to find and the journey there encompassed wrong turns route retracing and the negotiation of a crossing place over the grand union canal ultimately the house in question turned out to be part of a small estate that was tucked within the embrace of two sports grounds two playing fields three lakes and a marina part of greater london it still felt like the country and the distant planes taking off from heathrow couldnt dispel the sensation that somehow one had cleaner air and the possibility of freer and safer movement here muwaffaq masoud lived in telford way a narrow street comprising terrace houses of amber brick he lived at the end of one of the terraces and he was at home to answer the door when lynley and nkata rang the bell he blinked at them from behind heavyframed spectacles a slice of toast in his hand he was not yet dressed for the day and he wore a dressing gown fashioned like the robe boxers might don before their bouts complete with a hood and the sobriquet killer embroidered on the breast and across the back lynley offered his identification mr masoud he said and when the man bobbed his head in nervous affirmation may we have a word please he introduced nkata and said his own name masoud shot a look that went from one of them to the other before he stepped back from the door this gave immediately into a sitting room it was not much larger than a refrigerator box and a wooden staircase dominated its far end closer a woolcovered sofa stood on one side of the room facing a faux fireplace on the other in the corner a metal curio stand held the rooms only decorations perhaps a dozen photographs of what seemed to be a multitude of young adults and their offspring atop the stand an additional picture formed part of a shrine with silk flowers lying neatly at the base of a chromeframed photograph of princess diana lynley looked at the curio stand and then back at muwaffaq masoud he was bearded between fifty and sixty years old the belt of his dressing gown suggested something of a paunch beneath it your children lynley asked nodding at the photos i have five children and eighteen grandchildren the man replied there you see them except for the new baby third child of my eldest daughter i live alone here my wife is dead these four years now how may i be of help to you you were fond of the princess race did not appear to be an issue for her he said politely he looked down at the toast which he was still holding he appeared to have no further appetite for it he excused himself and ducked into a doorway beneath the stairs this led into a kitchen that looked even smaller than the sitting room through a window there bare branches of a tree suggested a garden to the back of the house he returned to them tightening the belt of his boxers robe he said formally and with considerable dignity i hope you have not come about that housebreaking in clapham once again at the time i told the officers everything i knew which was little enough and when i did not hear from them again i assumed the matter was at an end but now i must ask did no one among you phone the good nuns may we sit down mr masoud lynley asked weve a few questions to ask you the man hesitated as if wondering why lynley hadnt answered his question finally he said thoughtfully yes indeed and he gestured to the sofa there was no other seat in the room he fetched a chair from the kitchen for himself and he placed it squarely opposite them he sat his feet flat on the floor they were bare lynley saw one toe was missing its nail masoud said i must tell you i have never broken a law of this country this i told the police when they came to speak with me i do not know clapham nor do i know any neighbourhood south of the river thames even if i did know those things on nights when i do not see my children i go to victoria embankment this is where i was on the night of that breakin in clapham about which the police have questioned me victoria embankment lynley said yes yes near the river i know where it is what do you do there behind the savoy hotel many people sleep rough all seasons of the year i feed them feed them from my kitchen yes i feed them and i am not the only one to do this he added as if feeling the need to counter what he saw as lynleys scepticism the nuns are there and another group which hands out blankets when the police asked me about my van being in clapham on a night when someone was burgled there i explained this to them between half past nine and midnight i am far too busy to concern myself with burgling houses superintendent it was he told them the way of islam and he added as it is meant to be practised with gentle emphasis on the word meant perhaps to differentiate between the old ways and the militant forms of islam sometimes espoused round the globe the prophetblessed be his nameinstructed his followers to care for the poor masoud explained the mobile kitchen was how this one humble servant of allah complied with that instruction he took himself to victoria embankment all the year round although the need for him was greatest in winter when the cold dealt harshly with the homeless nkata was the one to jump on the words mobile kitchen mr masoud you dont use your kitchen here to fix up meals no no how could i keep the food hot for such a journey as it is from telford way to victoria embankment my van is kitted out with what is necessary to prepare the meals within it a cooker a work space a small refrigerator this is all that i need of course i could serve them sandwiches which would not require the effort of cooking but they need hot food those poor souls in the street not cold bread and cheese and i am grateful that i can provide it how long have you operated this mobile kitchen lynley asked the man since i began taking my pension from british telecom that would be nearly nine years now you must ask the nuns they will confirm this lynley believed him not only because the nuns would probably confirm it along with everyone else who saw muwaffaq masoud along the embankment on a regular basis but also because there was an air of honesty about the man that commanded ones trust righteous was the word lynley thought would describe him best nonetheless he said my colleague and i would like to look at your van outside and inside will you approve of that of course if you will wait let me dress and i shall take you to it he quickly mounted the stairs leaving lynley and nkata to glance at each other in silent evaluation of what hed had to say whats your assessment lynley asked telling the truth or a sociopath but look at this guv nkata turned his small leather notebook round on his knee so that it faced lynley and lynley glanced at what hed written waf bile chen while beneath it hed added muwaffaqs mobile kitchen nkata said thats what i cant suss out whatd he do then serve those meals behind the savoy hang about in central london for whatever then cruise over to st georges gardens in the middle of the night afterwards where he gets caught on the video we saw why assignation with who drug dealer that bloke does drugs like i do drugs prostitute then his wifes dead so hes wanting some okay but why would he take a tart to st georges gardens terrorist lynley offered it seemed like a complete nonstarter but he knew that nothing could be discounted gunrunner nkata said bomb maker someone with contraband to hand over not the killer but meeting the killer nkata said handing over something a weapon or taking something from him nkata shook his head handing over something or someone guv handing over the kid kimmo thorne that works nkata glanced at the stairs then back to lynley he goes to the embankment but how farre we talking from leicester square from hungerford footbridge if thats how kimmo and his mate got over the river this bloke could know kimmo from frever past and hes biding his time to decide what to do with him lynley considered this he couldnt conceive of it unless as nkata himself had pointed out the asian man was a sociopath please then follow me masoud said as he descended the stairs hed put on not the traditional shalwar qamis of his countrymen but rather baggy jeans and a flannel shirt over which he was zipping a leather flying jacket he had trainers on his feet he was suddenly much more of their country than of his own the transformation did give one pause to consider him differently lynley realised the van was parked inside one of a string of garages that stood together at the end of telford way there was no way to inspect the vehicle easily without moving it from the structure and masoud did this without being asked he rolled the van back to give nkata and lynley access it was red like the van that had been seen by their witness from her flat above handel street just outside st georges gardens it was also a ford transit masoud turned off the engine and jumped out opening the sliding panel door to show them the inside of the vehicle it was kitted out exactly as hed said a cooker had been fixed along one side there were also cupboards a work surface and a small fridge one could use the vehicle for camping as there was room to sleep in the middle if necessary one could also use it as a mobile murder site there was little doubt of that but it hadnt been used in such a manner lynley knew that much before masoud leapt out and opened the ford for them to look over the van was of recent vintage and on its side muwaffaqs mobile kitchen and the relevant phone number glistened pristinely nkata spoke asking the question as lynley opened his own mouth to do so you had nother van before this one mr masoud masoud nodded oh yes but it was old and it had many times failed to start when i needed to use it what happened to that van lynley asked i sold it with the interior in place youre speaking of the cooker the cupboards the fridge oh yes it was just like this one who bought it then nkatas voice held the sound of hopeagainsthope when masoud thought about both questions this would beseven months ago towards the end of june i believe that was it the gentlemani regret i cannot remember his namehe wanted it for the august bank holiday he told me i assumed he intended to take it on a little journey although he did not say as much how did he pay well of course i was not asking a great deal for the van it was old it was not reliable as ive already said it needed work done upon it and painting as well he wished to give me a personal cheque but as i did not know him i required the payment to be made in cash he departed but returned with the money the very same day we concluded our transaction and that was the end of it masoud put the pieces together himself as he finished his explanation that would be the van you seek of course this gentleman bought it expressly for an illegal purpose so he did not register his name upon it and the purpose washe is the clapham burglar lynley shook his head the burglar was a teenage boy he told masoud the purchaser of the van was probably that boys killer masoud took a stricken step backwards he said my van and could say no more can you describe this bloke nkata asked anything about him that you remember masouds expression looked dazed but he answered slowly and thoughtfully it was so long ago an older gentleman younger than myself perhaps but older than you he was a white man english bald yes yes he was bald because the day was hot and his head perspired and he wiped it with a handkerchief an odd sort of handkerchief as well for a man lace on the edge i remember that because i noticed and he said it had sentimental value his wifes handkerchief she made lace on things tatting nkata murmured and to lynley like that piece got left on kimmo guv he was a widower like myself masoud said that was what he meant by sentimental value and yes i remember this he was not very well we walked from the house to this garage here and that short distance took his breath i did not wish to comment on this but i thought that a man of his age should not be so breathless as he was anything else you cn remember about his looks nkata asked hes bald and what else beard moustache fat thin marks on him anywhere masoud looked at the ground as if hed be able to see a mental picture of the man there he said there was no moustache or beard he meditated on this his forehead wrinkled with the strain of remembering finally he said i cannot say more bald and breathless there was nothing to go on lynley said wed like to arrange an efit of this man well send someone out to work with you to draw his face do you mean masoud said doubtfully i will do what i can but i fear he hesitated as he appeared to look for a polite way to say what he wanted to say so many english look similar to me and he was very english veryordinary which lynley thought most serial killers were it was their special gift they faded into a crowd with no one the wiser about their presence only in fantasy chillers had they been born werewolves masoud returned his van to the garage they waited for him and walked back to his house it was only when they were about to part that lynley realised another question needed to be asked he said how did he get here mr masoud what do you mean if he planned to drive your van home he would have needed transport here in the first place theres no railway station nearby did you see what his method of transport was oh yes that would have been the minicab it remained in the streetparked just outside this house in factduring our transactions did you get a look at the driver of that cab lynley exchanged a glance with nkata im sorry no he merely sat in the car outside my house and waited he certainly did not appear interested in our transaction was he young or old nkata asked younger than any of us i should say fu didnt take the van to leadenhall market it wasnt necessary he didnt like removing it from the carpark during daylight hours and besides he had other means of transport that would seemat least to the casual observermore logical for the area he tried to tell himself that the last days had finally proved to him his power but even as others began to see him as hed long intended himself to be seen it appeared to him that control of the situation was beginning to slip from his grasp this concern bore no sense but still he found himself wanting to shout from a public place i am here the one you seek he knew the ways of the world as the knowledge spread so did the risk he had embraced that possibility from the first he had even sought it what he had not expected was how the need within him would be fueled once hed been finally acknowledged hed begun to feel consumed by it now he entered the old victorian market from leadenhall place where the freakishly modern lloyds of london provided him the cover of the commonplace his presence here would not be remarked upon and if one of the countless cctv cameras along the way caught his image no one would think anything of it in this place at this time of day inside the market and beneath its vaulted ceiling of iron and glass the great dragons loomed over him from every corner long clawed and red tongued with their silver wings unfurled for flight beneath them the old cobbled central street was closed to traffic and the shops that lined it offered their wares to the daytime workers of the city as well as to tourists whoat other more clement times of yearmade this place part of their trips to visit the tower or petticoat lane it was designed for exactly that sort of custom with narrow passageways offering everything from pizza to onehour photo developing cheek by jowl with butchers and fishmongers selling fresh items for that nights dinner in midwinter the site was very nearly perfect for what fu had in mind it was virtually deserted in the daytime aside from during the city workers lunch hours and at late nighttime with the traffic bollards removed from either end of the main route through what few vehicles rolled through it did so intermittently fu strolled through the market towards its main entrance on gracechurch street the shops were open but they were sparsely peopled while the most business being transacted appeared to be happening inside the lamb tavern behind whose translucent windows the shapes of drinkers moved periodically in front of this establishment a shoeshine boy did desultory business buffing the black shoes of a banker type who was reading a broadsheet as his footwear was seen to fu glanced at this newspaper when he passed the man one would expect a type like him to be perusing the financial times but this was the independent instead and it carried on its front page the sort of headline that broadsheets generally reserved for royal superdramas political nightmares and acts of god the words number six comprised it below that a grainy photograph appeared fu felt a different sort of need at the sight of this it was one directed not towards fulfilling his growing desire but one thathad he lacked controlwould have otherwise propelled him towards that banker and that broadsheet like a starving hummingbird to the embrace of a flower to proclaim himself to be understood he diverted his eyes instead it was too early yet he recognised in himself the same sensation hed experienced while watching the television programme about him on the previous night and how odd to name the sensation for what it was because it was not at all what hed expected it to be anger the heat of it searing the muscles of his throat until he would cry out for the one who truly sought him had made no appearance before the television cameras sending minions instead as if fu were a spider easily crushed beneath his heel hed watched and there the maggot had found him slithering up the chair in which he sat crawling in through his nose curling behind his eyes till his vision went blurry and then residing within his skull where he remained there to taunt there to provepathetic pathetic pathetic pathetic stupid little wanker nasty little swine think youre someone think youll ever be someone useless piecedont you ever turn your face from me when im talking to you fu tossed from it turned from it there it stayed you want fire ill show you fire give me your hands i said give me your sodding hands here you like how it feels hed leaned his head against the back of the chair and hed closed his eyes the maggot ate greedily at his brain and he tried not to feel or acknowledge it he tried to remain where he was doing what he alone had been able to do you hear me you know me how many people do you intend to send to the grave before youre satisfied as many as it takes hed thought at last till i am sated hed opened his eyes then to see the sketch on the television screen his face and not his face at all someones memory trying to coax an image out of the ether he evaluated the depiction of him and hed chuckled hed loosed his shirt and exposed himself to the hate that would be directed towards that image from every corner of the country come hed told it eat through my tissue thats what you think theyll do for you shite youre full of it arent you boy i never did see a case like you no one had fu thought no one would again leadenhall market made the promise of that he stood opposite a string of three shops just inside the gracechurch street entrance two butchers shops and a fishmongers all red gold and cream like a dickens christmas above each shop and extending the entire length of it hung three tiers of nineteenthcentury iron rails with myriad hooks reaching out from them it was upon these that game birds had been displayed one hundred years ago turkey upon turkey and pheasant upon pheasant tempting the passerby to make a purchase during the appropriate season now they were only an antique remnant of a time long passed but they were designed to serve him it was here that he would bring them both proof and witness simultaneously it would he decided be a crucifixion of sorts with arms stretched wide along the game rails and the rest of the bodies wedged within the spaces between the rails themselves it would be the most public of his displays it would be the most bold he walked the area as he laid his plans there were four separate ways to come into leadenhall market each of them posing a different kind of challenge but all of them shared one commonality and it was the commonality of virtually every street within the city itself there were cctv cameras everywhere those in leadenhall place guarded lloyds of london in whittingdon avenue they watched over a waterstones and the royal sun alliance across the street in gracechurch street they guarded barclays bank the best possibility was in lime street passage but even here a smaller camera hung above a greengrocers that he would have to pass when making his way into the market itself it was much like choosing the bank of england as the spot where hed make his next deposit but the challenge of it all was half the pleasure the other half came with the commission itself he would use lime street passage he decided its small and insignificant camera would be the easiest to get to and to render useless having made this decision he felt at peace he retraced his steps into the market and then in the direction of leadenhall place and lloyds of london beyond it that was when he heard the call you sir beg pardon sir if youll just hang on he paused he turned he saw a pearshaped man coming towards him official epaulets broadening his shoulders fu allowed his face to fall into the slack expression that seemed to put people at ease in his presence he offered a quizzical smile as well sorry the man said as he joined him he was out of breath which wasnt a surprise he was overweight and his trousers and shirt did not fit him properly he wore the uniform of a security guard and his name badge said he was called b stinger fu wondered how often he was teased about that name or if it was a real name at all its the times b stinger said sorry something going on fu looked round as if for an indication of this is something wrong its just that b stinger gave a rueful grimace well we saw you on the telly screensin security you know you seemed to bei told that lot you were probably looking for a shop but they saidanyway sorry but can i help you find something fu did what seemed natural in response he looked round for cameras for more cameras than hed seen outside the market itself he said what did you see me on cctv terrorists the man said with a shrug ira muslim militants chechens other assorted louts you dont look like one of them but when we see someone hanging about fu widened his eyes an ohwow sort of look he said and you thought that i he smiled sorry i was having a look round i come past here every day and id never actually been inside its fantastic isnt it he pointed to the features he declared especially to his liking the silver dragons the goldlettered signs with their deep maroon backgrounds the decorative plasterwork he felt like a bloody art appreciationist but he babbled enthusiastically at the end he said anyway im glad i didnt bring my camera you lot mightve had me in the nick for that but youre doing your job i know that dyou want my id or something i was just leaving by the way b stinger held up his hands palms outward as if to say enough i just needed to have a word ill tell them youre clear and then he added like a confidential aside paranoid that lot im up and down those stairs at least three times an hour its nothing personal fu spoke affably i didnt think it was b stinger waved him off and fu nodded goodbye he went on his way back to leadenhall place but there he paused he felt the tension riding down his neck and across his shoulders like a substance that was pouring out of his ears this had all been for nothing and a waste of his time when time was crucial nowhe wanted to track down the security guard and take him as a prize no matter how foolhardy such an act would be because now he would have to start again and starting again when his need was this great was a dangerous proposition it put him in the position of being driven to carelessness he couldnt afford that think youre special gobshite think youve got something anyone would want he tightened his jaw he forced himself to look at the cold hard facts this place would not do for his purpose and he was blessed by the appearance of the security guard to demonstrate that fact obviously there were more cameras within the market itself than hed accounted for hidden high in the vaulted ceiling no doubt tucked beneath an outspread dragon wing made to look part of the elaborate plasterwork it made no difference what counted was what he knew and now he could seek another place he thought about the television programme he thought about the newspaper articles he thought about pictures he thought about names he smiled at how simple the answer was he knew the spot he had to seek by the time lynley and nkata returned to new scotland yard barbara havers had done the work on minshalls background she had also viewed the boots tapes to scan the queue behind kimmo thorne and charlie burovaka blinkerto see if any familiar face appeared there and shed additionally done her best with what other customers she could see in the shop from the cctv footage there was no one she reported who bore any resemblance to anyone shed seen at colossus barry minshall was also not among the customers she added as to the efit from square four gym and whether anyone in boots looked like that individual shed been less than enthusiastic about that sketch from the first whole things a nonstarter she said to lynley what about minshalls background hes kept his nose clean up to now shed handed the photos of the boys in magician costumes over to di stewart and hed given them to officers who were in the process of showing them to the dead boys parents for possible identification she said if you ask me i dont think thats going to get us anywhere either sir i compared them to the photos weve already got of the dead boys and no one looks like a match to me she sounded unhappy with this development she definitely fancied minshall for the killer lynley told her to carry on digging in the background of the bathsalts vendor from the stables market the bloke called john miller whod seemed overly interested in the goingson at barry minshalls stall in the meantime john stewart had assigned five constablesthis was all he could spare the di told lynleyto handle the postcrimewatch phone calls about the efit sketch and other information countless viewers apparently knew someone who bore a marked resemblance to the baseballcapped man whod been seen in square four gym the constables had the job of sorting the wheat from the chaff among the callers cranks and crackpots loved the opportunity to make themselves important or to have a bit of revenge on a neighbour they were rowing with what better way than to inform the police that one person or another wants checking out lynley went from the incident room to his office where he found a report from so sitting on his desk he had fished his spectacles from his jacket pocket and started to read it when the phone rang and dorothea harrimans hushed voice told him that ac hillier was heading in his direction hes got someone with him harriman said sotto voce i dont know who it is but he doesnt look like a cop a moment later hillier entered the room he said im told youre holding someone lynley removed his reading glasses he glanced at hilliers companion before he replied a thirtyish man wearing blue jeans cowboy boots and a stetson definitely he thought not a cop he said to the man weve not met hillier said impatiently this is mitchell corsico the source our embedded reporter whats this about a suspect superintendent lynley carefully set the report from so facedown on his desk he said sir if i could have a private word that hillier told him is not going to be necessary corsico said hastily with a glance from one man to the other let me just step outside i said thank you lynley waited till the journalist had gone into the corridor before he went on to hillier you said fortyeight hours before the journalist would come onboard youve not given me that take it above my head superintendent this is not down to me then who the directorate of public affairs made a proposal i happen to think its a good one ive got to protest this is not only irregular its also dangerous hillier didnt look pleased with this remark you listen to me he said the press cant get much hotter this story is dominating every paper and every news outlet on television as well unless we get lucky and some hothead arab group decides to bomb grosvenor square we dont have a prayer of escaping scrutiny mitch is on our side you cant possibly think that lynley countered and you assured me the reporter would come from a broadsheet sir and hiller went on his idea has merit his editor phoned the dpa with it and the dpa gave it the goahead he turned to the door and called out mitch come back in here please which corsico did stetson shoved to the back of his head corsico echoed lynleys sentiments he said superintendent god knows this is irregular but youre not to worry i want to begin with a profile piece to bring the public into the picture about the investigation through the people involved in it i want to start with you who you are and what youre doing here believe me no detail about the investigation proper will be in the story if you dont want it there ive no time to be interviewed by anyone lynley said corsico held up a hand not to worry he said ive considerable information alreadythe assistant commissioner has seen to thatand all i ask of you is your permission to be the fly on your wall i cant give you that i can hillier told him can and do i have confidence in you mitch i know youre aware of how delicate this situation is come along and ill introduce you to the rest of the squad youve not seen an incident room have you i think youll find it interesting with that hillier left with corsico in tow incredulous lynley watched them go hed stood when the assistant commissioner and the journalist had entered the room but now he sat he wondered if everyone in the directorate of public affairs had gone mad who to phone he asked himself how to protest he thought about webberly wondering if the superintendent could intercede from his convalescence he didnt see how hillier was being used by the higherups now and he didnt appear able to question that the only person who might put the brakes on this lunacy was the commissioner himself but what would that gain in the long run save lynley most likely being pulled from the case profiles of the investigators he said to himself in derision god in heaven what would it be next glossy photos in hello or an appearance on some inane chat show he took up the so report knowing only that the squad of investigators would be just about as happy with this development as he was he put on his glasses to see what forensics had for him davey bentons fingernails had yielded skin beneath them product of his desperate fight with his killer the sexual assault had yielded semen there would be dna evidence from both of these results the first dna evidence to be gleaned from any one of the bodies the corpse had also yielded an unusual hairlynleys heart leapt when he read the word unusual and his thoughts went at once to barry minshallsand this was currently undergoing analysis it did not however appear to be a human hair so consideration would have to be given to whether it might have come from the location in which the body had been dumped finally the shoe prints at the site in queens wood had been identified they were from a churchs size nine the style was called shannon lynley read this last bit gloomily that narrowed the point of purchase down to every high street in london he punched in the extension for dorothea harriman would she get a set of this latest so paperwork over to simon st james he asked her ever efficient shed already done so adding that he had a phone call coming in from the holmes street station did he want to take it and by the way was she meant to ignore this mitchell corsico bloke when he asked questions about what it was like to have an aristo for a guv because she confessed when it came to having an aristo for a guv shed been thinking that there was a way to hoist the assistant commissioner uponhis own whatever was how she put it petard lynley said and he saw her point that was the answer and it was simplicity itself requiring no higherup to do anything at all dee youre a genius yes feel free to give him grist by the bushel that should keep him occupied for days on end so ladle it on mention cornwall the family pile a row of servants playing manderley under the direction of a brooding housekeeper phone my mother and ask her to arrange to have my brother look suitably drug addled should corsico appear on her doorstep phone my sister and warn her to bolt her doors lest he show up in yorkshire and want to examine her dirty linen can you think of anything else eton and oxford a rowing blue hmm yes rugby would have been better wouldnt it more laddish but lets stay with the facts the better to keep him occupied and away from the incident room we cant rewrite history no matter how much wed like to shall i call you his lordship the earl what dont go too far or hell see what were doing he doesnt seem stupid right now for holmes street station put them through if you will harriman did so in a moment lynley found himself talking not to one of the officers or specials but rather to barry minshalls solicitor his message was brief and welcome his client james barty said had thought things over he was ready to talk to the detectives chapter twentyone ulrike ellis told herself that there was no reason to feel guilty she was sorry for the death of davey benton as she would have been sorry for the death of any child whose corpse had been found like so much discarded rubbish in the woods but the truth was that davey benton was not a colossus client and she celebrated the lifting of suspicion that had to go along with the revelation that an adult from colossus was not involved in his killing of course the police had not said as much when she phoned this was her own conclusion but the detective inspector to whom shed spoken had said very well madam in a way that suggested he was crossing something important off his list and that could only mean a cloud had been lifted that cloud being the suspicion of an entire murder squad at new scotland yard shed phoned there earlier and requested the name of the boy whose body had been found in queens wood shed phoned once again with the delightedalthough shed tried very hard not to show itinformation that they had no record of a davey benton registered as a client at colossus in between the two calls shed trolled the records shed looked through the hard copies of files and shed scrolled through everything colossus kept stored on its computers shed gone through the index cards they kept filled out by kids expressing an interest in colossus at outreach programmes the organisation had offered throughout london in the last year and shed phoned social services with the boys name to be told they had no record of him and had never recommended him for colossuss intervention at the end of all this she felt relief the horror of the serial killings was not about colossus after all not that shed ever thought for a moment that it actually was a phone call from that unattractive female constable with the broken teeth and bad hair provided a blip on the screen of ulrikes liberation from anxiety however the police were now working on some other connection had colossus ever provided entertainment for clients the detective constable wanted to know for a special occasion perhaps when ulrike asked the womanhavers she was calledwhat sort of entertainment she said like a magic show fr instance you lot ever do something like that ulrike said as helpfully as she could manage that she would have to research this detail for the kids did indeed go on outingsthat was part of the assessment coursealthough the outings were of the physically adventurous kind like boating hiking biking or camping still there was always a chance and ulrike wished to leave no stone of possibility unturned so if she could get back to constable havers she set about finding out another troll through the records was called for she also queried jack veness because if anyone knew what was going on in every nook and cranny at colossus it would be jack whod been there before ulrikes arrival on the scene jack said magic and raised one of his scraggly ginger eyebrows like pulling rabbits out of hats or something whatre the cops on to now he went on to tell her that hed never heard of magic shows being performed at colossus or any of the assessment groups going out to see such a show either he said this lot with a jerk of his head towards the inner reaches of the building where the kids were busy with their assessment courses or other classes theyre not the sort to go for magic in a big way are they ulrike of course they werent and she didnt need telling that by jack veness she also didnt need to see jack smirk either at the thought of their kids sitting in a breathlessly spellbound semicircle to watch a magician perform or at the thought of herulrike ellis the supposed head of the organisationeven considering that their hardcore clients might enjoy such entertainment he needed putting in his place every few days did jack she did the honours she said do you find the search for a killer amusing jack and if you do why might that be that wiped the smirk from his face it was replaced with hostility he said why dont you chill ulrike she said watch yourself and went on her way her way was to dig for further information to offer the cops but when she phoned with the message that no one at colossus had brought in a magician or taken a group to see a magician they seemed unimpressed the constable who took her call merely echoed his miserable colleague like someone reading from a script he said very well madam and told her hed pass the information along she said you do see this has to mean but hed already rung off and she knew what that signified it was going to take even more to get the cops off the metaphorical back of colossus and she was going to have to dig for it she tried to come up with a way to do it that was not so obvious it might garner future employee problems or even a group action against her she knew an effective leader had to be unworried about the opinions of others but that leader also had to be a political animal who knew how to twist an action taken into a reasonable step in the right direction no matter what that action was but she could not come up with a way to make her next move look like anything other than a declaration of her distrust the very effort it took to plan out an approach actually made her teeth start aching till she wondered if shed gone too long without a visit to the dentist she searched in her desk for a packet of paracetamol and she swallowed two with a gulp of cold coffee that had been sitting next to her telephone for god only knew how long then she went in search ofshe decided to call it exoneration not for herself but for the others she told herself that whatever she uncovered she would report back to the cops there was no doubt in her mind that colossus did not harbour a killer but she knew she had to seem reasonable to the cops especially in light of having lied to them earlier about jared salvatores being one of their clients she had to appear cooperative she had to demonstrate change she had to get them away from colossus she sidestepped jack veness for the moment and went in search of griff she saw through the window of the assessment room that he was in session with his new group of kids and the flip chart he was using indicated that they were evaluating their last activity she made a gesture when she caught his eye may i talk to you it said he gave her five fingers and a half smile that communicated his mistaken belief about the topic she wished to pursue no matter she thought let him think she meant to cajole him back to her bed that might make him less wary of talking to her which was all to the good she nodded and went to look for neil greenham she found robbie kilfoyle instead in the practice kitchen setting up for a cookery class he was taking bowls and pans out of the classroom cupboards working off a list provided him by the instructor ulrike decided to start with him what the hell did she really know about robbie anyway aside from the fact that hed been in trouble with the law long ago peeping tom the crb check upon him had revealed shed taken him on anyway as a volunteer god knew they needed him and volunteers had never been leaking out of the woodwork people change shed assured herself at the time but now she looked at him more critically and she realised he had a baseball cap onjust like the efit of the serial killer god god god she thought if she had been the one to bring a killer into their midst but if she knew what the efit of the possible killer looked like because shed seen it in the evening standard and on crimewatch as well didnt it stand to reason that robbie kilfoyle also knew and if he knew and was the killer why in gods name would he show up here wearing that eurodisney hat unless of course he was wearing it because he knew how odd it would appear if he stopped wearing it immediately after crimewatch was broadcast or perhaps he truly was the killer and so cocky about not getting caught that hed decided to be in her face and everyone elses with the eurodisney cap on his head like a red rag waving in front of a bullor even still perhaps he was incredibly stupidor didnt watch television or read the newspapers orgodgod something wrong ulrike his question forced her to bring herself round the ache in her teeth had moved to her chest her heart again she needed a thorough checkup stem to stern or whatever she said sorry was i staring wellyeah he placed mixing bowls on the work top spacing them out to accommodate the kids in the class theyre doing yorkshire pud he told her with a nod to the list hed posted for himself on a corkboard right above the sink my mum used to make it every sunday what about you ulrike took the opening i never had it till we got to england mum didnt make it in south africa i dont know why no roast beef i cant recall actually probably not can i help you there he looked round he seemed wary of her offer she could well understand as shed never made it before shed never even talked to himreally talked to himaside from at the beginning when shed taken him on at colossus she made a mental note to talk to everyone at least once every day henceforth he said theres not much to do but i guess i could cope with some conversation she went to the corkboard and looked at his list eggs and flour oil pans salt yorkshire pudding certainly did not require genius to put together she made a second mental note to talk to the instructor about challenging the kids a bit more she riffled through her mind to think of something she knew about robbie other than the fact he was a former prowler hows the job going she asked him he gave her a sardonic look sandwich deliveries you mean its a living wellwith a smile thenits nearly a living i could do with something a bit better frankly ulrike took this as a hint he was angling for permanent employment at colossus for paid employment she couldnt blame him for that robbie seemed to read her mind he paused in the act of pouring flour from a bag into a large plastic bowl i can be a real team player ulrike he said if youd give me half a chance yes i know thats what you want its under consideration when we open the branch across the river youre tops on the list to do assessment youre not having me on are you why would i he set the bag of flour on the work top look im not stupid i know whats going on round here the cops talked to me they talked to everyone yeah okay but theyve talked to my neighbours as well ive lived there forever so the neighbours told me when the cops came round i expect theyre one step away from surveillance surveillance ulrike tried to make it sound casual on you surely not where do you go that theyd want to watch you exactly nowhere oh theres a hotel nearby and theyve got a bar its where i go when i need a break from my dad youd think it was a crime or something parents she said sometimes you need to get away from them eh he frowned he stopped what he was doing he was silent for a moment before he said get away whats this really about nothing its just that mum and i row so i guess i thoughtwell the samesex thing i suppose two adults of the same sex in the same house you start to get on each others nerves as long as we just watch the telly dad and i are fine he informed her oh lucky you do that a lot watch telly that is yeah the reality shows were hooked on those the other night in fact we which night was this she saw shed asked the question too quickly his face took on a sudden sharpness shed not seen before he fetched eggs from the fridge counting them out carefully as if intent upon displaying his diligence she waited to see if he would answer the night before that boy was found in the woods he finally said he was terribly polite about it we watched the show with the yacht sail away do you know it its on cable we bet each other about who was going to get voted off have you got cable ulrike she had to grudgingly admire the way he had put away affront in order to cooperate she owed him something she said sorry rob he took a moment before he shrugged relenting its all right i guess but i did wonder why you stopped to chat you are on the list for a paying job whatever he said id better finish up here she let him go back to what hed been doing she felt ill at ease but concluded that peoples feelings couldnt be allowed to matter even her own later when things were back to normal shed make more complete amends now there were far more pressing concerns so she decided to abjure the circuitous approach she found neil greenham and went directly for the jugular he was alone in the computer room working on one of the kids web pages typical of the colossus client the page was black and featured gothic graphics she said neil what were you doing on the eighth he made a note on the yellow pad next to the mouse she saw a muscle work in his fleshy jaw he said let me see ulrike you must want to know was i murdering some poor kid in the woods she didnt say anything let him think what he would have you checked with the others he asked her or am i the only favoured one can you just answer the question neil can of course but will is another matter neil this is nothing personal she told him ive already spoken to robbie kilfoyle im intending to speak to jack as well what about griff or doesnt he come onto your radar screen for murder now that youre playing at coppers nark id think youd want to start practising objectivity she felt herself colour humiliation not anger oh shed thought theyd been so circumspect no one can know shed told griff but in the end it hadnt mattered when one allowed the besotted to overcome the cautious a billboard wasnt exactly necessary she said do you plan to answer my question sure he said when im asked by the cops and i expect i will be youll make certain of that wont you this isnt about me she told him it isnt about anyone its about colossus he finished for her right ulrike its always about colossus isnt it now if youll excuse me ive work to do but if you want a shortcut phone my mum shell alibi me f course im her darling blueeyed boy so i may have told her to lie when someone comes snooping round to ask questions but thats the chance youll be taking with all of us anyway have a nice day he went back to the computer his ruddy face was ruddier she could see a pulse pounding in his temple outraged innocence under scrutiny she wondered or something else fine neil have it your way jack veness was easier he said miller and grindstone shit ulrike its where i always am why the hell are you doing this anyway dont we have enough aggro around here they did she was making things worse but that couldnt be helped she had to have something to give to the cops even if it meant checking every alibi herself robbies dad neils mum the publican at the miller and grindstoneshe was willing to do it she was able as well and she wasnt afraid shed do it because there was so much at stake ulrike what happened i thought i said five minutes griff had come out to reception he looked confused as well he might since any other time hed told her when to show up in his orbit shed been there like a dependable satellite i need a word she said have you got the time sure the kidsre editing the trust circle whats going on jack spoke up ulrikes taking up where the cops left off ulrike said thatll do jack and to griff come with me she led the way to her office and shut the door neither the oblique approach nor the direct approach had succeeded without offence being taken so she reckoned it didnt matter which way she went with griff she opened her mouth to speak but he began first he said running a hand back through that hair of his im glad you asked to talk rike ive wanted to talk she said what before she thought it through rike hed murmured that in her ear a groan with orgasm rike rike ive missed you i dont like the way things seem to have ended between us i dont like that things seem to have ended what you said about methat ive been a good fuck that went to the bone i never thought of myself like that with you it wasnt about fucking rike really what was it about then hed been standing by the door she in front of the desk he moved but not to her rather he went to the bookshelves and seemed to peruse them he finally picked up the photo of nelson mandela standing between ulrikemuch younger and so much more innocent of lifeand her dad he said this this kid in the picture and everything she believed back then and still believes now the passion of her the life inside her connecting to both because i want them both myself passion and life thats what it was about he replaced the picture and looked at her its still there in you thats whats so mesmerising was from the beginning still is now he drove his hands into the back pockets of his blue jeans they were tight as always moulding the front of him she could see the mound where his penis lay she averted her eyes things are insane at home he went on i havent been myself and im sorry arabellas hormones up and down the babys colic the silkscreen business isnt doing well just now theres been too much on my mind i started to think of you as one more thing i had to contend with and i didnt treat you well yes thats right but it didnt meani didnt meanthat i didnt want you just then the complication life doesnt have to be complicated she told him youve made it that way rike i cant leave her not yet not with a new baby if i did that i wouldnt be good for you or anyone youve got to see that no one asked you to leave her we were heading for that and you know it she was silent she knew that she needed to get them back on the track of why shed wanted to speak to him in the first place but his dark eyes diverted her and as they did so they also dragged her back into the past the feel of him near her the heat of his body that heady moment when he entered her more than flesh to flesh it was soul to soul she resisted the pull of memory and said yes well maybe we were you know we were you could see what i felt what i feel he approached she could feel the pulse light and rapid in her throat heat built within her and descended to her genitals she felt the maddening moistening in spite of herself she said that was animal stuff only a fool would mistake it for the real thing he was close enough that she caught the scent of him no lotion was this no cologne or aftershaving splash it was just his scent the combination of hair skin and sex he reached out and touched her his fingers on her temple describing a quarter circle to her ear he touched the lobe one finger traced the path of her jaw then he dropped his hand were still okay arent we he said at the heart of it she said griff listen but she could hear the lack of conviction in her tone he would hear it as well he would know what it meant because it did meanoh the closeness of him the scent and the strength holding her down his two hands imprisoning hers on the mattress and his kiss his kiss her hips in the rhythmical rotating dance and then tilting tilting because nothing mattered then or even later but wanting having and satiation she knew that he felt it as well she knew that if she dropped her gazewhich she would not doshe would see the evidence behind the tight denim griff said roughly listen to what rike my heart yours what theyre telling us i want you back its crazy stupid i cant offer you one bloody thing just now except the fact that i want you i dont know what tomorrow might bring we could both be dead i just want you now when he kissed her then she did not move away from his embrace his mouth found hers and then his tongue coaxed her own mouth to open she moved back against the desk and he moved with her so that she felt the hard hot demand of him pressing against her let me back rike he murmured she slipped her arms round his neck and kissed him hungrily there was danger everywhere but she didnt care for beyond the dangerabove it and hindering its ability to harm herthere was this her hands in his hair feeling the rough silk of it between her fingers his mouth on her neck as his hands sought her breasts the pressure of him grinding against her and the desire to have him combining with the absolute indifference to discovery they would be quick she told herself but they could not part until zips knickers and the gasp of pleasure on both their parts as he slid her up on the desk and entered her mouth on his her arms clinging his arms holding her hips in position and the brutal thrust of him that could never be hard or brutal enough and then she felt the blessed contraction and its release and a moment later his own groan of pleasure and they were clasped together as they were meant to be safe and secure in less than sixty seconds they parted slowly she saw he was flushed she knew she was too he was breathing rapidly and he looked stunned i didnt mean that to happen he said i didnt either its what we are together it is i know i cant let it end i tried but it doesnt work because i see you and i know she said i feel it too she pulled her clothes back on she could feel him leaking out of her already and she knew the smell of their sex was all over her she was meant to care about that but she didnt he felt the same he had to because he pulled her back to him and kissed her then im going to find a way she kissed him the rest of colossus didnt exist out there beyond her office door he finally tore his mouth from hers with a laugh he held her to him pressed her head against his shoulder he said youll be there for me wont you youll always be there wont you rike she raised her head she said it seems im not going anywhere im glad were together now always yes he caressed her cheek he returned her head to his shoulder and held her will you say that then hmmm rike will you she raised her head what that were together we want each other we know it isnt right but we cant stop ourselves so when we have the chance nothing else matters the time the day whatever we do what we have to do she saw his earnest eyeshow closely they watched herand she felt a coolness come into the air whatre you talking about griff gave a lovers chuckle tender and indulgent she pulled away he said whats wrong she said where were you tell me where you were me when you know when griffin because thats what thisshe gestured at the two of them the office the interlude theyd just createdis all about you my god its always about you having me so besotted that ill say anything the cops come calling and the last person i want them looking at closely is the man im fucking on the side he produced an expression of incredulity but she was not taken in nor was she moved by the wounded innocence that replaced it wherever hed been on the eighth he needed an alibi for it and hed blithely assumed that she would provide it secure in the knowledge that they were the starcrossed lovers that fateor whatever it washad intended them to be she said you bloody selfcentred bastard rike get out get out of my life he said what are you sacking me she laughed a harsh sound whose humour was directed only at herself and her stupidity it always comes down to that doesnt it down to what down to you no im not sacking you that would be far too easy i want you here right under my thumb i want you jumping when i say frog i intend to keep an eye on you incredibly he still said but will you tell the cops believe me ill tell them whatever they want to know lynley decided he owed it to havers to let her in on the second interview with barry minshall since shed been the one to collar him in the first place so he fetched her from the incident room where she was in the midst of looking into the background of the bathsalts vendor in the stables market he told her only to come with him as they took the stairs down to the underground carpark he put her in the picture hes looking for a deal ill wager she said when he told her that barry minshall was ready to talk that blokes got so much dirty laundry hes going to need a persil factory to clean it all mark my words will you play then sir these are boys havers just out of childhood i wont make their lives less valuable by giving their killer any option but the one that faces him life residence in a very unpleasant environment where child molesters are the least popular of the denizens i can live with that havers told him despite her agreement he found he needed to say more as if he were in debate with her it seemed to him that only by striking hard would anyone ever be able to extirpate the sickness that had begun to plague their society he said somewhere along the line havers weve got to become a country without throwaway children weve got to move beyond being a place where anything goes and nothing matters believe me im happy enough to start by using mr minshall as an object lesson for those who think of twelve and thirteenyearold boys as disposable items akin to takeaway curry cartons he paused on one of the landings then and looked at her preaching he said ruefully sorry no problem youre entitled she lifted her head to indicate the upper floors of victoria block but sir she sounded hesitant which was completely unlike her she barreled forward this corsico bloke hilliers embedded reporter we cant get round it hes not listening to reason any more than hes listened to it all along the blokes staying in bounds she reassured him its not that hes not looking at a thing and the only questions hes asking are about you hillier said hes going to be profiling people but im thinking she looked restless lynley could tell she wanted a cigarette which had long been havers form of dutch courage he finished her thought its not a good idea bringing the investigators into the picture in a public forum its just not on she said i dont want this bloke fingering through my knicker drawer ive told dee harriman to give him enough of an earful about me that hell be kept busy for days tracking down details from my disreputable past which shes been instructed to gild as much as she likes eton oxford howenstow a score of love affairs uppercrust pursuits like yachting pheasant shooting foxhunting bloody hell do you of course not well once when i was ten and i loathed it but dee can talk about that as well as dozens of dancing girls performing at my whimsy if thats what it takes i want this bloke kept out of everyone elses way for a while god willingand if dee does her job and everyone else corsico talks to catches onwell have this case wrapped up before he even gets on to profiling anyone else you cant want your mug on the front page of the source she said as they continued down the stairs the earl whos a cop that sort of rubbish its the last thing i want but if putting my face on the front of the source keeps everything else about this case out of the source im willing to put up with the embarrassment they made their way to their separate vehicles the day growing late and the holmes street station being close enough to havers bungalow to make it logical for her to return home at the end of their conversation with barry minshall she trailed lynley across london in her sputtering mini after a few breathless moments in the carpark wondering if the car would start at all at the holmes street station they were expected james bartythe duty solicitorhad to be fetched which took some twenty minutes while they cooled their heels in an interview room and declined an offer of lateafternoon tea when barty finally showed up with crumbs from a scone studding the corner of his mouth it shortly became evident that he had no idea why his client had decided to talk it certainly wasnt something that the solicitor had urged minshall to do he preferred to wait until he saw what the police had to offer barty informed them there was generally something behind it all when a charge of murder was as swift as this one had been didnt the superintendent agree barry minshalls advent in their midst precluded a reply on lynleys part the magician came in brought from his cell by the duty sergeant he had on his dark glasses he was much the same as hed been on the previous day save for his cheeks and his chin which showed white stubble how dyou like the accommodation havers asked growing on you yet minshall ignored her lynley switched the tape recorder on giving the date the time and the people present he said youve asked to speak to us mr minshall what is it youd like to say im not a murderer minshalls tongue came out and licked his lips a lizard movement of colourless flesh against colourless flesh dyou actually think that van of yours isnt going to give us fingerprints from here to friday havers asked not to mention your flat when was the last time you cleaned that place anyway i reckon its got more evidence inside it than an abattoir im not saying i didnt know davey benton or the others the boys in the pictures i knew them i know them our paths crossed and we becamefriends you can call it or teacher and pupil or mentor andwhatever so i admit to having them over to my flat davey benton and the boys in the pictures but the reason was to teach them magic so that when i was invited to a childrens party there would be no question of he swallowed loudly look people arent trusting and why should they be someone dressed up like father christmas pulls a child on his knee and puts his hand up her knickers a clown goes into the childrens ward at the local hospital and takes a toddler into a linen room its everywhere you look and i need a way to show parents theyve nothing to fear from me a boy assistanthe always puts the parents at ease thats what i was training davey to do to be your assistant havers repeated thats correct lynley leaned forward shaking his head he said im concluding this interview he glanced at his watch and gave the time he switched off the recorder and stood saying havers weve wasted our time ill see you in the morning havers looked surprised but she got up as well she said right then and followed him towards the door minshall said wait i havent lynley swung round you wait mr minshall you listen as well possession and transmission of child pornography child molestation paedophilia murder i didnt im not about to sit here and listen to you claim you were operating a training school for child magicians you were seen with that boy in the market at your home god knows where else because were just beginning traces of him will be everywhere associated with you and traces of you will be all over him youre not going to find we bloody well will and the barrister whos even willing to take your case will have the devil of a time explaining it all away to a jury hungry to send you down for putting your filthy hands on a little boy they werent little minshall stopped himself he fell back in his chair lynley said nothing neither did havers the room was suddenly as silent as a crypt in a country church james barty said would you like a moment barry minshall shook his head lynley and havers remained where they were two more steps and theyd be out of the room the ball was sailing into minshalls court and he was no fool lynley knew he had to see it it meant nothing he said that word werent it isnt the slip you think it is those boys whove diedthe others not daveyyou wont find a thing that connects me to them i swear to god i didnt know them are we talking biblically havers asked minshall threw her a look even from behind his glasses he transmitted the message as if youd understand next to him lynley felt her bristle he touched her arm lightly directing her back to the table he said what have you got to tell us turn on the recorder minshall replied chapter twentytwo it isnt what you think were barry minshalls first words when lynley had the tape recorder going your sort have an idea fixed in the head and then you mould the facts to make sure your idea plays out but how you think it was youre wrong and how davey benton was youre wrong about that as well but ill tell you straightaway you wont be able to face what i have to say because if you do it topples the way youve probably always seen the world i want some water im parched and this will take a while lynley hated to give the man anything but he nodded to havers and she disappeared to fetch minshall his drink she was back in less than a minute with a single plastic cup of water that looked as if shed taken it directly from the ladies toilet which she probably had she placed it in front of minshall and he gazed from her to it as if checking to see if shed spat in it finding it passable he took a sip i can help you he said but i want a deal lynley reached towards the recorder another time preparatory to switching it off and ending the interview once again minshall said i wouldnt do that you need me just as much as i need you i knew davey benton i taught him some elementary magic tricks i dressed him up as my assistant he rode in my van and he visited me in my flat but thats the end of it i never put a hand on him in the way youre thinking no matter what he wanted lynley felt his mouth going dry what the hell are you implying not implying saying telling informing whatever you want to call it it comes out the same that boy was bent at least he thought he was bent and he was looking for proof a first time to show him what it was like male to male you cant intend us to believe i dont care what you believe im telling you the truth i doubt i was the first bloke he tried because he was damned direct in his approach hands on my crotch the instant we were out of public view he saw me as a lonerwhich i am lets face itand to his way of thinking it was safe to try things out with me thats what he wanted to do and i set him straight i do not have underage kids i told him come back on your sixteenth birthday youre a liar barry barbara havers said your computers filled with child pornography you were carrying it in your van for gods sake youre shagging your fist in front of your computer screen every night and you want us to believe davey benton was after you and not the reverse you can think what you want you obviously do why not when im such a flipping freak and thats running through your head as well isnt it he looks like a ghoul so he must be one use that move often havers asked i expect it works wonders out there in the world turn peoples aversion in on themselves that must work specially well on kids youre a sodding genius you are boyo high marks for sorting out a way to play your appearance to your advantage mate lynley said you dont appear to understand your position mr minshall has mr bartywith a nod at the solicitorexplained what happens when youre charged with murder magistrates court remand coming to trial at the old bailey all those lags and screws just waiting to welcome you into wormwood scrubs with open arms havers added they have a special greeting for child molesters did you know that bar it requires you to bend over of course i am not lynley switched off the recorder apparently he said to james barty your client needs more time to think meanwhile the evidence mounts up against you mr minshall and the moment we confirm that you were the last person to see davey benton alive you can feel free to consider your fate well sealed i did not you might try to convince the cps about that we collect the evidence we turn it over to them at that point things are out of our hands i can help you think about helping yourself i can give you information but the only way youre going to get that from me is through a deal because if i give you anything im not going to be a particularly popular man if you dont give us something youre being sent down as davey bentons barbara havers pointed out and thats not going to do much for your popularity barry what i suggest lynley said is that you tell us what you know and pray to god were more interested in that than in anything else but make no mistake about it barry youre facing at least one murder charge currently any other charge you might come to face in the future as a result of what you tell us now about davey benton isnt going to carry the same stretch in prison unless its another count of murder of course i didnt kill anyone minshall said but his voice was altered now and for the first time it seemed to lynley that they might be getting through to the man convince us barbara havers said minshall thought for a moment and finally said turn the recorder on i saw him the night he died where i took him to a he hesitated then went for more water its called the canterbury hotel i had a client there and we went to perform what dyou mean perform havers asked what kind of client in addition to the tape that lynley was making she was taking notes and she looked up from her writing magic we were doing a private show for a single client at the end of it i left davey there with him with whom lynley asked with the client that was the last i saw of him and what was this clients name minshalls shoulders sagged i dont know and as if he expected them to walk out of the interview room he went on hastily i knew him only by numbers twoonesixoh he never told me his name and he didnt know mine he knew me only as snow he gestured at his hair it seemed appropriate how did you meet this individual lynley asked minshall took another sip of water his solicitor asked him if he wanted a conference the magician shook his head through mabil he said mabel who havers asked mabil he corrected its not a person its an organisation an acronym standing for lynley waited for the answer minshall gave it in a tired voice men and boys in love bloody hell havers muttered as she wrote in her notebook she gave the acronym a vicious underscoring that sounded like the scrape of rough sandpaper on wood let us guess what thats all about where does this organisation meet lynley asked in a church basement twice a month its a deconsecrated place called st lucys off the cromwell road down the street from gloucester road station i dont know the exact address but its not hard to find the scent of sulphurs no doubt a big hint when you get in the area havers pointed out lynley shot her a look he felt the same aversion to the man and his story but now that minshall was finally talking he wanted him to continue talking he said tell us about mabil minshall said its a support group it offers a safe haven for he seemed to search for a word that would elucidate the purpose of the organisation at the same time as it depicted its members in a positive light an impossible task lynley thought although he let the man attempt it anyway it offers a place where likeminded individuals can meet talk and learn theyre not alone its for men who believe there is no sin and should be no social condemnation in loving young boys and wanting to introduce them to malemale sexuality in a safe environment in a church havers sounded as if she couldnt restrain herself like some sort of human sacrifice on the altar i expect minshall took off his glasses and shot her a withering look as he polished them on the leg of his trousers he said why dont you put a cork in it constable its people like you who head witchhunts you listen to me you piece of thatll do havers lynley said and to minshall go on the magician gave havers another look then shifted his body as if to dismiss her he said there are no young boys who are members of the association mabil does nothing but provide support for lynley prompted he returned his dark glasses to his nose for men whoreconflicted about their desires those whove already made the leap help along those who want to make it this help is offered in a loving environment with tolerance for all and judgement of none lynley could see havers getting ready to make another remark he cut her off with and twoonesixoh i saw him straightaway the first time he showed up he was new to it all he could barely look anyone in the eye i felt sorry for the bloke and offered to help him its what i do meaning and here minshall stalled he was silent for a moment and then asked for time with his solicitor for his part james barty had been sitting there sucking on his lower teeth so hard that it looked as if hed swallowed his lip he burst out with yes yes yes and lynley switched the recorder off he nodded havers towards the door and they stepped out into the corridor of the holmes street station havers said hes had all bloody night to cook this up sir mabil that and the twoonesixoh rubbish dyou think for a moment theres going to be a mabil at this st lucys when we send vice over there to sit in on their next meeting not bloody likely sir and bar will have the perfect comeback for that wont he let me give it to you in advance mabil has members whore cops you know the mets grapevine mustve put those blokes in the picture and they passed the word along you know how it works telephone telegraph tellacop theyve gone to ground now too bad you cant find them and arrest their arses from here to sunday she added sodding paedophiles lynley observed her righteous indignation personified he felt it as well but he also knew they had to keep the information flowing from the magician the only way to sort out the truth from his lies was through encouraging him to talk for a length of time and listening for the snares he would ultimately set himself which was the fate of all liars he said you know the drill havers we need to give him the rope i know i know she looked towards the door and the man behind it but he makes my skin crawl hes in there with barty coming up with a way to justify the seduction of thirteenyearold boys and you and i know it what are we supposed to do about that sit there and seethe yes lynley said because mr minshalls about to discover he cant have it both ways he cant claim he rejected davey benton as too young to experience the love that dare not et cetera while at the same time he provided the boy to a killer i expect hes sorting out that little difficulty with mr barty as we speak so you believe theres a mabil that minshall himself didnt murder that kid and all the others like havers lynley looked towards the door of the interview room i think its very likely he said and theres part of it all that makes sense barbara which part is that the part that explains why weve now got a dead boy with no connection to colossus she was with him as usual making the leap with because the killer had to find new ground once we showed up in elephant and castle from everything we know hes not stupid lynley said once we got on to colossus he had to find a new source of victims didnt he and mabil exactly fills the bill havers because no one would even suspect him there especially not minshall whos just waiting to take him under his wing eager and ready to hand over the victims apparently believingor at least telling himself that he believesin the sanctity of the whole damned project we need a description of twoonesixoh havers said with a nod at the interview room and more lynley told her as the door opened and james barty bade them enter once again minshall had finished his water and was setting to the destruction of the plastic cup that had held it he said he wanted to clarify things lynley told him that they were ready to listen to whatever the magician wished to tell them and he activated the tape recorder as havers sat and scraped her chair noisily against the lino my first time was at the hands of my paediatrician minshall said quietly his head lowered to direct his gazeostensibly since he was wearing his dark glasseson his hands as they tore apart his plastic cup he called it seeing to my condition i was a kid so what did i know groping round between the legs to make sure my condition didnt cause sexual problems in the future like impotence or premature ejaculation he eventually raped me right there in his surgery but i kept quiet i was that scared minshall looked up i never wanted other boys first time to be like that do you understand i wanted it to come out of a loving and trusting relationship so that when it happened to them theyd be ready for it theyd want it as well theyd understand what was happening and what it meant i wanted it to be a positive experience so i empowered them how lynley kept his voice calm and reasonable although what he wanted to do was howl how they excelled when they had to justify he thought paedophiles lived in a parallel universe to the rest of mankind and one could do virtually nothing to blast them out of it so immovably had they placed themselves there through years of rationalisation through openness barry minshall said through honesty lynley heard havers restrain herself he saw how tight her grip was on her pencil as she took notes i talk to them about their sexual urges i allow them to see what they feel is natural and nothing to be hidden or ashamed of i show them what all children need to be shown that sexuality in all of its manifestations is something god given to be celebrated rather than hidden away there are actual tribes you know where children are initiated into sex as a rite of passage guided there by a trusted adult this is part of their culture and if we ever manage to loose the chains of our victorian past it will be part of ours as well thats what mabil aims at eh havers asked minshall didnt directly answer her when they come to see me in my flat he said i prepare them for magic to assist me this takes some weeks when theyre ready we perform for an audience of one my client from mabil what you need to know is that no boy has ever refused to go with the man to whom he was given at the end of our performance theyve been eager for it in fact theyve been ready theyve been as ive said empowered davey benton havers began and from the heat in her voice lynley knew he had to stop her he said where did these performances occur mr minshall at st lucys minshall shook his head they were private as i said at the canterbury hotel then where you last saw davey where is this place lexham gardens off the cromwell road one of our members runs it not for this not for men and boys together its a legitimate hotel ill bet havers murmured take us through what happened lynley said at this performance it was in a room a regular room the client is always asked to book himself into the canterbury in advance he meets us in the lobby and we go upstairs we do the showthe boy and iand i get paid for supplying the boy minshall wasnt about to admit to pandering he said for the magic show at which the boy assisted then what then i leave the boy the client will take him homeafterwards all those boys whose pictures we found in your flat havers asked the question former assistants minshall said you mean you handed every one of them over to be done by some bloke in a hotel room no boy went unwillingly no boy stayed against his will at the end of the performance no boy later came to me with a complaint about how hed been handled handled havers said handled barry lynley said mr minshall davey benton was murdered by the man you handed him over to you understand that dont you he shook his head i know only that davey was murdered superintendent theres nothing that tells me my client did it until i hear from him otherwise i remain convinced that davey benton went off on his own later that night once he was driven home what dyou mean until you hear otherwise havers asked are you expecting a serial killer to phone you up and say thanks mate lets have a second go of the same so i can kill another youre saying my client killed davey im not and yes im expecting a second request from him minshall said there usually is one and a third and a fourth if the boy and the man havent reached a separate agreement on the side what sort of agreement lynley asked minshall took his time about coming up with an answer he glanced at james barty perhaps trying to recall how much the solicitor had advised him to say he went on carefully mabil he said is about love men and boys in love most children are eager for that for love most people are eager for that in fact this isnt aboutthis has never been aboutmolestation just pandering havers said obviously able to restrain herself no longer no boy minshall plunged doggedly on has ever felt used or abused from an interaction i bring about through mabil we want to love them and we do love them and what do you tell yourself when they turn up dead havers asked that you loved the life right out of them minshall gave his answer to lynley as if believing lynleys silence implied tacit approval of his enterprise you have no proof that my client he decided to make a different point davey benton wasnt meant to die he was ready to have davey benton fought his killer lynley cut in in spite of what you thought about him mr minshall he wasnt bent he wasnt ready he wasnt willing and he wasnt eager so if he went with his killer at the end of your performance i doubt he did it willingly minshall said hollowly he was alive when i left them together i swear it ive never harmed a hair on a single boys head no client of mine has done that either lynley had heard enough of barry minshall his clients mabil and the great project of love in which the magician apparently saw himself involved he said what did this man look like how did you contact each other he isnt mr minshall just now i dont care if he is or isnt a killer i mean to find him and i mean to question him now how did you contact each other he phoned me land line mobile mobile when he was ready he phoned i never had his number how did he know when you had all the arrangements in place then i knew how long it would take i told him when to phone again he kept in touch that way when i had things set up i just waited for him to phone and i told him when and where to meet us he went first paid for the room in cash and we met him there everything else happened as i said we performed and i left davey with him davey didnt question this being left alone in a hotel room with a stranger that didnt sound like the davey benton that his father had described lynley thought there had to be a missing ingredient to the mixture minshall was describing was the boy drugged he asked i have never drugged one of the boys minshall said lynley was used to the mans way of dancing round by this time he said and your clients i do not drug plug it barry barbara cut in you know exactly what the superintendent is asking minshall looked at what hed done to his plastic cup rendered it into shreds and confetti he said were generally offered refreshments in the hotel room the boys are free to take them or not what sort of refreshments spirits not drugs cannabis cocaine ecstasy the like minshall actually reared up in offence at this question saying of course not were not drug addicts superintendent lynley just buggerers of children havers said then she shot sorry sir in a look to lynley he said what did this man look like mr minshall twoonesixoh minshall thought about it ordinary he said he had a moustache and goatee he wore a peaked cap like a countryman spectacles as well and did you never put all this down as a disguise lynley asked the magician the facial hair the glasses the cap at the time i didnt thinklook by the time a mans ready to stop fantasising about it and to make it real hes beyond disguises not if he plans to kill someone havers pointed out how old was this man lynley asked i dont know middleaged he must have been because he wasnt in very good shape he looked like someone who doesnt take exercise like someone who might easily get out of breath possibly but look he didnt have on a disguise all right i admit that some blokes wear them at first when they show up at mabilthe wig the beard the turban whateverbut by the time theyre readyweve built trust between us and no one does this without trust because for all they know i could be a cop undercover i could be anyone and so could they havers said but you never thought about that one did you bar you just handed davey benton to a serial killer waved goodbye and drove off with the money in your pocket she turned to lynley id say we have enough wouldnt you sir lynley couldnt disagree for now they had enough from minshall theyd want a list of the calls hed received on his mobile theyd want to get over to the canterbury hotel and theyd want to arrange for another efit to see if the one from square four gym matched whatever image minshall came up with of his client from his description of twoonesixoh though the points of comparison seemed to be not with the efit they already had from the gym but rather with the description theyd been given earlier by muwaffaq masoud of the man whod come to purchase his van there hadnt been a moustache and a goatee to be sure but the age was right the lack of physical fitness was right and the bald head masoud saw could easily have been hidden by the peaked cap minshall was familiar with for the first time lynley considered an altogether new idea havers he said to the constable when they were out of the interview room again theres another way to go with this its one that weve not looked at yet which is she asked stowing her notebook in her bag two men he said one procures and the other kills one procures to give the other the opportunity to kill the dominant and the submissive partners she thought about this it wouldnt be the first time she said a twist on fred and rosemary on hindley and brady more than that lynley said how it explains why weve got someone buying that van in middlesex while someone else waits for him in a minicab just outside muwaffaq masouds house when lynley arrived home it was quite late hed stopped in victoria street for a word with to about mabil and hed given the childprotectionteam officers what information he had about the organisation he told them about st lucys church near gloucester road underground station and he asked what the possibilities were of closing the group down the news he received in return was grim a meeting of likeminded people to discuss their likemindedness did not constitute a breach of the law was there something else going on besides talk in the basement of st lucys church if not vice had too few officers and too many other ongoing illicit activities with which they had to contend but these are paedophiles lynley countered in frustration upon hearing this assessment from his colleague may be was the reply but the cps arent going to drag anyone into court based on his conversation tommy still to would send someone undercover to a meeting of mabil when their burdens were lighter round the yard barring a complaint or hard evidence of criminal activities that was the best to could do so lynley was feeling gloomy when he drove into eaton terrace he parked in the garage in the mews and trudged down the cobblestone alley and round the corner to his home the day had left him with the distinct sensation of being unclean from his skin right through to his spirit inside the house the ground floor was mostly dark with a dim light shining at the foot of the stairway he climbed up and went to their bedroom to see if his wife had gone to bed but the bed was undisturbed so he went on first to the library and ultimately to the nursery there he found her shed bought a rocking chair for the room he saw and she was sitting in it asleep with an oddly shaped pillow in her lap he recognised it from one of their many trips to mothercare in the past few months it was meant to be used when nursing a baby the infant rested on it beneath the mothers breast helen stirred as he crossed the room to her she said as if theyd only just been speaking moments before so i decided to practise well i suppose its more like seeing what it will feel like not the actual feeding but just having him here its odd when you think about it i mean when you actually stretch the thought out what is the rocking chair was beneath the window and he leaned against the sill he watched her fondly that we have actually created a little human being our own jasper felix happily floating round inside me waiting for his introduction to the world lynley shuddered at the latter part of her thought introducing their son to a world that often seemed filled with violence and was indeed a place of great uncertainty helen must have seen this because she said what is it bad day he told her she extended her hand to him and he took it her skin was cool and he could smell the scent of citrus upon her she said i had a phone call from a man called mitchell corsico tommy he said he was from the source god lynley groaned im sorry he is from the source he explained how he was attempting to thwart hilliers plan by keeping corsico occupied with the minutiae of his own personal life dee should have warned you he might be in touch i didnt think hed be quite that fast she was intent upon giving him an earful to keep him away from the incident room ah helen stretched and yawned well i did assume there was something going on when he called me countess hed spoken to my father as well as things turn out ive no idea how he tracked him down what did he want to know she began to get to her feet lynley helped her rise she set the pillow into the babys cot and put a stuffed elephant on top of it daughter of an earl married to an earl obviously he loathed me i tried to amuse him with my astounding mindlessness and my sad fading itgirl proclivities but he didnt seem as charmed as i would have liked lots of questions about why a blue bloodthis is you darlingwould become a cop i told him i hadnt the slightest idea as id much prefer it if you were available to lunch with me daily in knightsbridge he asked to come and visit me here at home a photographer in tow i drew the line at that i hope that was the right thing to do it was im glad of course it was hard to resist the idea of posing artfully on the drawingroom sofa for the source but i managed it she slipped her arm round his waist and they headed for the door what else she asked him hmmm he kissed the top of her head your bad day god its nothing i want to talk about now have you had dinner no appetite he said all i want is to collapse preferably on something soft and relatively pliant she looked up at him and smiled i know just what you need she took his hand and led him towards the bedroom he said helen i couldnt manage it tonight im done for im afraid im sorry she laughed i never thought id hear that from you but fear not i have something else in mind she told him to sit on the bed and she went to the bathroom he heard the snick of a match he saw its flare a moment later water began to run in the tub and she returned to him do nothing she said avoid thinking if you can just be and she began to undress him there was a ceremonial quality to how she did it in part because she removed his clothes without haste she set his shoes carefully to one side and she folded trousers jacket and shirt when he was nude she led him into the bathroom where the bathtubs water was fragrant and the candles shed lit cast a soothing glow that was doubled by the mirrors and arced against the walls he stepped into the water sank down and stretched out until he was covered to his shoulders she fixed a towelling pillow for his head and she said close your eyes just relax dont do a thing try not to think the scent should help you concentrate on that what is it he asked helens special potion he heard her moving round the bath the door swinging shut the sound of garments dropping to the floor then she was next to the tub and her hand was dipping into the water he opened his eyes shed changed into a soft towelling dressing gown its olive colour warm against her skin she held a natural sponge and she was applying a bathing gel to it she began to wash him he murmured ive not asked about your day shhh she replied no tell me itll give me something to think about thats not hillier or the case all right she said but her voice was low and she ran the sponge the length of his arm with a gentle pressure that made him close his eyes once again i had a day of hope im glad someone did after much research deborah and i have targeted eight shops for the christening clothes weve a date tomorrow devoted entirely to the excursion excellent he said an end to conflict thats what we think may we use the bentley by the way there may be more packages than can fit in my car were talking about a babys clothes helen an infants clothes how much room can they take up yes of course but there may be other things tommy he chuckled she took his other arm you can resist anything but temptation he told her in a good cause what else would it be but he told her to take the bentley and to enjoy the excursion he himself settled in to enjoy her ministration to his body she did his neck and kneaded the muscles of his shoulders she told him to lean forward so that she could see to his back she washed his chest and she used her fingers to press at points on his face in a way that seemed to drain all tension from him then she did the same on his feet till he felt like warm putty she saved his legs for last the sponge glided up them up them up them and then it was not the sponge at all but her hand and she made him groan yes she murmured oh yes yes more harder how just do what youre doing he caught his breath god helen youre a very naughty girl i can stop if you like not on your life he opened his eyes and met hers to see she was smiling gently and watching him take off the robe he said visual stimulation you hardly need it not that sort he replied just take off the robe and when she did so he shifted so that she could join him in the water she put a foot on either side of him and he reached for her hands to help her down tell jasper felix to move over he said i think she replied that hell be happy to chapter twentythree barbara havers turned on the television to accompany her morning ritual of poptarts a fag and coffee it was cold as the dickens in her bungalow and she went to the window to see if snow had fallen during the night it hadnt but a sheen of ice on the concrete path from the front of the house gleamed with black menace in the security light that hung from the roof she returned to her crumpled bed and considered dropping back into it while the electric fire did something to ward off the chill but she knew she couldnt spare the time so she ripped the top blanket off and wrapped it round herself before she shivered her way to the kitchen and put the kettle on behind her the big breakfast was regaling its viewers with the latest celebrity gossip this mostly involved who was currently who elses partneralways a burning question for the british public it seemedand who had thrown over whom for whom else barbara scowled and poured boiling water into the coffee press she bent over the sink and tapped her finger against the fag that dangled from her lips dislodging ash in the vicinity of the drain god they were obsessed she thought partner this partner that did anyone stay alone for five minutesother than she herself of course it seemed that the national pastime was moving from one relationship to the next with as little downtime in between as possible a single woman was an accepted failure as a human being and everywhere you looked the message blasted you between the eyes she carried her poptart to the table and went back for the coffee she directed the remote at the television screen and she punched it off she felt raw far too close to the point of having to think of her partnerless life she could hear the remark azhar had made about whether she would ever find herself in the fortunate position of having children and she did not want to venture within fifty yards of thinking of that so she took a large bite of poptart and went in search of something to distract her from the consideration of her neighbour his comment about her marital and maternal state and the memory of that front door which had not opened when she had last knocked upon it she found this distraction in her man from lubbock she put the cd on and cranked up the volume buddy holly was still raving on at the end of her second poptart and her third cup of coffee indeed he was celebrating his short life with such passionand at such a volumethat as she headed for the bathroom and her morning shower she nearly missed hearing the telephones ring she quieted buddy and answered to find a familiar voice saying her name barbara dear is that you it was mrs floflorence magentry to the general publicat whose greenford home barbaras mother had been living for the past fifteen months with several other elderly ladies in similar need of care me and none other barbara said hi mrs flo youre up and about early everything okay with mum oh it is it is mrs flo said were all dandy out here mums asked for porridge this morning and shes tucked right into it lovely appetite shes got today shes been mentioning you since yesterday lunchtime it was not mrs flos way to induce guilt in the relatives of her ladies but barbara felt it anyway she hadnt been out to see her mum in several weeksshe looked at the calendar and realised it had actually been fiveand it didnt take much to make her feel like a selfish cow whod abandoned her calf so she felt the need to excuse herself to mrs flo and she said ive been working on these murdersthe young boys you might have read about it its been a rough case and times dead crucial has mum barbie dear youre not to go on like that mrs flo said i just wanted you to know mums had a few good days shes been here and she still is so i thought that as shes a bit more in the present and out of the blitz it might be good to take time for an examination of her personals we might be able to do it without sedating her which i always think is preferable dont you bloody hell yes barbara said if youll make the appointment ill take her of course dear theres no guarantee that shell be herself when you have to take her as i said there have been a few good days recently but you know how it is i do barbara said but make the appointment anyway i can cope if we have to sedate her she could steel herself to it she told herself her mum slumped into the passenger seat of the mini slack of jaw and bleary of eye that would be nearly unbearable to behold but it would be infinitely preferable to trying to explain to her disintegrating ability to understand what was about to happen to her when she was asked to put her legs into the ghastly stirrups in the doctors surgery so barbara and mrs flo reached an agreement which consisted of a range of days when barbara could drive out to greenford for the appointment then they rang off and barbara was left with the rueful knowledge that she wasnt as childless as she looked to the outside world for certainly her mother stood in place of progeny not exactly what barbara had in mind for herself but there it was the cosmic forces governing the universe were always willing to give you a variation of what you thought your life was meant to be like she headed for the bathroom again only to have the telephone ring a second time she decided to let her answer machine take the call and she left the room to turn the shower on but from the bathroom the voice she heard was male this time which suggested the night had brought another development in the case so she hurried back out in time to hear taymullah azhar saying the number up here should you need to get in touch with us she snatched up the receiver saying azhar hello are you there and where was there she wondered ah barbara he said i hope i did not awaken you hadiyyah and i have come to lancaster for a conference at the university and i realised that i did not ask anyone to collect our post prior to our leaving could you shouldnt she be at school is she on holiday halfterm yes of course he said that is to say she should be at school but i could not leave her alone in london so weve brought her schoolwork with us she does it here in the hotel room while im at my meetings it is i know not the best arrangement but shes safe and she keeps the door locked while im gone azhar she shouldnt barbara stopped herself that way led to disagreement she said instead you could have left her with me i would have been happy to have her here id always be happy to have her here i knocked you up the other morning no one came to the door ah we would have been here in lancaster he said oh i heard music my meagre attempt to thwart burglars barbara felt unaccountably relieved by this information dyou want me to check the flat then have you left a key because i could collect the post and go in and she realised how bloody happy she was to hear his voice and how much she wanted to accommodate him she didnt like this at all so she stopped herself from going on he was after all still the man who thought her unfortunately unpartnered in life he said you are very kind barbara if you would claim our mail id ask nothing more of you will do then she said cheerfully hows my mate i believe she misses you she is still asleep or i would bring her to the phone barbara was grateful for the information she knew he hadnt needed to give it to her she said azhar about the cd about the rowyou knowwhat i said about yourabout hadiyyahs mum being gone she wasnt sure where to go with this and she didnt want to reiterate her remarks in order to remind him of what she was about to apologise for she said i was out of order with what i said sorry there was a silence she could imagine him in some hotel room in the north frost on the window and hadiyyah a small lump in the bed there would be two beds with a nightstand between them and he would be sitting on the edge of his a lamp would be on but not on the nightstand because he wouldnt want its light to shine on his daughter and awaken her hed be wearingwhat dressing gown pyjamas or was he dressed for the day and were his feet bare or clothed in socks and shoes had he combed his dark hair shaved andand bloody hell dolly get a grip for gods sake he said i was not offering a response to your words as it turns out barbara i was merely reacting to what you said this was wrong of me this reacting and not simply replying i feltno i thought she doesnt understand this woman nor can she possibly understand without the facts she judges and ill set her straight this was wrong of me so i apologise as well understand what barbara heard the water gushing freely in her shower and she knew she ought to turn it off but she didnt want to ask him to hold on while she did that because she feared hed be gone altogether if she did what it was about hadiyyahs behaviour he paused and she thought she could hear the sound of a match being lit he would be smoking putting off his answer in that way theyd been taught by society culture films and the telly he finally said very quietly barbara it beganno angela began with lies where she was going and whom she was seeing she ended with lies as well a trip to ontario relatives there an aunther godmother in factwho was ill and to whom she owed muchand you will have guessedhave you notthat none of that is the case at all that there is someone else as i was someone else for angela once so for hadiyyah to lie to me as she did i understand barbara found that she wanted only to stop the pain that she could hear in his voice she didnt need to know what hadiyyahs mother had done and with whom shed done it you loved angela and she lied to you you dont want hadiyyah to learn to lie as well for the woman you love more than your life he said the woman you have given up everything for who has borne your childthe third of your children with the other two lost to you forever azhar barbara said azhar azhar im sorry i didnt thinkyoure right how could i possibly know what its like damn i wish what she asked herself that he was there she answered there in the room so that she could hold him so that something could be transferred from her to him comfort but more than comfort she thought shed never felt lonelier in her life he said no journey is easy this is what ive learned that doesnt help the pain i expect how true ah hadiyyah is stirring would you like to no just give her my love and azhar next time you have to go to a conference or something think of me all right like i said im happy to look after her while youre away thank you he said i think of you often and he gently rang off at her end barbara held on to the receiver she kept it pressed to her ear as if this would maintain the brief contact shed had with her neighbour finally she said to no one bye then and replaced the phone but she rested her fingers on it and she could feel her pulse beating in the tips of them she felt lighter warmer when she finally made her way to the shower she hummed not raining in my heart but rather everyday which seemed more appropriate to her altered mood afterwards the drive to new scotland yard didnt bother her she passed the journey pleasantly without a single cigarette to buoy her but all this good cheer faded once she arrived in the incident room the place was abuzz small knots of people gathered round three different desks and all of them were focussed on a tabloid opened upon each barbara approached a group that winston nkata was part of standing to the rear with his arms crossed on his chest as was his fashion but none the less riveted she said to him whats up nkata inclined his head towards the desk papers done their piece on the guv already she asked holy hell that was fast she looked round she noted the grim expressions she said he wanted to keep that bloke corsico occupied didnt that work or something he was occupied all right nkata said tracked down his house and ran a picture of it he doesnt say what street but he says belgravia barbaras eyes widened the sod thats bad she worked her way forward as other of her colleagues moved off having had their look at the paper she flipped it to the front page to see the headline his lordship the cop and an accompanying photo of lynley and helen arms round each others waists and champagne glasses in their hands havers recognised the picture it had been taken at an anniversary party the previous november webberly and his wife celebrating their twentyfifth just days before a killer had attempted to make him another of his victims she skimmed the accompanying article as nkata joined her she saw that dorothea harriman had done her part as lynley had described it to her encouraging corsico to pursue information left right and centre but what they had all failed to anticipate was the speed with which the reporter would be able to put together his facts mould them into the usual breathless prose of the typical tabloid story and combine them with information that was more than the public had a right to know like the approximate location of the lynleys house barbara thought there was going to be hell to pay for that she found the photograph of the eaton terrace house when she made the jump to page four for the continuation of the story she found there in addition to that picture another photo of the lynley family pile in cornwall along with one of the superintendent as an adolescent in his eton togs as well as one with him posing with his fellow oarsmen at oxford flipping flaming hell she muttered how in gods name did he get this stuff nkatas response was makes you wonder what hes going to unearth when he gets to the rest of us she looked up at him if he could have looked green he would have looked green winston nkata would not want his background offered up for public consumption she said the guv will keep him away from you winnie not the guv im worried about barb hillier that would be winnies concern because if lynley made excellent fodder for the papers what would the tabloids do when they got their teeth into the former gang member makes good variety of tale what nkatas life was worth in brixton was a moot issue at the best of times what it would be worth should the story of his redemption hit the papers was a frightening one a sudden silence hit the room and barbara looked up to see that lynley had joined them he looked grim and she wondered if he was castigating himself for having made himself the sacrificial lamb that the source had offered on the altar of its circulation figures what he said was at least they havent got on to yorkshire yet and a nervous murmur greeted this remark it was the single but indelible blight on his career and his reputation his brotherinlaws murder and the part hed played in the ensuing inquiry they will tommy john stewart said not if we give them a bigger story lynley went to the china board he looked at the photographs assembled on it and the list of activities assigned to the team members he said as he usually did what do we have the first report came from the officers who had been gathering information from the commuters who parked on wood lane and then walked the path down the hill through queens wood and up to the highgate underground station on archway road none of these people on their way to work had seen anything unusual on the morning of the day that davey bentons body had been found several of them mentioned a man a woman and two men togetherall of them walking dogs in the woodsbut that was the extent of what they had to offer and it did not include any descriptions of either man or beast from the houses along wood lane leading up to the park similarly nothing had been gleaned it was a quiet area in the dead of night and nothing had apparently altered that silence on the night of daveys murder this information was disheartening to everyone on the team but better news came from the officer whod taken the assignment to interview everyone in walden lodge the small block of flats on the edge of queens wood it was nothing to celebrate the officer told everyone but a bloke called berkeley pearstheres a name for you one of the other constables mutteredhad a jack russell terrier that had started barking at three fortyfive in the morning this was inside his flat not outside the constable added pears thought someone might be on the balcony so he took up a carving knife and went to see hes sure he saw a flash of light down the hillside on and off and on again but shielded like he thought it was taggers or someone making their way to or from archway road he got the dog quiet and that was the end of it three fortyfive explains why none of the commuters saw anything john stewart said to lynley yes well weve known from the first that he operates in the small hours lynley said anything else from walden lodge kevin a woman called janet castle says she thinks she heard a cry or a shriek round midnight operative word thinks she watches a lot of telly crime dramas and the like i think shes a frustrated dci tennison without the sex appeal just one cry thats what she said man woman child she couldnt tell the two men in the woodsthose who were walking the dog in the morningtheyre a possibility lynley said he didnt elucidate but rather told the reporting constable to go back for further information from the commuter whod sighted them what else he asked the others that old bloke the tagger saw in the allotments came the reply from another of the queens wood constables turned out to be seventytwo years old and no way the killer he can barely walk talks though i couldnt shut him up what did he see anything the tagger thats all he wanted to talk about as well seems hes phoned the cops over and over again about the little bugger but according to him they never do a damn thing because they have better things to occupy their time than catching vandals who happen to be defacing public property thats enjoyed by all lynley turned to the walden lodge constable curiously anyone inside talk about that tagger kevin kevin shook his head he glanced at his notes however and said i only talked to residents of eight of the flats though as to the other two one is newly empty and for sale and the other belongs to a lady taking her annual holiday in spain lynley considered this and saw the possibility get on to the estate agents in the area see whos been shown that empty flat he shared with the team a further report from so that had been waiting for him on his desk when hed arrived that morning the hair on davey bentons body belonged to a cat he told them additionally there was no match between the tyres of barry minshalls van and the tracks left in st georges gardens but there was a van out there that they were still seeking and it looked as if it may have been purchased precisely for the use to which it was being put a mobile killing site at the time of kimmo thornes death it appears that the van was still registered to the previous owner muwaffaq masoud someone out there has possession of that vehicle and weve got to find it you want the details released now tommy it was john stewart who asked the question if we put that van in the public eye he made a gesture that said you can figure out the rest lynley thought it over the reality was that van was going to contain a treasure trove of evidence find it and they had their killer but the trouble was that the situation remained unchanged publicising the vans exact description its number plates and the writing on its side also allowed the killer to see their hand he would either hide the vehicle in any one of the thousands of lockups round the city or he would clean and abandon it they had to pursue the middle course in this matter he said get the details out to every station in town he made additional assignments then and barbara received hers with as much good grace as she could muster considering that the first half of the assignment required her to compile her report on john miller the bathsalts vendor at the stables market the second half got her out in the street where she preferred to be however canterbury hotel in lexham gardens find the night clerk and talk to him about who paid for a room for a single night on the evening that davey benton died lynley was going on to the other assignmentseverything from obtaining minshalls mobile phone records to tracing the attendees at the last meeting of mabil in st lucys church by fingerprints if necessarywhen dorothea harriman ushered mitchell corsico into the incident room she looked apologetic about it her expression clearly said orders from above lynley said ah mr corsico come with me please and he left the squad to get back to work barbara heard the steel in his voice she knew that corsico was about to get an earful lynley had a copy of the source it had been supplied him by the guard in the kiosk when hed arrived a short while earlier hed looked it over and had seen the error of his ways how much hubris had he actually demonstrated he wondered in assuming he could outsmart a tabloid the tabloids bread and butter was produced through the means of digging up useless information so hed expected the lordship business the cornwall business and the oxford and eton business as well but he hadnt expected to see a photograph of his london home gracing the paper and he was determined that the reporter would put no other officers in jeopardy by giving them the same treatment ground rules he said to corsico when he and the reporter were alone you didnt like the profile the young man asked hitching up his jeans there wasnt even the ghost of a suggestion about the incident room or what youve got on the killer or havent got he added with a sympathetic smile that lynley wanted to smear across his face these people have wives husbands and families lynley said back off from them not to worry corsico said helpfully youre by far the most interesting of the lot how many cops can boast an address a stones throw from eaton square i had a phone call this am from a ds up in yorkshire by the way cant give you his name but he said he had some information we might want to print as a followup to todays piece care to comment that would be ds nies lynley thought of the richmond police he would no doubt have loved to bend the reporters ear about time spent rubbing elbows with the earl of asherton in the nick and the rest of lynleys squalid past would come oozing out of the woodwork as well drink driving a car wreck a crippled friend all of it he said listen to me mr corsico and the phone rang on his desk at that moment he snatched it up said lynley what he heard in reply i dont look at all like that sketch you know it was a mans voice perfectly friendly some sort of teadancing music played in the background the one on telly and what is it that you prefer to be called superintendent or mlord lynley hesitated a deadly calm come over him he was all too aware of mitchell corsicos presence in the room he said to his caller would you wait a moment please and was about to tell corsico to give him a few minutes privacy when the voice continued ill ring off if you try that superintendent lynley there i suppose ive made my decision about what to call you havent i try what lynley asked he looked towards his office door and the corridor fixed upon flagging someone down failing that he reached for a yellow pad on his desk to write the necessary note please im not a fool you wont be able to trace this call because i wont be on long enough for you to do it just listen lynley waved corsico over to his desk corsico feigned misunderstanding pointing at his own chest and frowning lynley wanted to strangle the man he waved him over again fetch dc havers on the paper he finally shoved at him now he said covering the mouthpiece of the phone youll get the computer records of this call anyway wont you the voice asked him pleasantly thats how you work but by the time you do it i will have already impressed you once again indeed ill have absolutely dazzled you youve a beautiful wife incidentally although corsico had already gone for havers lynley said to his caller ive a reporter in my office id like to usher him out will you hang on while i do that come now superintendent lynley you cant expect me to fall for that shall i put him on the line to convince you hes called mitchell corsico and and unfortunately i cant get a glimpse of his identification although im sure youd like to arrange that no theres no need i intend to be brief first ive signed a letter to you the mark of fu the reason for this doesnt matter but does the information itself suffice to convince you who i am or shall i add a reference to navels as well lynley said im convinced those details were among the few which the papers had no knowledge of they identified the caller as the real thing or as someone close to the investigation in which case lynley knew the voice would have been familiar to him which it was not he had to get a trace on this call but a single wrong move on his part and he knew that the killer would break the connection before havers got to the room good then hear me superintendent lynley out i went looking for a spot to thrill you another time it was difficult to find but i wanted you to know i have it now sheer inspiration a bit risky but itll make a real splash im planning an event you wont soon forget what are you ive already made my selection too i thought youd like to know that fair being completely fair may we talk about this oh i dont think so then why have you few words much action superintendent trust me its better this way he rang off just as havers came into the room with corsico half a step behind her lynley said to corsico get out hang on ive done what you what follows is none of your business get out the assistant commissioner will survive the news that ive escorted you from my office for the moment lynley took the reporter by the arm i suggest you follow up on the information from yorkshire believe me it will make good reading for your next edition he thrust him into the corridor and shut the door he said to havers hes phoned she knew when just now is that why she jerked her head towards the door get on to the records we need to find out where he phoned from hes got another victim in his possession sir those recordsits going to take music lynley said i could hear dance music in the background but that was it teadancing music thats what it reminded me of teanot at this hour of the day are you thinking period music thirties or forties havers what does that suggest to you that he could have phoned from inside a lift with muzak playing above his head and that could be bloody anywhere in town sir he knew about fu he said it as well christ if that reporter hadnt been in the roomthis has to be kept away from the press he wants it corsico and the killer as well they both want it front and centre page one with the accompanying headline and hes got the victim havers picked out already with him or whatever and the place as well christ we cant be sitting ducks for this sir sir lynley brought himself round he could see the anxiety on havers pale face she said something more right theres something more what is it tell me please lynley didnt want to give it words because then he knew he would have to face them and face his responsibility as well he mentioned helen he finally said barbara he mentioned helen chapter twentyfour as barbara havers came back to the incident room nkata clocked the expression on her face he saw her go to di stewart and have a few words after which the di left the room in a tearing hurry this in conjunction with corsicos having come from lynleys office to fetch havers told nkata something was up he didnt approach havers to be brought into the picture just yet instead he watched her go to the computer on which shed been digging round for information on the bathsalts bloke from the stables market she did a credible job of setting herself back to the task at hand but from across the room nkata could see that more than bath salts was on her mind she stared at the computer screen for at least two minutes before she roused herself and picked up a pencil then she stared at the screen for two minutes more before she gave up the effort and got to her feet she headed out of the incident room and nkata saw shed dug her fags from her bag sneaking off for a smoke in the stairwell he thought this would be a good time for a chat but instead of heading for the stairs to light up she went for coffee plugging coins into the machine and dismally watching the brew dribble into a plastic cup she fished a fag out of her packet of players as well but she didnt light it he said company and felt round in his pocket for change for the coffee machine she turned and said tiredly winnie come up with anything he shook his head you she did likewise the bathsalts blokejohn millerturns out to be squeaky clean pays his council tax on time has a credit card he pays off once a month has his telly licence squared away has a house and a mortgage and a cat and a dog a wife and three grandkids drives a tenyearold saab and has bad feet ask me anything ive become his boswell nkata smiled he plugged his own coins into the coffee machine and punched white with sugar he said with a nod back in the direction of the incident room corsico coming for you like that earlier i reckoned he picked you for the next profile in the paper but its something else int it he came to get you from the supers office barb didnt even try to misdirect him another reason nkata liked her she said he phoned guv had him on the line when i got there nkata knew whom she meant at once he said thas what stewart got on to she nodded hell get the records she took a sip of her coffee and didnt grimace at the flavour of the brew for what good itll do this blokes not stupid hes not going to phone from a mobile and hes not going to ring us up from his bedroom land line is he hes in a call box somewhere and hes damn sure not going to make it in front of his home his work or anywhere else were likely to connect him to has to be done though right she examined the cigarette shed been intending to light up she made up her mind and shoved it into her pocket it broke in half part fell to the floor she looked at it then gave it a kick under the coffee machine what else nkata asked her this bloke mentioned helen supers cut up and who can blame him thas from the paper hes trying to unnerve us right well hes managed that barbara downed her coffee and crumpled the cup with a crunch she said where is he anyway corsico nkata shrugged digging through someones personnel file i expect typing everyones name online and seeing what he can come up with next for a good story barb this blokered vanwhatd he say bout her about helen i dont know the details but the whole idea of anything being printed in the paper about anyonethis isnt good not for us and not for the investigation howre you with hillier by the way avoiding him not a bad idea mitchell corsico appeared from out of nowhere then his face brightening when he saw them by the coffee machine the reporter said ds nkata ive been looking for you barb said under her breath to nkata rather you than me winnie sorry and started back for the incident room she and corsico passed each other without a glance a moment later nkata found himself alone with the reporter could i have a word corsico purchased a tea for himself from the machine milk and extra sugar he slurped when he drank it alice nkata would have disapproved work to do nkata said and made a move to go its about harold actually corsicos voice remained as friendly as ever i wonder if youd just like to make a comment about him the contrast between two brothersitll be a brilliant lead for the story youre next as youve probably gathered you on the one hand and lynley on the other its sort of an alpha and omega situation thatll make good reading at the mention of his brothers name nkata had felt his whole body stiffen he would not talk about stoney and a comment about him like what anything he saideven if he said he had no comment at allwould come back to haunt him defend stoney nkata and it would go down to blinkers and blacks supporting blacks no matter what make no comment and it would go down to a cop disowning his past not to mention his family nkata said haroldand how odd his brothers christian name sounded when hed never called him that in his lifehes my brother thas right and would you like to i just did nkata said just confirmed it for you if youll scuse me then ive got work to do corsico followed him down the corridor and into the incident room he pulled up a chair next to nkatas and took out his notebook referring to the page on which hed taken down information in what looked like oldfashioned shorthand he said i began that all wrong let me try it again your dads called benjamin he drives a bus right how long has he worked for london transport which route would he be on ds nkata nkata tightened his jaw and began to sort through the papers on which hed been recording information earlier corsico said yes well its loughborough estate south london isnt it have you lived there long all my life still nkata did not look at the reporter his every movement he designed to say im busy man corsico wasnt buying he said with a glance at his notes and your mother alice what does she do nkata swung round in his chair he kept his voice polite he said supers wife ended up in the paper thas not happening to my famly no way corsico apparently took this as a welcome into nkatas psyche which seemed to be of more interest to him anyway he said tough being a cop with your background sergeant is that how it is nkata said i dont want a story bout me in the paper i cant make it any more clear n that mr corsico mitch corsico said and youre looking at me as an adversary arent you thats not how it should be between us im here to do the met a service did you read the piece about superintendent lynley not a bit of negativity to it he was depicted in the most positive light i could manage well yes all right theres something more to be said about himthe affair in yorkshire and his brotherinlaws deathbut we dont need to get into that anytime soon so long as the rest of the officers cooperate when i want to feature them hang on man nkata said you threatening me with what youll do to the super f i dont play your game corsico smiled casually he waved the questions off no no but information comes to me via the newsroom at the source sergeant that means someone else likely gets the information before i do and that means my editors twigged that theres more to a story than ive printed so far and he wants to know why not to mention when im going to do a followup like this yorkshire information why arent you going with the murder of edward davenport mitch hes going to ask i tell him that ive got a better story in hand a sort of ragstoriches or rather brixtonwarriorstothemet story believe me i tell him when you see this youll understand why i moved on from lynley howd you get that scar on your face sergeant nkata is it from a flick knife nkata said nothing not about windmill allotments and the street fight that had ended up with his disfigurement and certainly nothing about the brixton warriors who were as active as ever south of the river besides corsico said you know this comes from higher up than me dont you stephenson deaconnot to mention ac hillierdrives a hard bargain with the press i expect theyll drive a harder bargain with you if you dont jump onboard and help out with the profiles at this nkata made himself nod in a friendly fashion as he pushed back from his desk he picked up his notebook and said with as much dignity as he could manage mitch i got to talk to the super right now hes waiting for thiswith a gesture towards his notesso well have to dowhatever we have to do later on he left the incident room lynley didnt need the information he hadit was useless anywaybut there was no way in hell he was going to sit there and listen to the journalists polite implied threats if hillier blew a fuse as a result of nkatas lack of cooperation so be it he decided lynleys office door was open and the superintendent was on the phone when nkata entered lynley acknowledged him with a nod indicating the chair in front of his desk he was listening and writing on a yellow pad when he was finished with his call lynley said to him presciently corsico he started off with stoney straightaway man i do not want this bloke digging into my famly mums got enough on her shoulders without stoney ending up in the papers again he surprised himself with his own passion he hadnt thought he still felt the betrayal the outrage thethe whatever it really was because he could not name it at the moment and he knew he couldnt afford to try lynley took off his spectacles and put his fingers to his forehead pressing hard he said winston how do i apologise for all this nkata said you cn take out hillier i guess thatd do for a start wouldnt it just lynley agreed so you refused corsico more or less that was the right decision hillier wont like it god knows hell hear about it and have a seizure but that wont happen at once and when it does ill do my best to keep him away from you i wish i could do more nkata was grateful for that much considering the fact that the super had already been profiled by the journalist he said barb says red van rang you flexing his muscles lynley said hes trying to unnerve us whatve you got sod all from the credit card purchases thats a real nonstarter only connection between crystal moon and anyone were looking at is robbie kilfoyle the sandwich delivery bloke can we get surveillance on him based on crystal moon were stretched too thin hillier wont authorise more officers on this and those we have are already working fourteen and eighteenhour days lynley indicated his yellow pad sos done the comparison of everything inside minshalls van to the rubber residue found on kimmo thornes bike no match minshall put in old carpet and not rubber lining but davey bentons prints are all over that van so are a score of other prints as well the other dead boys were doing the comparisons you dont think theyre there do you the other boys inside minshalls van lynley put his reading glasses back on and looked at his notes before replying no i dont he finally said i think minshalls telling the truth much as i hate to believe it considering his perversions which means the killer moved on from colossus to mabil once we showed up in elephant and castle asking questions and now that minshalls in custody hes going to have to move on to yet another source of victims weve got to get to him before he gets to them because god only knows where hes going to find them and we cant protect every boy in london we need the meeting times of this mabil then we got to alibi everyone for them back to squareif not square one then square five or six lynley agreed youre right winston it has to be done ulrike had no choice but to take public transport the bike ride from elephant and castle to brick lane was a long one and she couldnt afford the time it would take to pedal over there and back it was suspicious enough that she was leaving colossus without having a scheduled meeting both in her diary and on the calendar jack veness kept in reception so she invented a phone call that had come in on her mobilepatrick bensley president of the board of trustees wanted her to meet him and a potential big money benefactor she saidso she would be out jack would be able to find her on her mobile shed keep it on as always jack veness had observed her a half smile splitting his scraggly beard he nodded knowingly she didnt give him the chance to make a remark he needed sorting once again but she didnt have time to talk to him now about his attitude and the improvements in it that would be necessary should he ever want to advance in the organisation instead she grabbed her coat her scarf and her hat and she departed the cold outdoors was a shock that she felt against her eyeballs first and then in her bones it was a quintessential london cold so filled with damp that drawing air into her lungs was an effort it prompted her to rush for the insufferable warmth of the underground she crammed herself into a carriage heading for the embankment and tried to keep away from a woman who was coughing wetly into the stale air at the embankment ulrike disembarked and weaved through the other commuters they were different here their ethnicity changing from mostly black to largely white and far better dressed as she switched to the district line which itself passed through some of the bastions of londons establishment employment scene on her way she dropped a pound coin into the open guitar case of a busker he was crooning from a man needs a maid sounding less like neil young and more like cliff richard with an adenoid problem but at least he was doing something to support himself at aldgate east she purchased a copy of the big issue her third in two days she added an extra fifty pence to the price the bloke selling it looked as if he needed it she found hopetown street a short distance along brick lane and there she turned she made her way to griffins house it wasnt far into the estate just across from a little green and some thirty yards from the community centre in which a group of children were singing as someone accompanied them on a badly tuned piano ulrike paused just inside the gate that fenced off the tiny front garden it was compulsively neat as shed thought it might be griff never spoke much about arabella but what ulrike knew of her made the trimmed pot plants and the spotlessly swept stones on the ground exactly what shed expected to find arabella herself however was not she came out of the house just as ulrike started towards the door she was guiding a pushchair over the threshold its tiny occupant so heavily bundled against the cold that only a nose was showing ulrike had expected someone utterly gone to seed but arabella had the look of someone quite trendy in her black beret and her boots she wore a grey turtlenecked sweater and a black leather jacket she was far too big in the thighs but was obviously working on it shed be back to form in no time good skin ulrike thought as arabella looked up all her life in england exposed to the moisture in the air you didnt find skin like that in cape town arabella was a regular english rose griffs wife said well this is a first griffs not here if youve come looking for him ulrike and if hes not gone to work he might be at the silkscreening business although i rather doubt it things being what theyve been lately and squinting like a woman making sure of the identity of her listener she added in a sardonic tone it is ulrike isnt it ulrike didnt ask how she knew she said i havent come to see griff ive come to talk to you thats another first arabella eased the pushchair off the single step that played the part of front porch she turned and locked the door behind her she made an adjustment to the babys pile of quilts and then said i cant see what we have to talk about surely griff hasnt made you promises so if you think that you and i are going to have a reasonable discussion about divorce swapping places or whatever i have to tell you youre wasting your time and not only with me but with him ulrike could feel her face getting hot it was childish but she wanted to lay out a few facts in front of arabella strong beginning with wasting my time he fucked me in my office only yesterday darling but she restrained herself saying only thats not why ive come oh its not arabella said no ive recently booted his pretty little arse out of my life hes all yours at last ulrike replied thats just as well then you wouldnt have been happy had he chosen you permanently hes not the easiest man to live with hishis outside interests grow tiresome fast one has to learn to cope with them arabella came across the front garden to the gate ulrike stepped aside but didnt open it for her instead she let arabella do it herself and afterwards she followed griffs wife into the street closer to her ulrike got a better sense of who she was the sort of woman who lived to be taken care of who left school at sixteen and then acquired one of those waittillahusbandcomesalong kind of jobs that are utterly inadequate for selfsupport should the marriage break down and the wife need to make her own way in the world arabella turned to her and said im going up to beigel bake near the top of brick lane you can come along if you like im happy enough for the company a friendly chat with another woman is always nice and anyway ive something you might want to see she started off heedless of whether ulrike was following ulrike caught her up determined not to look as if she were tagging along like an undesirable appendage she said how did you know who i was arabella glanced her way strength of character she said the way you dress and the expression on your face the way you walk i saw you come up to the gate griff always likes his women strong at least initially seducing a strong woman allows him to feel strong himself which he isnt well of course you know that he never has been strong he hasnt had to be of course he thinks he is just as he thinks hes keeping secrets from me with all thesethese serial trysts of his but hes weak the way every handsome man is weak the world bows to his looks and he feels he must prove something to the world beyond his looks which he utterly fails to do because he ends up using his looks to do it poor darling she added there are times i feel quite sorry for him but we muddle along in spite of his foibles they turned into brick lane heading north a lorry driver was making a delivery of bolts of bright silk to a sari shop that stood on the corner still decorated with christmas lights as it was perhaps all year arabella said i expect thats why you hired him isnt it because of his looks i expect you interviewed him found yourself a bit dazzled to be on the end of that soulful expression of his and didnt follow up a single reference hed have been depending upon that arabella gave her a look that seemed well practised as if shed spent days and months awaiting the opportunity to have her say in front of one of her husbands lovers ulrike gave her that much she deserved it after all guilty as charged she said he gives good interview i dont know how hell cope when his looks fade arabella said but i suppose its different with men longer shelf life ulrike agreed far more distant sellby date they found themselves having a quiet chuckle and then looked away from each other in embarrassment theyd strolled some distance up brick lane across from a buttonandthread shop that looked as if it had done business on the spot since the time of dickens arabella stopped she said there thats what i wanted you to see ulrike she nodded across the street but not at ablecourt and son ltd rather she indicated the bengal garden a restaurant that stood next to the button shop its windows and frontdoor grilles closed and locked until nightfall what about it ulrike asked thats where she works shes called emma but i dont expect thats her real name probably something unpronounceable beginning with an m so they added uh to anglicise it or at least she did emuh emma her parents probably call her by her given name still but shes trying very hard to be english griff intends to help her along in that shes the hostess shes a real departure for griffhe doesnt generally go in for ethnic typesbut i think the fact that shes trying to be english in the face of parental objection arabella glanced ulrikes way hed interpret that as strength or hed tell himself so how do you know about her i always know about them a wife does ulrike there are signs in this case he took me to the restaurant for dinner recently her expression when we walked in hed obviously been there before and laid the groundwork i was phase two the wife on his arm so emma can see the situation her darling must contend with what groundwork he has a particular pullover he wears initially when he wants to attract a woman a fishermans sweater its colour does something special to his eyes did he wear it round you for a meeting you may have had just the two of you ah yes i see that he did hes a creature of habit but what works works so one can hardly blame him for not branching out arabella walked on ulrike followed casting one last glance at the bengal garden she said why do you stay with him tatiana she said is going to have a father what about you my eyes are open griffin is who griffin is they crossed a street and continued north past the old brewery and into the region of leather shops and bargain prices ulrike asked the question shed come to ask although at this point she knew how unreliable arabellas answer was probably going to be the night of the eighth arabella repeated thoughtfully offering ulrike the possibility that she was actually going to hear the truth why he was home with me ulrike and then she added deliberately or he was with emma or he was with you or he was at the silkscreening business till dawn or later ill swear to any of them whatever griff prefers he you and everyone else can absolutely depend upon that she paused at the doorway to a largewindowed shop inside customers lined up at a glassfronted counter behind which an enormous blackboard listed the variety of bagels and the toppings on offer she said ive no idea actually but thats something ill never tell the police and that you can be sure of she looked away from ulrike to the interior of the shop wearing the expression of a woman who suddenly sees where she is for the very first time ah she said heres the beigel bake would you like a bagel ulrike it will be my treat he found a place to park that had logic written all over it beneath marks spencer there was an undergound carpark and while it had a cctv camerawhat else could one expect in this part of townshould he ever be witnessed on film from this place his presence possessed a rational explanation marks sparks had toilets marks sparks had a grocery either of those would serve as excuse to make sure he went above to the store and put in an appearance in both facilities he bought a chocolate bar in the grocery and stood wide legged at a urinal in the gents that he thought should satisfy he washed his hands thoroughlyat this time of year one couldnt be too careful with all the head colds going roundand he ducked out of the store afterwards and headed in the direction of the square it formed the intersection of half a dozen streets the one whose pavement he walked along being the busiest of them coursing upward in a glut of taxis and private vehicles all struggling southwest to northeast when he got to the square itself he crossed over with the traffic lights breathing the fumes of a number bus after leadenhall market hed been cheesed off but now he was in a different frame of mind inspiration had struck him and hed snatched it up making a switch in his plans without anyones intercession as a result there was no chant of ridicule from maggots there was just the instant when hed suddenly realised a new way was open to him broadcasting itself from every newsstand on every street corner that he passed in the square he went to the fountain it wasnt in the centre as design would dictate but rather towards the southern corner it was what he came to first in fact and he stood looking at the woman the urn and the trickle of water she was pouring into the pristine pool beneath her although trees lined the square at no great distance from the fountain he saw that no remainder of their dead leaves decomposed in the water someone had long ago fished them out so the trickle from the urn fell sonorously without the splat that otherwise would suggest decay in this part of town that would be an unthinkable idea death decay and decomposition that was what made his choice so perfect he stood back from the fountain and observed the rest of the square it was going to present an enormous challenge beyond the row of trees that lined a broad central path to a war memorial at the far end a rank of taxis waited for fares and an underground station disgorged passengers onto the pavement they made for banks for shops for a pub they sat at window tables of a brasserie nearby or joined a line of ticket buyers at the box office of a theatre this was no leadenhall market busy in the morning at noon and at the end of a workday but otherwise not busy at all in the dead of winter this was a place alive with people probably well into the early hours of the morning but nothing was insurmountable the pub would close the tube station would be locked and barred eventually the taxi drivers would go home for the night and the buses would run far less frequently by threethirty the square would be his all he had to do really was wait and anyway what he had in mind for this location would not take long he was regretful about the game rails in leadenhall market which he now could not use to make the statement he wished to make but this was far better for benches lined the path from the fountain to the war memorialwrought iron and wood gleaming in the milky sunlightand he was actually able to picture how it was going to be he could see their bodies in this place one of them redeemed and released and the other not one of them the observer and the other the observed so consequently one of them laid out and the other positioned in an air of watchfulsolicitude but both of them deliciously delightfully dead the plans were in motion inside his head and he felt filled as he always did he felt free there was no room for the maggot at a time like this the wormlike thing shrank back as if trying to escape the sun which was represented to the hateful creature by his presence and his plan see see he wanted to demand but that could not come now and it would have no reason to come till he had the two of themobserver and observedwithin the circle that was his power all that remained was the waiting now following and finding the moment to strike lynley examined the efit product of muwaffaq masouds memory of the man whod bought his van in the summer hed been looking at it for a good few minutes trying to find points of comparison with the sketch they already had of the man whod visited square four gym in the days before sean lavery was murdered he finally looked updecision madepicked up the phone and asked for an alteration in each drawing on a copy of each add a peaked cap spectacles and a goatee he said he wanted to see both individuals thus altered he knew it was a stab in the dark but there were times when a stab found flesh when that was in hand lynley finally had a moment to phone helen hed thought much about his conversation with the serial killer and hed considered whether the best course of action was to send helen home from her wanderings round london with constables posted at front and back doors but he knew how unlikely his wife was to embrace this move and he also knew that overreacting to this could be playing into the killers hands at the moment their man had no idea where the lynley home actually was far better to put eaton terrace itself under surveillancefrom rooftops from the antelope puband cast out a net into which the killer might well wander that would take several hours to set up all he had to do was make sure that helen took care in the meantime while she was out in the streets he reached her in a babble of noise crockery cutlery and womens chatting where are you he asked peter jones she said weve paused for sustenance id no idea that hunting for christening garments would be so grueling youve not made much progress if youve only got as far as peter jones darling thats completely untrue and then obviously to deborah its tommy wondering how far weve managed toyes ill tell him to lynley deborah says you might demonstrate a bit more faith in us weve already made three stops and weve plans to go on to knightsbridge mayfair marylebone and a dear little shop deborahs managed to unearth in south kensington designer wear for infants if we cant find something there well not find it anywhere youve a full day planned at the end of it all we intend to have tea at claridges the better to look decorative among all that art deco that was deborahs idea by the way she seems to think im not getting out enough and darling weve found one christening outfit already did i say have you its terribly sweet althoughwell your aunt augusta might have a seizure watching her greatgrandnephewis that what jasper felix will bebeing ushered into christianity in a miniature dinner jacket but the nappies are so precious tommy how could anyone complain it would be unthinkable lynley agreed but you know augusta oh pooh well search on i do want you to see the dinner jacket though were buying every outfit we think suitable so you can help decide fine darling let me talk to deborah now tommy you arent going to tell her to restrain me are you wouldnt think of it put her on were behaving ourselvesmore or less was what deborah said to him when helen handed over her mobile im depending on that lynley gave a moments thought to how he wanted to phrase things deborah he knew was incapable of dissembling one word from him alluding to the killer and it would be written all over her face in plain sight for helen to see and to worry about he sought a different tack dont let anyone approach you while youre out today he said people in the streetdont let yourselves become engaged with anyone will you do that for me of course whats going on nothing really im being a mother hen flu going round colds god only knows what else just keep an eye out and take care she said nothing on the other end he could hear helen chatting to someone keep an adequate distance from people lynley said i dont want her falling ill when shes finally got beyond morning sickness of course deborah said ill fend everyone off with my umbrella promise he asked her tommy is there something no no youre certain yes have a good day he rang off then depending upon deborahs discretion even if she told helen exactly what hed said he knew it would seem to his wife that he was merely being overprotective about her health sir he looked towards the door havers was standing there her spiral notebook in hand whatve you got sod all in a bun she said millers clean she went on to report what shed managed to unearth on the bathsalts vendor which was as shed said nothing at all she finished with so heres what ive been thinking prhaps we should consider him more carefully as someone likely to drop barry minshall in it if he knows what weve got on barryi mean exactlyhe might be willing to help if nothing else he could maybe identify some of the boys in the polaroids we found in barrys digs we find those boys and weve got a way to break up mabil but not necessarily a way to get the killer lynley pointed out no turn the mabil information over to to havers give them millers name and his details as well theyll give it all to the relevant child protection team but if we barbara he said stopping her before she could get into it thats the best we can do dorothea harriman came into the office as havers groused about letting even part of the investigation go the departmental secretary had several pieces of paper in her hand which she turned over to lynley she departed in a breeze of perfume saying new efits acting superintendent straightaway i was told he said to let you know hes done several since you couldnt tell him what the glasses were like or how thick the goatee was the peaked cap he said is the same on them all lynley thanked her as havers approached his desk for a look the two sketches were now altered both of the suspects wore hats spectacles and had facial hair it was little enough to go on but it was something he got to his feet come with me he told havers its time to go to the canterbury hotel chapter twentyfive like i said from the first to you lot jack veness declared i was at the miller and grindstone i dont know till what time because sometimes im there till last orders and sometimes im not and i dont keep a fucking diary of it okay but i was there and afterwards my mate and i went for a takeaway no matter how many times you ask me im going to give you the same flipping answer so whats the point of asking point winston nkata replied is that more ineresting events keep piling up jack more we learn about whos doing what to who in this case more we have to check out who mightve done something else and when it always comes down to when man it always comes down to cops trying to pin something on someone and not caring much who the someone is you lot got a nerve you know that people locked up for twenty years turns out they been framed and you never change your approach do you fraid thats whats going to happen nkata asked him why would that be he and the colossus receptionist were facing off right inside the entrance where nkata had followed him from the carpark there jackd been cadging cigarettes from two twelveyearolds hed lit one put another in his pocket and tucked a third behind his ear at first nkata had thought he was one of the organisations clients it was only when veness had stopped him with an oy you whatre you about as he went for the door that nkata realised the scruffy young man was a colossus employee hed asked veness if he could have a word and hed offered his identification he had a list of dates when mabil had methelpfully provided by barry minshall upon the advice of his solicitorand he was comparing it to alibis trouble was jack venesss alibi was unchanging as hed taken pains to point out now jack stalked into the reception area as if satisfied that hed been cooperative nkata followed him there a boy was lounging on one of the mangylooking sofas he was smoking and trying unsuccessfully to blow rings in the direction of the ceiling mark connor veness barked at him whatre you about besides getting ready for a boot in your bum no smoking anywhere inside colossus and you know that whatre you thinking no ones here mark sounded bored nless you plan on grassing me to someone no one knows im here got it jack snapped in reply get the fuck out or put out the fag mark muttered shit and swung his legs over the side of the sofa he got to his feet and shuffled out of the room the crotch of his trousers hanging nearly to his knees in gangsta fashion jack went to the reception desk and punched a few keys at his computer he said to nkata what else okay if you want to talk to the rest of this lot theyre out one and all griffin strong you have trouble hearing nkata didnt answer this he locked eyes with veness and waited the receptionist relented but made it clear by his tone that he wasnt happy hasnt been in all day he said probably having his eyebrows plucked somewhere greenham who knows his idea of lunch is two hours and counting so he cn take mummy to the doctor he says kilfoyle he never shows up till hes made his deliveries which i hope happens soon since hes got my salami andsalad baguette on him and id like to eat it what else man he grabbed up a pencil and tapped it meaningfully against a telephone message pad as if on cue the phone rang and he answered no he said she wasnt in could he take a message he added pointedly truth to tell i thought she was meeting with you mr bensley thats what she said when she left and he sounded satisfied as if a theory of his had just been proved right he jotted down a note and told the caller hed pass the information along he rang off and then looked up at nkata what else he said ive got things to do nkata had jack venesss background inscribed on his brain along with the background of everyone else at colossus who had piqued the interest of the police he knew the young man had reason to be uneasy old lags were always the first to come under suspicion when a crime went down and veness knew it hed done time beforeno matter it was arsonand he wouldnt be anxious to do time elsewhere and he was right about the cops tendency to set their sights on a culprit early on based on his past and their past interactions with him all over england there were redfaced chief constables sweeping up the debris of dirty investigations into everything from bombings to murder jack veness was no fool to expect the worst but on the other hand positioning himself thus was a clever move you got a lot of responsibility here nkata said with everyone gone jack didnt reply at once this change in gears obviously was cause for suspicion he finally made a reply of i cn handle it anyone notice what you handling it or are they too busy this direction appeared doable jack went for it saying no one notices much of anything im low man on the totem pole not counting rob he leaves im done for doormat time kilfoyle you mean jack eyed him and nkata knew hed sounded too interested im not going there with you mate robs a good lad hes been in trouble but i expect you know that like you know ive been in trouble as well that doesnt make either one of us a killer you hang about with him much miller and grindstone fr instance that how you got to know him he the mate you been talking about look im giving you sod all on rob do your own dirty work all goes back to this miller and grindstone situation we got nkata pointed out i dont see it that way but shit shit jack grabbed a paper and scrawled a name and a phone number which he then handed over there thats my mate ring him and hell tell you the same were at the pub then were off for a curry ask him ask at the pub ask at the takeaway cross from bermondsey square it is theyll tell you the same nkata folded the paper neatly and slid it into his notebook saying problem jack what what one night tends to fade into nother when you always go to the same place see a few daysor weeksafter the fact hows someone sposed to know which nights you were in the pub and buying takeaway chicken tikka afterwards and which nights you skipped cause you were doing something else like what like killing a few kids you mean fuck it i dont care trouble here jack another man had entered a somewhat rounded bloke with hair too thin for his age and skin too ruddy even for someone recently exposed to the cold nkata wondered if hed been listening just outside the reception door help you with something the man asked nkata with a glance that took the ds in from head to toe jack didnt seem pleased to see the bloke he apparently believed he needed no rescue neil he said another visit from the bill this would be greenham nkata concluded just as well he wanted a word with him too jack went on more alibis needed hes got a list of dates this time hope you keep a diary of your every move cause thats what hes looking for meet ds whahaha nkata said to greenham winston nkata and reached for his warrant card dont bother neil said i believe you and this is what you need to believe im going in therehe indicated the inner reaches of the buildingand im ringing my solicitor im finished answering questions or having friendly chats with the cops without legal advice you lot are bordering on harassment now and then to veness watch your backside they dont plan to rest till they get one of us pass word round he headed for the doorway to the interior of the building there was nkata concluded nothing more to be gained on this side of the river aside from corroborating the miller and grindstone tale and the takeaway curry situation if jack veness was slipsliding round london in the small hours depositing bodies in the vicinity of the homes of his fellow colossus workers hed not have announced that fact to anyone he knew at the pub or the takeaway through obvious behaviour still if hed selected mabil as his next source of young boys he might not have been as circumspect about disguising his absence from the pub and the takeaway on the nights of mabil meetings it was little enough to go on but it was something nkata left the building telling veness to have robbie kilfoyle and griffin strong phone him when they finally showed their faces he went across the carpark at the rear of the building and slid into his escort across the street tucked into the dismal and heavily graffitied railway arches leading out of london from waterloo station four carrepair shops faced colossus along with a radiocontrolled minicab and parcel service and a bicycle shop in front of these establishments young people of the area hung about they mingled in groups and as nkata watched an asian man emerged from the bicycle shop and shooed them off to another location they exchanged words with the man but nothing came of it they began to slouch off towards new kent road when nkata followed in his car he saw more of them beneath the railway viaduct and more strung out like african beads in twos threes and fours along the way to the grubby shopping centre which took up the corner of elephant and castle they shuffled along on a pavement spotted with discarded chewing gum cigarette ends orange juice cartons food wrappers crushed coke cans and halfeaten kebabs among themselves they passed a fagor more likely a spliff it was difficult to tell but they apparently had no worry of being stopped in this part of town no matter what they did there were more of them than there were outraged citizens to prevent them from doing whatever they liked which seemed to be listening to deafening rap music and giving aggro to the kebab maker whose tiny establishment stood between the charlie chaplin pub and el azteca mexican products and catering they had nothing to do and nowhere to go out of school without the hope of employment waiting aimlessly for the current of life to carry them wherever it would but none of them nkata thought had started out this way each of them had once been a slate on which nothing had been written this made him think of his own good fortune that combination of humanity and circumstance that had brought him to where he was on this day and had he thought also brought stoney to where he was he wouldnt think of his brother beyond his help now he would think of helping where he could in memory of stoney no not for that rather in acknowledgement of deliverance and in blessing of his godgiven ability to recognise it when it had come the canterbury hotel was one of a series of white edwardian conversions that curved north along lexham gardens from cromwell road in south kensington long ago it had been an elegant house among other elegant houses in a part of town made desirable by the proximity of kensington palace now however the street was only marginally appealing it was a spot that catered to foreigners with minimal needs and on very tight budgets as well as to couples looking for an hour or two in which to do sexual business together with no questions asked the hotels had names relying heavily on the use of court park or locations of historical significance all of which suggested opulence but belied the condition of their interiors from the street the canterbury hotel looked as if it was going to live up to barbaras grim expectations of it its dingy white sign bore two holes that had renamed the establishment can bury hot and its draughtsboard marble porch gaped with missing pieces barbara stopped lynley as he reached for the door handle you see what i mean dont you she waved at him the revised efits that shed been carrying its the one thing we havent talked about i dont disagree lynley told her but in the absence of something more weve got minshall sir and hes starting to cooperate lynley nodded at the door to the canterbury hotel the next few minutes will tell the tale on that right now what we know is that neither muwaffaq masoud nor our square four gym witness has anything to gain by lying you and i both know thats not the case for minshall they were talking about the efits theyd obtained barbaras point was their unreliability muwaffaq masoud had last seen the man whod purchased his van many months earlier the square four gym observer had seen the individual following sean laveryand he didnt know if the bloke was really following sean lavery admit it barbara had saidmore than four weeks previously what they had right now in the sketches was entirely dependent upon the memory of two men who at the precise moment theyd seen the person in question had no reason to memorise a single detail about him the efits thus could be worth sweet fa to the police while one generated by barry minshall could set them straight if lynleys point had been they could rely upon minshall to give them an accurate description in the first place that was open to doubt until they saw how truthful his account was of the goingson at the canterbury hotel lynley led the way in there was no lobby just a corridor with a worn turkey runner and a passthrough window in a wall that seemed to open upon a reception office the sound of aerosol spraying was emanating from this location as was the heady eyestinging odour of a substance that would have sent a huffer into raptures they went to investigate there were no paper bags involved in what was going on instead a twentysomething girl with what looked like a small chandelier dangling from one earlobe was squatting on the floor on an open tabloid waterproofing a pair of boots hers by the look of things her feet were bare lynley had taken out his warrant card but the receptionist did not look up she was virtually ensconced in her position on the floor fast becoming a victim of her aerosol cans fumes hang on she said and sprayed away she swayed dangerously on her heels bloody hell get some air in this place barbara strode back to the door and slung it open when she returned to the reception office the girl had dragged herself up off the floor whoa she said with a woozy laugh when they say do it in a ventilated place theyre not kidding she reached for a registration card and plopped it on the counter along with a biro and a room key fiftyfive for the night thirty by the hour or fifteen if you arent particular about the sheets which i wouldnt recommend by the waythe fifteenpound optionbut dont mention i said that at that point she finally took in the two people whod come calling it was clear she didnt twig they were copsdespite lynleys identification dangling in plain sight from his fingersbecause her glance went from barbara to her companion to barbara again and her expression said of lynley whatever floats your boat barbara saved lynley the embarrassment of having to disabuse the girl of her notion about their presence in the canterbury hotel as she dug out her police identification she said when we do it we prefer the backseat of a car bit cramped to be sure but definitely cheap she thrust her id at the girl new scotland yard she said and dead deelighted to know youre helping the neighbourhood cope with its ungovernable passions this is detective superintendent lynley by the way the girls eyes took in both warrant cards she reached up and fingered the chandelier that dangled from her earlobe sorry she said you know i didnt actually think the two of you right barbara cut in lets begin with the hours you work here what are they why lynley said are you on duty at night she shook her head im off at six whats going on whats happened it was clear that shed been prepped on what to do should the rozzers ever come calling she reached for the phone and said let me get mr tatlises for you he works reception at night hes the manager hey whatre you doing this last she said as barbara reached over the reception counter and broke the connection on the phone the night clerk will do just fine she told the girl where is he hes legal she said everyone who works here is legal theres not a single person without papers and mr tatlises makes sure they all enroll in english classes as well a real upright member of society he is barbara said where can we find the night clerk lynley asked whats his name asleep ive not heard that name before barbara said what nationality is it what hes got a room herethats why look he wont want to be woken up well do those honours for you then lynley said where is it top floor she said fortyone its a single he doesnt have to pay mr tatlises takes it out of his wages half price as well she said all this as if the information might be enough to keep them from speaking to the night clerk as lynley and barbara headed for the lift the girl reached for the phone there was little doubt she was phoning either for reinforcements or to warn room that the cops were on their way up the lift was a preworld war i affair a grilled cage that ascended at the dignified pace necessary for mystical assumptions into heaven it was suitable for two individuals without luggage but possession of luggage did not appear to be one of the qualifications for filling out a registration card in this hotel the door to was open when they finally got there the occupant was waiting for them pyjamas on body and foreign passport in hand he looked to be round twenty years old he said hello how do you do i am ibrahim selçuk mr tatlises is my uncle i speak english little my papers are in order like the words of the receptionist below all of what he said was rote lines you must recite if a cop asks you questions the place was probably a hotbed of illegal immigrants but that was something they were not concerned about at the moment as lynley made clear to the man when he said were not involved in immigration on the eighth a young boy was brought to this hotel by an oddlooking man with yellowwhite hair and dark glasses an albino we call him no colour in his skin the boy was young blond lynley showed selçuk the picture of davey benton which he took from his jacket pocket along with the mug shot taken of minshall by the holmes street police he may have left in the company of another man whod already booked a room here barbara added and this song and danceyoung boys being brought to this place by the albino man and leaving later with some other blokeits supposedly happened over and over ibrahim so dont lets try to pretend you havent seen the action she thrust the two efits at the night receptionist then saying he might look like this the man the young boy left with yes no can you confirm he said uneasily my english is little i have passport here and he danced from one foot to another like someone needing to use the toilet people come i give them card to sign and keys they pay in cash that is all he gripped the front of his pyjamas in the area of his crotch please he said casting a look back over his shoulder barbara muttered bloody hell and to lynley im about to wet myself is probably not part of his english lessons behind the man his room was dark in the light from the corridor they could see that his bed was rumpled hed definitely been sleeping but hed also been prepared by someone at some point to keep his answers minimal at all times admitting to nothing barbara was about to suggest to lynley that forcing the bloke to hold his bladder for a good twenty minutes might go some distance towards loosening his tongue when a diminutive man in a dinner suit came trundling towards them from round the corner this had to be mr tatlises barbara thought his look of determined good cheer was spurious enough to act as his identification he said in a heavy turkish accent my nephew his english wants repair i am mr tatlises and im happy to help you ibrahim i will handle this he shooed the boy into his room again and he closed the door himself now he said expansively you need something yes but not a room no no ive been told that already he laughed and looked from barbara to lynley with a weboysknowwherewewanttoplantit expression that made barbara want to invite the little worm to take a bite of her fist like someone would want to have a shag with you she wanted to ask him puhhleez we understand that this boy was brought here by a man called barry minshall lynley showed tatlises the relevant photos he left in the company of another man who we believe resembles this individual havers barbara showed tatlises the efits your confirmation of this is what we require at this point and after that tatlises inquired hed given a scant glance to the photos and the drawings youre not really in a position to wonder what happens after that lynley told him then i do not see how listen jackomate barbara broke in i expect your handmaiden of the boots downstairs put you in the picture that were not here from your local station two rozzers looking round their new patch for a nice bit of dosh from the likes of you if thats how you keep this operation going thiss just a bit bigger than that so if you know something about whats been going on in this rubbish tip i suggest you unplug it and give us the facts okay weve got it from this individualshe stabbed her finger onto barry minshalls mug shotthat one of his mates from a group called mabil met a thirteenyearold boy right in this hotel on the eighth minshall claims its a regular arrangement since someone from hereand let me guess its youbelongs to mabil as well hows this all sounding to you for a lark mabil tatlises said with some fluttering of eyelashes to approximate confusion this is someone i expect you know what mabil is lynley said i also expect that if we asked you to join an identity parade mr minshall would have no trouble picking you out as the fellow member of mabil who works here we can avoid all that and you can confirm his story identify the boy and tell us whether the man he left with looks like either one of these two sketches or we can prolong the entire affair and haul you over to earls court road police station for a while if he left with him barbara added i know nothing tatlises insisted he rapped on the door of room his nephew opened it so quickly that it was obvious hed been standing directly behind it listening to every word tatlises began speaking to him rapidly in their language his voice was loud he pulled the boy over by his pyjama jacket and he snatched the sketches and the pictures forcing the young man to study them it was a nice performance barbara thought he actually meant them to believe that his nephew and not himself was the paedophile here she glanced at lynley seeking permission he nodded she stepped up to business listen to me you little wanker she said to tatlises grabbing his arm if you think were going to jump on the wagon youre driving youre even stupider than you look leave him bloody alone and tell him to answer our questions and you can answer them as well got it or do i need to help you with your understanding she released him but not before she ended her question with a twist of his arm tatlises cursed her in his language or so she assumed he was doing from the passion of his words and the expression on his nephews face he said finally i will report you for this to both of them to which barbara answered im wetting my knickers in terror now translate this for your nephew or whatever the hell he really is this kidwas he here tatlises rubbed his arm where barbara had manhandled it she expected him to start shouting something meaningful like unconscionable brutality so assiduous were his ministrations to his limb he finally said i do not work nights brilliant he does though tell him to answer tatlises nodded at his nephew the younger man looked at the picture and nodded in turn fine now lets get on to the rest okay did you see him leave the hotel the nephew nodded he leaves with the other i see this not the albin one how you named him not with the albino man the man with yellowish hair and white skin the other yes and you saw this them together the boy walking talking alive the last word set them both off in a babble of their own language finally the nephew began to keen he cried i did not i did not and a damp spot appeared in the crotch of his pyjama bottoms he leaves with the other i see this i see this whats going on lynley demanded of tatlises have you accused him worthless worthless tatlises broke in smacking his nephew round the head what evil are you using this hotel for did you not think you would be caught the boy sheltered his head and cried i did not lynley pulled the men apart and barbara planted herself between them she said get this straight and tattoo it on your eyeballs both of you this bloke brought the boy to the hotel and this bloke left with him point the finger at each other and everyone in between but theres not a rat in this place not going down for pimping pandering paedophilia and anything else that we can make stick to you so i suggest you might want cooperative as the dickens to be what gets written in red across your paperwork she saw shed got through tatlises backed off from his nephew his nephew shrank back into his room both of them were reborn before their eyes tatlises might have had a dodgy arrangement with his mabil friends about the use of the canterbury hotel and he might have also collected a trunkful of lolly from allowing its rooms to be used for underage homosexual trysts but it did seem he drew the line at murder he said this boy and took up the picture of davey benton thats right barbara said were fairly certain he left here alive lynley told the man but he might have been killed in one of your rooms no no nephews english was improving miraculously not with the albino with the other man i see this and he turned to his putative uncle and spoke at some length in their mutual tongue tatlises translated the boy in the picture had come with the albino and they had gone up to room which had been booked earlier and checked in to by another man the boy left with that man some hours later two perhaps no more than that no he had not appeared ill drunk drugged or anything else for that matter although ibrahim selçuk had not studied the boy to tell the truth hed had no reason to it was not the first time a boy had come with the albino man and left with another man the night clerk added that the identity of the boys changed and the identity of the men booking the room changed but the man who coupled them was always the same the albino from the picture that the police had with them that is all he knows tatlises finished barbara showed the night clerk the sketches again was the man who booked the room either of these two blokes she wanted to know selçuk studied them and chose the younger of the two maybe he said it is something like they had the confirmation they needed minshall was apparently telling the truth insofar as the canterbury hotel went so there was a slim hope that the hotel itself still had more it could reveal lynley asked to see room there will be nothing tatlises said hastily it has been thoroughly cleaned as is every room once it has been used lynley was firm on this point however and they descended a floor leaving selçuk behind them to return to his sleep tatlises brought a master key from his pocket and admitted lynley and havers to the room in which davey benton had met his killer it was a dismal enough chamber of seduction a double bed was its centrepiece covered with the sort of quilted floral counterpane that would hide a multitude of mankinds transgressions from liquids spilt to bodily fluids leaked against one wall a blond wooden chest served double duty as a desk with a kneehole into which a mismatched chair was thrust on top of this a plastic tray held the requisite teamaking equipment with a grubby tin pot to use for the brew and a grubbier electric kettle for boiling the water dingy curtains covered the single transom window and brown fitted carpet bore streaks and stains stretching across the floor the savoy must be in real agony over the competition barbara remarked lynley said well want soco over here i want a thorough goingover tatlises protested this room has been cleaned you will find nothing and nothing occurred in here that lynley swung on him i dont particularly care to have your opinion at this point he said and i suggest you dont care to give it and to barbara phone soco stay in this room till they get here then get whatever registration card was signed for thishe seemed to seek a wordplace and check the address on it put earls court road into the picture about everything going on here if they arent already talk to their chief super no one less barbara nodded she felt a rush of pleasure both at the sensation of progress being made and at the responsibility given her it was almost like old times she said right will do sir and took out her mobile as he directed tatlises from the room lynley stood outside the hotel he tried to shake off the sensation that they were blindly swinging their fists at an enemy more adept at dodging than they were at forcing him into submission he phoned chelsea st james would have had time to read and to assess the next group of reports hed sent over to cheyne row perhaps lynley thought there would be something uplifting he had to share but instead of his old friend answering it was deborahs voice lynley heard no one at home leave a message at the tone please lynley rang off without doing so he phoned his friends mobile next and had luck there st james answered he was just heading into a meeting with his banker he said yes hed read the reports and there were two interesting details could lynley meethim inwhat about half an hour he was up in sloane square arrangements made lynley set off by car he was five minutes from the square if traffic was moving it was and he wove down towards the river he came at the kings road from sloane avenue and chugged up to the square in the wake of a number bus the pavements were crowded with shoppers at this time of day as was the oriel brasserie where he took timely possession of a table the size of a fiftypence coin just as three women with approximately twentyfive shopping bags were leaving it he ordered coffee and waited for st james to conclude his business his table was one in the oriels front window so he would be able to see his friend as he crossed the square and came down the neat treelined walk that stretched past the venus fountain to the war memorial right now the centre of the square was empty save for pigeons that were scouting round for crumbs beneath the benches lynley took a call from nkata while he waited jack veness had provided a friend to corroborate whatever alibi he chose to come up with and neil greenham had latched on to his solicitor the ds had left word for both kilfoyle and strong to phone him but theyd no doubt hear from their mates at colossus that alibis were being asked for which would give both of them plenty of time to cook some up before speaking again to the cops lynley told nkata to carry on as best he could and he picked up his coffee and downed it in three gulps scalding hot it attacked his throat like a surgeon which was fine he thought at last he saw st james coming across the square lynley turned and ordered a second coffee for himself and one for his friend the drinks arrived as did st james who shed his overcoat by the door and worked his way over to lynley lord asherton at rest st james said with a smile as he pulled out a chair and carefully folded himself into it lynley grimaced youve seen the paper it was hard to avoid st james reached for the sugar and began his usual process of rendering his coffee undrinkable for any other human being your photo is making quite a statement on the newsstands round the square with followups to come lynley said if corsico and his editor have their way what sort of followups st james went for the milk next just a dollop after which he began stirring his brew theyve apparently heard from nies up in yorkshire st james looked up hed been smiling but now his face was grave you cant want that what i want is to keep them away from the rest of the squad particularly from winston theyve set their sights on him next with you willing to have your dirty linen aired for public consumption instead not a good idea tommy not fair on you and certainly not fair on judith or stephanie if it comes to that his sister his niece lynley thought they shared in the story of the yorkshire murder that had taken husband from one and father from the other what rained on him as he tried to protect his team from exposure rained on his relations as well i dont see any way round it ill have to warn them its coming i daresay they can cope theyve been through it before st james was frowning down at his coffee he shook his head put them on to me tommy you itll work to keep them away from yorkshire for a time and from winston as well im part of the team if only tangentially play me up and set them on me you cant want that im not enthusiastic about it but you cant want them delving into your sisters marriage in this way theyd only be delving into driving drunk and crippling you lynley pushed his coffee away christ but ive cocked so many things up not this st james said we were both drunk lets not forget that and anyway i doubt your reporter from the source will even touch upon the subject of myphysical situation lets call it hell be too politically correct unseemly to mention it why dyou happen to be wearing that appliance on your leg sir its akin to asking someone when he stopped beating his wife and anyway if they do get on to it i was out carousing with a friend and this is the result an object lesson for todays wild adolescents end of story you cant want them homing in on you of course not ill be the laughingstock of my siblings not to mention what my mother will say in her inimitable fashion but look at it this way im outside the investigation even as im inside the investigation and theres an advantage to that you can play it any way you want with hillier either im part of the teamand he did say he wanted the team profiled didnt he siror im ruthlessly selfserving and as an independent scientist im seeking the selfaggrandisement that only exposure in the press will afford me play it either way here he smiled i know you live only to torment the poor sod lynley smiled also in spite of himself its good of you simon it keeps them away from winston hillier wont like that of course but i can deal with hillier and by the time they get round to winston or anyone else god willing this business will be finished have you anything with you lynley nodded towards the briefcase that st james had brought to the table with him dashed back for it yes ive had the advantage in several ways which means ive missed something all right i can live with it not missed exactly i wouldnt say that what would you say then that ive the advantage of being some distance from the case while youre in the thick of it and i dont have hillier the press and god only knows who else breathing down my neck and demanding a result ill take the excuse as offered with thanks what did you find st james reached for the briefcase and opened it on a spare chair that he pulled from another table he brought out the latest batch of paperwork hed been sent have you found the source of the ambergris oil he asked we have two sources why hes run out of the oil there was no trace of it on the queens wood body on all the others it was present not always in the same place but there but on this one its not lynley thought about this he saw a reason the oil might have been absent he said the body was naked the oil might have been on his clothes but the st georges gardens body was naked as well kimmo thornes body right and he still had traces of the oil on him no id say theres a very good chance our mans run out of it tommy hes going to need more and if youve traced two sources a watch on those shops might prove to be the key you say theres a good chance lynley noted what else then theres something else isnt there st james nodded slowly he seemed undecided about the importance of his next revelation he said its something tommy thats all i can say i dont like to interpret it because it could take you in the wrong direction at the end of the day all right accepted what is it st james pulled another batch of documents out he said the contents of their stomachs before this last boy the queens wood boy davey benton before him the others had all eaten within an hour of their deaths and in every case the contents of the stomachs were identical identical without a deviation tommy but with davey benton he hadnt had anything in hours eight hours at least taken in conjunction with the ambergrisoil situation st james leaned forward he put his hand on the neat stack of documents for emphasis i dont need to tell you what this means do i lynley turned from his friend he looked to the square outside where beyond the window the grey winter day moved unceasing towards darkness and what darkness brought with it no simon he finally said you dont have to tell me a thing chapter twentysix the name on the registration card was oscar wilde when barbara havers saw this she looked up at chandelier earring expecting a rolling of the eyes and an expression that said what else would you expect but it was clear that the girl in reception was of the recent unschooled generation whose education was dependent upon music videos and gossip magazines she hadnt made the connection any more than the night clerk had but at least he had the excuse of being a foreigner wildein revival or otherwiseprobably wasnt big in turkey barbara went on to the address a number on collingham road the hotel had a battered a to zpurportedly for use by the hordes of tourists who stayed thereand she found the street not that far from lexham gardens it was on the other side of cromwell road she could hoof it there without any trouble before descending to reception shed waited for the arrival of the soco team having phoned for them from room mr tatlises had taken himself off somewhere in his dinner suit doubtless to contact his fellow mabilians and give them the word that times were about to be achangin he would then she reckoned make a vain attempt to destroy every bit of child pornography that he had in his possession stupid sod barbara thought he wouldntve been able to resist downloading that filth off the netnone of them could ever resist thatand he was just enough of an idiot to think delete meant gone but not forgotten the earls court road station would have a field day at this place once tatlises was in their clutches theyd find a way to squeeze him for everything he knew about mabil about what was going on in the hotel about little boys and money changing hands and everything else related to this disgusting situation unless of course some of them were involved in mabilsome of the earls court road copsbut barbara didnt want to think of that cops priests doctors and ministers one had to hope if not to believe that a moral core existed somewhere as ordered by lynley she spoke to the earls court road chief super he set the wheels in motion when the soco team arrived she felt secure enough to leave with the address from the registration card in hand and the card itself turned over to the soco team for fingerprinting she crossed over cromwell road and headed east in the direction of the natural history museum collingham road headed south some yards from lexham gardens barbara made the turn and began searching for the correct address along the row of tall whitefronted conversions considering the name that had been on the registration card she had little hope of the address being anything but another sham she wasnt far from correct in this conclusion where collingham road met the lower half of courtfield gardens an old stone church stood on the corner a wroughtiron fence surrounded it and inside the churchyard that the fence contained a faded sign done in gold letters named the spot as st lucys community centre beneath this identification were the numbers of the street address they corresponded identically to the numbers on the card from the canterbury hotel how fitting it was barbara thought as she pushed through the gate and entered the churchyard the address on the card was the address for mabil st lucys the deconsecrated church not far from the gloucester road underground station minshall had said that mabil met in the basement so that was where barbara headed she went round the side of the building following a concrete path through a small overgrown cemetery toppling gravestones and ivychoked tombs filled it to capacity all of them untended a set of stone steps led down to the basement at the back of the church a sign on the bright blue door called this portion of the centre ladybird infant daycare this door stood partially open and from within barbara could hear the babble of childrens voices she pushed her way inside and found herself in a vestibule where a long rack of hooks at waist height held miniature coats jackets and macs while below a row of pintsized wellingtons waited neatly for their owners there appeared to be two classrooms opening off this little hall one large and one small and both of them filled with enthusiastic children engaged in making paper valentines the small room and an energetic conga line galloping about to the tune of on the sunny side of the street the large room barbara was deciding which room to try for information when a sixtyish woman with spectacles on a gold chain round her neck came out of what seemed to be a kitchen bearing a tray of ginger biscuits fresh ginger biscuits by the smell of them barbaras stomach made an appreciative gurgle the woman looked from barbara to the door her expression said that it was not meant to be left unlocked which barbara acknowledged was not a bad idea the woman asked if she could be of help barbara showed her identification and told the womanwho gave her name as mrs mcdonaldthat shed come about mabil mabel mrs mcdonald said they had no child named mabel enrolled this was an organisation of men who met in the basement in the evenings barbara told her mabil it was spelled ah well mrs mcdonald knew nothing about that for that sort of information the constable would have to talk to the letting agent taverstock percy she informed barbara on gloucester road they handled all of the lettings for the community centre twelvestep programmes womens clubs antiques and crafts fairs writing classes the lot could she have a look round anyway barbara asked mrs mcdonald there was she knew nothing to find here but she wanted to get a feel for the place where perversion was not only tolerated but encouraged mrs mcdonald was less than happy about this request but she said shed show barbara the facilities if she would wait right here while the biscuits got delivered to the conga line she carried her tray into the larger room and handed it off to one of the teachers she returned as the conga line disintegrated in a biscuit frenzy to which barbara could only too well relate shed skipped lunch and it was already teatime she followed mrs mcdonald dutifully from room to room they blossomed with childrenlaughing jabbering fresh faced innocent her heart felt sick at the thought of paedophiles defiling this atmosphere even by their presence at night when these children were tucked up safely at home there was little enough to see however a large room with a dais at one end a lectern pushed to one side and chairs stacked up along walls decorated with rainbows leprechauns and an enormous whimsical pot of gold a small room with totsized tables where children created crafts that were then displayed along the walls in a riot of colour and imagination a kitchen a lavatory a supply room that was it barbara tried to picture the place filled with salivadripping child molesters and it wasnt difficult she could see them here easily enough the miserable lot of them getting their rocks off at the thought of all the kids in these rooms every single weekday just waiting for some monster to snatch them off the street she thanked mrs mcdonald and left st lucys although it seemed a dead end she knew she couldnt leave the stone of taverstock percy unturned the estate agent she found was back on the other side of cromwell road and up a distance she passed a barclayscomplete with drunken homeless beggar on the front stepsas well as a church and a string of nineteenthcentury conversionsbefore she came to a smallish commercial area where taverstock percy was bookended by a haveeverything ironmonger and an oldfashioned takeaway serving up sausage rolls and jacket potatoes to a line of road workers who were taking their tea break from a jackhammered hole in the middle of the street inside taverstock percy barbara asked to see the estate agent in charge of letting space in st lucys church and she was shown to a young woman called misty perrin who was apparently thrilled by the idea that custom for st lucys was walking in off the street she took out an application and fixed it to a clipboard saying that of course there were certain rules and regulations that had to be met in order for anyone to have space in the former church or its basement right barbara thought thats what kept away the riffraff she took out her identification and introduced herself to misty could she have a word about a group called mabil misty lowered the clipboard to her desk but she didnt look concerned she said oh of course when you asked about st lucys i thoughtwell anywaymabil yes she opened a filing drawer in her desk and fingered through its contents she brought out a slim manila folder and opened it she read through the material nodding appreciatively and saying at the conclusion of her inspection i wish all tenants were as prompt as they are every month theyre right on time with the rent no complaints about how they leave the premises at the end of their meetings no problem in the neighbourhood with illegal parking well of course the clamp takes care of that doesnt it anyway what would you like to know what sort of group is it misty looked back at her documents support group it appears men going through divorce im not sure why they call it mabil unless thats an acronym formen against what bloody inconsiderate litigation barbara offered whose names on the contract misty read it to her j s mill she recited the address as well she went on to inform barbara that the only somewhat odd thing about mabil was that their fee always arrived in cash brought in person by mr mill on the first of the month he said it had to be cash because thats how they came up with the money through a collection at their meetings well its a bit irregular and all that but st lucys said that was fine by them just so long as they got the money and theyve got it every month on the first for the last five years five years yes thats right is there something misty looked anxious barbara shook her head and waved off the question what was the point the girl was as innocent as the children in the ladybird centre she didnt depend on the promise of anything coming from it but she showed misty the two efits anyway j s mill look like either of these blokes she asked misty glanced at the sketches but shook her head he was much older she saidround seventyand he didnt have a beard or goatee or anything he did wear an enormous hearing aid if that was any help barbara shuddered at the information someones granddad she thought she wanted to find and strangle him she took the address of j s mill as she left the estate agency it would be bogus she had little doubt of that but shed hand it over to to nonetheless someone somewhere had to kick down the doors of the members of this organisation she was heading back in the direction of cromwell road when her mobile rang it was lynley asking where she was she told him bringing him up to date on what little shed managed to glean from her efforts with the registration card from the canterbury hotel what about you she asked him st james thinks our boy may need to buy more ambergris oil lynley told her and informed her of the rest of st jamess report its time for you to take another trip up to wendys cloud constable nkata parked some distance along manor place he was still thinking about the dozens of aimlessly sauntering black kids hed seen in the vicinity of elephant and castle no single place for them to go and very little for them to do that wasnt the real truth of the matterif nothing else they could be at schoolbut he knew that was the way they themselves saw their situation taught to think it by older peers by disgruntled and disappointed parents by lack of opportunity and too much temptation it was easier for them in the long run not to care nkata had thought of them all the way to kennington he allowed them to become his excuse not that he actually needed one this journey was owed not to him but by him the time had definitely come he got out of the car and walked the short distance to the wig shop still a hopeful sign of what was possible among the failed and boardedup establishments in the neighbourhood the pubs naturally were still doing business but other than a dismal corner shop with heavy grilles on the windows yasmin edwards business was the only place open when nkata entered he saw that yasmin was with a client this was a skeletal black woman with a deathshead face she was bald and she sat slumped in a beauty chair before the long mirrored wall and the counter at which yasmin worked on the counter a makeup case was open three wigs stood near it one comprising a head full of plaits one close cropped like yasmins hair one long and straight of the sort worn by catwalk models yasmins glance went to nkata and then away as if shed been expecting him and was unsurprised by his arrival he nodded at her but he knew she didnt see she was focussed on her client and the brush on which she was applying blusher from a round tin box i jus cant see it her client said her voice was as exhausted as her body looked dont you bother with that yasmeen you wait yasmin told her gently le me fix you luv and in the meantime study those wigs for the one you want int going to make a difference is it the woman said i don know why i even came cause youre pretty ruby an the world deserves to see that ruby poohpoohed her no more im pretty now she said yasmin didnt answer this remark positioning herself instead in front of the woman in order to study her face yasmins own was professional devoid of the pity that the other woman would doubtless have been able to sense in an instant yasmin bent towards her and applied the brush along the ridge of her cheekbones she followed this with a similar movement along her jaw nkata waited patiently he watched yasmin work the flick of a brush a heightening of shading round the eyes she finished her client off with lipstick which she applied with a delicate paintbrush she wore no kind of lipstick herself the rosebloom scar on her upper liplongago gift of her husbandmade this impossible she stood back and surveyed her work she said now youre something ruby which wigs goin to finish off the picture oh yasmeen i dunno now come on your husband int waiting out there for some baldheaded lady with a pretty new face you want to try them again the short one i guess you sure the long one made you look like whatsername the model ruby chuckled oh yeah m ready for fashion week yasmeen maybe theyll put me in a bikini i finally got the figger for it le me do the short one i like it good enough yasmin removed the short wig from the stand she lowered it gently onto rubys head she stood back then made an adjustment then stood back again youre ready for a big night out she said make sure your man sees you get it she helped ruby out of the beauty chair and took the voucher that the woman held out to her she gently pushed away an additional tenpound note that ruby tried to press upon her none f that she said buy some flowers for your flat flowers enough at the funeral ruby said yeah but the corpse dont get to enjoy them they chuckled together yasmin saw her to the door a car at the kerb waited for her one door swinging open yasmin eased her inside when she returned to the shop she went at once to the beauty chair where she began to repack her makeup supplies nkata said to her whats she got pancreas yasmin said shortly bad pancreass always bad sergeant shes doing chemo but int any point what dyou want man i got work to do he approached her but still kept a safe distance between them i got a brother he said hes harold but we called him stoney cos he was stubborn as a stone in a field a stonehenge kind of stone i mean one you cant budge no matter what yasmin paused in putting the makeup away a brush in her hand she frowned at nkata so nkata licked his lower lip hes in wandsworth life her glance moved away then back to him she knew what that meant murder he do it oh yeah stoneyyeah that was stoney all the way through got a gun somewherehed never say from whoand whacked a bloke in battersea he and his mate were trying to carjack his bmw and the bloke didnt cooperate like they wanted stoney shot him in the back of the head an execution his mate turned him in she stood there for a moment as if evaluating this then she went back to work thing is nkata went on i couldve gone the same way and was doing jus that cept i figured i was cleverer than stoney i could fight better an anyway i wasnt inerested in ripping off cars i had a gang see and they were my brothers more brothers to men stoney couldve ever been anyway so i fought with them cos thats what we did we fought over turf this pavement that pavement this newsagents that tobacconist i end up in casualty with my face split openhe gestured to his cheek and the scar that ran down itand my mum faints dead on the floor when she sees it i look at her and i look at my dad and i know he means to beat me bloody when we get home with or without my face done up in stitches and i seeall of a sudden this wasthat he means to beat me not for myself but cos i hurt mum like stoney hurt mum and then i really see how they treat her doctors and nurses in casualty this is they treat her like she did somethin wrong which is what they think she did cos one of her boys s in prison and the others a brixton warrior and thats it nkata held out his hands empty a cop makes conversation with methis is about the fight that got me the scarand he starts me off in another direction and i cling to him and i cling to it cos i wont do to mum what stoney did as easy as that yasmin asked he could hear the note of scorn in her voice as simple as that nkata corrected her politely i wouldnt ever say it was easy yasmin finished packing her makeup away she closed the case with a snap and heaved it from the counter she carried it to the back of the shop and shoved it on a shelf before she placed one hand on a hip and said that all no fine what else i live with my mum and dad over on loughborough estate im goin to stay living with them no matter what cos theyre getting older and the older they get the more dangerous it is over there for them i wont have them facing aggro from smackheads an dope dealers an pimps that lot dont like me they dont wan to be round me they sure as hell don trust me and they keep their distance from my mum and my dad long as im there thas how i want it and ill do what it takes to keep it that way yasmin cocked her head her face maintained its distrustful scornful expression the same expression shed worn since hed met her so whyre you telling me this cos i want you to know the truth an thing is yas the truth int a road without curves and diversions so you got to know that yeah i was tracted to you the first moment i saw you and who wouldnt be so yeah i wanted you away from katja wolfe but not cos i believed youre meant for a mans love and not a womans love cos i dint know that did i how could i but cos i wanted a chance with you and the only way to get that chance was to prove to you katja wolfe wasnt worthy of what you had to offer but at the same time yas i liked daniel from the first s well an i could see daniel liked me back an i bloody well knowknew it then and know it nowhow life can be for kids on the street with time on their hands specially kids like daniel without dads in the house an it wasnt cos i thought you werentarenta good mum cos i could see that you were but i thought dan needed morehe still needs morean thats what i came to tell you that daniel needs no all of it yas beginning to end he still stood a distance from her but he thought he could see the muscles move in her smooth dark neck as she swallowed he thought he could see her heart beat in the vein on her temple as well but he knew he was trying to think things into a reality defined by his hopes let it go he told himself let it be what it is what dyou want now then yasmin finally asked him she returned to the beauty chair and picked up the two remaining wigs holding one under each arm nkata shrugged nothing he said an thats the truth you he said all right you but i dont know if thas even the truth which is why i dont want to say it out loud in bed yeah i want you like that in bed with me but everything else i dont know so thas the truth and its what youre owed you always deserved it but you never got it not from your husband and not from katja i dont know if youre even getting it from your current man but youre getting it from me so there was you first an foremost in my eyes and there was daniel afterwards an its never been as simple as you thinking im using dan to get to you yasmin nothin is ever simple as that everything was said he felt empty of nearly all that he was poured onto the lino at her feet she could step right through him or sweep him up and dump him in the street oranything really he was bare and helpless as the day hed been born they stared at each other he felt the wanting as hed not felt it before as if stating it blatantly had increased it tenfold till it gnawed at him like an animal chewing from the inside out then she spoke two words only and at first he didnt know what she meant what man what his lips were dry what current man you said my current man that bloke the last time i was here she frowned she looked towards the window as if seeing a reflection of the past in the glass then back at him she said lloyd burnett you dint say his name he came in to get his wifes wig she said he said oh and felt a perfect fool his mobile rang then which saved him from having to say anything more he flipped it open said hang on into it and used the blessed intervention as a means to his escape he took out one of his cards and he approached yasmin she didnt raise the wig stands to defend herself she wore only a jersey on topno pocket availableso he slid his card into the front pocket of her jeans he was careful not to touch her any more than that he said i got to take this call someday yas i hope its you ringing he was closer to her than shed ever let him get he could smell her scent he could sense her fear he thought yas but he didnt say it he left the shop and went towards his car drawing the mobile to his ear the voice on the phone was unfamiliar to him as was the name its gigi a young woman said you told me to ring you he said who she said gigi from gabriels wharf crystal moon the association brought him round quick enough for which he was grateful he said gigi right yeah whas happened robbie kilfoyles been in her voice lowered to a whisper he made a purchase you got paperwork on it i got the till receipt right here in front of me hang on to it nkata told her im on my way lynley sent the message to mitchell corsico immediately after he talked to st james the investigations independent forensic specialist would make a fine second profile for the source he told him not only was he an international expert witness and a lecturer at the royal college of science but he and lynley shared a personal history that began at eton and had spanned the years since then did corsico think a conversation with st james would be profitable he did and lynley gave the reporter simons contact number this would be enough to remove corsico his stetson and his cowboy boots from sight lynley hoped it would keep the rest of the investigations team out of the reporters mind as well at least for a time he returned to victoria street then details from the past several hours roiling round in his head he kept going back to one of them one offered by havers in their phone conversation the name on the letting agreement at the estate agencythe only name aside from barry minshalls that they could associate with mabilwas j s mill havers had told him hed supplied the rest although shed already got there j s mill john stuart mill if one wished to continue the theme set up at the canterbury hotel lynley wanted to think that it was all part of a literary jokewink wink nudge nudgeamong the members of the organisation of paedophiles sort of a slap in the collective face of the unwashed unread and uneducated general public oscar wilde on the registration card at the canterbury hotel j s mill on the letting agreement with taverstock percy god only knew who else they would find on other documents relating to mabil a a milne possibly g k chesterton a c doyle the possibilities were endless so for that matter were the million and one coincidences that happened every day but still the name remained taunting him j s mill catch me if you can john stuart mill john stuart john stewart there was no use denying it to himself lynley had felt a quivering in his palms when havers had said the name that quivering translated to the questions that police worknot to mention life itselfalways prompted the wise man to ask how well do we ever know anyone how often do we let outward appearancesincluding speech and behaviourdefine our conclusions about individuals i dont need to tell you what this means do i lynley could still see the grave concern on st jamess face lynleys answer had taken him places he didnt want to go no you dont need to tell me a thing what it all really meant was asking that the cup be passed along to someone else but that wasnt going to happen he was in too far truly steepd in blood so deep and he couldnt retrace a single one of his steps he had to see the investigation through to its conclusion no matter where each single branch of it led and there was decidedly more than one branch to this matter that was becoming obvious a compulsive personality yes he thought driven by demons he did not know that restlessness the occasional anger the illchosen word how had the news been received when lynleyahead of everyone elsehad been handed the superintendents position after webberly was struck down in the street congratulations no one congratulated anyone over anything in those days that had followed webberlys attempted murder and who would have thought to with the superintendent fighting for his life and everyone else trying to find his assailant so it was not important it meant absolutely nothing someone had to step in and hed been tapped to do it and it wasnt permanent so it could hardly have been an important enough detail to make anyone wantdecidebe pushed tono yet everything took him back inexorably to his earliest days among his fellow officers the distance theyd originally placed between themselves and him who would never be one of the lads not really no matter what he did to level the playing field there would always be what they knew about him the title the land the public school voice the wealth and the assumed privilege it brought and who bloody cared except everyone did at the end of the day and everyone probably always would but anything more than thatdislike evolving to grudging acceptance and respectwas impossible to consider it was disloyal even to entertain such thoughts it was divisive and nonproductive surely yet none of this kept him from having a chat with dac cherson in personnel management although his heart was at its heaviest when he did it cherson authorised the temporary release of employment records lynley read them and told himself they amounted to nothing details that could be interpreted any way one wanted a bitter divorce a ruthless childcustody situation spiritbreaking child support a disciplinary letter for sexual harassment a word to the wise about keeping fit a bad knee a commendation for extra coursework completed nothing really they amounted to nothing still he took notes and tried to ignore the sense of betrayal he felt as he did it we all have skeletons he told himself my own are uglier than those of others he returned to his office from where hed stowed it on top of his desk he read the profile of their killer he thought about it he thought about everything from meals eaten and meals skipped to boys disabled by an unexpected shot of electricity what he thought was no what he concluded was no what he did was turn to the phone and ring hamish robson on his mobile he found him between sessions in his office near the barbican where he met with private clients away from the grim surroundings of fischer psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane it was a sideline dealing with normal people in temporary crisis robson told him one can cope with the criminal element only so long he confided but i expect you know what im talking about lynley asked robson if they could meet at the yard elsewhere it didnt matter ive a full diary into the evening robson said can we talk on the phone now ive ten minutes before my next client lynley considered this but he wanted to see robson he wanted more than merely talking to him robson said has something moreare you all right superintendent may i help you sound he seemed to shuffle papers on the other end of the line listen i might be able to cancel a patient or two or move them round a bit would that help ive also got some shopping to do and id blocked out time for that at the end of the day its not far from my office whitecross street where it intersects with dufferin theres a fruit and veg stall where i could meet you we could talk while i make my purchases it would have to do lynley thought but he could handle the preliminaries over the phone he said what time half past five all right i can do that if you wouldnt mind my askingso that i might think about it in advance is there a new development lynley considered it new he thought yes and no he decided how confident are you in your profile of the killer dr robson its not an exact science naturally but its very close when you consider its based on hundreds of hours of detailed facetoface interviewswhen you consider the length and extent of the analyses of these interviewsthe data compiled the commonalities notedits not like a fingerprint its not dna but as a guideeven as a checklistits an invaluable tool you feel that sure of it i feel that sure but why are you asking have i missed something is there more information i ought to have i can only work with what you give me what would you say to the fact that the first five boys killed had all eaten something within the final hour of their lives while the last boy had eaten nothing in hours would you be able to make an interpretation from that a silence while robson considered the question he ultimately said not out of context i wouldnt like to what about the fact that the food eaten by the first five boys was identical each time that would be part of the ritual id say but why skip it for the sixth boy there could be dozens of explanations not every boy was positioned identically after death not every boy had his navel removed not every boy had a symbol on his forehead were looking for markers that make the crimes related but they wont be carbon copies of each other lynley didnt reply to this he heard robson say to someone else voice away from the phone tell her a moment please his next client had arrived no doubt they had little enough time to conclude their conversation lynley said fred and rosemary west ian brady and myra hindley how common was that could the police have anticipated it male and female killers or two killers working as a team two killers lynley said well of course the problem was the disappearance factor in both of those examples wasnt it the lack of bodies and crime scenes to gather information from when people simply disappearbodies buried in basements for decades hidden on the moors what you willtheres nothing to interpret in the case of brady and hindley profiling didnt exist then anyway as for the westsand this would be the case for all serialkilling couplestheres one dominant partner and one submissive partner one kills one watches one starts the process one finishes it off but may i askis this where youre heading with the investigation male and female two males either i suppose you tell me dr robson lynley said could we have two killers my professional opinion thats all youve got then no i dont think so i stand by what ive already given you why lynley asked why stand by what you gave us originally ive just given you two details you didnt have earlier why dont they change things superintendent i can hear your anxiety i know how desperate you dont lynley said you cant you dont all right accepted lets meet at half past five whitecross and dufferin the fruit and veg man hes the first stall you come to ill wait there whitecross and dufferin lynley said he rang off and carefully replaced the receiver he found that he was sweating lightly his palm left a mark on the telephone he took out his handkerchief and mopped his face anxiety yes robson was right about that acting superintendent lynley he didnt need to look up to know it was dorothea harriman always appropriate with her appellations he said yes dee she said nothing more he did look up then she had an expression asking for forgiveness in advance he frowned what is it assistant commissioner hillier hes on his way down to see you he rang me up personally and told me to keep you in your office i said i would but im happy to pretend you were already gone when i got here to tell you lynley sighed dont risk your own position ill see him you sure im sure god knows i need something to lighten up my day the miracle barbara havers found was that wendy was not in the clouds this time round in fact when barbara arrived at the womans eponymous stall in camden lock market she was willing to wager that the aging hippie had actually taken the cure standing within the confines of her tiny establishment wendy still looked like hell on a tricyclethere was something about long grey locks ashen skin and multicoloured caftans fashioned from counterpanes of the subcontinent that simply did not appealbut at least her eyes were clear the fact that she didnt remember barbaras earlier visit was something of a worry but she seemed willing to believe her sister when petula told her from behind the counter of her own establishment you were out of it luv at the time of their previous introduction to each other wendy said whoops and gave a shrug of her fleshy shoulders then to barbara sorry dear it mustve been one of those days petula confided to barbara with no small degree of pride that wendy was twelvestepping it again shed tried it before and it hadnt taken but the family had hopes it would this time round met a bloke who gave her the ultimatum petula added under her breath and wendyll do anything for a length you see always would has the sex drive of a shegoat that girl whatever it took barbara thought she said ambergris oil to wendy have you sold any this would be recently last few days maybe wendy shook her grey locks massage oil by the litre she said ive six spas whore my most regular customers they go in big for relaxants like eucalyptus but no ones doing ambergris whichs just as well if you want to know my opinion what we do to animals someone out there will do to us eventually like aliens from another planet or something they might like our fat just finethe way we like whale blubberand god only knows what theyll use it for but just you wait its going to happen wendy luv petula said with one of those saveitforlater chimes to her voice shed taken out a cloth and was using it to dust candles and the shelves they stood on its okay dear i dont even know when i last had ambergris oil in stock wendy said to barbara if someone asks for it i tell them what i think and has anyone asked for it barbara brought out the efits of their possible suspects she was finding this part of the routine rather tedious but who really knew when she was going to strike that vein of gold one of these blokes prhaps wendy looked at the drawings she frowned and then dug a pair of wirerimmed spectacles from deep within her copious cleavage one of the lenses was cracked so she used the other like a monocle no she told barbara neither of these blokes looked like anyone whod come to the cloud barbara knew how unreliable her information would beher drug use consideredso she showed the efits to petula as well petula made a study of both of them truth was there were so many people coming into the market especially at the weekends she didnt like to say one of these blokes had been in but at the same time she didnt like to say neither of them had been in either they looked a bit like beatnik poets didnt they or clarinet players in a jazz band one halfexpected to see their sort in soho didnt one course one didntnot that much any longerbut there was a time barbara created a diversion on memory lane with a question about barry minshall albino magician certainly got petulas attentionwendys as welland there was a moment when barbara thought that the mention of minshalls name and a description of him was going to bear fruit but no an albino magician dressed in black and wearing dark glasses and a red stocking cap would be fairly memorable even in camden lock market minshall they both said was someone they definitely would have remembered barbara realised that the tree of wendys cloud was not going to produce no matter how she attempted its pollination she returned the efits to her shoulder bag and left the two sisters to close up for the day pausing on the pavement outside to light up a fag and consider her next move late afternoon and she could have gone home but she had another route to explore she hated the fact that all she kept turning down was one dead end after another so she made her decision and went for her car it was no great distance from camden lock to wood lane and she could always go from there to the holmes street police station to see what more she could rattle out of barry minshall if things came to that she made her way north to highgate hill doing a bit of ratrunning in order to avoid the rush hour it took her less time than shed anticipated and from there it was easy enough to negotiate the route to archway road she made one stop prior to taking herself to wood lane a call to the incident room gleaned her the name of the estate agent who was selling the vacant flat in walden lodge that shed heard about from one of the murder squads meetings in the nostoneleftunturned category she knew that he was probably a pebble with nothing beneath it but she went there anyway and had a word with the bloke waving her efits in his direction for good measure sod bloody all on a toasted tea cake was what she got for the effort she felt like a girl guide selling biscuits in front of a weight watchers meeting there wasnt a taker anywhere she went on to wood lane there she found the street crowded with cars parked its entire length these would be the vehicles of commuters who drove in to town from the northern counties and parked to take the underground for the rest of the journey among them the police were still searching for someone who had seen something in the early morning hours of the day that davey bentons body had been found beneath the windscreen wiper of each car a handout was tucked and barbara assumed it was this that asked for additional information from the daily commuters for what it was worth perhaps a lot perhaps nothing at all at walden lodge a descending drive led in the direction of an underground carpark barbara pulled her mini into this drive she was blocking access but that couldnt be helped when she climbed the front steps of the squat brick structureso out of place in a street of otherwise historical buildingsshe found that the front door was propped open a yellow bucket of water held it so and the moppits was printed in red upon this so much for security barbara thought she entered the building and called out a hello a young man popped his head round the first corner he had a mop in hand and he wore a tool belt from which cleaning implements dangled officially one of the moppits barbara concluded as above her in the building someone began hoovering help you the young man inquired hitching up his tool belt not sposed to let anyone in barbara showed him her identification she was working on the queens wood murder she told him he told her hastily that he knew nothing about that he and his wife were merely a mobile cleaning service they didnt live here they came in once a week to do the sweeping mopping hoovering and dusting of the common areas and the windows as well but only four times a year and today wasnt one of those days it was too much information but barbara put that down to nerves a cop pops up on someones horizon and suddenly everything can be open to interpretation best explain your life down to the minutest detail she had the flat number of the gent whod seen the light flashing in the woods in the early morning hours when daveys body had been found she had his name as well berkeley pears which sounded like a brand of tinned fruit to her she told the moppit where she was heading and went for the stairs to seek him out when she knocked on his door a dog began yapping behind it it was the kind of yapping she associated with a terrier in need of discipline and she wasnt disabused of this notion when four different locks were released and the opening door allowed a jack russell to charge forward intent upon her ankles she pulled back and raised her bag to club the animal off but mr pears appeared in the terriers wake he blew on something that made no noise but the dog apparently heard it heor was it shedropped to the floor at once panting happily as if a job had been well done excellent pearl pears told the loathsome beast good dog treaties pearl wagged her tail shes supposed to do that barbara said its the startle factor the dogs owner replied i couldve clubbed her she couldve been hurt shes fast shedve had you before you had her he widened the door and said bowl pearl now the dog dashed inside presumably to wait by her dish for a reward cn i help you berkeley pears then asked barbara how did you get into the building i thought you were management were set to fight a legal battle over this and shes trying to intimidate us out of it police barbara showed him her id dc barbara havers could i have a word thiss about the boy in the woods ive already told them what little i know yeah got it but another set of ears you never know whats going to turn up very well he said come in if you must pearliethis in the direction of the kitchencome darling the dog trotted out bright eyed and friendly as if she hadnt been a nasty little killing machine only moments before she jumped into her masters arms and stuck her nose in the breast pocket of his tattersall shirt he chuckled and dug in another pocket for her treat which she swallowed without chewing berkeley pears was a type there was no doubt of it barbara thought he probably wore patentleather shoes and an overcoat with a velvet collar when he left his digs you saw his kind occasionally on the tube they carried furled umbrellas which they used as walking sticks they read the financial times as if it meant something to them and they never looked up till they reached their destination he showed her into his sitting room threepiece suite in position coffee table arranged with copies of country life and a treasures of the uffizi art book modern lamps with metal shades at precise angles suitable for reading nothing was out of place in here and barbara assumed nothing dared to bealthough three noticeable yellowish stains on the carpet gave testimony to at least one of pearls less than salubrious canine activities pears said i wouldntve seen a thing you understand if it hadnt been for pearl and youd think id get a thankyou for that but all ive heard is the dog must go as if cats are less of a botherhe said cats the way others said cockroacheswhen all the time that creature in number five howls morning and night like its being skewered siamese well what else would you expect she leaves the little beast for weeks while ive never left pearl for so much as an hour not an hour mind you but does that count no one night when she barks and i cant quieten her quick enough and that is it someone complainsas if they dont all have contraband animals the lot of themand i get a visit from management no animals allowed the dog must go well we intend to fight them to the very death i tell you pearl goes i go that barbara thought might have been the master plan she wedged her way into the conversation what did you see that night mr pears what happened pears took the sofa where he cradled the terrier like a baby and scratched her chest he indicated the chair for barbara he said i assumed it was a breakin at first pearl beganone can only describe it as hysterical she was simply hysterical she woke me from a perfectly sound sleep and frightened me to bits she was flinging herselfbelieve me there is no other word for itat the balcony doors and barking like nothing ive ever heard from her before or since so you can see why what did you do he looked marginally embarrassed i ratherwell i armed myself with a carving knife which was all i had i went to the doors and tried to see out but there was nothing i opened them and thats what caused the trouble because pearl went outside on the balcony and continued barking like a shedevil and i couldnt get a grip on her and keep hold of the knife so it all took a bit of time and in the woods there was a light a few flashes its all i saw here let me show you the balcony opened off the sitting room its large sliding window covered by a set of blinds pears raised these and opened the door pearl scrambled from his arms onto the balcony and commenced barking much as described she yapped at an earpiercing volume barbara could understand why the other residents had complained a cat was nothing in comparison with this pears grabbed the jack russell and held her snout she managed to bark anyway he said the light was over there through those trees and down the hill it has to have been when the bodywell you know and pearl knew it she could sense it thats the only explanation pearl darling that is enough pears stepped back inside the flat with the dog and waited for barbara to do likewise for her part though barbara remained on the balcony the woods began to dip down the hillside directly behind walden lodge she saw but that would be something one would not know from looking at the lodge from the street the trees grew in abundance here offering what would be a thick screen in summer but what was now a crosshatching of branches bare in midwinter directly below them and right up to the brick wall that defined the edge of the lodges property shrubbery grew unrestrained making access from walden lodge into the woods a virtual impossibility a killer would have had to thrash through everything from holly to bracken in order to get from here to the spot where the body had been dumped and no killer worth his saltlet alone a bloke whod so far managed to eliminate six youths and leave virtually no evidence behind when he dumped their bodieswould have attempted that he would have deposited a treasure trove of useful clues in his wake and he hadnt done so barbara stood there thoughtfully surveying the scene she considered everything that berkeley pears had told her nothing hed reported was out of place but there was one detail that she didnt quite understand she reentered the flat pulling the balcony door closed behind her she said to pears there was a cry of some sort heard sometime after midnight from one of the flats weve had that information from the interviews weve done with all the residents in this building youve not mentioned it he shook his head i didnt hear it what about pearl what about her if she heard the disturbance in the woods at this distance i suggest she sensed it rather than heard it pears corrected all right well say she sensed it but then why didnt she sense something wrong in the building round midnight when someone cried out possibly because no one did yet someone heard it round midnight what dyou make of that a desire to help the police a dream a mistake something that didnt happen because if it did and if it was out of the ordinary pearl would have reacted good grief you saw how she was with you thats how she always is when theres a knock at the door under some conditions what would those be if she doesnt know whos on the other side and if she does know if she hears a voice or smells a scent and recognises it then she makes no noise which was why you see her barking at three fortyfive in the morning was so unusual because if she doesnt bark it means she knows what shes seeing hearing or smelling thats right pears said but i dont actually see what this has to do with anything constable havers thats okay in the scheme of things mr pears barbara said fact is i do chapter twentyseven ultimately ulrike decided to soldier on she had little choice upon her return from brick lane jack veness had handed her the telephone message from patrick bensley president of the board of trustees with a knowing smirk hed said have a good meeting with the prez did you as hed passed her the slip of paper and shed said yes it went very well before lowering her gaze to see upon the phone message the name of the man whom shed claimed she was leaving colossus to meet she didnt try to pretend anything she was too caught up in trying to decide what to do with the information she had from arabella strong to quickstep into giving jack a reason why mr bensley had phoned her while she was supposedly meeting him so she merely folded the message into her pocket and leveled a look at jack she said anything else and endured yet another insufferable smirk nothing at all he told her so she decided she had to continue no matter what it looked like to the police and no matter how they might react if she handed over information to them she still had the hope that the met would respond in a quid pro quo fashion defined by keeping any mention of colossus away from the press but it didnt really matter whether they did or did not because regardless now she had to finish what shed started that was the only way she was going to be able to excuse her journey to griffin strongs house should the board of trustees get wind of it from someone as far as griff himself wentas far as arabellas vow to lie for him wentulrike didnt want to dwell on this and jacks reactions gave her a reason not to they moved him directly to the top of her list she didnt bother with an excuse when she left colossus a second time late in the day instead she took up her bicycle and headed along the new kent road jack lived in grange walk which opened off tower bridge road less than ten minutes by bicycle from elephant and castle it was a narrow oneway street across from bermondsey square one side of it comprised a newish housing estate while the other bore a terrace of homes that had probably stood in the spot since the eighteenth century jack had rooms in one of these houses number a building distinguished by its fanciful shutters painted blue to match the rest of the woodwork on the sooty building they had heartshaped openings at the top to let in the light when they were closed and secured they were open now and the windows that they would otherwise cover were hung with lace curtains looking several layers thick there was no bell so ulrike used the door knocker which was shaped like an oldtime cinecamera to compensate for the noise from tower bridge road she applied some force to the knocking when no one answered she bent to the brass letter box in the middle of the door and lifted it to peer inside the house she saw an old lady lowering herself carefully down the stairs twostepping it sideways and with both hands on the railing the woman evidently saw ulrike peering in for she shouted i do beg your pardon and she followed this with i believe this is a private residence whoever you are which prompted ulrike to drop the hinged lid on the letter box and wait chagrined for the door to open when it did she found herself confronted by a crumpled and very peeved face this was framed by tight white curls and along with her thinframed body they shook with indignation or so it seemed at first until ulrike dropped her gaze and saw the zimmer frame to which the old lady held then she realised it wasnt so much anger as it was palsy or parkinsons or something else that was causing the tremors she apologised hastily and introduced herself she mentioned colossus she said jacks name could she have a word with mrs she hesitated who the hell was this woman she wondered she should have sussed that one out before barreling over here mary alice atkinsward the old lady said and it was miss and proud to be so thank you very much she sounded stiffa pensioner who remembered the old days when people had manners defined by courteous queues at bus stops and gentlemen giving up seats to ladies on the underground she held the door open and manoeuvred herself back from it so that ulrike could enter ulrike did so gratefully she found herself immediately in a narrow corridor much taken up by the stairway the walls were jammed with photos and as miss awwhich was how ulrike began thinking of herled the way into a sitting room overlooking the street ulrike took a peek at these they were she found all photos taken from television shows bbc costume dramas mostly although there were also a smattering of gritty police programmes as well she said in as friendly a fashion as she could youre a fan of the telly miss aw cast a scornful look over her shoulder as she crossed the sitting room and deposited herself in a ladderbacked wooden rocking chair sans a single softening cushion what in heavens name are you talking about the photos in the corridor ulrike had never felt so out of step with someone those i wrote them you ninny was miss aws retort wrote wrote im a screenwriter for heavens sake those are my productions now what do you want she offered nothing no food no drink no fondly reminiscent conversation she was a tough old bird ulrike concluded it was going to be no easy feat to pull the wool here nonetheless she had to try there was no alternative she told the woman that she wanted to have a few words about her tenant what tenant miss aw asked jack veness ulrike prompted her he works at colossus im hiswell his supervisor i suppose hes not my tenant hes my greatnephew worthless little bugger but he had to live somewhere once his mum chucked him out he helps with the housework and the shopping she adjusted herself in her chair see here im going to have a cigarette missy i hope youre not one of those flagwaving ashers if you are too bad my house my lungs my life hand me that book of matches please no no you ninny not over there theyre right in front of you ulrike found them among the clutter on a coffee table the book was from a park lane hotel where ulrike imagined miss aw had doubtless terrified the staff into handing matches over by the gross she waited till the old lady had extracted a cigarette from the pocket of her cardigan she smoked unfilteredno surprise thereand she held the burning fag like an oldtime film star she picked a piece of tobacco from her tongue examined it and flicked it over her shoulder so whats this about jack she asked were considering him for promotion ulrike replied with what she hoped was an ingratiating smile and before someones promoted we talk to those people who know him best why do you suppose i know him any better than you do well he does live hereits just a starting point you understand miss aw was watching ulrike with the sharpest eyes she had ever seen this was a lady whod been through it she reckoned lied to cheated on stolen from whatever it must have come from working in british television notorious home of the thoroughly unscrupulous only hollywood was meant to be worse she continued to smoke and evaluate ulrike clearly unbothered by the silence that stretched between them finally she said what sort i beg your pardon no you dont she said what sort of promotion ulrike did some quick thinking were opening a branch of colossus across the river the north london branch he may have told you about it wed like jack to be an assessment leader there would you now well he doesnt want that he wants community outreach and id expect youd know that if youd talked to him about it yes well ulrike improvised theres a hierarchy involved as jacks no doubt mentioned we like to place people where we think theyllwell blossom actually jacks probably going to work his way up to community outreach eventually but as for now she made a vague gesture miss aw said hell be in a snit about that when he hears hes like that sees himself persecuted well his mum didnt help with that any did she but why cant you young people just get on with things instead of sniveling when you dont get what you want when you want it thats what id like to know she cupped her hand and flicked ash into it she rubbed this into the arm of her rocking chair what does this assessment leader do ulrike explained the job and miss aw picked up on the most relevant part young people she said working with them to build trust not exactly up jacks street id suggest you move right along to another employee if thats what you want but if you tell him i said that ill call you a filthy liar why ulrike asked perhaps too quickly what would he do if he knew we were talking miss aw dragged in on her cigarette and let out what smoke wasnt otherwise adhering to her doubtless blackened lungs ulrike did her best not to breathe in too deeply the old lady seemed to consider what she wanted to say because she was silent for a moment before she settled on he can be a good enough boy when he sets his mind to it but he generally has his mind on other things such as such as himself such as his lot in life just like everyone else his age miss aw gestured with her cigarette for emphasis young people are whingers and thats the boys problem in a teacup missy to hear him talk youd think hes the only child on earth who grew up without a dad and with a looseknickered mum whos flitted from man to man since the boy was born since before that as a matter of fact from the womb jack was probably listening to her try to recall the name of the last bloke she slept with so how could it be a surprise to anyone that he turned out bad bad come now you know what he was he went to colossus from borstal for heavens sake minthats his mumsays its all to do with her never being quite sure which lover was actually his dad she says why cant the lad just cope i do but thats min for you blaming anyone and anything before shed ever take a real look at herself she chased men all her life and jack chased trouble by the time he was fourteen min couldnt cope with him any longer and her mum didnt want to so they sent him to me until that arson nonsense stupid little sod how do you get on with him ulrike asked we live and let live whichs how i get on with everyone missy what about with others what about what about his friends does he get on with them theyd hardly be friends if he didnt get on with them would they miss aw pointed out ulrike smiled yes well dyou see them much why dyou want to know well because obviouslyjacks interactions with them indicate how hed interact with others you see and thats what were no i dont see miss aw said tartly if youre his superior you see him interacting all the time you interact with him yourself you dont need my opinion on the matter yes but the social aspects of ones life can reveal what she thought she couldnt come up with an answer so she cut to the chase does he go out with friends for instance in the evenings pubbing or the like miss aws sharp eyes narrowed a degree she said carefully he goes out as much as the next lad every night what on earth difference does it make she was sounding more and more suspicious but ulrike plunged on and is it always the pub are you asking if hes a dipso misswho ellis ulrike ellis and no its not about that but hes said hes in the pub every night so if thats what hes said thats where he is but you dont believe that i dont see how it matters he comes and he goes i dont keep tabs on him why should i sometimes its the pub sometimes its a girlfriend sometimes its his mum when theyre on good terms which happens whenever min wants him to do something for her but he doesnt tell me and i dont ask and what i want to know is why youre asking has he done something so he doesnt always go to the pub can you recall any time recently when he didnt when he went somewhere else like to his mums where does she live by the way at this ulrike saw shed gone too far miss aw heaved herself to her feet cigarette dangling from her lips ulrike thought fleetingly of the word broad as applied to women by american tough guys in old blackandwhite films that was what miss aw was a broad to be reckoned with the old lady said see here youre prowling round for information and dont pretend this is anything but a fishing expedition im not a fool so you can lift your tight little bum off that sofa and leave my house before i call the police and ask them to assist you in the act miss atkinsward please if ive upset youits only part of the job ulrike found herself floundering she needed a delicate touch and that was what she was lacking she simply did not possess the machiavellian manner that her position at colossus occasionally required too honest she told herself too up front with people she had to shed that quality or at least be able to shrug it off occasionally for gods sake she needed to practise lying if she was going to acquire any useful information she knew that miss aw would report her visit to jack try as she might she couldnt see how she could avoid that happening unless she hit the old lady over the head with a table lamp and put her in hospital she said if ive offendedused the wrong approachi should have been more delicate with the is there something wrong with your hearing miss aw cut in shaking her zimmer frame for emphasis are you leaving or do i have to take matters a step further and she would ulrike saw that was the insanity of it one had to admire a woman like this shed taken on the world and succeeded owing no one a thing ulrike had no further choice but to hustle herself from the room she did so making noises of apology in the hope they would suffice to keep miss aw from phoning the police or telling jack that his supervisor had come round checking up on him she had little confidence in either of these possibilities actually happening when miss aw threatened she followed through with the proposed action ulrike hurried out of the house and into the street she rued her plan and her ineptitude first griff now jack two down and shot to smithereens two to go and god only knew the mess shed make of them she climbed on her bike and wheeled her way into tower bridge road enough for today she decided she was going home she needed a drink it was fading daylight and the overhead lights were already crisscrossing gabriels wharf when nkata got there the cold was keeping people indoors so aside from the haberdasher sweeping the pavement in front of her fanciful shop no one else hung about most of the shops were still open however and nkata saw that mr sandwich appeared to be one of these despite its posted hours two middleaged white ladies in voluminous aprons seemed to be cleaning behind the counter in crystal moon gigi was waiting for him shed closed for the day but when he knocked on the door she appeared from the back immediately casting a look round as if she expected to be spied upon she came to the door unlocked it and gestured him inside conspiratorially she relocked it behind him what she said made nkata wonder why hed come parsley he said what about it i thought you said come here sergeant you need to understand she urged him over to the till and she indicated the large book open next to it nkata recognised the antique volume from his first visit when gigis gran had been in charge of the place i didnt think anything of it when he came in she said not at first because parsley oilwhich is what he boughthas more than one use see its a bit of a miracle herb diuretic antispasmodic stimulant of the uterine muscles breath freshener if you plant it next to roses it even improves their scent no joking and that doesnt begin to take into account all its uses in cooking so when he bought it i didnt thinkexcept i knew that you had your eye on him didnt i so the more i thought about iteven though he didnt even mention ambergris oili decided to have a look in the book and see what else it might be used for its not like i have them memorised you understand well maybe i ought but there are zillions and its just too much for one brain to hold on to she went behind the counter and swung the herb book round so that he could see it even then she seemed to feel the need to prepare him for what he was about to read she said now it may be nothing and it probably is so you must swear to me you wont tell robbie i rang you about it i have to work next door to him and bad blood between neighbours is the worst so can you promise me you wont tell him about this that you know about the parsley oil i mean and that i told you nkata shook his head f this blokes our killer i cant promise you a thing he told her honestly you got something we can use at someones trial it goes to the cps and they want to interview you as a potential witness thats the truth of it but i dont see how parsley relates to anything so far so i reckon youre the one to decide what you want to tell me bout it she cocked her head at him i like you she said any other cop wouldve lied just then so ill tell you she pointed out the entry for parsley oil in herbal magic it was used for triumph it was also used to drive away venomous beasts sown on good friday the plant itself would nullify wickedness its power was in its root and its seeds but that wasnt all aromatic oil nkata read fatty oil balsam medicinal culinary incense and perfume nkata pulled thoughtfully at his chin interesting as it was he didnt see how they could use any of this data well gigis voice bore a lowwattage undercurrent of excitement what dyou think was i right to ring you he hadnt been in in ages see and when he walked into the shop iwell to be honest i nearly bricked it i didnt know what he was likely to do so i tried to act like everything was normal but i watched him and i kept waiting for him to go for the ambergris oil in which case i spose i mightve passed out on the spot then when he bought the parsley oil instead like i said i didnt think too much about it till i read this stuff about triumph and demons and evil and she shuddered i just knew i had to tell you because if i didnt and if something happened to someone somewhere and if it turned out robbies thenot that i think he is for a minute and god you must never tell him cause weve even had drinks together like i told you before nkata said you got a copy of the receipt and all that oh absolutely gigi told him he paid cash and the oil was the only thing he bought ive got the till copy right here and she rang up something on the till to open it whereupon she pulled up the tray that held the notes separate from one another and from beneath this she took a slip of paper which she handed over to nkata shed written rob kilfoyles purchase of parsley oil on this shed underlined parsley oil twice nkata wondered how they could possibly make use of the fact that one of their suspects had purchased parsley oil but he took the receipt from gigi and folded it inside his leather notebook he thanked the young woman for her vigilance and told her to be in touch with him should robbie kilfoyleor anyone elsestop in for ambergris oil he was about to leave when the thought struck him so he paused in the doorway to ask her a final question any chance he nicked the ambergris oil while he was in here she shook her head she hadnt taken her eyes off him once she assured nkata there was no way hed taken anything that hed not presented to her and paid for no way at all nkata nodded thoughtfully at this but he wondered all the same he left the shop and stood outside casting a look towards mr sandwich where the two aproned women were still at work a closed sign now hung in the window he took out his police identification and went to the door there was one possibility for the parsley oil that he needed to check out when he knocked they looked up the plumper of the two women was the one who opened the door to him he asked her if he could have a word and she said yes of course do come in officer they were just about to go home for the day and he was lucky to catch them still at it he stepped inside at once he saw the large yellow cart parked in a corner mr sandwich was painted neatly on it along with a cartoon figure of a filled baguette with crusty face top hat spindly arms and legs this would be robbie kilfoyles delivery cart kilfoyle himself along with his bicycle would be long gone for the day nkata introduced himself to the two women who told him in turn they were clara maxwell and daughter val this bit of information was something of a surprise since the two looked more like sisters than they did parent and child a circumstance caused not so much by claras youthful looksof which there were none to speak ofas by vals dowdy dress sense and drooping figure nkata adjusted to the information and nodded in a friendly fashion in return val kept her distance behind the counter where she did as much lurking as she did cleaning her glance kept shifting from nkata to her mother and back again while clara established herself as spokeswoman for the two cn i have a word with you bout robbie kilfoyle nkata asked he works for you right clara said hes not in trouble as a statement of fact and cast a look at val who nodded in apparent agreement with this remark he delivers your sandwiches int that the case yes has done forwhat is it val three years four val nodded again her eyebrows knotted as if in a display of concern she turned away and went to a cupboard from which she took a broom and dustpan she began using this on the floor behind the counter must be nearly four years then clara said lovely young man he carries the sandwiches round to our clientswe do crisps pickles and pasta salads as welland he returns with the cash hes never been out by so much as ten pence val looked up suddenly her mother said oh yes id forgotten thank you val there was that one time wasnt there what time shortly before his mum died this would have been december year before this last one we were ten pounds short one day turned out hed borrowed them to buy mum flowers she was in a home you know clara tapped her skull alzheimers poor soul he took heri dont knowtulips would thereve been tulips at that time of year perhaps something else anyway vals right id forgotten about that but he confessed straightaway when i asked him about it didnt he and i had the money in my hand the very next day after that nothing hes been good as gold we couldnt run the business without him because mainly what we do is delivery and theres no one but rob to do it val looked up from her sweeping once again she brushed a lank lock of hair from her face now you know thats the truth clara chided her gently you couldnt make those deliveries no matter what you think dear does he buy supplies for you as well nkata asked what kind of supplies paper bags and such mustard wrapping for the sandwiches no we mostly have all that delivered i had in mindprhaps ingredients nkata said he ever get parsley oil for you parsley clara looked at val as if to register her level of incredulity parsley oil you say i never knew there was such a thing of course i suppose there must be mustnt there walnut oil sesame oil olive oil peanut oil why not parsley oil as well but no hes never bought it for mr sandwich i wouldnt know what to do with it val made a sound something like gurgling her mother hearing this leaned over the counter and spoke directly into her face did she know something about parsley oil and robbie clara inquired if she did dearest then she needed to tell the policeman straightaway vals glance went to nkata she said nuffink which was the extent of her intelligible comments during the entire interview nkata said i spose he could be using it for cooking or for his breath hows his breath clara laughed its nothing ive ever noticed but i daresay our vals got close enough for a whiff now and then how is it darling nice bad what val scowled at her mother and skulked off into what seemed to be a storeroom clara said to nkata that her daughter had a bit of a crush not that anything could come of it naturally the sergeant had probably noticed that val had a few problems with her social skills id thought robbie kilfoyle might be just the ticket to bring her out of herself clara confided in a lower voice which is part of the reason i hired him hed never had much of an employment recordthats owing to the mum being ill for so longbut i rather saw that as something of an advantage in the romance department wouldnt have his sights set so high i thought not like other lads for whom val lets face it poor love wouldnt exactly be a prize but nothing came of it no spark between them you see then when his mum passed on i thought hed come round a little bit but he never did the life just went out of the lad she glanced back in the direction of the storage room and then added quietly depression it will do you in if you arent careful i felt it myself when vals dad died it wasnt sudden of course so at least i had some time to prepare but you feel it all the same when someones gone dont you theres that void and theres no getting round it youre staring into it all day long val and i opened this shop because of it because of her dads dying he left us well enough off i mean with enough to get by on but one cant sit home and stare at the walls one has to keep living she paused and untied her apron as she folded it carefully and laid it on the top of the counter she nodded as if shed just revealed something to herself you know i think ill have a word with our robbie about that very subject life must go on she cast a last furtive look at the storage room and shes a good cook our val thats not something a young man of marriageable age ought to turn his nose up at just because shes the quiet typeafter all whats more important at the end of the day conversation or good food good food correct wont get an argument from me nkata said clara smiled really most men like to eat he told her exactly she said and he realised shed begun looking at him with entirely new eyes which told him it was time to thank her for her information and to depart he didnt want to think of what his mum would say if he showed up at home with a val on his arm i want an explanation were the assistant commissioners words to lynley as he walked through the door he hadnt waited for harriman to announce him instead allowing a simple and terse is he in here to precede him into the office lynley was seated behind his desk comparing forensic reports on davey benton with those from the killings that had gone before his he set the paperwork aside took off his reading spectacles and stood dee said you wanted to speak to me he motioned towards the conference table at one side of the room hillier didnt accept that wordless invitation he said ive had a talk with mitch corsico superintendent lynley waited hed known how likely it was that this would come once he thwarted corsicos intentions of doing a story on winston nkata and he understood the workings of hilliers mind well enough to realise he had to let the assistant commissioner have his say explain yourself hilliers words were regulated and lynley had to give him credit for descending into enemy territory with the intention of holding on to his temper as long as he could he said st james has an international reputation sir the fact that the met is pulling out all the stops on this investigationby bringing in an independent specialist to be part of the team for examplewas something i thought should be highlighted that was your thought was it hillier said in brief yes when i considered how far a profile of st james could go to boost public confidence in what were doing that wasnt your decision to make lynley went doggedly on and when i compared that increase in confidence with what could be gained by profiling winston nkata instead so you admit you moved to block access to nkata then it seemed likely that we could make more political hay from letting the public know weve an expert witness on our team than we could make by putting a black officer on display and washing his dirty linen in public corsico had no intention he went straight to questions about winstons brother lynley cut in it sounded to me as if hed even been briefed on the subject so hed know what angle he ought to take when he wrote the interview sir hilliers face took on deep colour it rose from his neck like a ruby liquid just beneath his skin i dont want to think what youre implying lynley made an effort to speak calmly sir let me try to be clear youre under pressure im under pressure the publics stirred up the press is brutal somethings got to be done to mould opinion out thereim aware of thatbut i cant have a tabloid journalist sniffing round the background of individual officers youre not going to be naying or yeaing decisions made above your head do you understand ill be doing whatever naying or yeaing is necessary and ill be doing it every time something occurs that could affect the job done by one of my men a story on winstonfeaturing his pathetic brother because you and i know the source was intending to put harold nkatas face right there next to winstonscain and abel esau and jacob the unreturned and unreturnable prodigalwhatever you want to call himand a story on winston just at the moment when hes already got to contend with being on public display at press conferencesits just not on sir are you daring to tell me that you know better than our own people how to manage the press that youspeaking no doubt from the great height you alone happen to occupy sir lynley didnt want to get into mudslinging with the ac desperately he sought another direction winston came to me asking you to intervene not at all hes a team player but he mentioned that corsico was going after the good brotherbad brother angle on the story and his concerns were that his parents i dont care about his god damn parents hilliers voice rose precipitately hes got a story and i want it told i want it seen i want that to happen and i want you to ensure that it does i cant do that you bloody well wait ive said it wrong i wont do that and lynley went on before hillier had a chance to respond telling himself to stay calm and to stay on message sir it was one thing for corsico to dig round about me he did it with my blessing and he can go on doing it if thats what itll take to help our position here at the met but its another thing for him to do that to one of my men especially one who doesnt want that happening to himself or to his family ive got to respect that so do you he knew he shouldnt have said that last even as his lips formed the words it was just the remark hillier had apparently been waiting for youre god damn out of order he roared thats your way of seeing it mine is that winston nkata doesnt want to be part of a publicity campaign designed to soothe the very people whove been betrayed by the met time and again i dont blame him for that i also wont fault him nor will i order him to cooperate if the source intends to smear his familys trouble across the front page some morning then its thats enough hillier was teetering on the edge whether what he fell into was rage a seizure or an action they both would regret remained to be seen you god damn bloody disloyal piece ofyou come in here from a life of privilege and you dareyou bloody well dareyou to tell me they both saw harriman at the same time standing white faced in the doorway that had been left open when hillier entered no doubt lynley thought every ear on the floor was being assaulted by the strength of the animosity that the ac felt for him and he for the ac hillier shouted at her get the hell out of here whats wrong with you and made a move to the door likely to slam it in harrimans face incredibly she put out a hand to stop him doing just that as they both reached for the door at once he said ill see you in which she interrupted with sir sir i need to speak to you lynley saw unbelievably that she was talking not to him but to hillier the womans gone mad he thought she means to intervene he said dee thats not necessary she didnt look at him she said it is with her eyes fixed on hillier it is necessary sir please the last word came from somewhere in her throat where it caught and seemed nearly to lodge that got through to hillier he grabbed her by the arm and took her from the room then things moved both quickly and incomprehensibly there were voices outside his office and lynley headed for the door to see what in gods name was going on he got only two steps in that direction though when simon st james came into the room st james said tommy and lynley saw saw and somehow understood without wanting to begin to understand or to give st jamess purpose in his officearriving unannounced to him but certainly announced and fully forewarned to harriman he heard a cry of oh my god from somewhere st james flinched at this his eyes lynley saw were fixed upon him what is it lynley asked whats happened simon you must come with me tommy st james said helens then he faltered lynley would always remember thatthat his old friend faltered when it came to the momentand he would always remember what the faltering meant about their friendship and about the woman whom both of them had loved for years shes been taken to st thomas hospital st james said his eyes reddened at the rims and he cleared his throat harshly tommy you must come with me at once chapter twentyeight outside berkeley pears flat barbara havers considered her next move it appeared to be a nice little visit with barry minshall in the holmes street station to see what else she could scoop out of the cesspool that was his brain she was heading off to do just that making her way along the corridor towards the stairs when she heard the sound it was something between a howl and the cry of someone in the throes of death by strangulation and it stopped barbara in her tracks she waited to hear if the cry would repeat itself and in due course it did throaty desperateit took a moment for her to realise that she was listening to a cat bloody hell she murmured it had sounded exactly likeshe attached the sound to the shriek that someone in the building had heard the night of davey bentons murder and when she made that leap she realised that everything about her journey to walden lodge might well have been an exercise in pure futility the cat cried again barbara knew little enough about felines but it sounded like one of those crackedvoice siamese types malevolent little furballs though they were they still had a right furballs barbara looked towards the door behind which the cat sounded another time cat fur she thought cat hair whatever the bloody hell it was thered been cat hair on davey bentons body she went in search of the building manager a question to one of the moppits directed her to a groundfloor flat she knocked on the door after a moment a womans voice called out who is it please in a tone that suggested shed opened the door more than once to an unexpected visitor barbara identified herself several locks were disengaged and the building manager stood before her morag mcdermott she was called what did the police want this time round because god only knew shed told them everything she could think of last time theyd come seeking information about that dreadful nasty business in the woods barbara saw shed interrupted morag mcdermott in the midst of an afternoon snooze despite the time of year she wore a thin dressing gown through which her skeletal body showed and her hair was pancaked on one side the unmistakable pattern of a chenille counterpane had lumped her cheeks like facial cellulite she added sharply how on earth did you get into the building let me see your identification at once barbara fished it out and explained the situation with the front door and the moppits in response to this the building manager pulled a sticky pad from a tabletop nearby and scribbled furiously upon it barbara took this as invitation to enter and she did so as morag mcdermott slapped her note onto the wall next to the door this was already aflutter with two score similar notes the wall resembled a prayer board in a church it was for her monthly report to the management firm morag informed barbara as she replaced the little yellow pad in a drawer now if the constable would step this way into the sitting room she made it sound as if the room in question required directions to get to when in fact it was less than five feet from the front door the flats floor plan was identical to that of berkeley pears but reversed so that it faced not the woods but the street its decor however was utterly dissimilar to the flat barbara had been in earlier where berkeley pears would have passed a drill sergeants inspection morag was a poster child for clutter and sheer bad taste mostly this was due to horses of which there were hundreds on display on every surface in all sizes and of all possible composition from plastic to rubber she was national velvet gone berserk barbara edged her way past a tea stand of lippizaners poised to perform their airs above the ground she trod the sole path available into the room which led to a sofa burdened with perhaps a dozen equine cushions there she deposited herself shed begun to perspire and she understood why the building manager was wearing so thin a dressing gown in the middle of winter it felt like a jamaican summer in the flat and it smelled as if the place hadnt been aired since the day of morags advent in the building cutting to the chase was the best option for personal survival barbara concluded so she went directly to the subject of the cat shed been about to leave the building she said when shed heard the sound of an animal in distress she wondered if morag ought to know about that it certainly soundedto her admittedly unschooled ears since shed never owned anything more than a gerbilserious a siamese cat perhaps she added helpfully this would be in flat number thats mandy morag mcdermott told her promptly esthers cat shes on holiday i mean esther of course not the cat shell quiet soon enough when esthers boy comes to feed her theres nothing for you to worry about worry for the animal was the last thing on barbaras mind but she went with the flow of the conversation she needed to get inside that flat and she didnt want to wait for a warrant to do it mandy sounded dead frantic she told the building manager solemnly true she didnt know much about felines but she thought the situation wanted checking into and by the way berkeley pears had told her that cats werent allowed in the building had he been playing fast and loose with the truth that man will say anything morag replied of course cats are allowed in the building cats fish and birds but not dogs he knew that before he moved in constable barbara nodded yes well people and their animalsit took all kinds didnt it she brought morag round to flat number once again this catmandy she soundswell is there any chance the son hasnt come round to feed her for a while have you seen him here entering or leaving morag thought about this drawing the neck of her dressing gown more tightly closed at her throat she admitted that she hadnt exactly seen the son in the vicinity lately but that didnt mean he hadnt been there he was completely devoted to his mum everyone should have such a son nonethelessbarbara offered a smile she hoped was ingratiating perhaps they ought to have a look for the sake of the cat something could have happened to prevent the son from coming round couldnt it car crash heart attack kidnap by aliens at least one of barbaras suggestions seemed to work because morag nodded thoughtfully and said yes perhaps we ought to see before she went over to a corner cupboard and opened it to reveal the back of its door covered with hooks from which keys dangled still attired in her dressing gown morag led the way to flat number there was silence behind the door and for a moment barbara thought that her ruse to get inside was going to fail but as morag said i dont actually hear mandy howled cooperatively once more with an oh my dear the building manager hastily unlocked the door and opened it the cat escaped like a lag given an unexpected opportunity she melted round the corner of the corridor going for the stairs and doubtless heading for the freedom of the front door which the moppits still had propped open this would not do morag took off after her barbara stepped inside the flat the first thing she noted was the overpowering smell of urine cat urine she assumed no one had changed the poor creatures litter for days the windows were closed and the curtains drawn over them which greatly exacerbated the matter it was no wonder the cat had bolted for the outdoors anything to get a breath of fresh air barbara closed the door despite the odour the better to give herself warning when morag returned and would have to insert the key in the lock another time that done the flat was even gloomier so she opened the curtains and saw that flat number like that of berkeley pears faced the woods at the back of the property she turned from the window and surveyed the room the furniture came to her straight out of the sixties vinyl sofa and chairs side tables once called danish modern coy figurines in the shape of animals with anthropomorphic expressions on their faces bowls of potpourriostensibly attempting to rid the air of the foetid odour of catsat on lacy antimacassars that were now being used as mats barbara saw those last with a rush of happiness kimmo thornes loincloth in st georges gardens things were definitely looking up she prowled round for signs of recent occupationof deadly occupationand she found the first of them in the kitchen one plate one fork one glass in the sink did you feed him something before you raped him then you bugger or did you have a bit of sustenance yourself while the kid entertained you with one more magic trick which you applauded and for which you told him you had a very nice reward come over closer to me davey my lad god but youre a lovely boy did anyone ever tell you that no why not its plain to see on a floor in the corner the cats dry food spilled out of a container and a large bowl next to it was empty of water using a dishcloth to hold it by its edges barbara carried this to the sink and filled it wasnt the cats fault she told herself no point in letting it suffer any longer and suffer mandy had done since the night of davey bentons murder there was no way in hell that the killer could have afforded to return to this place once davey was dead not with the street crawling with cops intent upon finding a witness she went from the kitchen back into the sitting room looking for signs hed have raped and strangled davey benton somewhere in here but the rest he would have done when he got the body into the woods she went to the bedroom where as she had done in the sitting room she opened the curtains and turned back to survey the scene illuminated by the fastfading daylight a bed with covers and counterpane in place side table with an oldfashioned windup alarm clock and lamp chest of drawers with two framed photos sitting on top it all looked so ordinary save for one detail the clothescupboard door hung partially open inside barbara could see a flowery dressing gown askew on a hanger she took it out the belt was missing let me show you how to do a knot trick hed said and barbara could hear his coaxing voice its the only trick that i know davey and believe me itll make your mates stand up and take notice when they see how easily you can escape even if they tie your hands behind your back here you tie me first see how it works now ill tie you something like that she thought something like that he had done it that way and then bent the boy over the bed no shouting davey no wiggling about okay all right dont panic lad ill untie your hands but no trying to get away from me now becausegod damn you scratched me davey you bloody well scratched me and now ill have toi told you not to make a sound didnt i didnt i davey didnt i you miserable filthy little sod or maybe he had used handcuffs on the boy glowinthedark handcuffs just like those that barry minshall had given davey or maybe he hadnt needed to restrain him at all or hadnt thought to restrain him because davey had been so much smaller than the rest of the boys and there had after all been no mark of restraints on his wrists not like the others which gave barbara pause which made her admit how desperately she wanted this place on wood lane to be the answer which told her she was on dangerous ground weaving place to fit circumstance in the worst kind of reckless police work of the sort that landed innocent people in prison because the cops were just so bloody tired and so anxious to get home for supper one night in ten because their wives were complaining and their kids were misbehaving and some serious sorting needed to be done and why did you even marry me frank or john or dick if you meant to be gone day and night for months on end that was how it happened and barbara knew it that was how cops made deadly mistakes she returned the dressing gown to the clothes cupboard and forced her mind to stop painting pictures out in the sitting room she heard morags key scratching at the lock there was no time for anything else but a quick look at the bedsheets beneath the counterpane catching the faint scent of lavender upon them they offered no visible secrets to her so she moved to the chest of drawers on the other side of the room and there it was everything she needed in one of the two photographs a woman posed in her wedding gown with her bespectacled groom in the other a much older version of the same woman stood on brighton pier with her was a younger man he was bespectacled like his father barbara picked this latter picture up and took it over to the window for a better look in the sitting room morags voice called out are you in here constable and mandy gave her siamese yowl in the bedroom barbara murmured bloody hell at what she was looking at hastily she shoved the brighton pier photograph into her shoulder bag she composed herself as best she could and called out sorry having a look round got reminded of my mum she goes for this sixties stuff in a very big way complete casuistry but it couldnt be helped truth was in her present state mum wouldnt know the sixties from a basket of potatoes shed run out of water barbara said helpfully when she joined the building manager in the sitting room the sound of mandy lapping came from the kitchen i refilled her bowl shes got plenty of food though i think shell be set for a while morag gave barbara a shrewd look which suggested she wasnt entirely convinced of the constables heartfelt concern for the cat but she didnt make a move to frisk barbaras person so the end result was a round of farewells after which barbara hotfooted it outside and dug round in her shoulder bag for her mobile it rang just as she was about to punch in the numbers for lynley a scotland yard extension was calling detective conconstable havers dorothea harriman was on the other end she sounded terrible me barbara said dee whats wrong harriman said condetect and barbara realised she was sobbing she said dee dee get a grip for the love of god whats going on its his wife she cried whose wife what wife barbara felt the fear coming upon her in a rush because there was only one wife that she could conceive of in that moment one woman only about whom the departments secretary might be calling her has something happened to helen lynley has she lost her baby dee whats going on shot harriman keened the word the superintendents wife has been shot lynley saw that st james had come to him not in his old mg but in a panda car driven from st thomas hospital with lights flashing and siren blaring he assumed this much because that was how they returned to the other side of the river riding in the back with two grimfaced belgravia constables in the front the entire journey made in a matter of minutes which nonetheless felt like hours to him all the time with traffic parting like red sea waters before them his old friend kept a hand on his arm as if expecting lynley to bolt from the car he said theyve got a trauma team with her theyve given her blood onegative they said its universal but youll know that wont you of course you will st james cleared his throat and lynley looked at him he thought at that moment unnecessarily that st james had once loved helen had so many years ago intended to be her husband himself where lynleys voice was raw simon i told deborahi said that she was to tommy st jamess hand tightened where then where in eaton terrace at home helen was tired they parked the car and unloaded their parcels at the front door deborah took the bentley round to the mews she parked it and when she got back to the house she didnt hear anything see anything she was on the front step at first deborah thought shed fainted lynley raised his hand to his forehead he pressed in on his temples as if this would allow him to understand he said how could she have thought there was virtually no blood and her coathelens coatit was dark is it navy black both of them knew the colour was meaningless but it was something to cling to and they had to cling to it or face the unthinkable black lynley said its black cashmere hanging nearly to her ankles and she loved to wear it with boots whose heels were so high that she laughed at herself at the end of the day when she hobbled to the sofa and fell upon it claiming she was a mindless victim of male italian shoe designers with fantasies of women bearing whips and chains tommy save me from myself she would say only foot binding could be worse than this lynley looked out of the window he saw the blur of faces and knew theyd made it as far as westminster bridge where people on the pavements were caught in their own little worlds into which the sound of a siren and the sight of a panda car zooming by caused them only an instant of wondering who what and then forgetting because it didnt affect them when he said to st james what time half past three theyd thought to have tea at claridges but as helen was tired they went home instead theyd have it there they boughti dont knowtea cakes somewhere pastries lynley tried to absorb this it was four fortyfive he said an hour more than an hour how can that be st james didnt reply at once and lynley turned to him and saw how drawn and gaunt he looked far more than normal for he was a gaunt and angular man by birth he said simon why in gods name more than an hour it took twenty minutes for the ambulance to get to her christ lynley whispered oh god oh christ and then i wouldnt let them tell you by phone we had to wait for a second panda carthe first officers needed to stay at the hospitalto speak to deborah shes there still yes of course so we had to wait tommy i couldnt let them phone you i couldnt do that to you say that helensay that no i see and then he said fiercely after a moment tell me the rest i want to know it all they were calling in a thoracic surgeon when i left they havent said anything else thoracic lynley said thoracic st jamess hand tightened on his arm once again its a chest wound he said lynley closed his eyes and he kept them closed for the rest of the ride which was mercifully brief at the hospital two panda cars stood at the top of the sloping entrance to accident and emergency and two of the uniformed constables who belonged to them were just coming out as lynley and st james entered he saw deborah at once seated on one of the blue steel chairs with a box of tissues on her knees and a middleaged man in a crumpled mackintosh talking to her notebook in hand belgravia cid lynley thought he didnt know the man but he knew the routine two other uniforms stood nearby affording the detective privacy apparently they knew st james by sightas they would since hed already been at the hospital earlierso they let both of them approach the interview that was going on deborah looked up her eyes were red her nose looked sore a pile of sodden tissues lay on the floor next to her feet she said oh tommy and he could see her try to pull herself together he didnt want to think he couldnt think he looked at her and felt like wood the belgravia man stood superintendent lynley lynley nodded shes in the operating theatre tommy deborah said lynley nodded again all he could do was nod he wanted to shake her he wanted to rattle the teeth in her head his brain shouted that it was not her fault how could it be this poor womans fault but he needed to blame he wanted to blame and there was no one else not yet not here not now he said tell me her eyes filled the detectivesomewhere lynley heard him say his name was fireterence fire but that couldnt be right because what sort of name was fire after allsaid that the case was well in hand he was not to worry all stops were being pulled out because the entire station knew not only what had happened but who she was who the victim dont call her that lynley said well be in close contact terence fire said and then sirif i mayi am so terribly yes lynley said the detective left them the constables remained lynley turned to deborah as st james sat next to her what happened he asked her she asked would i park the bentley shed been driving but it was cold and shed got tired youd done too much if you hadnt done too muchthose god damn bloody christening clothes a snaking tear spilled over the rim of deborahs eye she brushed it away she said we stopped and unloaded the parcels she asked me to take care parking the car becauseyou know how tommy loves his car she said if we put a scratch on it hell have us both for dinner watch the left side of the garage she said so i took care id never drivenyou see its so big and it took me more than one try to get it into the garagebut not five minutes tommy not that even and i assumed shed go straight into the house or ring the bell for denton hes gone to new york lynley said unnecessarily he isnt there deborah she didnt tell me i didnt know and i didnt thinktommy its belgravia its safe its no where is god damn safe his voice sounded savage he saw st james stir his old friend raised a hand a warning a request he didnt know nor did he care there was only helen he said im in the middle of an investigation multiple murders a single killer where in the name of heaven did you get the idea any place on earth is safe deborah took the question like a blow st james said his name but she stopped him with a movement of her head she said i parked the car i walked back along the mews you didnt hear i didnt hear a sound i came round the corner back into eaton terrace and what i saw was the shopping bags they were spread on the ground and then i saw her she was crumpledi thought shed fainted tommy there was no one there no one nearby not a single soul i thought shed fainted i told you to be sure no one i know she said i know i know but what was i meant to make of that i thought of flu someone sneezing in her face tommy being a fuss pot husband because i didnt understand dont you see that tommy how would i know because this is helen were talking about and this is belgravia where its supposed to beand a gun why would i ever think of a gun she began to weep in earnest then and st james told her that shed said enough but lynley knew she never could have said enough to explain how his wife how the woman he loved he said what then st james said tommy deborah said no simon please and then to lynley she was on the top step and her door key was in her hand i tried to rouse her i thought shed fainted because there was no blood tommy there was no blood not like what you would think if someone isid never seeni didnt knowbut then she moaned and i could tell something was terribly wrong i phoned triple nine and then i cradled her to keep her warm and thats whenon my hand there was blood i thought id cut myself at first and i looked for where and how but i saw it wasnt me and i thought the baby but her legs helens legsi mean there was no blood where one would thinkand this was a different sort of blood anyway it looked different because i know you see tommy even in his own despair lynley felt hers and that was what finally got through to him she would know what the blood of a miscarriage looked like shed suffered how many he didnt know he sat not next to deborah and her husband but across on the chair that terence fire had been using he said you thought shed lost the baby at first but then i finally saw the blood on her coat high up here she indicated a spot beneath her left breast i phoned triple nine again and i said theres blood theres blood hurry but the police got there first twenty minutes lynley said twenty god damn minutes i phoned three times deborah told him where are they i asked shes bleeding shes bleeding but i still didnt know shed been shot you see tommy if id knownif id told them thatbecause i didnt think not in belgraviatommy who would shoot someone in belgravia lovely wife superintendent the sodding profile in the source complete with photographs of the smiling superintendent of police and his charming wife titled bloke he was not your garden variety sort of cop at all lynley rose blindly he would find him he would find him st james said tommy no let the belgravia police and only then did lynley realise hed said it aloud i cant he said you must youre needed here shell come out of theatre theyll want to speak to you shes going to need you lynley headed in the direction of the door but this apparently was why the uniformed constables had been hanging about they stopped him saying its in hand sir its top priority its well in hand and by that time st james had reached his side as well he said come with me tommy we wont leave you and the kindness in his voice felt like a crushing weight on lynleys chest he gasped for breath for something to cling to he said my god ive got to phone her parents simon how am i going to tell them whats happened barbara found that she couldnt bring herself to leave even as she told herself she wasnt needed and probably wasnt wanted either people milled about everywhere each one of them in a personal hell of waiting helen lynleys parents the earl and countess of whatever because barbara couldnt remember if shed ever heard the title so many generations in their family were huddled in misery and they looked frail more than seventy years old and unprepared to face what they were facing now helens sister penelope rushing in from cambridge with her husband at her side tried to comfort them after herself crying out how is she mum my god how is she wheres cybil is daphne on her way they all were all four of helens sisters including iris on her way from america and lynleys mother was tearing up from cornwall with her younger son while his sister hurried down from yorkshire family barbara thought she was neither needed nor wanted here but she could not bring herself to leave others had come and gone winston nkata john stewart other members of the team uniformed constables and plainclothes officers whom lynley had worked with through the years cops were checking in from stations in every borough in town everyone save hillier had seemed to put in an appearance during the course of the night barbara herself had arrived after the worst sort of journey from north london her car had refused to start at first up on wood lane and shed flooded its engine in a panic trying to get the bloody thing running shed sworn at the car shed vowed to reduce the mini to rubble shed strangled the steering wheel shed phoned for help shed finally got the engine to sputter into life and shed sat on the horn trying to clear traffic out of the way shed got to the hospital just after word had been given to lynley about helens condition shed seen the surgeon come to fetch him and shed watched as hed received the news its killing him shed thought she wanted to go to him to say shed bear the weight of it with him as his friend but she knew she didnt have that right instead she watched as simon st james went to him and she waited until simon had returned to his wife to share with her what he had learned lynley and helens parents disappeared with the surgeon god only knew where and barbara understood that she could not follow so she crossed the room to speak to st james he nodded at her and she was furiously grateful that he did not exclude her or ask why she was there she said how bad is it he took a moment from his expression she prepared herself to hear the worst she was shot beneath the left breast he said his wife leaned into him her face against his shoulder as she listened along with barbara the bullet evidently went through the left ventricle the right atrium and the right artery but there was no blood there was almost no blood deborah spoke into the jacket he was wearing into his shoulder shaking her head how can that happen barbara asked st james her lung collapsed at once st james told her so the blood began filling the cavity that was left in her chest deborah began to cry not a wail not an ululation of grief just a shaking of her body that even barbara could see she was doing her best to control they would have put a tube in her chest when they first saw the wound st james told barbara they would have got blood from it a litre perhaps two they would have known then that they had to go in at once thats what the surgery was they sutured the left ventricle did the same for the artery and the exit wound in the right ventricle the bullet have we got the bullet what happened to the bullet it was under the right scapula between the third and fourth rib we have the bullet so if shes repaired barbara said thats good news isnt it isnt it good news simon she saw him withdraw inside himself then to a place she could not know or imagine he said it took so long to get to her barbara what do you mean so long why he shook his head she sawinexplicablythat his eyes grew cloudy she didnt want to hear the rest then but theyd waded too far into these waters retreat was not an option has she lost the baby deborah was the one to ask the question not yet thank god for that then barbara said so the news is good right she repeated st james said to his wife deborah would you like to sit down stop it she raised her head the poor woman barbara saw looked like someone with a wasting disease she felt barbara realised like shed pulled the trigger on helen herself for a while st james said his voice so low that barbara had to lean in to him to make out his words she had no oxygen what do you mean her brain was deprived of oxygen barbara but now barbara said insistent still shes all right yes what about now shes on a ventilator now fluids of course a heart monitor good thats very good yes it was surely excellent she thought reason to celebrate terrible moment but theyd all passed through it and everything was going to sort itself out right yes say the word yes theres no cortical activity st james said and that means barbara walked away she didnt want to hear more hearing more meant knowing knowing meant feeling and that was the last bloody god damn thingeyes fixed on the lino she paced rapidly out of the hospital into the cold night air and the wind which struck her cheeks so surprisingly that she gasped and looked up and saw them gathered the carrion feeders the journalists not dozens of them not as shed seen them behind the barriers at the shand street tunnel and at the end of wood lane but enough and she wanted to hurl herself at them constable constable havers a word barbara thought it had to be someone from inside the hospital coming out to fetch her with a piece of news so she turned but it was mitchell corsico and he was approaching with his notebook in his hand she said you need to clear out of here you especially youve done enough his brow furrowed as if he couldnt quite make out what she was saying to him you cant think he paused clearly regrouping constable you cant think this has anything to do with the sources story on the superintendent barbara said to him you know what i think get out of my way but how is she is she going to be all right get out of my bloody way she snarled or i wont answer for the consequences chapter twentynine preparations had to be made and he set about them with his usual care he worked quietly he caught himself smiling more than once he even hummed as he measured for the span of a grown mans arms and when he sang he did so quietly because it would be idiocy to take an unnecessary and stupid risk at this point he chose tunes from whoonlyknewwhere and when he finally burst into a mighty fortress is our god he had to chuckle for inside the van it was indeed a fortress a place where he would be safe from the world but the world would never be safe from him the second set of leather restraints he fixed opposite the sliding panel door of the van he used a drill and bolts to do the job and he tested the result with the weight of his body hanging from them as the observer would hang struggling and twisting as the observer would do he was satisfied with the result of his efforts and he went on to catalogue his supplies the cylinder for the stove was full the tape was cut and hanging well within his reach the batteries in the torch were fresh the implements for a souls release were sharp and prepared for use the van had petrol a full supply the body board was perfectly pristine the clothesline ligatures were neatly coiled the oil was in its proper place this would he thought be his crowning achievement oh yes too right you think that do you whered you learn to be such a fool fu used the back of his tongue to change the pressure against his eardrums eliminating the maggots voice for a moment that insidious planting of the seeds of doubt he could hear the whoosh of that pressure changing crinkle and crack against his eardrums and the maggot was gone only to return the instant he ceased the movement of his tongue how longre you planning to occupy space upon the planet was there ever on earth a more useless bit of gobshite than you stand there and listen when im talking to you take it like a man or get out of my sight fu hastened his work escape was the key he left the van and made for safety there was nowhere really where the maggot left him in peace but there were still distractions always had been and always would be he sought them quickly now quickly quickly in the van he used judgement punishment redemption release elsewhere he used more traditional tools do something useful with your time little sod he would he would oh yes he would he made for the television and punched it on raising the volume until everything else might be driven away on the screen he found himself looking at a buildings entrance figures coming and going a female reporters mouth moving and words that he could not connect to meaning because the maggot would not leave his brain eating at the very essence of him you hear me gobshite understand what i say he raised the volume higher still he caught snatches of words yesterday afternoonst thomas hospitalcondition criticalwho is nearly five months pregnantand then he saw him the detective himself witness observer the sight brought fu round and banished the maggot he focussed on the television screen the man lynley was coming out of a hospital he had a uniformed constable on either side of him and they were shielding him from reporters who were shouting questions any connection to do you regret is this in any way related to the story that the source decision to embed a journalist lynley walked through them away beyond he looked like stone the reporter onscreen said something about an earlier news conference and the scene switched to that a surgeon in operating gown stood behind a lectern blinking in the television lights he spoke about the removal of a bullet the repairing of damage a foetus that was moving but thats all they could report at the moment and when questions were asked by the unseen listeners he would say no more merely removing himself from behind the lectern and from the room the scene then went back to outside the hospital where the reporter stood shivering in the mornings wind this is she said gravely the first time that a family member of a police detective has been struck down in the midst of an investigation the fact that this crime should fall so quickly on the heels of a tabloids profile of that same detective and his wife brings into question the wisdom of the earlier and highly irregular scotland yard decision to allow a journalist unprecedented access to a criminal investigation she ended her report but for fu the image of lynley was what stayed with him when the viewer was returned to the television studio where the presenters managed to look suitably grave as they went on with the mornings news whatever they said was lost to him at that point because he saw only the police detective how he walked and where he looked what struck fu the most was that the man was not the least bit wary he had no defence fu smiled he flicked off the television with a snap he listened intently no sound in the house the maggot was gone di john stewart took immediate charge but it seemed to nkata that he was merely going through the motions his mind on other things everyones mind was elsewhere as well either mentally at st thomas hospital where the superintendents wife lay fighting for her life or with the belgravia police who were handling the investigation into her shooting still nkata knew there was only one reasonable way for any of them to proceed and he told himself to keep moving forward because he owed it to lynley to do the job but his heart wasnt in it and this was a bloody damn dangerous place to be how simple a matter it was to let a crucial detail slip when one was in this state because healong with everyone elsewas distracted by an external concern his carefully plotted and altogether irritating multicoloured outline in hand di stewart had made assignments that morning and then began to micromanage every one of them in his inimitable fashion he paced maddeningly round the room and when he wasnt doing that he was liaising with the belgravia police this consisted of demanding to know what progress theyd made on the attack on the superintendents wife in the meantime detectives in the incident room made reports and pcs typed them occasionally someone asked in a hushed voice does anyone know how she is is there any word the word was critical nkata reckoned barb havers would know more but she hadnt put in an appearance so far no one had made mention of this fact so hed concluded barb was either still at the hospital or on an assignment stewart had given her earlier or going her own way in things in which case he wished shed get in touch with him hed seen her briefly at the hospital on the previous night but they hadnt spoken more than to exchange a few terse words now nkata tried to force his thoughts to travel in a productive direction it seemed like days had passed since hed last received an assignment making himself adhere to it was like swimming through refrigerated honey the list of dates for the mabil meetingshelpfully provided by james barty to demonstrate the extent to which his client mr minshall was willing to cooperate with the policecovered the last six months using this list as a jumpingoff point nkata had already spoken to griffin strong by telephone and he had received the mans meaningless assurance that he had been with his wifenever left her side and she would be the first to confirm that sergeantwhenever an alibi was called for so nkata had gone on to talk to robbie kilfoyle whod said he didnt exactly keep records of what he did every night which was little enough since besides watching the telly all he ever did was drop by the othello bar for a pint and perhaps they could confirm that at the bar although he doubted even they would be able to say when hed been in and when hed not from there nkata had conversed with neil greenhams solicitor with neil himself and ultimately with neils mother who said that her lad was a good lad and if he said he was with her whenever he said he was with her then he was with her as for jack veness the colossus receptionist declared that if his greataunt his mate the miller and grindstone pub and the indian takeaway were not good enough to clear his name then the cops could god damn arrest him and have done with it nkata immediately discounted any alibi given by a relative which consequently made griffin strong and neil greenham look good in the role of member of mabil and serial killer the problem for him was that both jack veness and robbie kilfoyle seemed to fit the profile far better this made him in turn decide he needed to have a closer look at the profile document that had been provided for them weeks ago he was about to conduct a search for it in lynleys office when mitchell corsico turned up in the incident room escorted there by a minion of hilliers whom nkata recognised from their earlier press conferences together corsico and the minion had a word with john stewart at which point the minion left for points unknown and the journalist sauntered over to nkata he deposited himself on a chair near the desk where nkata had been studying his notes i got the word from my guv corsico told him hes axed the st james direction sorry sergeant youre my next man nkata looked at him frowning what you crazy after whats happened corsico removed a small tape recorder from his jacket pocket along with a notebook which he flipped open i was set to do that forensic bloke next the expert witness you lot have working outside the yard but the big cheeses over on farringdon street gave the project thumbs down im back to you listen i know you dont like this so im willing to compromise i get inside to talk to your parents i leave harold nkata out of the story sound like a deal to you what it sounded like was a decision made by hillier and his dpa cronies and passed along to corsico whod probably already planted a bug in his editors ear aboutwhat did they call itthe natural angle that a story on winston nkata had human interest they would describe it without a thought where the last human interest tale had got them no ones talking to my mum and dad nkata said no ones putting their pictures in the paper no ones looking them up at home no ones getting inside their flat corsico made an adjustment to the volume on his tape recorder and nodded thoughtfully that does bring us to harold then doesnt it he shot that bloke in the back of the head as i understand made him kneel at the edge of the pavement then put the barrel of the gun to his skull nkata reached for the tape recorder he dropped it onto the floor and slammed his foot into it hey corsico cried i am not responsible you listen to me nkata hissed several heads turned their way nkata ignored them he said to corsico you write your story with or without me i cn see youre set on doing it but my brothers part of it my mums or my dads picture in that paper one word bout loughborough estateand im coming after you unnerstan and i xpect you know enough about me already to get what i mean corsico smiled completely unfazed it came to nkata that this was the reaction the reporter had been seeking he said your speciality was the flick knife as i understand it sergeant you were what fifteen years old sixteen did a knife seem less traceable to you thansaya pistol of the sort your brother used nkata wouldnt take the bait this time he got to his feet this isnt going to be part of my day he told the reporter he slid a pen into his jacket pocket preparatory to heading for lynleys office to get back to what hed intended to do corsico got to his feet as well perhaps with the intention of following but that was when dorothea harriman came into the room looked round for someone and chose nkata she said is detective constable havers not here nkata said whats wrong harriman gave a glance to corsico before she took nkata by the arm she said meaningfully to the reporter if you dont mind some things are personal and she waited until he retreated to the other side of the room then she said simon st james just phoned the superintendents left the hospital hes meant to go home and rest but mr st james thinks he may head here at some point today hes not sure when hes coming back to work nkata couldnt believe this was the case harriman shook her head if he comes here mr st james thinks hell go to the assistant commissioners office he thinks someone needs to she hesitated her voice uncertain she raised a hand to her lips and said in a more determined tone he thinks someone needs to be ready to look after him when he gets here detective sergeant barbara havers cooled her heels in the interview room at the holmes street station while the solicitor serving the interests of barry minshall was rounded up a sympathetic special constable in reception had taken one look at her and said black or white when shed first entered the station now she sat with the coffeewhitein front of her her hands curved round a mug that was shaped into the caricatured visage of the prince of wales she drank without tasting much of the brew her tongue said hot bitter that was it she stared at her hands saw how white her knuckles were and tried to loosen her grip on the mug she didnt have the information she wanted and she didnt like being in the dark shed phoned simon and deborah st james at the most reasonable hour she could manage shed ended up listening to their answer machine so she reckoned theyd either never left the hospital on the previous night or had returned there before dawn to wait for further news about helen deborahs father wasnt in either barbara told herself he was walking the dog shed rung off on the answer machine without leaving a message they had better things to do than phone her with news which she might be able to get in another way but ringing the hospital was even worse mobile phones could not be used inside so she was left having to speak to someone in charge of general information which was no information at all lady ashertons condition was unchanged she was told what did that mean she asked and what about the baby she was carrying there was no reply to this a pause a shuffling of papers and then terribly sorry but the hospital was not allowedbarbara had hung up on the sympathetic voice mostly because it was sympathetic she told herself that work was the anodyne so she gathered her things and left her bungalow at the front of the house however she saw that lights were on in the groundfloor flat she didnt pause to ask the shoulds of herself at the sight of movement behind the curtains covering the french windows she changed direction and crossed to them she knocked without thinking merely knowing that she needed something and that something was real human contact no matter how brief taymullah azhar answered manila folder in one hand and briefcase in the other behind him somewhere in the flat water ran and hadiyyah sang offkey but what did it really matter sometimes well sigh sometimes well cry buddy holly barbara realised she was singing true love ways it made her want to weep azhar said barbara how good to see you im so very gladis something wrong he set down his briefcase and put the manila folder on top of it by the time hed turned back to her barbara had got a better grip on herself he wouldnt necessarily know yet she thought if he hadnt looked at a newspaper and if he hadnt turned on the radio or seen the television reports she couldnt bring herself to talk about helen she said working hard bad night not much sleep she remembered the peace offering shed boughtit seemed like another lifetime to herand she dug round in her shoulder bag till she found it the fivepoundnote trick meant for hadiyyah astound your friends amaze your relations i picked this up for hadiyyah thought she might like to try it out itll take a fivepound note to do it if youve got oneshe wont hurt it or anything at least not when she gets good so in the beginning i spose she could use something else for practice you know azhar looked from the magic trick in its plastic covering back to barbara he smiled and said you are very good to hadiyyah and for hadiyyah this is not something i have told you barbara and i apologise for that let me get her now so that you no the intensity of her word surprised both of them they stared at each other in some confusion barbara knew shed puzzled her neighbour but she also knew she couldnt explain to azhar how the kindness of his words had seemed like a blow from which she felt in sudden danger not from what the words implied but from what her reaction to them told her about herself she said sorry listen ive got to go about a dozen things on my plate and im juggling them all at once this case he said yeah what a way to earn a living eh he observed her dark eyes set in skin the colour of pecans expression grave he said barbara she cut him off ill talk to you later okay despite her need to escape the kindness in his tone though she reached out and clasped his arm through the sleeve of his neat white shirt she could feel the warmth of him and his wiry strength im dead chuffed youre back she said the words coming thickly see you later of course he replied she turned to go but she knew he was watching she coughed and her nose began to run she was god damn falling apart she thought and then the blasted mini wouldnt start it hiccuped and sighed it spoke to her of arteries hardening with oil too long unchanged in its system and she saw that from the french windows azhar was still observing her he took two steps outside and in her direction she prayed and the god of transport listened the engine finally sprang to life with a roar and she reversed down the drive and into the street now she waited in the interview room for barry minshall to give her the word yes was all she required of him yes and she was out of there yes and she was making an arrest the door finally opened she pushed her prince of wales mug to one side james barty preceded his client into the room minshall wore his dark glasses but the rest of him was strictly incarcerationissue garb he needed to get used to it barbara thought barry would be going away for a good many years mr minshall and i are still waiting to hear from the cps his solicitor said by way of prefatory remarks the magistrates hearing was mr minshall and you barbara said ought to be thanking your stars we still need him hanging round this end of town when he gets to remand hes likely to find the company not quite as accommodating as it is here weve been cooperative thus far barty said but you cant expect that cooperation to extend into infinity constable i dont have deals to offer and you know it barbara told him to is dealing with mr minshalls situation your hopeand this to minshall himselfis that those boys in the polaroids we found in your flat enjoyed their experience at your hands so much that they wouldnt dream of testifying against you or anyone else but i wouldnt count on that and anyway face it bar even if those boys dont want to be put through a trial youve still supplied a thirteenyearold to a killer and youre going down for that one if i were in your position id want it known to the cps and everyone else concerned that i started cooperating the moment the rozzers asked my name its only your belief that mr minshall supplied a boy to someone who murdered him barty said that has never been our position right barbara said have it any way you want but the laundry gets wet no matter what order you put it into the machine from her bag she brought out the framed photograph shed taken from flat number in walden lodge she laid it on the table at which they were sitting and she slid it across to minshall he lowered his head she couldnt see his eyes behind the dark glasses but she noted his breathing and it seemed to her he was making an effort to keep it steady she wanted to believe this meant something important but she didnt want to get ahead of herself she let the moments stretch out between them while inside she repeated two words come on come on come on finally he shook his head and she said to him take off your glasses barty said you know that my clients condition makes it shut up barry take off your glasses my eyesight take off your bloody glasses he did so now look at me barbara waited till she could see his eyes grey to the point of altogether colourless she wanted to read the truth in them but even more than that she wanted just to see them and to have him know that she was seeing them at this precise moment no ones saying you handed over any boys in order to get them killed she felt her throat trying to close on the words but she forced herself to say them anyway because if the only way to get him to move in her direction was to lie cheat and flatter she would lie and cheat and flatter with the best of them you didnt do that to davey benton and you didnt do that to anyone else when you left davey with thisthis bloke you expected the game to be played the way it had always been played seduction sodomy i dont know what they didnt tell me what but she broke in because the last thing she could bear was to hear him justify protest deny or excuse she just wanted the truth and she was determined to have it from him before she left the room you didnt mean him to die to be used yes to have some bloke touch him up rape him even no they were never barry his solicitor said you neednt shut up barry you offered those boys for cash to your slimeball mates at mabil but the deal was always sex not murder maybe you had the boys yourself first or maybe you just popped your cork by having all those other blokes depending on you to supply them with new flesh the point is you didnt mean anyone to die but thats what happened and youre either going to tell me that the bloke in this picture is the one who called himself twoonesixoh or im going to walk out of this room and let you go down for everything from paedophilia to pandering to murder thats it youre going down barry and you cant escape it its up to you how far you want to sink she had her eyes locked on his and his skittered wildly in their sockets she wanted to ask him how hed come to be the man he waswhat forces in his own past had brought him to thisbut it didnt matter abused in childhood molested raped and sodomised whatever had turned him into the malevolent procurer he was all that was water under the bridge boys were dead and a reckoning was called for look at the picture barry she said he moved his gaze to it another time and he looked at it long and hard he finally said i cant be sure this is old isnt it theres no goatee not even a moustache hes gothis hair is different theres more of it yes but look at the rest of him look at his eyes he put his glasses back on he picked up the picture whos he with he asked his mum barbara said whered you get the picture from her flat inside walden lodge just up the hill from where davey bentons body was found is this the man barry is this twoonesixoh is this the bloke you gave davey to at the canterbury hotel minshall set the photograph down i dont barry she said take a nice long look he did so again and barbara switched from come on to prayer he finally spoke i think it is he said she let out her breath i think it is wouldnt cut the mustard i think it is wouldnt get a conviction but it was enough to spawn an identity parade and that was good enough for her his mother had finally arrived at midnight shed taken one look at him and opened her arms she didnt ask how helen was because someone had managed to catch her en route from cornwall and tell her he could see that from her face and from the way his brother hung back from greeting him gnawing on his thumbnail instead all peter managed to say was we rang judith straightaway shell be here by noon tommy there should have been comfort in thishis family and helens family gathering at the hospital so that he did not have to face this alonebut comfort was inconceivable as was seeing to any simple biological need from sleeping to eating it all seemed unnecessary when his being was focussed on a single pinpoint of light in the midnight of his mind in the hospital bed helen was insignificant in comparison to the machinery round her they had told him the names but he recalled only their individual functions for breathing to monitor the heart for hydration to measure oxygen in the blood to maintain watch over the foetus aside from the whir of these instruments there was no other sound in the room and outside the room the corridor was hushed as if the hospital itself and every person within it already knew he didnt weep he didnt pace he made no attempt to drive his fist through the wall so perhaps that was why his mother ultimately insisted he had to go home for a while when the next day dawned and found them all still milling round the hospital corridors a bath a shower a meal anything she told him well stay right here tommy peter and i and everyone else you must make an attempt to take care of yourself please go home someone can go with you if you like there were volunteers to do that helens sister pen his brother st james even helens father although it was easy to see that the poor mans heart was in shreds and hed be no help to anyone while his youngest daughter was where she wasas she was so at first hed said no he would stay at the hospital he couldnt leave her they must see that but finally sometime in the morning he consented home for a shower and a change of clothes how long could that take two constables ushered him through a small gathering of reporters whose questions he neither understood nor even heard very well a panda car drove him to belgravia he dully watched the streets roll by at the house they asked did he want them to stay he shook his head he could cope he told them he had a livein man in the house denton would see that he had a meal he didnt tell them that denton was off on a longawaited holiday bright lights and big city broadway skyscrapers theatre every night instead he thanked them for their trouble and took out his keys as they drove off the police had been he saw signs of them in the scrap of crimescene tape that still clung to the narrow porchs railing in the fingerprint dust that still powdered the door there was no blood deborah had said but he found a spot of it on one of the draughtsboard marble tiles that comprised the top step just before the door shed been so close to getting inside it took him three tries to get his key properly in the lock and when hed managed the whole operation he felt lightheaded he expected the house to be different somehow but nothing had changed the last bouquet of flowers shed arranged had lost a few petals to the marquetry top of the table in the entry but that was it the rest was as hed last seen it one of her winter scarves hanging over the railing of the stairs a magazine left open on one of the sofas in the drawing room her diningroom chair sitting at an angle and not replaced the last time shed sat upon it a teacup in the kitchen sink a spoon on the work top a binder of fabric samples for the babys room on the table somewhere in the house the bags of christening clothes were probably stowed mercifully he did not know where upstairs he stood beneath the shower and let the water beat upon him endlessly he found he couldnt exactly feel it and even when it struck his eyeballs he didnt blink nor did he feel pain instead he relived individual moments silently imploring a god he could not say he believed in to give him a chance to turn back time to what day he asked himself to what moment to what decision that had led them all to where they now were he stood in the shower until there was no hot water left in the boiler he had no idea how long hed been there when he finally emerged dripping and shivering he remained undried and unclothed till his teeth were castanets in his skull he couldnt face walking back into their bedroom and opening the wardrobe and the drawers to search out clean clothes he was nearly airdried before he summoned the will to pick up a towel he moved to the bedroom ridiculously they were babes in arms without denton there to sort them out so their bed was badly made and consequently the impression of her head was still in her pillow he turned from this and forced himself over to the chest of drawers their wedding picture accosted him hot june sunshine the fragrance of tuberoses the sound of schubert from violins he reached out and toppled the frame so it fell facedown there was fleeting mercy when her image was gone and then quick agony when he could not see her so he righted it again he dressed he gave the procedure the sort of care she herself would have taken this allowed him to think about colours and fabrics for a moment to search out shoes and the proper tie as if this were an ordinary day and she still in bed with a cup of tea on her stomach watching to see he didnt make a sartorial faux pas his ties were the thing they had always been tommy darling are you absolutely certain about the blue one he was certain of little he was certain in fact of only one thing and that was that he was certain of nothing he went through motions without complete knowledge of making them so he found himself dressed at last and staring at himself in the mirrored wardrobe door wondering what he was meant to do next shave but he couldnt the shower had been difficult enough labeled as it was the first shower since helen and he couldnt do more he couldnt have more labels because he knew the very weight of them would kill him in the end the first meal since helen the first tank of petrol since helen the first time the post dropped through the door the first glass of water the first cup of tea it was endless and it was burying him already he left the house outside he saw that someonemost likely one of the neighbourshad left a bunch of flowers on his doorstep daffodils it was that time of year winter faded to spring and he needed desperately to stop time altogether he picked up the flowers she liked daffodils hed take them to her theyre so cheerful shed say daffodils darling are flowers with spunk the bentley was where deborah had carefully parked it and when he opened the door helens scent floated out to him citrus and she was with him he slid into the car and closed the door he rested his head on the steering wheel he breathed in shallowly because it seemed to him that deep breaths would dissipate the scent more quickly and he needed the fragrance to last as long as it possibly could he couldnt bring himself to adjust the car seat from her height to his to sort out the mirrors to do anything that would erase her presence and he asked himself how if he couldnt do this much this very simple and essential thing because for the love of god the bentley wasnt even the car she regularly drove so what did it matter then how could he possibly walk through what he had to walk through now he didnt know he was operating on rote behaviors that he hoped could carry him from one moment to the next which meant starting the car so that was what he did he heard the bentley purr beneath his touch and he reversed it out of the garage like a man performing keyhole surgery he glided slowly along the mews and into eaton terrace he kept his eyes averted from his front door because he didnt want to imagineand he knew he would imagine how could he help itwhat deborah st james had seen when shed walked round the corner having parked the car as he drove to the hospital he knew he was taking the same route the ambulance had taken when bearing helen to casualty he wondered how much shed been aware of what was going on around her drips being established oxygen seeping into her nose deborah somewhere nearby but not as close as those who listened to her chest and said her breathing was laboured on the left side now nothing going into a lung that had already collapsed shed have been in shock she wouldnt have known one moment shed been on the front steps searching out her door key and the next shed been shot short range theyd told him less than ten feet away probably closer to five shed seen him and hed seen the shock on her face the surprise to find herself suddenly vulnerable had he called her name mrs lynley have you a moment countess lady asherton isnt it and shed turned with that embarrassed breathless laugh of hers drat that silly story in the paper all of it was tommys idea but i expect i cooperated more than i should have done and then the gun automatic pistol revolver what did it matter a slow steady squeeze on the trigger that great equaliser among men he found it difficult to think and even more difficult to breathe he struck the steering wheel as a means of bringing himself round to the moment he was in and not one of the moments already lived through he struck it to distract himself to cause himself pain to do anything to keep from fracturing beneath everything that assaulted him from memory and imagination only the hospital could save him and he hurried in the direction of its refuge he wove round buses and dodged cyclists he braked for a crocodile of tiny schoolchildren on the kerb waiting to cross the street he thought of their own child among themhis and helens high socks scabby knees and miniature brogues a cap on his head a name tag fluttering round his neck the teachers would have printed it for him but hed have been the one to decorate it any way that he liked hed have chosen dinosaurs because theyd taken himhe and helento the natural history museum on a sunday afternoon there hed stood beneath the bones of the t rex with his mouth agape in wonder mummy he would have said what is it its tremendously big isnt it dad hed have used words like that tremendously hed have named constellations hed have known the musculature of a horse a horn honked somewhere he roused himself the children were across the street now and on their way heads bobbing and shoes scuffling along three adultsfore mid and aftkeeping a careful eye on them which was all that had been required and hed failed keeping a careful eye instead hed as good as provided a map to his own front door photographs of him photographs of helen belgravia how difficult could it have been how tough a proposition even to ask a few questions in the neighbourhood and now he reaped the result of his hubris there are things we dont know the surgeon had said but cant you tell there are tests for some conditions and no tests for others all we can do is make an educated guess a deduction based on what we know about the brain from that we can extrapolate we can present the facts as we know them and we can tell you how far those facts can take us but thats it im sorry i wish there were more he couldnt think about it cope with it live with it anything the horrible day after day of it a sword piercing his heart but neither fatally quickly nor mercifully just the tip of it at first and then a bit more as days became weeks became the necessary months in which he waited for what he already knew was the very worst a human being can adapt to anything yes a human being can learn to survive because as long as the will to endure remained the mind adjusted and it told the body to do the same but not to this he thought not ever to this at the hospital he saw that the journalists had finally dispersed this was not a twentyfourseven story for them the initial incident and its relationship to the investigation of serial murders had mobilised them at first but now they would check in only sporadically their focus would be on the perpetrator and the police from this point on with passing references made to the victim and canned footage of the hospital useda shot of a window somewhere behind which the wounded was ostensibly languishingshould that be required by the producers soon even that would be considered a rehash of a twicetold tale we need something fresh and if you havent got a new angle on this situation bury it inside page five or six ought to do it they had after all the meat of the matter scene of the crime press conference from the doctor the image of himselfnice good a suitable reaction shotleaving the hospital earlier in the day they would be given the name of the press officer from the belgravia station as well so that was it really the story could just about write itself on to other things there were circulation figures to concern them and other breaking news to bolster those figures this was business merely business he parked he got out of the car he moved towards the hospital entrance and what waited for him inside the unchanging and unchangeable situation the family his friends and helen decide tommy darling i trust you completely wellall except in the matter of ties and thats always been a puzzle to me because youre generally a man of impeccable taste tommy he stirred from his thoughts his sister judith was coming towards him she was looking more like their mother every day tall and lithe with closecropped blonde hair he saw she was holding a folded tabloid and he would later think it was this that set him off because it wasnt the most recent edition but rather the one in which the story about him his personal life his wife and his home had appeared and suddenly what he felt was shame in such a wave that he thought hed actually drown beneath it and the only way to struggle to the surface was to give in to the rage he took the tabloid from her judith said helens sister had it stuffed in her bag i hadnt seen it yet i actually didnt know about it so when cybil and pen mentioned she saw something surely for she came to his side and put her arm round him she said it isnt that you mustnt think so if you start to believe he tried to speak his throat didnt allow it she needs you now judith said he shook his head blindly he turned on his heel and left the hospital returning to his car he heard her voice calling after him and then a moment later he heard st james who must have been near when hed first seen judith but he couldnt stop and speak to them now he had to move to go to deal with things as they should have been dealt with from the first he made for the bridge he needed speed he needed action it was cold and grey and damp outside and there was clearly a rainstorm on its way but when the first drops finally fell as he turned into broadway he saw them only as minor distractions splatters on the windscreen on which was already written an unfolding drama of which he wanted no part in the kiosk the officer waved him through his mouth opening to speak lynley nodded to him and drove on descending to the carpark where he left the bentley and stood for a moment in the dim light trying to breathe because it felt to him as if hed been holding air in his lungs since hed left the hospital left his sister returned the accusing tabloid to her hands he made for the lift what was wanted was tower block that aerie from which the sight of the trees in st jamess park marked the changing of the seasons he made his way there he saw faces emerge as if from a mist and voices spoke but he wasnt able to make out the words when he reached ac hilliers office the assistant commissioners secretary blocked his path to the door judi macintosh said superintendent in her most officious voice and then apparently read something or understood something for the first time because she altered to tommy my dear in a tone so rich with compassion that he could hardly bear it you dont belong here go back to the hospital is he in there yes but then step aside please tommy i dont want to have to ring for anyone then dont judi step aside let me at least tell him she made a move for her desk when any sensible woman would have simply charged into hilliers office ahead of him but she did things by the book which was her downfall because with the path unblocked he accessed the door and let himself in shutting it behind him hillier was on the phone he was saying many so fargood i want the stops pulled outbloody right its to be a special task force no one strikes at a cop and then he saw lynley he said into the phone ill get back to you carry on he rang off and stood he came round the desk how is she lynley didnt respond he felt his heart slamming against his ribs hillier gestured to the phone that was belgravia theyre getting volunteersthesere men off duty on rota whateverfrom all over town asking to be assigned to the case theyve a task force in place its top priority they went into action late yesterday afternoon it doesnt matter what sit down here im getting you a drink have you slept eaten hillier went for the phone he punched in a number and said he wanted sandwiches coffee and no it didnt matter what kind just get it to his office as soon as possible fetch the coffee first and to lynley again how is she shes brain dead the first time hed actually said the words helen is brain dead my wife is brain dead hilliers face went slack but i was told a chest woundhow is that possible lynley recited the details finding that he needed and wanted the pain of telling them one by one the wound was small they didnt see at first that no there was a better way to say it all the bullet went through an artery then through parts of her heart i dont know the order the actual path of it but i expect you get the general idea dont oh he would he would but he said forcefully her heart was still beating at this point so her chest began to fill with blood but they didnt know that in the ambulance you see everything took them too long so when they finally got her to hospital she had no pulse she had no blood pressure they put a tube down her throat and they shoved another into her chest and thats when the blood started coming out of herpouring outso they knew you see at that point they knew when he breathed he could hear it grinding into his lungs and he knew hillier could hear it as well and he hated that fact for what it revealed and for how it could be used against him hillier said sit down please you need to sit down not that he thought never that he said i asked what they did for her in casualty well one would ask that dont you agree they told me they opened her up right there and saw one of the holes the bullet had made the doctor actually stuck his finger in it to stop the flow of blood if you can picture that and i wanted to be able to picture it because i had to know you see i had to understand because if she was breathing even shallowlybut they said the blood flow was inadequate to her brain and by the time they controlled itoh shes breathing now on the machine and her hearts back to beating but her brainhelens brain is dead god in heaven hillier went to the conference table he pulled out a chair and indicated he meant lynley to sit im so sorry thomas not his name he thought he could not bear his name he said he found us you see you understand that yes her helen he found her he found her you see that you know how it happened dont you what do you mean what are you talking im talking about the story sir im talking about your embedded journalist im talking about putting lives into the hands dont hillier raised his voice it didnt seem like something done in anger though rather in desperation a lastditch effort to stem a tide he could not stop from rising he phoned me after that story appeared he mentioned her we gave him a key a map whatever and he found my wife thats impossible hillier said i read the story myself there was no way he could have there were a dozen ways his own voice was louder now his anger fueled by the others denial the moment you started playing with the press you created ways television tabloids radio broadsheets you and deaconthe two of youthought you could use the media like two crafty politicians and see where its brought us see where its brought us hillier held up both his hands palms out the universal sign to stop he said thomas tommy this isnt he stopped he looked towards the door and lynley could almost read the question in his mind where is that bloody coffee where are the sandwiches where is a useful distraction for gods sake because i have a madman in my office he said i dont want to argue with you you need to be at the hospital you need to be with your family you need your family i have no god damn family finally the weir gave way shes dead and the babythe babythey want her on machines for at least two months more if possible do you understand not alive not dead with the rest of us watchingand yougod damn you youve brought us to this and there is no way stop stop youre mad with grief dont do and dont saybecause youll regret what the hell else do i have to regret his voice broke horribly and he hated the breaking and what it revealed about how he had been reduced man no longer but something like an earthworm exposed to salt and to sun and writhing writhing because this was the end this was surely the end and he hadnt expected there was nothing for it but to lunge for hillier to reach him to grab him to force himsomewhere strong arms caught him from behind these were so it wasnt hillier he heard a voice in his ear oh jesus man you got to get away you got to come with me easy man easy winston nkata he thought where had he come from had he been there all along unnoticed take him away it was hillier speaking hillier with a handkerchief to his face held by a hand that was shaking lynley looked at the detective sergeant nkata seemed to be behind a shimmering veil but even then lynley could still see his face in the moment before his arms went round him come with me guv winston murmured in his ear you come with me now chapter thirty it was late in the afternoon by the time ulrike decided the next approach she wanted to take having learned from her encounter in bermondsey with jack venesss aunt that prevarication wasnt going to serve her purpose she began with the list of dates shed got earlier from new scotland yard she took this list and fashioned a multicolumn document from it using the dates the victims names and the names of the polices potential suspects as the columns and the rows she allowed herself plenty of space to fill in any pertinent fact that came to light about everyone who looked questionable to her september she wrote first anton reid october came after that jared salvatore november was next dennis butcher and then more quickly december kimmo thorne december sean lavery january davey benton who wasshe thanked godnot one of theirs nor if it came down to it was the detective superintendents wife and that had to mean something didnt it but just supposing what it meant was a killer moving further afield because the heat was too much at colossus that was highly possible and she couldnt discount it because to discount itto anyonecould be construed as an attempt to direct suspicion elsewhere which was what she wanted to do of course but not while looking as if she was doing it she realised it had been completely ludicrous to pretend she was interviewing mary alice atkinsward in order to see if jack veness was ready to be promoted to a more responsible position with colossus she couldnt think how shed actually come up with such a plan and she certainly understood why miss aw had seen through it so now she was going to opt for the direct approach one that had to begin with neil greenham the only individual whod called in a solicitor cavalrylike with the indians looming she decided to accost neil in his classroom a glance at the clock telling her hed still be there giving kids the individual help for which he was noted he was having a têteàtête with a black boy whose name escaped her for the moment she frowned as she watched and heard neil say something about the boys attendance mark he called him mark connor she thought hed come to them via youth offenders in lambeth perpetrator of a common street mugging gone wrong when he pushed an old lady and she fell breaking her hip just the sort of kid colossus was designed to save ulrike watched as neil put a hand on the boys slender shoulder she saw mark flinch she went immediately on the alert she said neil could i have a word and took note of how he then reacted she was looking for any sign that she could interpret but he appeared careful not to give her one he said let me finish up here ill be along directly your office thats fine shed have preferred to have him here in his own environment but her office would do she went on her way he turned up exactly fifteen minutes later cup of tea in hand he said i didnt think to ask you if you wanted and gestured with the cup to indicate his offer this seemed to signal a truce between them she said thats fine neil i dont want any thanks come in and sit down wont you as he sat she got up and closed the door when she returned to her desk he lifted an eyebrow special treatment he asked with a soundless sip of darjeeling or whatever it was it would be soundless naturally neil greenham was not the sort of bloke who slurped should i be flattered or warned by the sudden attention ulrike ignored this shed thought about an entrée to the conversation she needed to have with neil and she decided she had to keep the goal in mind no matter where she began that goal was cooperation the time for stonewalling had long since passed she said its time we talked neil were getting close to the moment when we open the north london branch of colossus you know that dont you hard not to know it he looked at her steadily over the rim of his cup his eyes were blue there was a suggestion of ice about them that she had not noticed before well be wanting someone whos already in the organisation to head that branch dyou know that as well he shrugged noncommittally that makes sense he said not much learning curve involved for someone who already works here right theres that and its a compelling reason but theres loyalty as well loyalty not a question but a statement he made it in a reflective tone yes obviously well be looking for someone whose first loyalty is to colossus it has to be that way weve enemies out there and meeting them headon requires not only perspicacity but the spirit of a warrior you know what i mean i daresay he took his time before replying lifting his tea and having a thoughtfuland silentsip he said as it happens i dont what know what you mean not that perspicacitys beyond my ability to comprehend mind you its the spirit of a warrior bit that has me confused she gave a gentle laugh of the selfdirected kind sorry i was thinking of the image of the warrior leaving homewife and kids behind himand setting off to do battle that willingness of the warrior to set the personal to one side when a battle has to be fought the needs of colossus in north london will have to come first to its director and in south london neil inquired what what about the needs of colossus in south london ulrike the north london director isnt going to be responsible thats not actually what i meant i was just wondering if the way south london colossus is being run is a model for how north london ought to work ulrike gazed at him he looked mild enough neil always had seemed a bit fuzzy round the edges but now she had the distinct sensation of flint beneath the soft boyish surface and not just the flint of the anger problem that had cost him his erstwhile teaching job but something else she said why dont you speak a bit more directly i didnt know i wasnt neil said sorry i guess what im saying is that it seems a little hypocritical all this all what all this talk about loyalty and colossus first im he hesitated but ulrike knew the pause was for effect in other circumstances id be delighted to be having this confab with you id even flatter myself by concluding that youre considering recommending me to head the north london branch when it opens i thought i did imply but the loyalty to colossus bit rather gives you away your own loyalty hasnt exactly been impeccable has it she knew he was waiting for her to ask him to clarify his statement and she wasnt about to give him that pleasure she said neil everyone has a moment now and again when theyre distracted from their primary concern no one at any level of administration expects anyone else to have tunnel vision in the loyalty department which is good for you i expect your own secondary concerns being what they are i beg your pardon she wanted to grab the question back the instant she said it but it was too late because he snatched it up like a fisherman netting a hooked trout discretion is as discretion does which is to say that sometimes discretion doesnt at all doesnt do i mean or perhaps doesnt work is a better way of putting it its one of those bestlaid plans of mice and men kind of things if you know what i mean which in itself is to say that when theres a plan to cast stones its always a good idea that the thrower live in a house of bricks do you want me to be any more direct ulrike or do you get my meaning wheres griff by the way hes been flying under the radar for a bit hasnt he is that on your advice so now theyd come to it ulrike thought they were at a takeoffthegloves moment perhaps it was time her personal life was none of his business but he was going to be made to see that the reverse was not the case she said get rid of the solicitor neil i dont know why youve hired him and i dont want to know but im telling you to get rid of him straightaway and speak to the police neil changed colour but the way he adjusted his body told her he was not blushing with embarrassment or shame he said am i hearing you yes you are what the hell ulrike you cant tell meyou of all people i want you to cooperate with the police i want you to tell them where you were for every date they question you about if youd like to make it easier on yourself you can begin with telling me and ill convey the information to them she picked up her pen and held it poised above the paper on which shed created her threecolumn data sheet she said well start with last september the tenth to be precise he stood let me see that he reached for the paper she put her arm across it is your name on that as well he asked her or is the bonkinggriff alibi going to serve as your answer to any question they ask you and anyway how does it all work ulrike you fucking a suspect on the one hand and acting the role of coppers nark on the other my life she began but he cut in your life your life his voice was a scoff all colossus all the time thats how its supposed to look right butter wouldnt melt and in the meantime you dont even know when a kid goes missing have the cops cottoned on to that have the board of trustees because i think theyd be rather interested dont you are you threatening me im stating a fact take it however you like in the meantime dont tell me how to react when the cops start trawling through my life are you aware of how insubordinate bugger off he reached for the door he jerked it open he shouted veness get in here will you ulrike stood then neil was crimson with fury and she knew she matched him colour for colour but this was intolerable she said dont you dare start ordering round other employees if this is an example of how you take or dont take direction from a superior then believe me its going to be noted its already noted he swung round dyou think i actually believed youd consider me for anything other than bum wiper of this lot jack get in here jack arrived at the door saying whats going on just want to make sure you know ulrikes grassing to the cops about us ive had my sit down with her and i expect youre next on the list jack looked from neil to ulrike and then his gaze dropped to the desk and the fact sheet upon it he said an eloquent shit ulrike neil said shes found a second calling he adjusted the chair hed been sitting in and gestured to it your turn he said to jack thatll do ulrike told him go back to work jack neils giving in to his predilection for temper tantrums while ulrikes spent a good long time giving in to i said thatll do it was time to wrest control from the snake pulling rank was the only way even if it meant he would make good his threat and put the board of trustees into the picture about her carrying on with griff she said if you want to keep your job i suggest you get back to it both of you hey jack protested i only came in here yes i know ulrike said calmly im speaking largely to neil and what im saying remains the same neil do what you intend to do but in the meantime drop the solicitor ill see you in hell first which makes me rather wonder what youre hiding jack looked from her to neil and back again he said holy shit and left them together i wont forget this was neils final comment i dont expect you will was hers nkata hated the moment the activity and himself sitting at hilliers side before a newly energised collection of journalists there was nothing like the drama of trauma to get them motivated nothing like bringing that trauma home and giving it a human face to make them momentarily sympathetic to the met he knew this was what ac hillier was thinking as he fielded their questions after having made his statement now they had the press where they wanted them the acs demeanor seemed to suggest they were going to think twice before they went after the met while an officers wife was fighting for her life in hospital except she wasnt fighting for her life she wasnt fighting for anything because she wasnt any longer he was immobile he wasnt attending to what was being said but he knew that this was fine with hillier all he needed to look was fierce and ready nothing more would be asked of him he hated himself for complying lynley had insisted nkata had got him out of the acs office by grabbing him round the shoulders in an embrace of insistence but also one of devotion hed known in that instant that he would do anything for this man and that had startled him because for years hed told himself that the only important fact of his life was to succeed do the job and let everything else slide right off you because it is not important what anyone thinks it is only important what you know and who you are lynley had seemed to understand this about him without their ever having spoken about it hed continued to understand it even in the midst of what he was going through nkata had taken him from hilliers office as they left hed heard the ac punching numbers on the telephone he reckoned hillier was trying to reach building security to escort lynley from the premises so he made for a spot theyd not be likely to look the library on the twelfth floor of the building with its sweeping views of the city and the silence into which lynley had told him the worst and the worst was actually more than the superintendents wife being dead the worst was what they were asking of him hed said dully staring out at the view the machines can keep her breathing for months long enough to deliver a viable he stopped he rubbed his eyes looking like hell was such a common expression nkata had thought as hed stood there but this was real hell he realised this wasnt looking like this was living in theres no way to measure the exact amount of brain damage to the baby its there they can bewhat was itninetyfive percent certain of that because shed gone without sufficient oxygen for twenty minutes or more and if that destroyed her brain it only stands to reason man itsyou dont have to nkata hadnt known what else to say theres no test winston just the choice keep her on the machines for two monthsalthough three would be idealwell at least as ideal as anything could be at this pointand then go in for the baby cut her open take the baby and then bury the body because there is no her any longer just the body the breathing corpse if you will from which they could cut the livingalbeit permanently damagedchild youll have to make this decision they say think about it they say no real hurry of course because its not as if a decision either way is going to affect the corpse nkata knew they probably hadnt used the word corpse he could see that lynley himself was using it because it was the brutal truth of the matter and he also could see what a story it would make and was already making the earls wife dead her body reduced to incubator and incubators inhabitant the eventual birthcould they even call it a birthfeatured on the front page of every tabloid in town once it happened because what a story it was and then the followups ever after perhaps one a year in a deal that would have to be made with the press give us our privacy to cope with this situation now and occasionally well tell you how the child is doing perhaps allow a photo to be taken only leave us alone please leave us alone all nkata could say was oh a sound that escaped him in a groan lynley looked at him i made her the sacrificial lamb how do i live with that nkata knew what he was talking about although he didnt quite believe his own words he said man you did not do that you never think that you are not responsible because for lynley to believe that this tragedy was down to him a chain would be forged and its links would lead inexorably to nkata himself and he couldnt stand that he knew he couldnt for he also knew that part of the superintendents plan had been to occupy mitchell corsico so thoroughly with a story about himself that he would be kept away from everyone else and from nkata especially who had perhaps the most attentiongrabbing past of everyone involved in the serialkilling investigation lynley seemed to know what he was thinking because hed replied with its down to me not to you winston and then hed left hed said do your bit something has to come out of all this dont take my side its over all right nkata responded with i cant but lynley cut him off dont bloody make me responsible for anything else for gods sake promise me winston so here he was at hilliers side playing the part dimly he could hear the press briefing drawing to a conclusion the only indication hillier gave of his own inner state was in the direction he sent mitchell corsico afterwards the reporter would return to the press pool to his paper to his editors side to wherever he wanted to go or to be but he wouldnt be writing any further profiles of anyone in the investigation corsico protested with but you cant be thinking the story on the superintendent had anything to do with whats happened to his wife jesus god there was no way this bloke could have found her no way i made certain of that you know i made certain that story was vetted by everyone but the pope youve had my last word on the matter hillier said other than that he spoke nothing about lynley and what had happened in his office he merely nodded at nkata and said get on with it and went on his way solitary this time no minion accompanied him nkata returned to the incident room he saw he had a message to phone barb havers on her mobile and he made a mental note to do it but first he tried to remember what hed been engaged in so much earlier when dorothea harriman had given him the word about lynleys possible arrival in victoria street the profile he thought hed intended to have another look at the profile of the killer in the hope that something therein would relate to one of the suspectsif they were indeed suspects at all because the only thing that appeared to connect them to the killings was proximity to some of the victims which was seeming more and more like nothing to build anything upon at all not sand beneath the foundation but ice ready to crack under the burden of proof he took himself to lynleys office on the superintendents desk there stood a photograph of his wife lynley at her side they were both perched on a sundrenched balustrade somewhere his arm was round her her head rested on his shoulder they both were laughing into the camera while in the background a blue sea glittered honeymoon nkata thought he realised theyd been married less than a year he averted his eyes he made himself look through the stack of paperwork on lynleys desk he read lynleys notes he read a recent report by havers and at last he found it identifiable by the coversheet stationery from fischer psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane he slid the report out from the stack in which lynley had placed it he carried it to the conference table sat and tried to clear his mind superintendent a neat sample of cursive on the covering stationery said while you may not be a believer i hope youll find this information helpful no signature but the profiler himself must have written it no other person would have a reason to before he turned to the report beneath the stationery nkata gave thought to where the hospital was located he admitted to himself that he was thinking of stoney even now it always came down to his brother in the end he wondered if a place like fischer could have helped his brother eased his anger cured his madness removed the urge to strike out and even to kill nkata realised he was reading the heading on the creamy paper over and over he frowned he focussed he read again hed been taught that there were no coincidences at the end of the day and hed just after all seen lynleys notes and havers report he reached for the phone barbara havers burst into the office she said didnt you get my message bloody hell winnie i phoned i asked you to ring me back ive gotwhat the hells going on round here nkata handed the report to her read this he said take your time with reason everyone not only wanted a part of him but also needed a part of him lynley accepted this even as he knew he could do next to nothing to accommodate anyone he could barely accommodate himself when he returned to the hospital he was aware of virtually nothing he found his family and hers where hed left them along with deborah and st james holding the fort came ridiculously into his mind there was no fort to hold and nothing to hold it for helens sister daphne had arrived from italy her sister iris was due from america anticipated at any moment although no one knew when that moment might be cybil and pen were tending to their parents while his own siblings sat with their mother no stranger to hospitals certainly no stranger to sudden and violent death the room theyd been allotted was small and they crowded it perched uncomfortably on whatever chairs and settees had been scavenged sent to this particular place to shield them from the other families of other patients because of their numbers because of the sensitivity of the situation and because of who they were not who they were by class but who they were by occupation the family of a cop whose wife had been shot in the street lynley was aware of the irony of it all being granted this privacy because of his career and not because of his birth it seemed to him that this was the only moment in his life that was honestly defined by his chosen occupation the rest of the time hed always been the earl that odd bloke whod eschewed life in the country and mingling among his own kind for work of the commonest sort tell us why superintendent lynley he couldnt have done so especially now daphne the latest arrival came to him gianfranco she told him had wanted to be there as well but that would have meant leaving the children with daph its fine lynley said helen wouldnt have wantedthank you for coming her eyesdark like helens and it came to him how much helen looked like her eldest sistergrew bright but she did not weep she said theyve told me about yes he replied whatre you he shook his head she touched his arm dear heart she said he went to his mother his sister judith made a spot for him on the settee he said go to the house if youd like theres no need for you to stay here hour after hour mother the spare rooms available dentons in new york so he wont be there to do a meal for you but you canin the kitcheni know theres something weve been fending for ourselves so in the fridge therere cartons im fine lady asherton murmured were all fine tommy we dont need a thing weve been to the café and peters been fetching coffee for everyone lynley glanced at his younger brother he saw that peter still could not look at him for longer than a second he understood eyes upon eyes seeing and acknowledging he himself could barely stand the contact when does iris get here lynley asked does anyone know his mother shook her head shes in the middle of nowhere over there i dont know how many flights shes had to take or even if shes taken them yet all she said to penelope was that she was on her way and shed be here as soon as possible but how does one get here from montana im not even sure where montana is north lynley said its going to take her forever well it doesnt matter does it his mother reached for his hand hers was warm but quite dry which seemed to him an unlikely combination and it was soft as well which was also strange because she loved to garden and she played tennis every day the cornwall weather allowed it every season of the year so why were her hands still soft and god in heaven what did that matter st james came over to him while deborah watched from across the room lynleys old friend said the police have been tommy he glanced at lynleys mother and then said do you want to lynley rose he led the way out of the room to the corridor by the worst means the worst came to him from somewhere a song he wondered no it couldnt be that what is it he asked theyve determined where he went after he shot her not where he came from although theyre working on that but where he went where they went tommy they it appears there may have been two males they think an elderly woman was walking her dog along the north end of west eaton place shed just come round the corner from chesham street do you know where i mean what did she see from a distance two individuals were running round the corner from eaton terrace they seemed to have seen her and they ducked into west eaton place mews a range rover was parked alongside a brick wall there it took a dent in the bonnet belgravia think these blokesindividuals whoever they werejumped onto the range rover and leapt into the garden beyond that brick wall do you know where im talking about tommy yes beyond the brick wall a line of gardenseach one defined by yet another brick wallcomprised the back of the houses on cadogan lane itself another mews that was one of hundreds in the area once housing stables for the sumptuous dwellings nearby now housing homes converted from garages that themselves had been converted from the stables it was a complicated area of streets and mewses anyone could fade into the woodwork there or make good an escape or anything st james said its not what it sounds like tommy why is that lynley asked because an au pair on cadogan lane also reported a breakin shortly after helenshortly after within the hour shes being interviewed she was home when the breakin occurred what do they know just about the breakin at the moment but if its relatedand good god it has to be relatedand if whoever broke in went out of the front of the house then theres further good news because one of the larger houses along cadogan lane has two cctv cameras mounted on the front of it lynley looked at st james he wanted desperately to care about this because he knew what it meant if the au pairs housebreaker had gone in that direction there was a chance the closedcircuit television cameras had caught him on film and if hed been caught on film that was a step in the direction of bringing him to whatever justice there was which was little enough and what did it matter at the end of the day lynley nodded however it was expected of him st james said the house with the au pair hmm yes its quite a distance from where the range rover was in the mews tommy lynley struggled to think what this meant he could come up with nothing st james went on therere perhaps eightmaybe fewer but still a number of themgardens along the route which means whoever went over the wall where the range rover stood had to continue going over walls so belgravia are doing a search of every one of the gardens therell be evidence i see lynley said tommy theyre going to come up with something its not going to take long yes lynley said are you all right lynley considered this question he looked at st james all right what did it really mean the door opened and deborah joined them you must go home now lynley said to her theres nothing you can do he knew what he sounded like he knew she would misread him hearing the blame which was there but not directed towards her seeing her merely reminded him that shed been with helen last heard her talk last laughed with her last and it was the last of it that he couldnt stand just as earlier hed not been able to tolerate the first of anything else she said if you like if itll help you tommy it will he said she nodded and went to collect her things lynley said to st james im going to her now do you want to come i know youve not seen yes st james said id like to tommy so they went to helen dwarfed in her bed by everything that kept her working as a womb she looked waxen to him helen yes but even more helen no and never again while within her damaged beyond hope or repair but who knew how much they want me to decide lynley said he took his wifes lifeless hand he curled her flaccid fingers into his palm i cant stand it simon winston drove and for this barbara havers was grateful after a day in which shed determinedly not thought about what was happening at st thomas hospital she felt shed been punched in the gut with the news about helen lynley shed known it was going to be a grim prognosis but shed told herself that people survived being shot all the time and medicine being as advanced as it was meant helens chances had to be good but there was no current advance in medicine that compensated for a brain deprived of oxygen a surgeon didnt just go in and repair that damage like the messiah laying hands on a leper there was literally no coming back once the word vegetative was applied to a situation so barbara hunched against the door in winston nkatas car and clenched her teeth so hard together that her jaw was pulsing and sore by the time they reached their destination in the darkness funny barbara thought as nkata parked the car with his usual quasiscientific precision shed never thought of the city as a place people lived they worked here true they went to events at the barbican tourists came here to visit st pauls cathedral but after hours the place was supposed to be a ghost town that was not the case at the corner of fann and fortune streets here peabody estate welcomed home its residents at the end of their working day a pleasant upmarket area with blocks of flats that faced a perfectly groomed garden of winterpruned rosebushes shrubbery and lawn across the street theyd phoned first theyd decided they would go in the back door on this one no stormtrooping but rather a collegial approach there were facts to check and theyd come to check them the first thing hamish robson said to them when he answered the door was how is superintendent lynleys wife ive seen the news theyve apparently got a witness did you know theres some sort of film footage as well although i dont know from where they say they may have an image to broadcast hed come to the door wearing rubber gloves which seemed odd till he ushered them into the kitchen where he was doing the washing up he appeared to be something of a gourmet cook because there were pots and pans on the work top in amazing abundance and crockery cutlery and glassware for at least four people already standing wetly in the dish drainer suds galore mounded in the sink the place looked like a set for a fairy liquid commercial shes brain dead winnie was the one to tell him barbara could not bring herself to use the term they got her hooked up to machines because shes pregnant you know she was pregnant dr robson robson had plunged his hands into the sink but he took them out and rested them on the edge of it im so sorry he sounded sincere perhaps he was at some level some people were good at creating compartments for the various parts of themselves how is the superintendent he and i had made an arrangement to meet the daythe day this all occurred he never turned up hes trying to cope winston said how can i help barbara brought out the profile of the serial killer that robson had provided for them she said can we and indicated a neat chromeandglass table that defined a dining area just beyond the kitchen of course robson said she laid the report on the table and pulled out a chair she said join us robson said you dont mind if i carry on with the washing up barbara exchanged a glance with nkata whod joined her at the table he gave an infinitesimal shrug she said why not we can talk from here she sat winston did likewise she gave the ball to him we took some second and third looks at this profile he told robson who went back to washing a pot he brought forth from the suds he was wearing a cardigan and he hadnt bothered to roll the sleeves up so where the gloves ended the wet began weighing down the wool of his sweater i had a look at some of the guvs handwritten notes s well we got some conflicting information we wanted to sort that with you what kind of conflicting information robsons face was shiny but barbara put that down to the steamy water le me put it this way nkata said whyd you come up with the age of the serial killer as twentyfive to thirtyfive statistically speaking robson began but nkata interrupted beyond statistics i mean the wests wouldntve fitted that part of a statistical description and thas just for starters its never going to be foolproof sergeant robson told him but if youve doubts about my analysis i suggest you bring in someone else to do another bring in an american an fbi profiler id bet the resultsthe report you getis going to be nearly the same but this report here nkata gestured to it and barbara slid it across the table to him i mean come down to it all we got is your word that its even authentic int that right robsons glasses winked in the overhead lights as he looked from nkata to barbara what reason would i have to tell you anything but the truth of what i saw in the police reports that nkata said with a lift of his finger to stress the point is one very good question innit robson went back to his washing up the pot he was scrubbing didnt appear to need the attention he was giving to it barbara said to him why dont you come over here to the table dr robson itll be a little easier to talk he said the washing up right got it only theres a hell of a lot of washing up isnt there for just one bloke whatd you fix up for dinner i admit to not washing up every night those pots dont look used to me take off the gloves and join us please barbara turned to nkata you ever see a bloke wear rubber gloves to do the washing up winnie ladies do sometimes i do being a lady myself got to keep the manicure manicured but blokes why dyou think ah thanks dr robson its cozier like this im protecting a cut robson said theres no law against that is there hes got a cut barbara said to nkata howd you get that dr robson what the cut lets have a look at it by the way ds nkata here is something of an expert on cuts as you can probably tell by his mug he got hishowd you get that impressive scar sergeant knife fight nkata told her well i used the knife other bloke had a razor ouch in a lifeboat barbara said and again to robson howd you say you got yours i didnt say and im not sure its any of your business well it cant be from pruning the rosebushes because the time to do thats come and gone hasnt it so it has to be from something else what robson said nothing but his hands were clearly visible now and what was on them wasnt a cut at all but rather a scratch several scratches in fact theyd been deep by the look of them and possibly infected but they were healing now and the flesh was new and pink barbara said i cant sort out why you wont answer me dr robson whats going on cat got your tongue robson licked his lips he took off his glasses and polished them on a cloth that he removed from his pocket he was nobodys fool he must have learned at least something from his years of dealing with the criminally insane see nkata said to the man way the constable and i look at it we got only one thing tells us your report int a bucketful of cock and thats your word on the matter unnerstan as ive said if you dont believe me an we realisedthis is the constable and methat we been running six ways to sunday looking for someone who fits that profile but what ifthiss what the constable and meve been thinking cos we do think on occasion you knowthe real bloke were looking for had a way to make us think we were looking for someone else f we were he turned to barbara what was that word barb predisposed she said yeah predisposed what if we were predisposed to think one way while the truth was the other seems to me then the killer could go on doing his thing pretty safe knowing who we were looking for wasnt anything in the world like him itd be clever dont you think are you trying to suggest robsons skin was shiny but he wouldnt remove his cardigan hed probably donned it before letting them into the flat barbara thought hed have wanted to cover his arms scratches barbara said always nasty howd you get yours dr robson look he replied ive a cat that would that be mandy the siamese your mothers cat she was a bit thirsty when we were introduced this afternoon i took care of that by the way youre not to worry robson said nothing the thing about davey benton that you didnt expect was that he was a fighter barbara went on and how would you know how would anyone know because he didnt look like a fighter did he he looked just like his brothers and sisters which is to say he looked likewell he looked like an angel didnt he he looked fresh untouched nice boyflesh there for the taking i can almost understand why a bloody sick bastard like you mightve wanted to carry things further with this one and rape him dr robson you havent a shred of evidence to back up that statement robson said and i suggest you take yourselves out of this flat straightaway really barbara nodded thoughtfully winnie the doctor would like us to leave cant do that barb not without his shoes oh right you left two footprints at the final crime scene dr robson one hundred thousand footprints wouldnt mean a thing and all of us know it robson told her how many people do you expect buy the same ordinary pair of shoes each year millions probably barbara said but only one of them leaves his footprint at the scene of a murder where the victimthis is davey dr robsonalso has dna evidence under his fingernails your dna i expect from those nice scratches youve been protecting oh and the cats by the way the cats dna thats going to be a difficult one to talk your way out of at the end of the day she waited for a reaction from robson and she got it in the movement of his adams apple cat hair on daveys body she said when we link that to little mandy the squalling siamesegod that cat makes a bloody racket when shes thirsty doesnt sheyoure done for dr robson robson was silent nice barbara thought he had less and less to argue about hed hedged his bets with the profile and hed given as his moniker when hed moved on from colossus to barry minshall at mabil but there was the phone number of fischer psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane right on the letterhead of the stationery that covered his lying report with the final four numbers that a credulous callerlike the inspectors plod whom robson no doubt believed worked at the metcould punch in to be connected to the place she said twoonesixoh dr robson weve had barry minshallbut i think you know him as snowlocked up for a bit in the holmes street station we took this over and let him study it for a while she removed the photo of robson and his mother that shed found in esther robsons flat our barrythats your snow rememberturned it this way and that but he always came up with the same conclusion this is the bloke he handed davey benton over to he tells us at the canterbury hotel in lexham gardens where the registration cards going to hold interesting fingerprints and the clerk will be only too happy you damn well listen to me i didnt oh right i damn well expect you didnt youve got to see shut up barbara said she shoved herself away from the table in disgust she walked out of the room and left winston nkata the pleasure of reciting the caution before they arrested the piece of filth he watched first from across the street rain had fallen while hed made his way across town and now the lights from the hospital shone against the pavement they made streaks of gold and when he squinted he could almost think it was christmas again gold and then the red of tail lights on the cars as they passed by not that father christmasll be coming to visit the likes of you you know he groaned he did the tongue thing again pressure against his eardrums whoosh whoosh safe again gone again he could breathe as normal because normal is as normal does the reporters were gone he saw and wasnt that nice wasnt that a mark of the meanttobes the story was still a sensational one but now it could be covered from a distance profiles of all the principals if you will because what after all needed to be said about a body in a bed here we are in front of st thomas hospital on day number whateveritwas and the victim still lies within so back to you in the studio for the weather report which is far more interesting to the general public than this nonsense so why dont you give me a bloody new assignment please or words to that effect but for him it was endlessly fascinating events had conspired to illustrate over and over again that supremacy was more than a chance of birth it was also a miracle of timing embraced by the willingness to seize the moment and he was the god of moments in fact it was he who made moments this was the qualityone among manythat made him different from everyone else think youre special that it little sod he used his tongue whoosh and whoosh release the pressure to check and you get away from him charlene jesus its time he learned his lesson because special is as special god damn does and what the hell has ever been special abouti said step away who wants some of this bugger the both of you get out of my sight but in his sight was the future it lay before him in the streak of gold from the hospital lights and in what the lights meant which was broken broken one of them was broken one of them was destroyed one of them was a shell that had cracked at first and now lay smashed in a hundred pieces and hed been the one to crush that egg beneath the heel of his shoe he and no other look at me now look at me now he wanted to crow but there was danger in this and equal danger in remaining silent attention that it you want attention develop some personality and thatll give you attention if thats what you want lightly he hit his fist against his forehead he forced the air against his eardrums whoosh whoosh if he didnt take care the maggot would eat away his brains at night in bed hed started plugging orifices against the invasion of the wormcotton in ears and nostrils plasters across his arsehole and at the end of his prongbut he still had to breathe and that was where he failed in his prophylactic measures the worm got in with the air he took into his lungs from his lungs it crawled into his bloodstream where it swam like a deadly virus to his skull and munched and whispered and munched perfect adversaries he thought you and i and who wouldve thought it when all of this started the maggot chose to feast upon the weak but heah hed chosen an opponent worthy of the struggle for supremacy and thats what you think youve been doing little bugger maggots ate that was simply what maggots did they operated solely on instinct and their instinct was to eat until they metamorphosed into flies blowflies bluebottles horseflies houseflies it didnt matter he merely had to wait out the period of eating and then the maggot would leave him in peace except there was always the chance that this particular maggot was an aberration wasnt there a creature that would never sprout wings in which case he did have to rid himself of it but that was not why he had begun and that was not why he was here just now across the street from the hospital a shadow waiting to be dispersed by light he was here because there was a coronation that needed to happen and it would happen soon he would see to that he crossed the street this was chancy but he was ready and willing to take that chance to show himself was to make a mark of preeminence upon a time and a place and that was what he wanted to do to begin the process of carving history from the stone of now he walked inside he did not seek his adversary nor did he even try to locate the room in which he knew he would be found he could walk directly to it if hed wanted to but that was not his purpose in coming here at this hour of night breaking into morning there were few enough people in the hospital corridors and those who were present did not even see him from this he knew that he was invisible to people in the way that gods were invisible moving among ordinary men and knowing that he could smite them at any moment illustrated irrefutably to him what he was and would always be he breathed he smiled it was soundless in his skull supremacy is as supremacy does chapter thirtyone lynley remained with her throughout the night and long into the day that followed he used the time largely to disengage her faceso pale upon the pillowfrom what she was now from the body to which she had been reduced in this he tried to tell himself that it was not helen he was looking upon helen was gone in that instant in which everything had been transformed for them both she had fled the helen of her had soared from the framework of bone muscle blood and tissue leaving behind not the soul which defined her but the substance which described her and that substance alone was not and could never be helen but he couldnt make a go of that because when he tried what came to him were images for he had known her simply far too long shed been eighteen years old and not his in any way but rather the chosen mate of his friend meet helen clyde st james had told him im going to marry her tommy dyou think ill do for a wife she had asked i havent a single wifely talent and shed smiled a smile that had engaged his heart but rather in friendship than in love love had come later years and years later and in between the friendship and the love what had bloomed was tragedy change and sorrow altering all three of them unrecognisably madcap helen no more st james no longer the fervent batsman in front of the wicket and himself knowing hed been the cause for which sin there was no forgiveness one did not alter lives and simply walk away from the damage hed been told once that things are at any given moment just as they are supposed to be there are no mistakes in gods world hed been told but he could not believe that then or now he saw her in corfu a towel spread beneath her on the beach and her head thrown back so that the sun could strike her face lets move to a sunny climate shed said or at least lets disappear into the tropics for a year or thirty or forty yes brilliant well lord lucan it with less cause of course what do you think that youd miss london the shoe sales if nothing else hmm there is that she said i am a lifelong victim of my feet the perfect target for male designers with ankle fetishes im the first to admit it but have they no shoes in the tropics tommy not the sort youre used to im afraid the silly stuff of her that made him smile the very maddening helen of her cant cook cant sew cant clean cant decorate honestly tommy why do you want me but why did one person ever want another because i smile with you because i laugh at your banter which you and i both know very well is designed just for thatto make me laugh and the why of that is that you understand and have done from the first who i am what i am what haunts me most and how to banish it thats why helen and there she was in cornwall standing before a portrait in the gallery his mother at her side they were looking upon a grandfather with too many greats in front of him to know exactly how far back he was in time but that didnt matter because her concern was centred on genetics and she was saying to his mother dyou think theres any chance that terrible nose could pop up again somewhere along the line its rather ghastly isnt it his mother murmured at least it shades his chest from the sun tommy why didnt you point this picture out to me before you proposed ive never seen it before we kept it hidden in the attic that was very wise the helen of her the helen you cannot know someone for seventeen years and not have a swarm of memories he thought and it was the memories that he felt might kill him not that they existed but that there would be no more of them from this point forward and that there were others hed already forgotten a door opened in the room somewhere behind him a soft hand took his shaping his fingers round a hot cup he caught the scent of soup he looked up to see his mothers tender face i dont know what to do he whispered tell me what to do i cant do that tommy if i let hermum how can i let herthem and if i do that is it ego or is it ego if i dont what would she want how can i know she came close to him he turned back to his wife his mother curved her hand round his head so she cradled his cheek dearest tommy she murmured i would take this from you if i could im dying with her with them and thats what i want actually believe me i know no one can feel what you feel but all of us can know what you feel and tommy you must feel it you cant run away it wont work like that but i want you to try to feel our love as well promise youll do that he felt her bend and kiss the top of his head and in that action although he could hardly bear it he also knew there was healing as well but that was even worse than what lay before him in the immediate future that he might stop feeling this agony someday he didnt know how he could live through that his mother said simons come back will you speak to him i think he has news i cant leave her ill stay or ill send simon to you or i can get the message if youd like he nodded numbly and she waited in silence for him to make up his mind he finally handed the cup back to her the soup untouched ill go to him he said his mother took his place at the bed he turned at the door and saw her lean towards helens head and touch the dark hair that fell back from her temples he left her to maintain a vigil over his wife st james was just outside in the corridor he looked less haggard than the last time lynley had seen him which suggested hed gone home for some sleep lynley was glad of this the rest of them were operating on nerves and caffeine st james suggested they find the café and when they reached it the smell of lasagne suggested the hour of the day to be somewhere between noon and eight oclock at night inside the hospital lynley had long since lost track of time where helen was the lights were dim but elsewhere it was forever fluorescent daytime with only the changing faces of staff members with each new shift suggesting that hours were passing normally for the rest of the world lynley said what time is it simon half past one not in the morning though no afternoon im getting you something he nodded to the stainless steel and glass of the buffet what would you like it doesnt matter a sandwich im not hungry consider it medicinal itll be easier that way egg mayonnaise then if they have it brown bread st james went to fetch it lynley sat at a small table in the corner other tables were occupied by staff by members of patients families by ministers and in one case by two nuns the café reflected the sombre nature of what went on in the building it served conversation was hushed people seemed careful not to clatter their crockery and cutlery no one glanced his way for which lynley was grateful he felt raw and exposed as if he had no protection from the knowledge of others and the judgements that they could pass upon his life when st james returned he brought egg sandwiches on a tray hed bought one for himself as well and hed picked up a bowl of fruit and a twix bar along with two cartons of ribena they ate first in companionable silence theyd known each other for so many yearsfrom their very first day at eton in factthat words would be superfluous at the moment st james knew lynley could tell that in his face nothing needed to be said st james nodded his approval when lynley finished the sandwich he moved the bowl of fruit in his direction and followed that with the chocolate bar when lynley had eaten as much of both as he could stand his friend finally relayed his information belgravia have the gun they found it in one of the gardens along the route from the mews where that range rover had been dented to the house where the au pair reported a breakin they had to leap one brick wall after another to get away they lost the gun along the route in some shrubbery evidently they wouldnt have had time to go back for it even if they knew it was missing lynley looked away from st jamess face because he knew his friend was watching him carefully and gauging him with every word hed want to make sure he told lynley nothing that might push him over the edge again this told lynley he knew about hillier and new scotland yard in what seemed now like another lifetime i wont storm the belgravia station he said you can say the rest theyre fairly certain the gun they found is the one that was used theyll do the ballistics study on the bullet they took fromfrom helen naturally but the gun lynley turned back to him what kind is it handgun twentytwo calibre st james said blackmarket special it looks that way it hadnt been there long in the garden the home owners claimed to know nothing about it and a look at the shrubbery supported their claim it was freshly broken up in the other gardens along the way as well footprints everywhere belgravia are going to catch them tommy soon them there were definitely two of them one of them was mixed race the othertheyre not sure yet the au pair belgravia have spoken to her she says she was with the baby she looks after when she heard a window being broken down below at the back of the house by the time she got down to see what was going on they were inside and she met them at the bottom of the stairs one of them was already at the front door heading out she thought theyd burgled the house she started screaming but she also tried to stop them from getting away god only knows why one of them lost his hat is someone getting an efit made im not sure thats going to be necessary why the house on cadogan lane with the cctv cameras theyve got images theyre being enhanced belgravia are going to run them on television and the papers will print the best of the lot this is st james raised his head ceilingward lynley saw how difficult this was for his friend not only the knowledge of what had happened to helen but also the gathering of information to pass on to helens husband and her family the effort left him no time for grief theyre putting everything they have into this tommy theyve more volunteers than they can use from stations all over town the papersyouve not seen them have you its been an enormous story because of who you are who she is your families everything just the sort of thing the tabloids love lynley said bitterly but theyre carrying the public along with them tommy someone is going to see the pictures from the cctv camera and turn the boys in lynley said the boys st james nodded at least one of them apparently was a boy the au pair says he looked about twelve years old oh my god lynley looked away as if this would prevent his mind from making the inescapable connection st james made it anyway one of the colossus boys in the company of the serial killer but without knowing his companion is the serial killer i gave himtheman invitation to my home right in the pages of the source simon but there was no address no street name a killer looking for you couldnt have found you through that article its impossible he knew who i was what i look like as well he could have followed me home from the yard on any day and then all that would be left for him was laying his plan and waiting for an appropriate time if thats the case why take a boy with him to give him a sin so he could be his next victim when the job on helen was done theyd decided to let hamish robson stew for a night in lockup it would be something of a taste of the future so theyd taken the profiler to the shepherdess walk police station which while it wasnt the closest lockup to his flat near the barbican allowed them to avoid negotiating a route which would take them deeper into the city to get to the wood street station search warrant in hand they spent most of the following day in robsons flat building their case against the psychologist one of the first bits of evidence they found was his laptop computer squirreled away in a cupboard and barbara made short work of tripping along the trail of electronic bread crumbs that robson had left upon it kiddy porn she said to nkata over her shoulder when she found the first of the images boys and men boys and women boys and animals boys and boys hes a real piece of work our hamish for his part nkata found an old a to z with the location of st lucys church circled on the corner of courtfield road and tucked into its pages was the name and address of the canterbury hotel as well as a business card with snow and a phone number printed on it this along with barry minshalls earlier identification of robsons photograph and as part of the phone number of the doctors employer was enough to bring a soco team onto the scene and to send another to walden lodge the first would be looking for further evidence in robsons car the second would be gathering what it could from his mothers flat it seemed unlikely that hed have brought davey benton or anyone else into his digs here near the barbican but at least davey would have ridden over to wood lane with robson and once there he would have left his mark inside esther robsons flat when they had enough to put him away as a paedophile if nothing else they went to the station hed already phoned for his solicitor and after a wait for her to turn up from the magistrates court barbara and nkata met them both in an interview room it was barbara thought a nice touch for robson to employ a female solicitor she was called amy stranne and she appeared to have achieved an advanced university degree in impassivity she matched her utter lack of expressive reaction with a severe short haircut an equally severe black suit and a mans tie knotted at the throat of her white silk shirt she took a pristine legal pad from her briefcase along with a manila folder whose contents she consulted before speaking ive advised my client of his rights she said he wishes to cooperate with you in this interview because he feels there are significant aspects of the current investigation that you dont understand too right barbara thought bless his black little heart the psychologist knew he was going to be locked up for years like minshall the slimy sod was already trying to position himself for a lesser sentence nkata said we got soco sifting through your vehicle dr robson we got soco sifting through your mums flat we got a team at the yard searching for the lockup you got to have somewhere in town because we xpect thats where you got the van hidden and we got bout half a dozen officers treading through your background to find anything anyone else might miss robsons haggard face suggested that his accommodation in shepherdess walk hadnt been to his liking he said i didnt please barbara said if you didnt kill davey benton wed be happy to hear what actually happened to him between the time you raped him and the time he ended up a body in the woods robson flinched at the baldness of the statement barbara wanted to point out to him that there was actually no palatable way to portray what had happened to the thirteenyearold robson said i didnt mean to hurt him him the boy davey snow told me they always went willingly he said they were well prepared like a joint of beef barbara asked all saltandpeppered he said they were ready and they wanted it it nkata said the encounter the rape barbara clarified it wasnt robson looked to his solicitor amy stranne was taking notes but she appeared to sense his glance in her direction because she looked up she said its up to you hamish youve got healed scratches on your hands and arms barbara noted and weve got skin under daveys fingernails weve evidence of forcible sodomy as well so what is it about this scenario that we ought to be taking as a voluntary sexual encounternot that sex with thirteenyearolds is legal by the way but were willing to set that aside for a moment if only to hear your version of the romantic seduction which apparently i didnt intend to hurt him robson said i panicked thats all hed been cooperative hed been enjoyingperhaps he was hesitant but he wasnt telling me to stop he wasnt i swear he was liking it but when i turned him round robsons face was grey his thin hair drooped across his forehead spittle dried at the corners of his mouth buried within his nicely trimmed goatee i just tried to keep him quiet after that i told him the first time was always a little frightening even a little painful but he wasnt to worry how nice of you barbara noted she wanted to rip the sorry buggers eyes out next to her nkata stirred she told herself to back off which she knew her colleague was also telling her through his body language but she didnt want this sod to think that their silenceher silenceimplied approval even though she knew her silence was crucial in order to keep him talking she pressed her lips together and bit down to keep them in place i should have stopped then robson said i know it but at the momenti thought if he would just be quiet it would be over quickly enough and i wanted robson looked away but there was nothing in the room for him to fix upon save the tape recorder making a history of his words i didnt intend to kill him he said again i just wanted him to keep quiet while while you finished with him barbara said you strangled him with your bare hands nkata pointed out how was that supposed to i didnt know how else to get him silent he was only struggling at first but then he began to scream and i didnt know how else to quieten him and then as things werewere building for mei didnt realise why hed gone so silent and limp i thought he was cooperating cooperating barbara couldnt help herself with sodomy rape a thirteenyearold you thought he was cooperating so you finished the job only you found you were plugging away at a corpse robsons eyes reddened my whole life hed said i tried to ignorei told myself it didnt matter my uncle the wrestling and the touching my mother wanting to sleep with her little man and the arousal that was natural to any boy only how could it have been natural when she was making it happen so i ignored it and i eventually married but i didnt want her you see the woman fully formed and making demands of me i thought pictures would help videos dodgy things that no one would know about kiddy porn barbara said i could get aroused easily at first but then later takes more nkata said always takes more like a drug howd you get on to mabil through the internet a chat room i went at first just to see just to be round men who felt as i felt id borne the burden so long this obscene need i thought it would cure me if i went and saw the sorts of men whowho actually engage in it he brought a tissue out of his pocket and used it to scrub at his face but they were just like me you see that was the hell of it they were like me only happier at peace theyd arrived at a spot where theyd come to believe there is no sin in bodily pleasure bodily pleasure with little boys barbara said and why would that be the no sin part of it because the boys learn to want it as well do they now and how is it that blokes like you measure the wanting dr robson i can see you dont believethat you think im a monster a freak a genetic mutant who needs to be wiped from the surface of the earth along with the rest of your ilk why the hell would i think that finally it was all too much for her barb nkata said he was so like lynley she thought capable of keeping cool when that was called for the one thing shed never been able to do because shed always associated keeping cool with letting your insides get eaten by the horror you felt when you had to deal with monsters like this tell us about the rest nkata said to robson theres nothing more to tell i waited as long as i could far into the night i carried thehis body into the woods it was threefour in the morning there was no one anywhere the burning the mutilation tell us about that i wanted to make it look like the others once i saw id accidentally killed him that was the only thing i could think make it look like the others so you would conclude the same killer was at work on davey as on them hang on are you trying to claim you didnt kill the other boys barbara asked robson frowned you havent thoughtyou havent been sitting there thinking im the serial killer how on earth can that be how could i even have had access to those other boys you tell us i did tell you from the profile i told you they were silent he made the leap to what the silence implied my god the profiles real why would i ever have made that up most obvious reason in the world nkata said lays a nice trail away from yourself but i didnt even know those boys those dead boys i didnt know them you must believe what about muwaffaq masoud nkata asked you know him muwaf ive neverwho is he someone who might be able to pick you out of an identity parade nkata said been a while since hes seen the bloke who bought a van off him but i xpect having the man in front of him might do to jog his memory a bit robson turned to his solicitor then he said they cantcan they do this ive cooperated ive told them everything so you say dr robson barbara put in but weve found liars and killersre cut from similar cloth so dont mind us for not taking your word as gospel youve got to listen to me robson protested the one boy yes but it was an accident i didnt intend it to happen the others thoughi am not a murderer youre looking for someoneread the profile read the profile i am not the person youre looking for i know youre under pressure to bring this case to a close and now that the superintendents wife has been assaulted the superintendents wife is dead nkata reminded him you forget that for some reason youre not suggesting he turned to amy stranne get me away from them he said i wont speak to them further theyre trying to make me something im not thats what they all say dr robson barbara told him in a pinch blokes like you always whistle the exact same tune two members of the board of trustees came to see her which told ulrike that trouble was not just brewing it was steaming in the carafe the president of the board dressed to the nines with everything but the requisite gold chain to illustrate his authority had the board secretary in tow patrick bensley was doing the talking while his cohort tried to look like someone more substantial than an entrepreneurs socialite wife her recent facelift on tight display it didnt take long for ulrike to understand that neil greenham had made good on the threats hed uttered the last time theyd spoken shed reached that conclusion when jack veness told her that mr bensley and mrs richie were unexpectedly in reception asking for a word with the colossus director what took her longer was sorting out exactly which one of the threats neil had acted upon was she to be taken to task for her affair with griffin strong or for something else shed seen griff only briefly in the past few days hed kept himself busy with his new group of assessment kids and when he wasnt involved with them he was out of the way and busily engaged in outreach work silkscreening work or the sort of social work hed been asked to do a thousand times since signing on at colossus hed always been too busy to see to that latter aspect of his job before now it was astounding how tragedies managed to illustrate for people exactly how much time theyd in fact had for preventing tragedies in the first place in griffs case it was taking the time to connect with his assessment clients and their families outside the regular colossus hours he was good about that now or so he claimed truth was he could have been bonking emma the brick lane bengali hostess every time he was gone from colossus for all ulrike knew or cared for that matter she had larger concerns now and wasnt that an additionally intriguing twist in life a man one would have sacrificed nearly everything for turned out to have the value of a dust mote when ones head finally cleared but the clearing had come at too great a cost and it turned out that was why mr bensley and mrs richie had come to call which visit in and of itself wouldnt have been so bad had she not already been visited that day by the police this time it was belgravia not new scotland yard they turned up in the form of an unfriendly detective inspector called jansen with a constable in attendance who remained nameless and wordless throughout the interview jansen had produced a photograph for ulrike to inspect in the picture which was grainy but not impossible to make out two individuals were caught in the act of apparently jogging down a narrow street the identical houses along itall of them only two and three floors tallsuggested the action had occurred in a mews the subjects of the photo were in an affluent part of town as well there was no rubbish or litter visible no graffiti no dead plants in decrepit window boxes ulrike reckoned she was meant to say whether she recognised the individuals who were rushing by the cctv camera that had produced their photo so she studied them the taller of the twoand he seemed to be malehad sussed out the presence of the camera and wisely averted his face he wore a hat pulled low over his head he had his jacket collar turned up wore gloves and was otherwise dressed completely in black he might as well have been a shadow the smaller one had not had the same foresight his image while not crisp was still clear enough for ulrike to be able to say with certaintyand no small measure of reliefthat she didnt know him there was nothing about him that was recognisable to her and she knew she would have been able to name him had they been acquainted because he had masses of unforgettably crinkly hair and enormous splotcheslike monstrous unrestrained freckleson his face he looked to be round thirteen years old perhaps younger and he was a mixedrace boy she decided white black and something in between she handed the picture back to jansen i dont know him she said the boy either one of them although i cant say for sure because of how the taller one is hidden he saw the cctv camera i expect where was it there were three jansen told her two on a house one across the street from it this is from one of the cameras on the house whyre you looking a woman was gunned down on her doorstep it may be down to these two that was all he told her but ulrike made the leap shed seen the newspapers the wife of the scotland yard superintendent whod come to colossus to speak to ulrike about the deaths of kimmo thorne and jared salvatore had been shot on her doorstep in belgravia the hue and cry over this had been deafening broadsheets and tabloids especially the crime had been inconceivable to the inhabitants of that part of town and theyd been making their feelings known in every venue they could find he isnt one of ours this boy ulrike replied to di jansen ive never seen him before are you sure about the other he had to be joking ulrike thought no one would be able to recognise the taller man if it even was a man still she took another look at the picture i am sorry she said theres just no way wed like to show this round the place if you dont mind jansen told her ulrike didnt like what this impliedthat she was somehow out of the loop at colossusbut she had no choice before the officers left to flash the photo round she asked them about the superintendents wife how was she jansen shook his head bad he said im sorry will you she nodded at the photo do you expect to catch him jansen looked down at it a slim slip of paper in his large chafed hands the kid thatll be no problem he replied this is in the evening standards latest right now itll make the front of every paper tomorrow morning and itll be on the news tonight and again tomorrow well get him and i expect itll happen soon and when we get him hell talk and then well have the other absolutely no bloody doubt about it imthats good she said poor woman and she did mean that no oneno matter how rich how privileged how titled how fortunate or how anything elsedeserved to be gunned down in the street but even as she told herself this and assured herself that the milk of human kindness and compassion had not utterly drained out of her when it came to the upper class of this rigid society in which she lived ulrike still felt relieved that colossus could not be attached to this new crime only now here were mr bensley and mrs richie and they were sitting with her in her officeanother chair having been procured from the reception areaintent upon talking about the one subject she had done everything in her power to keep from them bensley was the one to introduce it he said tell us about the dead boys ulrike she could hardly act the innocent with a what boys would this be sort of reply there was nothing for it but to tell them that five boys from colossus had been murdered from september onward their bodies left in various parts of london why werent we informed bensley asked why did this information have to come to us from someone else from neil you mean ulrike could not keep herself from saying it she was caught between the desire to let them know she was perfectly aware of her judass identity and the equal need to defend herself she went on with i didnt know myself till after kimmo thorne was murdered he was the fourth victim the police came round then but otherwise bensley did one of those tieadjustment moves of the kind meant to illustrate an incredulity that might otherwise strangle him mrs richie accompanied this with a click of her teeth how is it you didnt know the other boys were dead or even missing mrs richie added were not organised to keep attendance tabs on the clients ulrike told them as if they hadnt had this explained to them a thousand times or more once a boy or girl gets beyond the assessment course theyre free to come and go as they like they can participate in what we have to offer or they can drop out we want them to stay because they want to be here only those whore here as a probationary measure are monitored and even then colossus didnt tattle on the kids straightaway there was a certain amount of leeway given even to them once they had completed the assessment course that bensley said is what we expected you to say or were told to expect ulrike thought neil had done his best shell make excuses but the fact remains the director of colossus damn well ought to know whats going on with the kids colossus is meant to be helping wouldnt you agree i mean how much work are we talking about to look in on the courses and ask the instructors whos there and whos fallen by the wayside and wouldnt it be wise for the director of colossus to place a phone call and try to locate a child whos dropped out of a programme designedand funded lets not forget thatto prevent him from dropping out in the first place oh hed done his very best had neil ulrike had to give him high marks for that she found she had no ready response to bensleys comment so she waited to see what the board president and his companion had really come to see her about which she reckoned was only tangentially related to the death of the colossus boys perhaps bensley said you were too distracted to know that boys had gone missing ive been no more distracted than usual ulrike told him what with the plans for the north london branch and the associated fundraising going on on your instruction by the way was what she did not add but she did her best to imply it bensley however didnt make the inference she wished him to make he said thats not exactly how we understand it theres been another distraction for you hasnt there as i said mr bensley theres no easy way to approach this work ive tried to keep my focus spread evenly on all the concerns a director would have in running a place like colossus if i missed the fact that several boys stopped coming it was due to the number of concerns that i had to deal with related to the organisation frankly i feel terrible that none of uswith delicate emphasis on the word nonemanaged to see that let me be frank bensley interrupted mrs richie settled herself in her chair a movement of the hips spelling out now weve got to the point yes ulrike folded her hands youre under review for want of a better word im sorry to have to tell you this ulrike because overall your work for colossus has seemed unimpeachable seemed ulrike said yes seemed are you sacking me i didnt say that but consider yourself under scrutiny well be conductingshall we call it an internal investigation for want of a better word if you will and how do you intend to carry out this internal investigation through review through interviews let me say that i believe youve largely done a fine job here at colossus let me also say personally that i hope you emerge unscathed from this look at your employment and personal history here my personal history what does that mean exactly mrs richie smiled mr bensley hemmed and ulrike knew her goose was in the oven she cursed neil greenham but she also cursed herself she understood to what extent she was going to be cooked if she didnt bring about a significant alteration to the status quo chapter thirtytwo put him through two identity parades was how di stewart had initially greeted the news that hamish robson had cooperated as far as the davey benton murder was concerned but had refused to admit to anything else have minshall and masoud both look at him to barbaras way of thinking two identity parades was a waste of time since barry minshall had already tentatively identified robson from the photograph shed nicked at his mothers flat but she tried to see it as di stewart would not as the compulsion towards overkill that had long made the di a notorious and tiresome personality at the yard but as a tremor in the earth designed to rattle robson into further admissions the very act of standing in a line of men and waiting to learn if an unseen witness would finger you as the perpetrator of a crime was unnerving having to do it twice and hence understanding that there was yet another witness to god only knew whatat the end of the day that was actually a very nice touch and barbara had to admit it so she made the arrangements to have minshall carted over to the shepherdess walk station and she stood behind the twoway mirror while the magician picked out robson in an instant saying thats the man thats twoonesixoh barbara had the pleasure of saying to robson thats one down mate so as to leave him dangling in the wind of suspense then she cooled her heels while muwaffaq masoud worked his way from hayes into the city via a wasted eternity on the piccadilly line even though she understood the game plan that stewart was following at that point she would have preferred that stewart follow it with someone other than her so she still tried to work her way out of having to hang about the shepherdess walk station waiting for masoud to turn up he was she told di stewart going to say the same as minshall so wouldnt her time be better spent looking for the lockup where robsond left the van there was going to be a mountain of evidence against the sod when they found that lockup wasnt there stewarts response had been set about the job youve been assigned constable whereupon he doubtless returned to his list of todos he was a great one for making lists was stewart barbara could only imagine how his day began at home as he consulted his selfmade schedule to see what time he was meant to clean his teeth her own day had begun with breakfast news on the telly they ran the best of the cctv footage that theyd managed to get off a house in a street not far from eaton terrace and to this they added a more illdefined image that theyd got from sloane square underground station these were the individuals wanted for questioning in the shooting of helen lynley countess of asherton the presenters told their early morning audience anyone who recognised either one of them was asked to phone the incident room at the belgravia street police station once the presenters had said her name they then kept referring to helen as lady asherton it was as if the individual she was had been completely engulfed by her marriage the fifth time the presenters used her title barbara turned off the telly and tossed the remote into a corner she couldnt cope with any more of it despite the hour she wasnt hungry she knew that there was no way she was going to be able to face something even vaguely resembling breakfast but she also knew she had to have something so she forced herself to eat a tin of unheated american sweet corn followed by half a plastic container of rice pud when shed worked herself up to it she picked up the phone and tried to get real news of helen she couldnt bear the thought of talking to lynley and she didnt expect him to be at home anyway so she phoned st jamess number this time she managed to get a real person on the line and not a voice on an answer machine that person was deborah when she had her there barbara wasnt quite sure what to ask how is she was ludicrous hows the baby was just as bad hows the superintendent coping was the only query even remotely reasonable but it was also unnecessary because how the hell was the superintendent supposed to be coping knowing the decision that faced him a modest proposal of keeping his wife a dead body in a bed for the next few months with air pumping mechanically in and out of her while their child was reduced tothey just didnt know they knew it was bad they just didnt know how bad how close to disaster was close enough barbara settled on saying to deborah its me i just wanted to check in is he i dont know what to ask everyones arrived deborah told her her voice was very quiet iristhats helens middle sister she lives in america did you knowshe was the last to get here she made it finally last night she had a terrible time getting out of montana theyve had so much snow everyone stays at the hospital in a little room theyve set up its not far from hers they go in and out no one wants to leave her alone she meant helen of course no one wanted helen left alone it was an extended vigil for all of them how could anyone decide she wondered but she couldnt ask so she said has he talked to anyone a priest a minister a rabbi ai dont know anyone there was a silence barbara thought perhaps shed intruded too far but finally deborah spoke again and her tone had changed to such careful tightness that barbara knew she was crying simons been there with him dazethats his mothershes there as well theres a specialist supposed to fly in today someone from france i think or perhaps its italy i dont really remember a specialist what sort neonatal neurology something like that daphne wanted it done she said if theres the slightest possibility that the baby wasnt harmedshes taking this very badly so she thought that an expert on babies brains but deborah hows that going to help him cope he needs someone to help him deal with what hes going through deborahs voice dropped i know she gave a broken laugh its exactly what helen hated you know all this soldiering on that people do stiff upper lips and just getting on with things god forbid anyone should sound like a whinger she hated that barbara shed prefer to have him screaming from the rooftop at least she would say thats real barbara felt her throat tighten she couldnt talk any longer so she said if you see him tell him what im thinking of him praying for him going through the motions of bringing all this to an end when she knew it was only beginning for him what was the message exactly she neednt have worried ill tell him deborah said on her way to her car barbara saw azhar watching her somberly from the french windows of his flat she raised a hand but she didnt stop not even when hadiyyahs solemn little face appeared next to him and his arm went round her thin shoulders the parentchild love of it was too much at the moment barbara blinked away the image when muwaffaq masoud finally arrived at the shepherdess walk station those hours later barbara recognised him mostly by his confusion and unease she met him in reception and introduced herself thanking him for coming such a distance to help with the inquiry he smoothed his beard unconsciouslyshe was to see that he did this a lotand he polished his spectacles once she took him to the room from which theyd view the line of men he gazed upon them long and hard they turned for him one at a time he asked that three of them step forwardrobson was one of themand he took a lengthier look at them finally he shook his head the middle gentleman resembles him he said and barbara felt a rush of pleasure since hed fingered robson but the pleasure died when he went on but i must say it is only a resemblance based on the shape of his head and the type of body the robustness of it the man i sold the van to was older i think he was bald he had no facial hair try to think of this bloke here without the goatee barbara said she didnt add that robson could have shaved his thinning hair off before he went out to hayes to purchase a van masoud tried to do as she asked but his conclusion remained unchanged he could not say for certain that the man he was looking at was the same man whod purchased a van from him in the summer he was terribly sorry about that constable he sincerely wished to be of help barbara took this news back to new scotland yard she kept her report to stewart brief it was yes on minshall and no on masoud she told the di they needed to find that sodding van stewart shook his head he was going over someones reportred pencil in hand like a frustrated schoolteacherand he tossed it down on his desk before he said that whole lines a nonstarter as things turn out why barbara asked robsons telling the truth she gawped at him what dyou mean i mean copycat constable copy and cat he killed the kid and arranged it to look like one of the other murders she said what the hell and shoved her hand through her hair in sheer frustration i just spent four bloody hours putting this bloke into identity parades dyou mind telling me why you had me waste my time like that if you knew she couldnt even finish the di said with his usual finesse christ havers dont get your knickers caught in the crack all right no ones keeping secrets from you st james only just rang us with the details hed told tommy it was likely nothing else then the attack on helen happened and tommy never passed the information on to us what information the dissimilarities revealed by the postmortem exam but we always knew there were dissimilarities the manual strangulation the lack of a stun gun the rape robson himself pointed out that things escalate when the boy hadnt eaten in hours constable and there was no trace of ambergris oil on him that could be explained every other boy had eaten within an hour of his death every other boy had consumed the identical thing beef some bread robson didnt know that and he didnt know about the ambergris oil what he did to davey benton was based on what he knew of the crime which was superficial what he saw in the preliminary report and in the photographs of the scene thats it are you saying minshall had nothing to dorobson had nothing theyre responsible for what happened to davey benton end of story barbara sank heavily into a chair round her the incident room was muted obviously everyone knew about the dead end theyd all just run headlong into where does that leave us she asked back to alibis background checks prior arrests back i daresay to elephant and castle weve damn well done so we do it again plus every other man whose name has come up in the course of the investigation theyre all going under the microscope make yourself part of that she looked round the room wheres winnie she asked belgravia stewart said hes having a closer look at the cctv tapes they got off cadogan lane no one said why but no one had to nkata was looking at the cctv tapes because nkata was black and a mixedrace boy was featured on them god but they were so obvious barbara thought have a look at these snaps of the shooter winnie you know how it is all of them look the same to us and besides if this is gang relatedyou get the picture dont you she picked up a phone and punched in the numbers of nkatas mobile when he answered she heard voices babbling in the background masoud said robsons not our bloke she told him but i expect youre up to speed on that no one knew till st james phoned stewart barb this wasmustve been round eleven this morning wasnt personal you know me too well not like i dont go through the same dance howre you doing what dthey expect you to be able to tell them from looking at the tapes i dont think they know theyre trying everything at this end im just another source and sweet fa kids mixed race mostly white some black and something else dont know what thother bloke in the picture he could be anyone he knew what he was doing kept himself covered face away from the camera well that was one excellent use of your time wasnt it i cant blame them barb doing what they can they got a decent lead though not five minutes before you rang came through by phone what is it whered it come from over west kilburn harrow road stations got a snout in the community they depend on reglarly some black bloke with a big street rep and a nasty disposition so no one messes with him cording to harrow road this bloke saw the pictures in the paper from the cctv and he phoned them up and gave them a name could be nothing but harrow road seem to think its worth looking into could be they say we got the shooter were looking for who is it didnt get the name harrow road are picking him up for questions but if hes the one hes going to crack no doubt about it hes going to talk why how can they be so sure cause hes twelve years old and this int the first time hes been in trouble st james gave lynley the news they met not in the corridor this time but rather in the small room that the family had been occupying for what seemed to lynley like months on end helens parents had been talked into decamping going in the company of cybil and daphne to a flat they owned in onslow square where helen herself had once lived penelope had returned to cambridge to check on her husband and her three children his own family were taking a few hours for rest and for a change of scene in eaton terrace his mother had phoned when theyd arrived saying tommy what shall we do with the flowers scores of bouquets on the front porch she said a coverlet of them that descended the steps and went onto the pavement he had no suggestions to give her offerings of sympathy could not touch him he found only iris remained stalwart iris the least clydelike of all the clyde sisters not a hint of elegance anywhere about her her long hair nononsense and pulled back from her face with slides in the shape of horseshoes she wore no makeup and her skin was lined from the sun shed wept when shed first seen her youngest sister shed said fiercely this is not supposed to happen here god damn it and hed understood from that that she meant violence and death brought about by a gun the provenance of this was america not england what was happening to the england shed known shed been gone too long he wanted to tell her the england shed known had been dead for decades shed sat with helen for hours before she spoke again and then it was to say to him quietly shes not here is she no shes not here lynley agreed for the spirit of helen was gone entirely now moved onward to the next part of existencewhatever that was what remained was just the housing for that spirit kept from putrescence by the questionable miracle of modern medicine when st james arrived lynley took him to the waiting area leaving iris with helen he listened to the news about the harrow road police and their snout but what he took in was a single piece of information trouble with the law prior to this he said what sort of trouble simon arson and bag snatching according to youth offenders up there hes had a social worker attempting to counsel the family for some time i spoke with her and not much im afraid an older sister doing community service for a street mugging and a younger brother no one knows much about they all live with an aunt and her boyfriend on a council estate thats all i know youth offenders lynley said he has a social worker then st james nodded his gaze stayed on lynley and lynley could feel him making a study of him evaluating him even as he too drew together the facts like strands of a web whose centre was always and forever the same youth at risk lynley said colossus dont torture yourself he gave a bleak laugh believe me i dont need to the truth is doing the job well enough to ulrike given the current circumstances there were no two uglier words than internal investigation that the board of trustees intended to gather information about her was bad enough that they intended to do it through interviews and reviews was worse she had enemies aplenty at colossus now and three of them were going to be happy as the dickens to take the opportunity to throw a few tomatoes against the image of herself that shed tried to build neil greenham headed the list hed probably been storing his rotten little informational fruit grenades for months now just waiting for the appropriate time to hurl them for neil was fighting for complete control of colossus and this was something that ulrike had not realised till the latest development of bensley and richie turning up in her office of course hed never been a team player had neilwitness him actually losing a teaching job in a climate where the government was begging for teachersand while that had always been something of a red flag that ulrike now admitted she should have noted it was nothing compared to the insidious side of him that had been revealed with the unexpected advent in elephant and castle of two of the board members not to mention the questions they had asked upon their arrival so neil was going to revel in the chance to tar her with a brush hed no doubt been dipping in pitch since the first time shed looked at him sideways then there was jack the whole whathadshebeenthinking of jack her errors with jack didnt have to do with trotting off to talk to his landlady aunt however they had more to do with giving him a paid position at colossus in the first place oh yes that was supposed to be the whole theory about the organisation to build the sense of self in malefactors till they didnt have to malefact any longer but shed let fall by the wayside a critical piece of knowledge that shed always possessed about individuals like jack they didnt take kindly to others suspicions about them and they were especially nasty when it came to the ideahowever mistakenthat someone had grassed them up or was considering doing so so jack would be looking for payback and hed get it he wouldnt be able to think things through to the point of understanding how taking part in the facilitation of her demise at colossus might come back and bite him in the arse once a replacement for her was found griff strong on the other hand understood that only too well he would do what it took to preserve his position in the organisation and if that meant making ostensibly reluctant allegations of sexual harassment from a female superior who couldnt keep her hands off his delectable albeit married and ohsohesitant body then that was what he would do so what neil greenham planted in the minds of the board of trustees and what jack veness watered griff would cultivate hed wear that blasted fishermans sweater for the interview as well if he told himself anything he would list the reasons why theyd come to a situation of every man for himself arabella and tatiana would top that list rike you know ive got personal responsibilities you always knew that the only person ulrike could come up with who might speak up in support of her was robbie kilfoyle and that was merely because as a volunteer and not a paid employee hed have to be careful when interviewed hed have to walk a fine line of neutrality because hed have no other way to protect his future and move himself along in the direction he wanted which was paid employment he couldnt want to deliver sandwiches for the rest of his life could he but he had to be positioned had rob he had to see himself as a player on her team and no one elses she went in search of him it was late in the day she didnt check the time but the darkness outside and the emptiness of the building told her it was long after six and probably closer to eight robbie often worked later into the evenings putting things back in order there was a good chance he was still in the back somewhere but if he wasnt she was determined to track him down he was nowhere in the building however the kit room was compulsively neatsomething to compliment rob on when she saw him ulrike thoughtand surgery could have been performed in the practice kitchen so tidy was it the computer lab had been seen to as well as had the assessment meeting room robs careful marks were evident everywhere rational thought told ulrike to wait till the next afternoon to speak to robbie he would turn up round half past two as always and she could thank him and forge a bond with him then but anxiety suggested she start forging straightaway so she looked up robs phone number and rang his house if he wasnt there she reckoned she could leave a message with his dad but the double ringing went on and on ulrike listened to it for a good two minutes before she rang off and went on to plan b she was of course flying by the seat of her jeans and she knew it but the part of her that was saying relax go home have a bath drink some wine you can do all this tomorrow was outshouted by the part of her exclaiming that time was flying and the machinations of her enemies were well under way besides her stomach had been riding above her lungs it seemed for most of the day she was never going to be able to breathe eat or sleep with ease till she did something to alter that and anyway she was a doer wasnt she shed never sat round and waited to see how events unfolded in this instance that meant corralling rob kilfoyle so hed be ready to take her part the only way she could see to do that was to get on her bicycle and find him it took the a to z to accomplish the first part of the plan since she had no clue where granville square was once she had robs address in hand she found it tucked to the east of kings cross road this was a definite plus she would merely have to work her way up to blackfriars bridge cross the river and head north it was simple and its simplicity told her the journey to granville square was meant to be she saw it was later than shed thought once she was outside and aboard her bicycle the commuter traffic had long since thinned out so the trip up farringdon streeteven in the vicinity of ludgate circuswasnt as white knuckling as shed expected she made good time to granville square a foursided terrace of simple georgian town houses in various states of disrepair and renovation typical of so many neighbourhoods in london in the centre of the square was the ubiquitous patch of nature this one not locked off barred and otherwise kept private to all but paying residents of the nearby houses but rather open to anyone who wanted to walk read play with a dog or watch children romp in the miniature playground along one side rob kilfoyles house faced the middle of this playground it was dark as a tomb but ulrike parked her bike by the railing and went up the steps anyway he could be in the back and now that shed come she wasnt about to leave without making an attempt to roust him out of there if he was within she knocked but gained no reply she rang the bell she tried to peer in the front windows but she had to resign herself to the admission that other than affording her exercise the ride across town to this borderland between st pancras and islington had been wasted he isnt home our rob a female voice declared behind her no surprise in that though poor lad ulrike turned from the door a woman was watching her from the pavement she was shaped like a barrel with a similarly shaped wheezing english bulldog on a lead ulrike went back down the steps to join her dyou happen to know where he is she introduced herself as robs employer you that sandwich woman the woman said she was sylvia puccini missus no relation by the way if youre musical live three doors down known our rob since he was a toddler im robbies other employer ulrike said at colossus didnt know he had another employer mrs puccini said eyeing her carefully whered you say colossus were an outreach programme for youth at risk robbies not strictly an employee i suppose he volunteers in the afternoons after he does his sandwich round but we consider him one of us all the same never mentioned it to me youre close to him why dyou ask mrs puccini sounded suspicious and ulrike could sense that they might easily head into mary alice atkinsward territory if she pursued this route she smiled and said no particular reason i thought you might be since youve known him so long like a second mum or something hmm yes poor charlene god rest her dear tormented soul alzheimers but rob would have told you that i expect she went off early winter last year poor thing didnt know her own son from shoe leather at the end didnt know anyone if it comes down to it and then his dad he hasnt had an easy time of it for the last few years our rob ulrike frowned his dad dropped like a stone last september this was setting off to work like always and drops like a hundredweight falls straight down the gwynne place steps right over there she indicated the southwest end of the square dead before he ever hit the ground dead ulrike asked i didnt know robs dad was alsohes dead youre sure in the light of a streetlamp mrs puccini cast her a look that indicated how bizarre she thought the question was if hes not luv we all stood round and watched someone else get sent off to be cremated and thats not very likely is it no ulrike had to agree it certainly wasnt she said i suppose its just thatyou see robs never mentioned his dad passing away on the very much contrary she added to herself well he wouldnt i expect i cant say robd ever be the sort to go shopping for pity no matter how bad he felt about his dads passing vic was one who didnt ever tolerate whingers and you know what they say as the saplings bent but make no mistake about it my dear that boy felt deeply when he found himself alone there are no other relations oh theres a sister somewhere a lot older than rob but she took off years ago and didnt show up to either funeral married kids australia or who knows where far as i know shes not been in touch since she was eighteen mrs puccini gazed at ulrike more sharply then as if evaluating her when she next spoke it was apparent why on the other hand dear between you me and trixie hereshe indicated the dog with a shake of the lead which the animal apparently took as a sign to resume her walk because she lumbered to her feet from where shed been squatting gustily at mrs puccinis ankleshe wasnt a very nice bloke that victor robs father as ever was a real shocker when he went like that true but not a lot of hearts were breaking at the thought of it in this neighbourhood if you must know ulrike heard this but she was still attempting to process the first bit of information that robbie kilfoyles dad was in fact dead she was comparing this to what rob had told her recentlysky television wasnt it something called sail away all she said to mrs puccini was i do wish hed told me it helps to talk oh i expect hes talking unaccountably mrs puccini nodded once again towards the gwynne place steps theres always a friendly ear when youre paying for it paying friendly ears and paying suggested one of two things prostitution which seemed about as much robs style as armed robbery or psychotherapy which seemed equally unlikely mrs puccini appeared to know what she was thinking because she gave a hoot of laughter before she explained the hotel she said at the base of the steps he goes to the bar there most nights i expect thats where he is right now this proved to be the case when ulrike bade mrs puccini and trixie good night and headed across the square and down the steps she found that they led to an unassuming and unmistakably postwar tower block heavily given over to chocolatecoloured bricks and minimal exterior decoration inside however it boasted a lobby done up in faux art deco its walls hung with paintings depicting wellheeled men and women lounging and partying between the two world wars at one end of this lobby a door marked the entrance to the othello bar it seemed strange to ulrike that robbieor anyone from the neighbourhoodwould choose a hotel rather than a nearby pub in which to do his drinking but she decided that the othello bar had one quality to recommend it at least on this night there was virtually no one present if robbie wished to bend the sympathetic ear of the barman that individual was entirely available there were seats at the bar to boot another feature making the othello perhaps more welcoming than the corner pub robbie kilfoyle was at one of these seats two of the tables were occupied by businessmen working at laptops with their lagers before them one other table was taken up by three women whose enormous bums white trainers and choice of drink at this time of nightwhite winesuggested they were american tourists otherwise the bar was empty thirties music played from speakers in the ceiling ulrike slid onto the stool next to robbie he glanced her way once then again when the sight of her registered with him his eyes widened hi she said one of your neighbours said you might be here he said ulrike and looked round her as if to see if she was accompanied by someone he was wearing a snug black jersey she noted which emphasised his physique in a way that his usual neatly ironed white shirt had never done lessons from griff she wondered he had quite a nice body the barman heard rob exclaim and came to take her order she said shed have a brandy and when he fetched it for her she told rob that mrs puccini had suggested she look for him here she said youd been coming here regularly since your dad died ulrike added robbie looked away and then back at her he didnt attempt to obfuscate and ulrike had to admire him for that he said i didnt like to tell you about it that hed died i couldnt think of a way to tell you it seemed like it wouldve been he thought about it it appeared as he turned his pint of lager between his hands it would have been like asking for special treatment like hoping someoned feel sorry for me and give me something as a result whatever gave you that idea ulrike asked i hope nothing anyones done at colossus would make you feel you had no friends to confide in no no he said i dont think that i spose i just wasnt ready to talk about it are you now this was she saw an opportunity to forge the loyalty bond with robbie while she had bigger concerns than the death of a man that had taken place months agoa man she had never even metshe wanted robbie to know that he had a friend at colossus and that friend was sitting right next to him in the othello bar am i ready to talk about it yes he shook his head not really painful a glance in her direction why dyou say that she shrugged it seems obvious you apparently had a close relationship with him you lived together after all you must have spent a great deal of time together i remember your telling me about how the two of you watched tele she stopped the words cut off by the realisation she twirled her brandy glass slowly and made herself finish you watched television with him you did say you watched television with him and we did he replied my dad was a bugger and a half on good days but he never went after anyone when the telly was on i think it hypnotised him so whenever we were alone togetherespecially after mum finally went into hospitali turned on the telly to keep him off my back force of habit when i was talking to you about watching the telly with him i guess thats all we ever really did together he drained his beer whyd you come he asked why had she come suddenly it seemed rather unimportant she sifted through topics to find one that was simultaneously believable and innocuous she said actually to thank you what for you do so much round colossus sometimes you dont get acknowledged enough you came round here for that robbie sounded incredulous as any reasonable person might ulrike knew the ground was treacherous here so she decided that opting for the truth was wise more than that really im beingwellinvestigated rob so im sorting out who my friends are you must have heard what who your friends are that im being investigated i know the copsve been round not that investigation then what the board of trustees are looking into my performance as director of colossus you must have known they came round today why why what why must i have known im pond scum over there least important and last informed he said it casually but she could tell he waswhat frustrated bitter angry why hadnt she seen this before and what was she supposed to do about it now other than apologise make a vague promise about things changing round colossus and go on her way she said im going to try to change that rob if i take your part in the coming conflict im not saying its okay he shoved his pint glass away shaking his head when the barman offered him another he settled his bill and hers and said i understand its a game i get the politics of everything im not stupid i didnt mean to suggest you were no offences been taken youre doing what you have to do he slid off his stool howd you get here he asked you didnt bike over did you she told him she had done she finished off her brandy and said so id better set off he said its late ill take you home take me i thought you cycled as well to work he said otherwise no i got dads van off him when he died in the summer poor sod he bought himself a camper for his pension years and dropped dead the next week never even had a chance to use it come on we can fit your bike inside ive done it before thanks but thats really not necessary it puts you to trouble and dont be stupid its not any trouble he took her arm he said night dan to the barman and he guided ulrike not to the door through which shed come but towards a corridor this led she found to the toilets and beyond them to the kitchen which he entered only a single cook remained and he said rob with a nod of hello as they passed through she saw there was another exit here an escape route for the kitchen workers should a fire start and this was the door that robbie chose it took them to a narrow carpark behind the hotel canyoned on one side by the building itself and on the other side by a slope at the top of which was granville square in a far dark corner of the carpark a van stood waiting it looked old and harmless with rust spots pitting the faded white lettering on its side my bike ulrike began up in the square well sort that out get in well drive round to pick it up she looked round the carpark it was dimly lit and otherwise deserted she looked at robbie he shot her a smile she thought of colossus and how hard shed worked and how much would fall into ruin if she was made to hand it over to someone else someone like neil someone like griff anyone in fact some things needed a leap of faith she decided this was one of them at the van robbie opened the door for her she climbed inside he shut the door she felt for the seat belt but couldnt find it anywhere above her shoulder when robbie joined her and saw her searching he started the van up and said oh sorry thats a bit tricky its lower than youd expect ive got a torch here somewhere let me give you some light he rustled round on the floor next to his own seat ulrike watched him bring up a torch he said this should be of some help and she turned back to reach over for the belt once again everything happened in less than three seconds after that she waited for the light to shine from the torch she said rob and then felt the jolt run through her body she gasped for breath the first spasm shook her the second rendered her semiconscious the third teetered her on the edge from which she slid into the dark chapter thirtythree harrow roads reputation as a police station wasnt a good one but cops had a lot to contend with in west kilburn they were dealing with everything from the usual social and cultural conflicts one found within a multiethnic community to street crime drugs and a thriving black market they found themselves perpetually coping with gangs as well in an area dominated by housing estates and grim tower blocks built in the sixties when architectural imagination was moribund legends abounded of cops being outrun outmanoeuvred and outsmarted in places like the interlocking and tunnellike corridors of the notorious mozart estate the police had been outnumbered forever in this part of town they knew it which didnt improve their tempers when it came to meeting the needs of the public when barbara and nkata arrived they found a heated argument going on in reception a rastafarian accompanied by a hugely pregnant woman and two children was demanding action of a special constablei wan that fuckin car back man you tink dis woman plan on giving birth in the streetwho claimed things to be out of my power sir youll have to talk to one of the officers whore working on the case the rasta said shit then and turned on his heel he grabbed his womans arm and made for the door saying blood to nkata with a nod as he passed him nkata identified himself and barbara to the special constable they were there to see detective sergeant starr he said harrow road had a boy in lockup fingered as the shooter in a street crime in belgravia hes xpecting us nkata said harrow road had reported to belgravia whod reported in turn to new scotland yard the snout in west kilburn had proved reliable hed named a kid who resembled the one seen on the cctv films from cadogan lane and the cops had found him in very short order he hadnt even been on the run the job on helen lynley done hed merely repaired to his home via underground to westbourne park because his mug had been visible on their cctv tapes as well sans companion this time nothing could have been easier all that remained was matching his fingerprints to those on the gun found in the garden near the scene of the crime john stewart had told nkata to take it nkata had asked barbara to accompany him by the time they got there it was ten oclock at night they could have waited till morningtheyd been working fourteen hours at that point and they were both knackeredbut neither one of them was willing to wait there was a chance that stewart would hand this job over to someone else and they didnt want that sergeant starr turned out to be a black man slightly shorter than nkata but bulkier he had the look of a pleasantfaced pugilist he said weve already had this yob in for street brawling and arson those times hes pointed the finger elsewhere you know the sort it wasnt me you fucking pigs he glanced at barbara as if to ask pardon for his language she waved a weary hand at him he went on but the familys got a whole history of trouble dad got shot and killed in a drug dispute in the street mum toasted her brain with something and shes been out of the picture for a while sister tried to pull off a mugging and ended up in front of the magistrate the aunt they live with hasnt been willing to hear shit about the kids being on the fast track to trouble though shes got a shop down the road that she works in fulltime and a younger boyfriend keeping her busy in the bedroom so she cant afford to see whats going on under her nose if you know what i mean it was always just a matter of time we tried to tell her first time we had the kid in here but she wasnt having it same old story he talked before you said barbara asked what about now were getting sod all out of him nothing nkata said not a word hed probably notve told us his name if we hadnt already known it what is it joel campbell how old twelve scared oh yeah id say he knows hes going away for this but he also knows about venables and thompson who bloody doesnt so six years playing with bricks fingerpainting and talking to shrinks and hes finished with the criminaljustice system there was some truth in this it was the moral and ethical dilemma of the times what to do with juvenile murderers twelveyearold murderers and younger wed like to talk to him for what good itll do were waiting for the social worker to show has the aunt been here come and gone she wants him out of here directly or shell know the reason why hes going nowhere between her position and ours there wasnt a hell of a lot to discuss solicitor i expect the aunts working on that angle now he gestured for them to follow him on their way to the interview room they were met by a wornout looking woman in a sweatshirt jeans and trainers who turned out to be the social worker she was called fabia bender and she told sergeant starr that the boy was asking for something to eat did he ask or did you offer starr inquired which meant of course had he opened his mouth to say something at last he asked she replied more or less he said hungry id like to fetch him a sandwich ill organise it he said these two want a word you see to that arrangements made starr left nkata and barbara with fabia bender who didnt have much more to add to what the detective had already told them the boys mother she said was in a mental hospital in buckinghamshire where shed been a repeat patient for years during this most recent round of institutionalisation her children had been living with their grandmother when the old lady decamped for jamaica with a boyfriend who was being deported the children got passed off to the aunt really it was no surprise that kids found their way into trouble when their circumstances were so unsettled hes just in here she said and shouldered open a door she went in first saying thank you sherry to a uniformed constable who apparently had been sitting with the boy the constable left and barbara entered the room behind fabia bender nkata followed and they were facetoface with the accused killer of helen lynley barbara looked at nkata he nodded this was the boy hed seen on the cctv film taken in cadogan lane and in the sloane square underground station the same head of crinkly hair the same face blotched with freckles the size of tea cakes he was about as menacing as a fawn caught in the headlamps of a car he was small and his fingernails had been bitten to the quick he was sitting at the regulation table and they joined him there nkata and barbara on one side and the boy and the social worker on the other fabia bender told him that sergeant starr was fetching him a sandwich someone else had brought him a coke although it remained untouched joel nkata said to the boy you killed a cops wife you know that we found a gun nearby fingerprints on thatll turn out to be yours ballisticsll show that gun did the killing cctv film places you on the scene you and nother bloke what dyou got to say then blood the boy slid his gaze over to nkata for a moment it seemed to linger on the razor scar that ran the length of the black mans cheek unsmiling nkata was no teddy bear but the boy drew himself inone could almost see him call upon courage from another dimensionand he said nothing we want a name man nkata told him we know you werent alone barbara said th other bloke was an adult wasnt he we want a name out of you its the only way to go forward joel said nothing he reached for the coke and closed his hands round it although he did not attempt to pop it open man where you think youre going for this one nkata asked the boy you think we send blokes like you to blackpool for a holiday going away is what happens to the likes of you how you play it now determines how long this wasnt necessarily true but there was a chance that the boy wouldnt know it they needed a name and they would have it from him the door opened then and sergeant starr returned he held the triangle of a plasticwrapped sandwich in his hand he unwrapped it and passed it over to the boy the child picked it up but did not take a bite he looked hesitant and barbara could tell he was struggling with a decision she had the sensation that the alternatives he was considering were ones that none of them would ever be able to understand when he finally looked up it was to speak to fabia bender i aint grassing he said and took a bite of his sandwich that was the end of it the social code of the streets and not only of the streets but the code that pervaded their society as well children learned it at the knees of parents because it was a lesson essential to their survival no matter where they went one did not sneak on a friend but that alone told them volumes in the interview room whoever had been with the boy in belgravia there was a strong possibility that he was consideredat least by joela friend they left the room fabia bender accompanied them ds starr remained with the boy i expect hell tell us eventually fabia bender assured them its early days yet and hes never been inside a youth facility before when he gets there hell have another think about whats happened he isnt stupid barbara considered this as they paused in the corridor hes been in here for arson and a mugging though hasnt he what happened about that a wrist slapping by the magistrate did things even go that far the social worker shook her head charges were never brought i expect they didnt have the evidence they wanted he was questioned but then he was released both times so he was barbara thought the perfect candidate for some sort of social intervention of the kind provided in elephant and castle she said what happened to him then what do you mean when he was released did you recommend him to any special programme what kind of programme the kind designed to keep kids out of trouble you ever send a kid over to a group called colossus nkata asked cross the river this is elephant and castle fabia bender shook her head ive heard of it of course weve had their outreach people here for a presentation as well but but weve never sent any of our children over to them you havent barbara made this a statement no its quite a distance you see and weve been waiting for them to open a branch closer to this part of town lynley was alone with helen and had been so for the last two hours hed made the request of their respective families and theyd agreed only iris protested but shed been here at the hospital the least amount of time so he understood how impossible she felt it that she would be asked to part from her sister the specialist had come and gone hed read the charts and the reports hed studied the monitors hed examined what little there was to examine in the end hed met everyone because lynley had wanted it that way as much as a person could ever be said to belong to anyone helen belonged to him by virtue of being his wife but she was a daughter as well a beloved sister a loving daughter and sisterinlaw the loss of her touched every one of them he did not suffer this monstrous blow alone nor could he ever claim to grieve it alone so all of them had sat with the italian doctor the neonatal neurologist who told them what they already knew twenty minutes was not a vast span of time twenty minutes described a period in which very little could generally be accomplished in life indeed there were days when lynley couldnt even get from his house to victoria street in under twenty minutes and other than showering and dressing or brewing and drinking a cup of tea or doing the washing up after dinner or perhaps deadheading the roses in the garden onethird of an hour didnt provide the leisure necessary to do much of anything but for the human brain twenty minutes was an eternity it was forever because that was the nature of the alteration it could bring upon the life depending upon its normal functioning and that normal functioning depended upon a regular supply of oxygen witness the victim of the gunshot the doctor had said witness your helen the difficulty of course was in the not knowing which arose from the not seeing helen could be seendaily hourly moment by momentlifeless in the hospital bed the babytheir son their amusingly named for want of a permanent decision by his indecisive parents jasper felixcould not all they knew was all the specialist knew and what he knew was dependent upon what was common knowledge about the brain if helen had no oxygen the baby had no oxygen they could hope for a miracle but that was all helens father had asked how likely is that miracle the doctor shook his head he was sympathetic he seemed generous and good hearted but he would not lie none of them looked at one another at first once the specialist left them all of them felt the burden but only one of them experienced the weight of having to make a decision lynley was left with the knowledge that everything rested with him and upon him they could love himas they did and as he knewbut they could not move the cup from his hands to theirs each one of them spoke to him before they left for the night somehow knowing without being told that the moment for resolution had arrived his mother remained longer than any of them and she knelt before his chair and looked up into his face everything in our lives she said quietly leads up to everything else in our lives so a moment in the present has a reference point both in the past and in the future i want you to know that youas you are right now and as you ever will beare fully enough for this moment tommy one way or the other whatever it brings ive been wondering how im meant to know what to do he said i look at her face and i try to see on it what shed want me to do then i ask myself if even that is a lie if im merely telling myself that im looking at her and trying to see what shed want me to do when all the time im just looking at her and looking at her because i cant face the coming moment when i wont be able to look at her at all because shell be gone not only gone in spirit but gone in flesh as well because right now you see even in this shes giving me a reason to keep going on im prolonging that his mother reached up and caressed his face she said of all my children you were always the hardest on yourself you were always looking for the right way to behave so concerned you might make a mistake but darling there are no mistakes there are only our wishes our actions and the consequences that follow both there are only events how we cope with them and what we learn from the coping thats too easy he said on the contrary its monumentally difficult she left him then and he went to helen he sat at her bedside he knew that no matter how he disciplined his mind to this moment the image of his wife as she was just now would fade with time just as the image of her as she had been days ago would also fade had indeed already begun to fade until ultimately there would be nothing of her left in his visual memory if he wanted to see her hed be able to do so only in photographs when he closed his eyes however hed see nothing but the dark it was the dark that he feared it was everything that represented the dark which he could not face and helen was at the centre of it all as was the nothelen that would come about the instant he acted in the only way he knew his wife would have wanted shed been telling him that from the first or was even that belief a lie he did not know he lowered his forehead to the mattress and he prayed for a sign he knew he was looking for something that would make the road an easier one for him to walk but signs did not exist for that purpose they served as guides but they did not smooth the way her hand was cool when he felt for it where it lay at her side he closed his fingers round it and he summoned hers to move as they might have done had she only been what she looked asleep he pictured her eyelids fluttering open and he heard her murmured hullo darling but when he raised his head she was as before breathing because medical science had evolved to that extent dead because it had evolved no further they belonged together the will of man might have wished it otherwise the will of nature was not so vague helen would have understood that even if she had not phrased it that way let us go tommy would have been how she put it at the heart of matters she had always been the wisest and most practical of women when the door opened some time later he was ready its time he said he felt his heart swelling as if it would be torn from his body the monitors deadened the ventilator hushed the silence of parting swept into the room by the time barbara and nkata arrived back at new scotland yard the news was in the gun bore the boys prints on the barrel and on the grip and ballistics showed the bullet to have come from the same pistol they made their own report to john stewart who listened stone faced he looked as if he believed his own presence in the harrow road station might have made a difference shaking the name of the other perpetrator out of the kid sod all he knew barbara thought and she told him what theyd learned from fabia bender about the boy and about colossus at the end she said i want to tell the superintendent sir when stewarts expression suggested that he smelled something bad she altered her declaration to id like to tell him that is he thinks helens shooting has to do with this investigation with that profile in the source as the way the shooter found her he needs to knowitll give him one less thing to think about i expect stewart appeared to look at this from every angle before he finally agreed but he told her she was to do the paperwork related to their call in harrow road and she was to do that before setting off for st thomas hospital it was past one in the morning then when she finally staggered down to her car then the blasted mini choked on her and she sat with her head on the steering wheel willing the damn engine to turn over properly in her head she heard that same admonition from some mystical automotive dimension suggesting that she might want to get the car seen to before it conked out altogether she muttered tomorrow all right tomorrow and hoped that promise was enough it was the engine finally started at this time of night the streets of london were virtually empty no sane taxi driver was out trying to get a fare in westminster and the buses ran far less frequently an occasional car was passing by but largely the streets were as vacant as the pavements where the homeless tucked themselves into doorways so she made quick time to the hospital as she drove she realised that he might not be there that he might have gone home and tried to get some sleep in which case she would not disturb him but when she arrived and pulled into a dropoff point directly down from lambeth palace road she saw his bentley at the far end of the carpark he was with helen then as shed reckoned he would be she gave passing thought to the risk of shutting the minis engine off after shed finally got it going but the risk was necessary because she wanted to be the one to tell lynley about the boy she felt a need to relieve at least some small portion of the guilt he was carrying round so she turned the key in the ignition and waited for the minis hiccupping to come to an end she grabbed up her shoulder bag and got out of the car she was just about to walk towards the entrance when she saw him hed come out of hospital and the look of himhow he walked and how he held his shoulderstold her how permanently altered he was she hesitated then how to approach a dearly loved friendhow to approach him in such a time of devastation at the end she didnt think she could because after all what difference did it actually make with his life now as it was in ruins he trudged across the carpark to the bentley there he looked up not at her but at a spot in the carpark out of her range of vision it was as if someone had called his name and then a figure quickly emerged from the darkness and things happened very swiftly after that barbara saw that the figure wore all black he moved over to lynley there was something in his hand lynley looked round then he turned in a flash back to his car but he got no farther for the figure reached him and pressed the object that he carried into lynleys side not even a second passed before barbaras superintendent was on the ground and the hand that held the object pressed to him again his body jerked and the figure in black looked up even from a distance barbara saw she was gazing on robbie kilfoyle it had all taken three seconds perhaps less kilfoyle grabbed lynley by his armpits and dragged him quickly to what barbara should have bloody well seen she thought if she hadnt been so focussed on lynley a van was parked deeply in the shadows its sliding door open in another second hed got lynley inside barbara said bloody sodding hell weaponless and for a moment utterly directionless she looked to the mini for something she could useshe reached for her mobile to phone for help she punched in the first nine as across the carpark the van roared to life she dived for her car she threw her bag and her mobile inside phone call incomplete she would punch in the last two nines in a moment but in the meantime she had to get going had to get on his tail had to follow and shout the direction she was traveling into the mobile so that an armed unit could be sent on its way because the van the bloody van was moving it was coming across the carpark now it was red as theyd suspected and on its side were the faded letters theyd seen in the film barbara shoved her key into the ignition and turned it the engine ground it did not engage across from her the van was rumbling towards the exit its lights swept her way she ducked because he had to think he had an all clear so hed keep his pace slow steady and unsuspecting she could follow then and ring for the men with the nice big guns to take down this useless piece of human excrement before he did something to someone who meant everything to her to someone who was her friend her mentor and who at this moment would not fight back would not care to fight back and would think do with me as you will and she could not let that happen to lynley the car did not start it would not start barbara heard herself shriek she leaped out she slammed the door behind her she dashed across the carpark she thought how hed been heading to the bentley had been near to the bentley so there was a chance and hed dropped the keys as hed fallen hed dropped the keys she grabbed them up with a sob of gratitude that she forced herself to quell and then she was in the bentley her hands were shaking it took a century to get the key into the ignition but then the car was starting and she was trying to get the damn seat into a place where she could reach the accelerator and the brake because his legs were long because he was nearly a foot taller than she she jerked the car into gear and reversed it and prayed that the killer was being careful careful careful because the last thing he would want was to attract attention to his driving hed turned left she did the same she revved the engine of the huge car and it leapt ahead like a welltrained thoroughbred and she swore as she gained control over it control over her reactions control over her exhaustion which was no longer exhaustion at all but raging adrenaline and the need to stop this bugger in his tracks arrange a little surprise for the bastard bring out a hundred cops if necessary and all of them armed so that they could storm his bloody little mobile killing site and he couldnt hurt lynley while the van was in motion so she knew she was all right until it stopped but she needed to let the cops know where she was heading so the moment she finally caught sight of kilfoyles van crossing westminster bridge she reached for the mobile and realised it was back in the mini along with her bag left where shed thrown them when shed leapt into her car her call to incomplete she shouted shit shit and knew that barring a miracle she was on her own you and me babe lynleys life in the balance because that was it wasnt it this was going to be the pièce de résistance you bloody sod this was going to put your miserable name in lightsyou would kill the cop who was looking for you and you would do to him what youd done to the others and as he was he could not fight back and as hed been in the carpark he wouldnt care about fighting to save himself and you know that dont you just as you knew where to find him you sod because youd read the papers and youd watched the telly and now you were going to have real fun she didnt know where they were the bugger was good when it came to rat runs but hed be good wouldnt he because he bicycled and he knew the streets he knew the byways he knew the whole flaming town they were heading northeast that was all she could tell she stayed behind as far as she dared without losing him altogether she drove without headlights which he could not do if he wanted to look normal casual just going from point a to point b in all innocence at whatever time it was which felt like two in the morning or later she couldnt risk stopping at a phone box or grabbing up a pedestrianhad there even been oneand demanding the use of his mobile all she could do was remain in pursuit and think feverishly of what she could do when she got to wherever the hell they were going which she knew would be the spot where hed killed the others and then transported their bodies so where do you plan to place lynleys you piece of filth but that would not happen even if the superintendent welcomed it in his present state because she would not allow it because although that bugger had the weapons she had surprise and she bloody well intended to use it only what was it that was the surprise other than her presence which was going to mean sweet fa to this bastard with his stun gun his knives his duct tape his restraints his bloody sodding oils and his marks on the forehead wheel brace in the boot of the bentley that was what it boiled down to and what the hell was she supposed to do with that dont you fucking touch him or ill swing this thing at your miserable head while im dodging your stun gun and youre leaping upon me with your carving knife how was that going to work up ahead he turned once more and it looked like a final time theyd been driving and driving at least twenty minutes and possibly longer just before the turn theyd crossed over a river which damn well wasnt the thames way up here when way up here was far north and east of where theyd begun then theyd passed an outdoor storage facility at the northeast edge of the river and shed thought hes got a bloody lockup where he does the job just like wed thought at some point along the route thats brought us to this miserable moment but he passed the storage facility with its neat row of lockups lined up along the river and instead he pulled into a carpark just beyond it was large vast when she compared it to where hed been parked at st thomas hospital above it was a sign that finally told her where they were lea valley ice centre essex wharf they were at the river lea the ice centre was an indoor skating rink looking like an antique quonset hut it sat some fifty yards off the road and kilfoyle drove to the left of it where the carpark made a dogleg that possessed two distinct advantages for a killer it was overgrown with evergreen shrubbery and the streetlamp above it was broken when the van was parked there it was completely in shadow no one driving by would see it from the street the vans lights went out barbara waited for a moment to see if kilfoyle planned to emerge if he dragged his victim out and did his stuff in the bushesonly how the hell could he burn someones hands in the bushes no she thought hed do it inside he had no need to depart his mobile execution site he just had to find a spot where no one was likely to hear any noise coming from the van a spot where no one was likely ever to see the van hed do his stuff and then go on his way which meant she had to do her business first shed been idling the bentley at the kerb but now she slowly pulled into the carpark herself she watched and waited for some sort of sign like the slight motion of the vehicle as kilfoyle moved round inside it she got out of the car although she left it running she looked for somethingfor anything she could use surprise was the only thing she had she reminded herself what then constituted the biggest surprise she could give the sodding freak she went over the details feverishly what they knew and everything they had tried to guess he restrained them so hed be doing that now for the drive hed have placed lynley where he could zap him with the stun gun whenever he seemed to be coming to his senses but now hed be restraining him and in the restraint came the hope of salvation for as the restraints immobilised lynley so did they protect him and thats what she wanted protection gave her the answer she needed lynley was aware of his inability to order his body to move what was gone from him was the messagetoaction workings of his brain nothing was natural he had to think about moving his arm instead of just moving it but it didnt move anyway the same for his legs his head felt unduly heavy and somewhere his muscles were being told to shortcircuit it felt as if his nerve endings were in warfare he was aware also of darkness and movement when he managed to focus his eyes on something he was also aware of warmth the warmth attached itself to movementnot his unfortunatelyand through a haze he saw that he was not alone a figure lay in the gloom and he was sprawled upon it half on a body and half on the floor of the van he knew it was a van he knew it was the van in the instant in which his name was called quietly from the shadows in which hed turned and thought it was a reporter whod come to be the first to interview the nonhusband and nonfather he had just become one part of his brain told him something wasnt right then hed seen the torch in the extended hand and hed known whom he was looking at after that hed been struck by the bolt of current and it was over he didnt know how many times hed been hit with the stun gun during the journey to wherever they were when the van finally stopped what he did know was that the bolts hit him with a regularity that suggested the administrator knew how long a victims disorientation was likely to last when the van stopped and its engine shut off the man who had called himself fu climbed into the rear stungun torch in his hand he applied it to lynley another time in the businesslike manner of a doctor administering a necessary injection and the next time lynley came to his senses and finally felt as if his muscles might be his own once more he found that he was bound to the inside wall of the van hanging downward by his armpits and his wrists legs bent so that his ankles could also be bound to the wall behind him the bindings felt like leather straps but they could have been anything he couldnt see them what he could see was the woman source of the earlier warmth hed felt she lay bound on the floor of the van arms stretched out to either side in the manner of a horizontal crucifixion the cross itself was there as well represented by a board on which she was lying she had duct tape patched across her mouth her eyes were open wide in terror terror was good lynley managed to think terror was much better than resignation as he looked at her she seemed to sense his gaze she turned her head he saw that she was the woman from colossus but in his present state he couldnt recall her name that suggested to him that barbara havers had been right all along in her inimitable stubborn bloodyminded way the killer in the van with them was one of the men who worked for colossus the man fu was getting everything ready primarily himself hed lit a candle and stripped and he was anointing his naked body with a substancethis would be the ambergris wouldnt itthat he took from a small brown vial next to him was the cooker that muwaffaq masoud had described to them in hayes it was heating up a large pan from which the scent of previously burnt meat gave off a faint odour he was actually humming it was all in a nights work for him they were in his power and the manifestation of power and the execution of power were what he wanted out of life on the floor of the van the woman made a pitiful sound from beneath the duct tape fu turned at this and in the light lynley saw that he looked vaguely familiar that he possessed that quintessential and very english face of substantial pointed nose rounded chin and breaddough cheeks he could have been a hundred thousand men on the street but in him the strain had mutated somehow so he was not a bland little individual working at an ordinary job and going home to the wife and the children every evening in a terrace house somewhere but rather he was who circumstances in life had altered him to be someone who liked to kill people fu said i wouldnt have chosen you ulrike i rather like you it was actually my mistake ever to mention dad but when you started asking for alibisand it was fairly obvious that was what you were doing by the wayi knew i had to tell you something youd be happy with sitting home alone would never have cut the mustard would it the alone part would have made you curious he looked down on her completely friendly i mean you would have been all over that prhaps even telling the coppers about it and then where would we be he brought out the knife he took it from the little work top where the propane cooker was merrily heating not only the pan but the van itself now lynley could feel the warmth undulating across to him fu said it was meant to be one of the boys i thought mark connor you know him dont you likes to hang round in reception with jack little rapist in the making you ask me he needs sorting ulrike they all need sorting proper little gobshites they are need discipline and no one gives that to them makes one wonder what kind of parents they have parenting you know is essential to development will you excuse me for a moment he turned back to the cooker he took up the candle and held it to various points on his body it came to lynley that this was a hieratic ritual he was watching and he was meant to be watching like a worshipper at church he wanted to speak but his mouth too was covered with tape he tested the bindings that held his wrists to the side of the van they were immovable fu turned again he stood there quite naturally in his nudity his body glistening where hed used the oil on it he held up the candle and saw that lynley was watching him he reached for something on the work top again lynley thought it would be the torch to stun him once more but it was instead a small brown bottle not the one hed been using but another that he took from a little cupboard and held up so that lynley would be sure to see it something new superintendent he said after ulrike ill switch to parsley triumph you see and therell be much cause for it for triumph for me that is for you well i dont expect youve much to feel grand about at this moment have you but youre curious still and who can blame you you want to know dont you you want to understand he knelt by ulrike but he looked at lynley adultery nowadays its nothing shed actually go to gaol for but itll do nicely she would have touched himintimately ulrike it would have been intimately wouldnt itso like the others her hands bear the stain of her sin he looked down at ulrike i expect youre sorry for that arent you darling he smoothed her hair yes yes youre sorry so youll be released i promise you that when its over your soul will fly to heaven ill keep a bit of you with mesnip snip and youre minebut at that point you wont feel it you wont feel a thing lynley saw that the young woman had begun to cry she struggled wildly against her restraints but the effort only exhausted her fu watched her placid and smoothed her hair once again when she was finished it has to happen he said kindly try to understand and do know that i like you ulrike actually i quite liked them all you have to suffer of course but thats what life is suffering through whatever were handed and this is whats been handed to you the superintendent here will bear witness and then hell pay for his own sins as well so youre not alone ulrike you can take comfort from that cant you the toying with her lynley saw was giving the man pleasure actual physical pleasure this however seemed to embarrass him it would doubtless make him feel like one of the others and he wouldnt like that the indication that he too was of warped human stock like every other psychopath who had gone before him getting a sexual kick from anothers terror and pain he picked up his trousers and donned them pushing his phallus out of view but it seemed that the fact of his arousal altered him he became all business the friendly chat put behind him he sharpened the knife he spat into the pan to test the heat of it from a rack he took a length of thin line that he heldone end in each handand snapped expertly as if to test its strength down to work then he said when he was fully prepared barbara studied the van from the farthest end of the carpark some sixty yards away she tried to think what the inside might be like if hed killed the boys and sliced them open within the vehiclewhich she was certain hed donethat called for space space in which to lay someone out which meant the back of the van obvious no but how exactly was one of these bloody vehicles structured she wondered where were its most vulnerable points and where the most secure she didnt know and she didnt have the time to find out she climbed back into the bentley and she adjusted the seat far back now as far as it would go this would make it difficult for her to drive but she wasnt going a great distance she fastened her safety belt she revved the motor she said sorry sir and changed the car from park to drive fu said to ulrike weve had judgement already havent we and i can see both admission and repentance in your tears so well go on directly to punishment darling from punishment you see purification comes lynley watched as fu removed the pan from the stove he saw him smile kindly down at the struggling woman he too struggled but it was to no avail dont fu told them both itll make everything worse and then directly to ulrike anyway darling trust me on this its going to hurt me far worse than itll ever hurt you he knelt beside her and placed the pan on the floor he reached for her hand untied it and held it tight he considered it for a moment then kissed it and the side of the van exploded the airbag deployed smoke filled the car barbara coughed and fumbled frantically with the fastening on her safety belt she managed to release it and she stumbled from the car sore of chest and hacking to clear her lungs when she got her breath back she looked at the bentley and realised then that what shed thought was smoke was actually some sort of powder the airbag who knew the important thing was that nothing was on fire neither the bentley nor the van although neither was the same as it had been shed aimed for the drivers door shed hit it dead centre thirtyeight miles an hour had done the job the speed had destroyed the front of the bentley and sent the van spinning into the shrubbery what faced her now was the rear of the van its single window staring and black he had the weapons but she had surprise she went forward to see what surprise had wrought the sliding door was on the passengers side it was open barbara yelled cops kilfoyle youre finished step outside nothing in response he had to be unconscious she moved carefully she looked round her as she went it was dark as pitch but her eyes were adjusting the shrubbery was thick gnarling from the ground right into the carpark and she made her way along it to the open van door she saw figures unaccountably two of them and a candle guttering on its side on the floor she righted this and it shed light in a glow that allowed her to find him lynley hung limply from his arms and his wrists bolted like a piece of meat to the side of the van on the floor ulrike ellis lay bound shed wet herself the smell of piss was rank in the air barbara stepped over her and got to lynley he was conscious she saw and she sent a broken prayer of gratitude heavenward she ripped the piece of duct tape from his mouth crying did he hurt you are you hurt where is he sir lynley said see to the woman the woman and barbara left him to go to her she saw that a heavy frying pan lay next to ulrike and for a moment she thought the bastard had bashed her with it and she was finished altogether but when she knelt and felt for a pulse it was fast and steady she ripped the duct tape from ulrikes mouth she unbound her left hand she said sir where is he is he here where the van lurched lynley shouted barbara behind you and the bastard was there back in the van and coming towards her and god damn but didnt he have something in his hand it looked like a torch but she couldnt believe it was a torch since it wasnt on and anyway he was storming at her and barbara grabbed the only thing within reach she leaped to her feet just as he lunged he missed her fell forward she was more fortunate she swung the frying pan and brained him on the back of the head he fell over ulrike but that didnt matter barbara brained him a second time for good measure chapter thirtyfour nkata arrived at the police station on lower clapton road in record time he found it not overly far from hackney marsh in an area of town hed never before seen an old redbrick victorian affair the station looked like something bobby peel might emerge from at any moment and at this early hour it was still lit up as if for night exterior lights thwarting the wouldbe terrorists unheard of in the s what had awakened him was his mobile phone ringing with barb havers on the other end shed said tersely its kilfoyle winnie weve got the bugger lower clapton road if you want to be in on things do you hed said what i thought you went to tell the super kilfoyle was there he snatched him out of the carpark i followed andbloody hell i wrecked his bentley win but it was the only way you telling me you saw the guv get snatched and dint ring for help fuck all barb i couldnt but winnie stuff a sock in it if you want to be in on things get over here now theyve got him in a cell while they wait for john stewart to get here but theyll let us talk to him in advance if the duty solicitor gets here first so dyou want in im on my way hed banged round in the dark in his haste to be gone which had roused his mother shed come storming out of her bedroom with a tatting hook held aloftgod only knew what shed intended to do with itand when shed seen him she demanded to know what in the name of jamaica he was doing out here at four thirtytwo oclock in the morning you just gettin in shed cried just going out hed said without your breakfast you sit down and let me do a proper fryup for you cant mum case is closing and i want to be there for it only so much time before i get muscled aside by the higherups so hed grabbed his coat kissed her cheek and hed taken off sprinting down the corridor hurtling down the stairs dashing to his car he had a general sense of where the police station was lower clapton road was just north of hackney now he hustled into reception where he gave his name and showed his identification the special on duty placed a call somewhere and in less than two minutes barb havers came to fetch him she brought him into the picture quickly what shed seen in the carpark of st thomas hospital her miserable wreck of a flaming worthless mini breaking down her appropriation of lynleys bentley the lea valley ice centre the hurried plan the crash of the bentley into the van finding lynley and ulrike ellis within it the brief confrontation with the killer himself he didnt count on the frying pan barbara concluded i couldve hit him round six times more but the super shouted id bashed him enough where is he the guv in casualty thats where we all went when triple nine got these blokeswith a gesture round her to indicate their colleagues from the lower clapton road stationover there kilfoyled hit him with the stun gun so much they wanted to watch him for a while same for ulrike and kilfoyle buggers heads like a brick wall winnie i didnt break anything mores the pity hes probably got concussion a contusion whatever but his vocal cords are operable so hes doing just fine s far as were concerned oh and i got him with the stun gun s well she grinned couldnt resist police brutality and proud to have it written on my tombstone here we are she shouldered open the door to an interview room inside robbie kilfoyle sat with a duty solicitor who was speaking to him urgently nkatas first thought was that kilfoyle didnt in fact look very much like any efit theyd come up with during the course of the investigation he bore only a mild resemblance to the man seen lurking round square four gym where sean lavery worked out and he bore no resemblance at all to the man whod bought the van from muwaffaq masoud late the previous summer had he in fact even been that man so much for peoples memories nkata thought robson on the other hand and for his sins had been fairly close to the mark from the start with his profiling of the serial killer and the meagre facts they were able to glean from kilfoylewhen the duty solicitor wasnt telling him to mind what he said or to plug his mug altogetherconfirmed this kilfoyles age of twentyseven was dead within range and his circumstances werent far off either mum deceased hed lived with his dad till the older man had dropped dead in late summer that wouldve been the stressor nkata reckoned because the first of the killings started not long afterwards they already knew that his past fit the profile with truancy problems peeping tom allegations and awol concerns in his record but in the limited time they had with him prior to di john stewarts arrival to take over they saw that the rest of the details were going to come from the evidence that would be gleaned from his home possibly from the environs of the icerink carpark and from his van the van was waiting for the arrival of soco the environs of the icerink carpark were waiting for full daylight that left his house in granville square nkata suggested they check it out barb was reluctant to leave the bloody sod but she agreed to do so they met di stewart on the way out he already had his clipboard in hand and the parting in his razorcut hair might have been put there with a straight edge there were still comb marks in it as well he nodded at them both he directed his comments to barb well done havers doubtless youll be reinstated now back to rank for what its worth i approve how is he nkata knew the di wasnt referring to kilfoyle barb answered the question in casualty for now i expect theyll release him in a few hours i phoned his mum shell fetch him or his sister will theyre both here in london and otherwise barb shook her head hes not saying much stewart nodded and looked bleakly at the police building barbs face altered and nkata could see she was thinking she could almost like the bloke for the instant in which hed actually evidenced a modicum of compassion poor bloody sod stewart murmured and then to them in his usual tone carry on have something to eat ill see you later a meal was not of interest to them they made their way instead to granville square by the time they got there it had come to life a crimescene van parked out front hailed socos presence within and curious neighbours gathered on the pavement nkata flashed his id at the constable at the front door explained why barb didnt have hers and got them both inside within more of the pieces of the killers personality became revealed in the basement a neat stack of newspapers and tabloids displayed stories that chronicled kilfoyles exploits and an a to z sitting on a nearby table xmarkedthespots hed carefully selected to deposit bodies upstairs the kitchen contained a wide variety of knivesall being tagged and bagged by socowhile over the chairs in the sitting room lay the same sort of tattingedged mats that had been used to fashion a flimsy and respectful codpiece for kimmo thorne everywhere tidiness reigned the place was in fact a testament to tidiness only in one room were there signsother than with the newspapers and the a to zthat an extremely unsteady mind was at work in a bedroom upstairs a dated wedding picture had been defaced with the shaggyhaired groom disemboweled by means of pen and ink and the same mark upon his forehead as had been made as the signature of the letter kilfoyle had sent to new scotland yard in the wardrobe as well a disturbed hand had slit every male garment down its centre didnt care for dad much by the looks of things did he barb remarked a voice spoke from the doorway thought you two might want to see this before we cart it off one of the whitesuited forensicteam members stood there an urn in his hands it was a funeral urn by the look and the size of it suitable for containing human ashes whatve you got nkata asked his souvenirs ill wager he carried the urn to the chest of drawers on which the wedding picture stood he tipped off its top they looked inside human dust formed the majority of the contents along with several ashcovered lumps barb was the one who twigged what they were the navels she said whose ashes dyou expect those are dads could be the queen mums for all i care nkata remarked we got the bastard the families could be given the news now there would be no satisfactory justice for them there never was but there would be a conclusion nkata drove barb back to st thomas hospital to arrange for her car to be towed away and put into running order again there they parted and when they did neither of them looked at the hospital itself nkata headed towards new scotland yard it was nine in the morning by then and traffic was slow he was negotiating parliament square when his mobile rang he reckoned it was barb all attempts at coping with her car a failure but a glance told him the number was not one he knew so he said nkata and nothing else you arrested him then it was on the news this morning radio one a womans voice spoke familiar but not one hed heard on the phone before whos this im glad its over and i know you meant good towards him towards us i know that winston winston yas he said i knew it before but i dint want to look at what that meant unnerstan i still dont want to look at it i mean he considered this considered the fact shed phoned at all cn you give it a glance you think she was silent a glances not much innit just a flick when you move the eyes thas all not looking at nothin really yas just sneaking a look thas it thas all i dont know was what she finally said which was better than things had been before when you do know you ring me then he told her waitins not a trouble to me lynley reckoned that one of the reasons they forced him to stay in casualty was their worry that he would do something to kilfoyle if they released him and the truth was that he would have done something although not what they obviously thought he would do instead he would merely have asked a question of the man why and perhaps that question would have led to others why helen and not me and why in the way he had done it with a boy in his company what sort of statement did that make power indifference sadism pleasure to destroy as many lives as possible in as many ways as possible in one swift blow because he knew the end was coming was that why hed be famous now infamous notorious with all the attendant bells and whistles hed be up there with the best of the best those names like hindley that would forever light the firmament of iniquity avid followers of crime would flock to his trial and writers would document him in their books and he would thus never fade from public memory like an ordinary man or for that matter like an innocent woman and her unborn child both dead now and soon to become yesterdays news obviously those in power had believed that lynley would spring to the attack if he came facetoface with the monster again but springing to the attack suggested a life force within driving one forward that was gone from him now they said they would release him to a relative and since they had his clothing tucked away somewhere he was forced to wait until a member of his family arrived they had no doubt suggested in their phone call to eaton terrace that that person take as long as possible in making the trip to the hospital so it was midmorning when his mother came to fetch him she had peter with her a taxi she said was just outside whats happened she looked older to him than she had days earlier he understood from this that the experience in living chaos which they all were enduring was taking a toll on her as well he hadnt thought of that before he wondered what it meant that he thought of it now beyond their mother lynleys brother stood lanky and ill at ease as always theyd been close once but that was years in the past with cocaine and alcohol and fraternal abandonment leering like spectres in the space between them too much disease ran through his family lynley thought part of it of the body the rest of it of the mind peter said you all right tommy and lynley saw his brothers hand reach out then drop uselessly to his side they wouldnt tell us on the phonejust to fetch you they said we thoughtthey said youd come from near the river but up herewhat river what were you his brother was afraid lynley thought another possible loss in his life and peter did not know how hed cope with that if he had no crutch to lean upon up the nose in a vein out of the bottle whatever peter didnt want that but it was always out there beckoning to him lynley said im all right peter i didnt try anything i wont try anything although he knew that latter statement was neither a promise nor a lie peter chewed on the inside of his lip a habit from his childhood he gave a nervous nod lynley explained what had happened in two simple sentences hed had an encounter with the killer barbara havers had taken care of matters remarkable woman lady asherton said she is lynley replied he discovered that ulrike ellis had been released to the police several hours earlier to make her statement she was shaken he learned but otherwise unharmed kilfoyle had done nothing save stun her gag her and restrain her that was bad enough but so far from what it could have been that it was ludicrous to suggest she would not recover in the taxi he sank into a corner his mother next to him and his brother perched on the jump seat opposite he said to peter tell him scotland yard and his mother protested with youre to come straight home he shook his head tell him and nodded towards the driver peter leaned to the opening in the shield between driver and passengers he said victoria street new scotland yard and after that eaton terrace the driver swerved into the street with the flow of traffic and headed in the direction of westminster we should have stayed with you at the hospital lady asherton murmured no lynley said you did what i asked he looked out of the window ill want to bury them at howenstow i think thats what she would have wanted we never discussed it there was no need but id like he felt his mothers hand take his of course she said i dont know when yet i didnt think to ask when theyd release theher body there are all sorts of details well handle things tommy his brother said all of them let us lynley looked at him peter was leaning forward closer to him than hed been in ages slowly he nodded his agreement some of them then he said thank you they rode the rest of the way in silence when the taxi made the turn from victoria street into broadway lady asherton spoke again she said will you let one of us come in with you tommy theres no need he told her ill be all right mum he waited till they drove off before he entered then he went inside not to victoria block but to tower block he made his way to hilliers office judi macintosh looked up from her work like his mother she seemed to be able to read him and it appeared that what she read was accurate for he had not come for a confrontation she said superintendent iall of us herei cant imagine what youre going through she held her hands at her throat as if beseeching him to relieve her of saying anything more he said thank you and he wondered how many more times he would have to thank people in the coming months indeed he wondered what he was even thanking them for his breeding called for this expression of gratitude when he wanted instead to raise his head and shriek into the eternal night that was falling round him he despised good breeding but even despising it he relied upon it again when he said would you tell him im here id like a word it wont take long she nodded rather than phone into hilliers office however she went through the door she closed it softly behind her a minute passed another they were probably phoning someone to come up nkata again perhaps john stewart someone capable of restraining him someone to escort him from the premises judi macintosh returned do go in she said hillier wasnt in his usual position behind the desk he wasnt standing at one of the windows instead hed come across the carpet to meet lynley halfway he said quietly thomas you must go home and get some rest you cant continue i know lynley couldnt recall the last time hed slept hed been running on anxiety and adrenaline for so long he no longer remembered what it felt like to be doing otherwise he removed his warrant card and every other vestige of police identification that he had upon him he extended them to the assistant commissioner hillier looked at them but did not take them i wont accept this he said youve not been thinking straight youre not thinking straight now i cant allow you to make a decision like this believe me sir lynley cut in ive made far more difficult decisions he passed hillier then and went to his desk he lay his identification upon it thomas hillier said dont do this take some time off take compassionate leave with everything thats happened you cant be in a position to decide your future or anyone elses lynley felt the hollowness of a laugh rising in him he could decide he had decided he wanted to say that he didnt know any longer how to be let alone who to be he wanted to explain he was good for no one and nothing now and he did not know if things would ever be any different instead what he said was for my part of what went between us sir i am most deeply regretful thomas the tone of hilliers voicewas it pained it actually sounded sostopped him at the door he turned hillier said where will you go to cornwall he said im taking them home hillier nodded then he said something more as lynley opened the door he couldnt have been certain what the words were but later he would think theyd been go with god outside in the anteroom barbara havers was waiting she looked done in and it came to lynley that at this point shed been working more than twentyfour hours straight she said sir im fine barbara you neednt have come up im to take you somewhere where justtheyre suggesting i drive you home ive a car on loan so you wont have to cram yourself into my heap thats fine then lynley said lets go he felt her hand on his elbow guiding him from the office to the lift she spoke to him as they went along and he gathered from her words that there was evidence aplenty to link kilfoyle to the deaths of the colossus boys and the rest he asked her as the lift doors opened on the underground carpark what about the rest and she spoke of hamish robson and then of the boy in lockup at the harrow road station robsons was a crime of necessity and opportunity she said as for the boy in harrow road he wouldnt say but theres no connection at all between him and colossus havers said as they reached the car they continued talking over its roof her on one side and him on the other it looks likesir it looks to everyone like a oneoff street crime he wont talkthis kid but were thinking its a gang he looked at her she seemed underwater to him and at a great distance a gang doing what she shook her head i dont know but you have an idea you must tell me cars unlocked sir barbara tell me she opened her door but didnt climb inside it couldve been an initiation sir he needed to prove something to someone and helen was there she was justthere lynley knew from this there was supposed to come absolution for himself but he could not feel it he said take me to harrow road then she said you dont need to take me to harrow road barbara she gazed at him and then got into the car she started it up she said the bentley you put it to good use he told her well done constable its to be sergeant again she said finally he said sergeant and he felt his lips curve slightly well done sergeant havers her own lips trembled and he saw her chin dimple she said right well she got them out of the carpark and on their way if she worried that he was going to do something rash she gave no sign of it instead she told him how ulrike ellis had got herself into the company of robbie kilfoyle and from there she went on to say that the announcement of the arrest had been handed over to john stewart to make before the media once nkata refused to do it stewarts moment of glory sir was how she concluded i think hes been waiting for stardom for years keep on his good side lynley told her i dont want to think of you with enemies in the future she glanced at him he could see what she feared he wished he could tell her the situation was otherwise in the harrow road station lynley told her what he wanted she listened nodded and in an act of friendship he welcomed with gratitude she did not try to talk him out of it when strings had been pulled and arrangements had been made she came to fetch him as shed done in victoria street she walked along at his side her hand lightly upon his elbow she said in here sir and opened a door to a dimly lit room beyond it on the other side of the twoway mirror helens killer sat theyd given him a plastic bottle of juice but he hadnt opened it he had his hands clasped round it and his shoulders were slumped lynley felt a large breath leave him all he could say was young so young good christ in heaven hes twelve years old sir why there was no answer and he knew she knew he did not expect one he said whats happened to us barbara what in gods name and he also knew she knew he wanted no reply still she said will you let me take you home now he said yes you can take me home it was late in the afternoon when he went to cheyne row deborah answered the door wordlessly she held it open for him to enter they stood facing each otherlongago lovers that they wereand deborah gazed as if to make a study of him before she straightened her shoulders in what seemed to be resolve and said in here tommy simons not home he didnt tell her hed come to see her not his friend because she seemed to know this she took him into the dining room where in what seemed like another century shed been wrapping the baby gift for helen on the table folded neatly upon the carrier bags which had held them lay the christening outfits that deborah and helen had bought deborah said it seemed to me that youd want to see them before iwell before i took them back to the shops i dont know why i thought that but as it was the last thing she didi hope i was right they were helen all of them her whimsical statement about what was truly important and what was decidedly not here was the tiny dinner jacket shed spoken of there a miniature clown costume next to it white velvet dungarees an impossibly tiny threepiece suit an equally tiny babygro fashioned into a bunny costumethe assortment was appropriate to anything but a christening but that had been helens point well start our own tradition darling neither side of our subtly battling families can possibly be offended by that lynley said i couldnt let them do what they wanted to do i couldnt face it shed become a specimen to them a few months on life support sir and well see how everything turns out could be bad could be worse but in the meantime well have pushed the envelope of medical science one for the journals this will be one for the books he looked at deborah her eyes were bright but she gave him the gift of not weeping he said i couldnt do that to her deborah i couldnt so i shut things down i shut them down last night yes oh tommy i dont know how to live with myself without blame she said thats how you must do it you as well he told her promise me that what that you wont live a single moment thinking that this was your fault that you could have done something to stop what happened to prevent it to anything you were parking a car thats all you were doing parking a car i want you to see it that way because its the truth will you do that for me ill try she said when barbara havers arrived home that evening she spent thirty minutes cruising up and down streets waiting for someone to vacate a parking space at a time of day when most people were at home for the duration of the night she finally found a space in winchester road nearly all the way to south hampstead and she took it gratefully despite the fact that a lengthy slog awaited her once she locked up and began plodding back to eton villas as she walked she realised how much she ached her muscles were sore from her legs up to her neck but particularly in her shoulders the wrecking of the bentley had had a greater impact than shed felt in the immediate aftermath clubbing robbie kilfoyle with the frying pan hadnt helped had she been a different sort of woman she would have decided a nice massage was in order steam room sauna whirlpool the whole experience throw in a manicure and pedicure as well but she was not that sort of woman she told herself that a shower would do and a good nights sleep since shed gone without for some thirtyseven hours and counting she kept her mind on that up to fellows road and along the way she fixed her thoughts on showering and dropping into bed she decided she wouldnt even turn on the lights in her bungalow lest anything keep her from her appointed rounds which were defined by a journey from front door to dining table drop off ones belongings from dining table to bathroom turn on the shower shed clothes onto the floor let water beat upon throbbing muscles and from bathroom to bed the embrace of morpheus this allowed her not to think of what she didnt want to think about that he hadnt told her that shed had to learn it from di stewart she lectured herself about the way she felt which was cut off and drifting into space she told herself that his private life was none of her bloody business anyway she pointed out to herself that his pain would have been intolerable and to speak of itto confide that he had ended things and with them his life as hed known it and seen it weaving a future for him for her for them as a little familywould probably have finished him off but all her selftalk did was provide a thin patina of guilt over her other feelings and all the guilt did was momentarily silence the child within her who kept insisting they were supposed to be friends friends told each other things important things friends leaned on each other because they were friends but the news had come to the incident room via dorothea harriman whod asked for the ear of di stewart whod then made a sombre general announcement no one knew about funeral arrangements hed said in conclusion but hed keep them informed in the meantime though carry on you lot therere reports to be made to the cps on more than one front so lets make them because i want this signed sealed and delivered in such a way that no doubt exists in anyones mind what kind of verdict the jurys intended to hand down barbara had sat there and listened shed been unable to prevent herself from thinking that theyd been together from hilliers office to harrow road and from harrow road to eaton terrace and lynley had never said hed turned off his wifes life support she knew it was not what she ought to be thinking she knew his decision to keep the information to himself was not about her yet still she felt a sorrow renewed rush over her that child inside her kept insisting were meant to be friends why they were not and could never be at the end of the day was the fault not of who they wereman woman colleaguesbut of who they were beneath all that this had been both determined and defined before either one of them had seen the first light of day she could rail against it till the end of time but she could not change it certain strands of certain fabrics made the fabric itself too strong to be torn in eton villas at last she turned up the drive and in through the gate hadiyyah she saw was heaving a rubbish sack along the path to the bins at the back of the building and barbara watched her struggling with it for a moment before she said hey kiddo cn i help barbara her voice was bright as ever her head lifted and her plaits swung round dad and i have cleaned out the fridge he says springs coming and thiss our first step to welcome it cleaning the fridge that is course that means that were going to be cleaning the rest of the flat next and im not much looking forward to that hes making a list of what were to do a list barbara and washing walls is at the top of it that sounds pretty bad mummy used to wash them every year so thats why were doing it so when she comes home everythingll be nice and sparkling for her coming home then is she your mum oh my goodness eventually one cant be on holiday forever no i expect youre right barbara handed over her shoulder bag to the little girl and took the rubbish from her she heaved it like a duffel and manoeuvred it to the bins together they heavehoed it to join the rest of the rubbish im going to have tap lessons hadiyyah told her as they brushed themselves off dad said so tonight im ever so pleased because ive wanted them for ages will you come to watch me when i do my exhibition frontrow centre barbara said i love exhibitions brilliant she said prhaps mummyll be there as well if i get good enough shell come i know it night barbara got to get back to dad she scooted off round the corner of the house barbara waited till she heard a door shut telling her her little friend was safely inside then she went to her own digs and unlocked the door true to her decision she turned on no lights she merely walked to the table dumped her belongings and turned to head for the shower and its blessed heat the damn answering machine stopped her with its blinking light she thought about ignoring it but knew she couldnt she sighed and made her way across to it she punched the button and heard the familiar voice barbie dear ive got the appointment mrs flo barbara thought her mothers keeper my lord it wasnt easy to get one the nhs being what it is these days now i do have to tell you that mums gone back to the blitz but i dont want you to worry about it if we must sedate her we simply must my dear and thats all there is to it her health barbara cut off the message she would listen to the rest another time she vowed but not tonight a hesitant knock sounded on her front door she crossed back to it shed not switched on a single interior light so she reckoned only one person knew she was finally at home she opened the door and he stood before her a covered pan in his hand azhar said i believe you have not had your dinner barbara and extended the pan in her direction she said hadiyyah told me you were cleaning out the fridge are these leftovers if yours are anything like mine azhar id be taking my life in my hands to eat them he smiled this is freshly made pilau to which ive added chicken he lifted the lid in the dim light she couldnt see the contents but she could smell their fragrance her mouth watered hours days weeks since shed had a decent meal she said cheers shll i take it then if i might set it down course she held the door open wider but still did not turn on the light at this point it had more to do with the terminal disarray of her digs than with a desire for sleep azhar she knew was akin to a neat freak on steroids she didnt trust the strength of his heart if he saw the mess shed not dealt with in weeks he placed the pan in the kitchen area on the work top she waited by the door assuming hed leave after that he didnt instead he said your case is concluded then the news is full of it this morning right or last night or somewhere in between i dont actually know things start running together after a while he nodded i see she waited for more more did not come a silence hung between them he finally broke it you have worked long with him havent you his voice was kind her insides gave warning she said lightly lynley yeah few years a decent enough bloke if you can get past that voice he finished school in the days before estuary english when they turned out toffs who did world tours and spent the rest of their lives chasing foxes round the countryside things are very bad for him she didnt reply instead she saw lynley at the front door to his house in eaton terrace she saw the door open before he could put his key in the lock his sister framed in the light from inside she waited thinking he might turn and wave a farewell but his sister put her arm round his waist and drew him within terrible things happen to very good people azhar said well yeah right she couldntand wouldnttalk about it too fresh too sore vinegar washing over open wounds she ran her hand back through her choppedup hair and gave a big sigh that he was meant to read as tiredwomanneedingherrestthankyou but hed been a fool only once in his life and hed learned to be a wiser man from that experience so she couldnt drive him off with theatrics she would have to be direct or stand there and tolerate what he had to say such a loss one does not recover completely from that yeah well i reckon thats right hes got a row to hoe and i dont envy him it his wife and the child there was a child the papers said helen was pregnant yeah and did you know her well she would not she said azhar and took an unsteady breath you see im knackered absolutely done in pickled dead on my the word the word itself and she stopped herself on it she strangled back a cry tears sprang to her eyes she brought a fist to her mouth leave she thought please go bloody leave but he didnt do that and she saw that he wouldnt that hed come for a reason beyond what she could at that moment comprehend she waved a hand at him waved him off and away but he didnt do as she hoped he would do instead he crossed the small room to her said only barbara and took her into his arms she began to weep then like the child shed been and the woman shed become it seemed the safest place to do so
