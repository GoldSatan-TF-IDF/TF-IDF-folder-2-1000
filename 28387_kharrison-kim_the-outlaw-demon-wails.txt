the outlaw demon wails kim harrison to the guy who knows the more things change the weirder it gets one i leaned over the glass counter squinting at the price of the highgrade redwood rods safe in their airtight glass coffins like snow white the ends of my scarf slipped to block my view and i tucked them behind my short leather jacket i had no call to be looking at wands i didnt have the money but more important i wasnt shopping for business todayi was shopping for pleasure rachel my mom said from halfway across the store smiling as she fingered a display of packaged organic herbs how about dorothy make jenks hairy and he could be toto no friggin way jenks exclaimed and i started when the pixy took off from my shoulder where hed been nestled in my scarf s warmth gold dust sifted from him to make a temporary sunbeam on the counter and brighten the drab evening im not going to spend halloween handing out candy as a dog and no wendy and tinker bell either im going as a pirate his wings slowed as he settled atop the counter next to the stand of lowgrade redwood dowels suitable for amulets coordinating costumes is stupid normally id agree but silent i drew back from the counter id never have enough disposable income for a wand besides versatility was key in my profession and wands were onespell wonders im going as the female lead in the latest vampire flick i said to my mom the one where the vampire hunter falls in love with the vamp youre going as a vampire hunter my mother asked warming i plucked an uninvoked amulet from a vanity rack to size my chest up i was hippy enough to pass for the actress i was trying to mimic but my excuse of a chest wouldnt match her spellenhanced bust and it had to be spell enhanced naturally bigchested women dont run like that no the vampire i said embarrassed ivy my housemate was going as the hunter and despite my agreement that coordinating costumes was stupid i knew ivy and i would stop conversation when we walked into the party and that was the point wasnt it halloween was the only time doppelgänger charms were legaland inderland and the braver slice of humanity made the most of it my mothers face went serious then cleared oh the blackhaired one right in the slut outfit good god i dont know if my sewing machine can go through leather mom i protested though used to her language and lack of tact if it came into her head it came out of her mouth i glanced at the clerk with her but she clearly knew my mother and wasnt fazed seeing a woman in tasteful slacks and an angora sweater swearing like a sailor tended to throw people off besides i already had the outfit in my closet frowning my mother fingered the charms to change hair color come over here honey lets see if they have anything that will touch your curls honestly rachel you pick the hardest costumes why cant you ever be anything easy like a troll or fairy princess jenks snickered cause thats not slutty enough he said loud enough for me to hear but not my mother i gave him a look and he simpered as he hovered backward to a rack of seeds though only about four inches tall he cut an attractive figure with his softsoled boots and the red scarf matalina his wife had knitted him wrapped about his neck last spring id used a demon curse to make him humansize and the memory of his eighteenyearold athletic figure with its trim waist and broad muscular shoulders made strong from his dragonflylike wings was still very much in my memory he was a very married pixy but perfection deserved attention jenks made a darting path over my basket and a package of fern seed for matalinas wing aches thumped in catching sight of the bust enhancer his expression turned positively devilish speaking of slutty he started wellendowed doesnt equal slutty jenks i said grow up its for the costume like thatll do anything his grin was infuriating and his hands were on his hips in his best peter pan pose you need two or three to even make an impression fried eggs shut up from across the store came my mothers oblivious solid black right i turned to see her hair color shifting as she touched the invoked sample amulets her hair was exactly like mine sort of i kept mine long the wild frizzy red just past my shoulders instead of in the close cut she used to tame hers but our eyes were the same green and i had her same skill in earth magic fleshed out and given a professional stamp at one of the local colleges she had more education than i did actually but had few opportunities to use it halloween had always been a chance for her to show off her considerable earth magic skills to the neighboring moms with a modest vengeance and i think she appreciated me asking for her help this year she had been doing great these last few months and i couldnt help but wonder if she was doing better because i was spending more time with her or if she simply appeared more stable because i wasnt seeing her just when she was having problems guilt slithered through me and giving jenks a glare at his song about bigbusted ladies tying their shoes i wove through the stands of herbs and racks sporting premade charms each having a distinctive sticker identifying who had made it charm crafting was still a cottage industry despite the high level of technology available to smooth out the rough spots but one tightly regulated and vigorously licensed the owner of the store probably only crafted a few of the spells she sold at my mothers direction i held each sample amulet in turn so she could evaluate my appearance the clerk ooohed and ahhed trying to push us into making a decision but my mom hadnt helped me with my costume in years and we were going to make an evening out of it ending with coffee and dessert at some overpriced coffeehouse it wasnt that i ignored my mom but my life tended to interfere a lot id been making an effort over the last three months to spend more time with her trying to ignore my own ghosts and hoping that she wouldnt be sofragile and she hadnt looked this good in a while which convinced me i was a crappy daughter finding the right hair color was easy and i nodded when my red curls turned a black so deep they were almost gunmetalblue satisfied i dropped a packaged uninvoked amulet into the basket to hide the bust enhancer ive a charm at home to straighten your hair my mother said brightly and i turned wonderingly to her id found out in fourth grade that overthecounter charms wouldnt touch my curls why on earth did she still have the difficulttomake charms i hadnt straightened my hair in ages the shops phone rang and when the clerk excused herself my mom sidled close smiling as she touched the braid jenkss kids had put my hair in this morning that charm took me your entire high school career to perfect she said you think im not going to practice it worried now i glanced at the woman on the phonethe one who obviously knew my mother mom i whispered you cant sell those you dont have a license lips pressed tightly she took my basket to the counter in a huff to check out exhaling my gaze went to jenks sitting on the rack and he shrugged i slowly followed in my mothers steps wondering if id neglected her more than i thought she did the damnedest things sometimes id talk to her about it over coffee honestly she should know better streetlights had come on while we had shopped and the pavement glowed with gold and purple holiday lights in the evening rain it looked cold and as i went to the register i adjusted my scarf for jenks thanks he muttered as he landed on my shoulder his wings were shivering and they brushed my neck as he settled in october was too cold for him to be out but with the garden dormant and matalina in need of fern seeds risking a trip in the rain to a charm shop had been his only recourse hed brave anything for his wife i thought as i rubbed my tickling nose how about the coffeehouse down two blocks my mom suggested as the dull beep beep of barcodes being read clashed with the earthy smells of the shop grab some air jenks im going to sneeze i warned him and muttering things i was just as glad not to hear he flew to my moms shoulder it was a marvelous sneeze clearing out my lungs and earning a bless you from the clerk but it was followed by another and i hardly had time to straighten when a third hit me breathing shallowly to forestall the next i looked at jenks in dismay there was only one reason why i would sneeze like this damn i whispered glancing out the huge front windowit was after sundown double damn i spun to the clerk who was now shoving things into a bag i didnt have my calling circle i had cracked the first one and the new one was sandwiched between spell books under my kitchen counter damn damn damn i should have made one the size of a compact mirror maam i warbled then accepted the tissue my mom handed me from her purse do you sell calling circles the woman stared clearly affronted absolutely not alice you told me she didnt deal in demons get her out of my store my mother let out a huff of annoyance then her face turned coaxing patricia she cajoled rachel does not summon demons the papers print what sells papers thats all i sneezed again this time so hard it hurt crap we had to get out of there heads up rachel jenks called out and i looked up to catch a cellophanewrapped stick of magnetic chalk as he dropped it fumbling with the wrapper i tried to remember the complex pentagram ceri had taught me minias was the only demon who knew i had a direct line to the everafter and if i didnt answer him he might cross the lines to find me searing pain came from nowhere doubled over i gasped at the assault and fell back from the counter what in hell it isnt supposed to hurt jenks hit the ceiling leaving behind a cloud of silver dust like an octopus inking my mother turned from her friend rachel she questioned her green eyes wide as i bent and clutched my wrist the chalk slipped from me as my grip went numb it felt like my wrist was on fire get out i yelled and the two women stared at me as if i had gone insane we all jumped when the air pressure shifted violently ears ringing i looked up my heart pounding and my breath held he was here i didnt see the demon but he was here somewhere i could smell the burnt amber spotting the chalk i scooped it up and picked at the cellophane but my nails couldnt find the seam i was torn between fear and anger minias had no business bothering me i didnt owe him and he didnt owe me and why couldnt i get the damned wrapper off the chalk rachel mariana morgan came an elegant british accent id expect from a shakespearean play and my face went cold where aaaaare you it drawled shit i whispered it wasnt minias it was al panicked i looked across the store to my mother she stood with her friend neat and tidy in her autumncolored outfit her hair perfectly arranged and the skin around her eyes just starting to show a few faint lines she hadnt a clue mom i whispered gesturing frantically as i put space between us get into a circle both of you but they just stared i didnt have time to explain hell i didnt understand it myself this had to be a joke some perverted twisted joke my eyes went to the darting clatter of jenks as he came to hover beside me its al the pixy whispered rache you said he was in demon prison rachel mariana mooooorgaaaaan the demon sang and i stiffened at the tapthunk tapthunk of his booted feet coming from behind a tall display of spelling books damn fool mosswipe of a pixy jenks berated himself its too cold to take my sword he said in a mocking falsetto itll freeze to my ass its a shopping trip not a run his voice shifted becoming angry tink save you rachel cant you even go shopping with your mom without calling up demons i didnt call him i protested feeling my palms start to sweat yeah well hes here the pixy said and i swallowed when the demon peeked from behind the display he had known exactly where i was al was smiling with deep taunting anger his red eyes their pupils horizontal slits like a goats peering over a pair of round smoked glasses dressed in his usual frock coat of crushed green velvet he was a picture of old european grace the image of a young lord on the verge of greatness lace showed at his cuffs and collar his aristocratically chiseled features with a strong nose and chin were tightened in bad humor and his thick teeth showed in an expression that anticipated dealing out pain i kept backing up and he came out from behind the display oh i say this is splendid he said in delight two morgans for the price of one oh god my mother terror snapped me out of my shock you cant touch me or my family i said while i tried to get the cellophane off the magnetic chalk if i could make a circle i might be able to trap him you promised the tapping of his boots stopped as he posed to show off his elegant grace my eyes measured the distance between us eight feet not good but if he was looking at me he was ignoring my mom i did didnt i he said and when he sent his gaze to the ceiling my shoulders eased rache jenks shrilled al lunged panicking i backpedaled fear hit hard when he found my throat i dug at his fingers my nails gouging him as he picked me up to dangle me from his grip his sculptured face grimaced at the pain but he only tightened his fingers my pulse pounded in my head and i went limp praying he wanted to gloat a little before he dragged me back to the everafter to hopefully just kill me you cant hurt me i squeaked out not sure if the sparkles at the edge of my vision were from lack of oxygen or jenks i am dead i am so dead a soft sound of satisfaction emanated from al a long low rumble of contentment he effortlessly pulled me close until our breaths mingled his eyes were red behind his glasses and the scent of burnt amber coursed through me i asked nicely for your testimony you refused ive no incentive to play by the rules anymore you can thank your own shortsightedness for that me sitting in a tiny little cell he gave me a shake to rattle my teeth stripped of my curses and naked but for what i can say or spell but someone summoned me out he said maliciously and we have a deal thats going to leave you dead and me a free demon it wasnt my fault you went to jail i squeaked the pulsing adrenaline hurt my head he couldnt take me to the everafter unless i let him hed have to drag me to a ley line somewhere in my frazzled brain something clicked he couldnt hold me and go misty at the same time grunting i pulled my knee up connecting right between his legs al grunted agony smacked into me as he flung me away and my back hit a display i gasped for air holding my bruised throat as packets of freezedried herbs sifted over me with light thumps sucking in the scent of amber as i coughed i held up a hand to fend them off angling my legs under me to stand where is the chalk you sorry bitch of a succubus whore al groaned holding himself as he hunched over and i smiled minias had told me that as part of als punishment for letting his old familiar go when she knew how to spindle line energy hed been purged of the accumulated charms spells and curses he had built up over the millennia it left him while not helpless at least reduced to a limited spell vocabulary obviously hed been in the kitchen recently since his uppercrust englishman persona was a disguise i didnt want to know what he really looked like whats the matter al i mocked wiping my mouth to find id bitten my lip not used to anyone fighting back this was freaking great here i was in a charm shop and nothing was invoked but vanity charms and bust enhancers here rachel my mom cried out and als head swung around mom i shouted when she threw something at me get out als eyes tracked it i stiffened as a shimmer of black everafter coursed over him healing whatever i had damaged but the magnetic chalk thumped safely into my hand i took a breath to yell at her to get out again and the shimmer of a bluetinted everafter circle rose up around her and the clerk behind the counter they were safe an odd unexpected sensation of ice swept through me and i stiffened it felt like the chime of a bell ringing through my bones oblivious al let out a roar and lunged yelping i dropped to the floor and out of his reach from behind me came a crash as al sailed over me and fell into the rack id knocked over i had seconds arm extended i sat on the floor and scribbled a circle rolling back and away as a premonition honed by years of martial arts told me he was reaching for me not this time witch he snarled eyes wide i spun on my butt my foot came up to kick but he moved with an inhuman quickness and my boot struck his palm i froze lying on my back with my ankle in his grip and my scarf in my face one good twist and hed break it shit al had lost his glasses his eyes glinted maliciously as he smiled but before he could move an explosion rocked through the store and blew out the windows my hands jerked to my ears and i yanked my foot out of als grip the demons goatlike eyes were wide as he stumbled back but his shock quickly became anger frightened i scrabbled to knock over another display packaged amulets rained down the shush of tires against wet pavement became obvious as my hearing returned the sound coming in through the broken window along with the calls of people what had my mom done jenks i shouted feeling the icy cool of a damp night it was too cold it might throw him into hibernation im fine he exclaimed as he hovered in a red haze of dust lets get the bastard i gathered myself to stand then hesitated in a crouch when jenkss gaze fixed on something over my shoulder and the pixy went white uh bastards he amended shakily and a new fear settled in when i realized al wasnt moving anymore either but watching whatever jenks was in the hush of ambient street noise a wave of burntamber tainted ozone flowed over me theres another demon behind me isnt there i whispered jenkss eyes flicked to mine and away two terrific jenks darted away and i moved i tripped on my scarf then kicked backward when someone grabbed my leg their hold faltered and dropping back to the floor i spun a yellowclad arm reached for me gripping someones shoulder i swung my foot up as a fulcrum and flung him over me there was no crash whoever it was had gone misty three demons what in hell is going on ticked i got to my feet only to stumble when a blur of red darted in front of me my eyes went to my mother she was okay fighting to get the clerks arms off her as the woman panicked safe in the circle as the store was ripped apart you sent a rentacop after me al bellowed nice try i covered my ears when a pressure shift pulsed against me and al vanished the demon in red that had been headed for him skidded to a stop cursing violently he flung his scythe in rage it sliced through a metallic rack like it was cotton candy and the display toppled as the clerk began sobbing blinking i stood and slowly backed away packets of amulets crunched under my feet holy crap i thought the monster looked like death having a temper tantrum and i jumped when jenks landed on my shoulder the pixy had a straightened plasticcoated paper clip and i found strength in that so what if there were still two demons here i could do anything with jenks watching my back follow him the last demon shouted and i spun fearing the worst please not newt anyone but newt you i exclaimed my breath exploding out of me in that one word it was minias yes me minias snarled and i jumped when the red demon with the scythe vanished why by the bloody new moon didnt you answer me because i dont deal with demons i shouted pointing to the shattered window as if i had any authority over him get the hell out of here miniass smooth ageless face creased in anger look out jenks cried as he took off from my shoulder but i was way ahead of him the demon was striding across the store in his yellow robe and funny hat kicking charms and herbs out of the way i backed up the cries from the sidewalk telling me how close i was to the circle id scribed earlier my pulse pounded and i felt myself sweat this would be close murderously silent he came on his slitted eyes a red so dark as to be almost brown his robes unfurled as he moved looking like a cross between a desert sheiks cloak and a kimono pace stilted he reached for me the light glinting on his rings now jenks shouted and i dropped out from under the demons reach and rolled past the chalk line i was outside the circle minias was in it rhombus i exclaimed slapping my hand down on the chalk my awareness reached out to touch the nearest ley line power surged through me and i held my breath eyes watering as it flowed in unchecked my desire for a quick circle letting the ley line energy fill me with an unusual force it hurt but i gritted my teeth and held on while the forces equalized in the time it takes for an electron to spin pulled by the trigger word my will tapped the memory of hours of practice consolidating a fiveminute prep and invocation into an eyeblink i wasnt that good with most ley line magic but this this i could do bloody hell and damn your dame minias swore and i couldnt help but smile when the hem of his yellow robe swung to a stop it was blurry from the moleculethin sheet of everafter that rose to trap him in my circle my breath slipped from me and i sat back on my butt my palms behind me on the hardwood floor and my knees bent as i looked at the demon i had him and the fading adrenaline was starting to turn into the shakes rachel my mother called and i looked past minias she was frowning at the clerk the woman refused to take down her protective circle sobbing and crying finally my mother had enough and with her lips pursed in the temper we shared she shoved the woman into her own bubble causing her to break it out of sight behind the counter the frazzled woman hit the floor and wailed all the louder i sat upright when the phone was dragged from the counter to thunk on the floor beaming my mother stepped delicately around the scattered charms and spells hands extended and pride flowing from her like a wave are you okay i asked as i took her grip and she pulled me up fantabulous she exclaimed eyes bright hot damn i love to watch you work i had crushed herbs all over my jeans and i slapped at them to get the flakes off there was a crowd at the broken window and traffic had stopped jenks dropped to hover behind my mom making the crazy motion with his finger and i frowned my mom had been more than a little off since my dad had died but i had to admit this nonchalance at a threedemon attack was much easier to take than the clerks noisy hysterics get out the woman yelled as she pulled herself up her eyes were red and her face was swollen alice get out and dont you ever come back you hear me your daughter is a menace she ought to be locked up and shunned my mothers jaw clenched shut your mouth she said hotly my daughter just saved your butt she drove off two demons and bound a third while you hid like a prissy girliegirl who wouldnt know the right end of an amulet if it came out her ass color high she turned with a huff and looped her arm through mine the plastic bag of charms was in her grip and it thumped into me lightly rachel were leaving this is the last time i shop in this peestained hole jenks was grinning as he hovered before us have i told you lately how much i like you mrs morgan mompeople can hear you i said embarrassed god her mouth was worse than jenkss and we couldnt leave minias was still standing in my circle heels crunching on the merchandise my mom dragged me to the door her head high and her red curls bobbing in the breeze from the busted window a tired sigh lifted through me at the wail of sirens great just freaking great theyd want to haul me down to the is tower to fill out a report demon summoning wasnt illegal just really stupid but theyd think of something probably a baldfaced lie the is or inderland security didnt like me since having quit their lameass worldwide police force last year ivy jenks and i had been showing up the cincinnati division with a pleasant regularity they werent idiots but i attracted trouble that just begged me to beat it into submission it didnt help that the media loved printing stuff about me either if only to feed peoples animosity and sell papers minias cleared his throat as we approached and my mother halted in surprise clasping his hands innocently before him the demon smiled from outside came an increase in conversation at the approaching cruisers the jitters started and jenks slipped between me and my scarf with that paper clip still in his grip he was shivering too but i knew it was from the cold not fear banish your demon rachel so we can get our coffee my mother said as if he was a nuisance like fairies in her garden its almost six there will be a line if we dont hurry the clerk steadied herself against a counter i called the is you cant go dont you let them go she screamed at the watching people but thankfully none came in you belong in jail all of you look at my shop look at my shop put a cork in it patricia my mother said you have insurance coyly touching her hair she turned to minias youre nice lookingfor a demon minias blinked and i sighed at his contriving smile and the bow that made my mom titter like a schoolgirl the conversations at the broken window shifted and when i looked at the street and the sound of approaching cruisers someones camera phone flashed oooooh better and better licking my lips i turned to minias demon i demand that you depart i started rachel mariana morgan minias said stepping so close to the edge of the barrier that smoke curled up where his robe touched it youre in danger tell us something we dont know moss wipe jenks muttered from my shoulder im in danger i said snidely feeling better now that the demon was behind a circle gee you think why is al out of jail you told me he was in custody he attacked me i shouted pointing to the destroyed shop he broke our agreement what are you going to do about it miniass eye twitched and the barest rasp gave away his slippers scuffing the floor someone is summoning him out of confinement its in your best interest to help us rache jenks complained its cold and the is is almost here get rid of him before they make us fill out paperwork until the sun goes nova i rocked back on my heels yeah like i was going to help a demon my reputation was bad enough seeing me ready to banish him minias shook his head we cant contain him without your help he will kill you and with no one alive to file a complaint hell get away with it a chill ran through me at the certainty in his voice worried i glanced at the people at the window then looked over the store not much was standing outside traffic began to move as the amber and blue lights of an is car started playing over the buildings my gaze fell on my mom and i cringed i could usually keep the more lethal aspects of my job from her but this time better listen she said shocking the hell out of me then clacked her heels smartly as she went to intercept the clerks dash to the street a bad feeling knotted my stomach if al wasnt playing by the rules anymore hed kill me probably after making me watch him murder everyone i loved it was that simple id been living on instinct for the first twentyfive years of my life and though it had gotten me out of a lot of trouble it had also gotten me into just as much and killed my boyfriend so though every fiber of my body said to banish him i took a slow breath listened to my mother and said okay talk minias pulled his attention from my mother a sheet of everafter cascaded over him melting the formal yellow robe into a pair of faded jeans leather belt boots and a red silk shirt my face went cold it was kistens favorite outfit and minias had probably picked it out of my thoughts like a cookie out of a jar damn him kisten the memory of his body propped up against his bed flashed through me my jaw trembled and i clenched my teeth i knew i had tried to save him or maybe he had tried to save me i just didnt remember it and guilt slithered across my soul i had failed him and minias was using it son of a bitch demon free me minias said mockingly as if he knew he was hurting me then well talk i held my right arm as it throbbed with a phantom pain remembering thats likely i said bitterly and the clerk jerked from my mother her shrill voice hurting my ears minias wasnt fazed and he looked over his new attire with interest a pair of modern mirrored sunglasses misted into existence in his grip and he placed them on the bridge of his narrow nose with a meticulous care to hide his alien eyes he sniffed and i felt sick at how much he looked like any guy on the street an attractive university kind of guy whod fit in on any campus as a grad student or maybe a teacher still working for tenure but his bearing was uncaring and slightly supercilious the coffee your mother mentioned sounds equitable i give my word ill begood my mother flicked her attention to the noisy street and seeing her eyes glinting in approval i wondered if this was where i got my need to live for the thrill but i was smarter now and putting a hand on my hip i shook my head my mother was nuts he was a freaking demon the demon glanced over my shoulder at the sound of a car door shutting and a police radio have i ever lied to you he murmured so only i could hear do i look like a demon tell them im a witch that was helping you catch al and i got in the circle by mistake my eyes narrowed he wanted me to lie for him minias leaned so close to the barrier of everafter that it buzzed a harsh warning if you dont ill give the public what they expect his eyes went to the people clustered at the window proof that you deal in demons ought to do wonders for yoursterling reputation mmmm there is that the door jingled open with a cry of relief the clerk shoved my mother away and ran to the two officers sobbing she draped herself over them effectively preventing them from coming in any farther i had thirty seconds tops and then it would be the iss decision as to what happened with minias not mine no freaking way minias saw my decision and smiled with an infuriating confidence demons never lied but they never seemed to tell the truth either id dealt with minias before finding that for all his considerable power he was a novice when dealing with people he had been babysitting the everafters most powerful insane denizen for the last millennium but clearly something had changed and someone was summoning al out of containment and setting him free to kill me damn is it nick stomach caving in i put a fist to my middle i knew he had the skill and we had parted on very bad terms let me out minias whispered ill hold myself to your definition of right and wrong i glanced across the demolished shop one of the officers managed to disentangle himself when the clerk pointed at us almost gibbering other people in uniform were filing in and it was getting crowded id never get a better verbal contract from minias than that done i said rubbing my foot across the chalk line to break the circle hey an incoming suit shouted as my bubble went down the spare young man whipped a thin wand from his belt and pointed it at us everybody down the clerk screamed and collapsed from outside came the sound of panic i jumped in front of minias hands up and spread wide whoa whoa whoa i cried out im rachel morgan from vampiric charms independent runner service ive got the situation under control were cool were all cool point the wand up the tension eased and in the new calm my mouth dropped open when i recognized the is officer you i accused then started when jenks catapulted himself from my shoulder jenks no i shouted and the room reacted a unified protest rose and ignoring the calls to halt i lunged to get in front of the man with the wand before jenks could pix him and somehow land me with an assault charge you sorryass hunk of putrid fairy crap jenks shouted darting erratically as i tried to stay between them nobody sucker punches me and gets away with it nobody easy jenks i soothed all the while trying to watch both him and minias hes not worth it hes not worth it my words penetrated and with his wings clattering aggressively jenks accepted my shoulder when i fluffed my scarf and turned to the is officer i knew my face was as ugly as jenkss i hadnt expected to ever see tom againthough who else would they send out on a call concerning demons but someone from the arcane division the witch was a mole in the is working one of their most sensitive highestpaying jobs while simultaneously laboring away as a peon in some fanatical blackarts cult i knew because he had played messenger boy last year and asked me to join them right after he stunned jenks into unconsciousness and left him to fry on my cars dashboard what an ass hi tom i said dryly hows the wand hanging the is officer backed up with his eyes on jenks his face reddened when someone laughed at him for being afraid of a fourinch pixy the truth of it was he should be something that small and winged could be lethal and tom knew it morgan tom said nose wrinkled as he breathed in the burntambertainted air i am not surprised summoning demons in public his gaze traveled over the trashed store and a mocking tsktsk came from him this is going to cost you my breath quickened when i remembered minias and i spun true to his word the demon was behaving himself standing still as every incoming is officer pointed their weapons both conventional and magic at him my mother made a puff of noise her high heels clacking as she strode to him a demon are you insane she said as she tucked our purchases under an arm to take miniass hand and pat it i froze in shock minias looked even more surprised do you honestly think my daughter is so stupid shed let a demon out of a circle she continued her smile bright in the middle of cincinnati three days before halloween its a costume this kind man helped my daughter repel the demons and got caught in the crossfire she beamed up at him and minias delicately removed his hand from hers curling his fingers into a tight fist isnt that so dear minias silently sidestepped away from my mother i felt a tug on my awareness as something was drawn from the everafter to this side of the lines and minias pulled a wallet from his back pocket my papersgentlemen the demon said giving me a smirk before he passed tom what looked like one of those id holders you see on cop shows the clerk slumped against the first officer wailing there were two of them in robes and one in a green costume i think thats the green one there they trashed the store they knew her name that woman is a black witch and everyone knows it its been in the papers and the news shes a menace a freak and a menace jenks bristled but it was my mother who said get a grip pat she didnt call them but the store patricia insisted her fear turning to anger now that is officers surrounded her whos going to pay for this look i said feeling jenks shivering between me and the scarf my partner is cold sensitive can we wrap this up i havent broken the law as far as i can see tom looked up from reading miniass id he squinted from the picture to minias then handed it to someone far older standing behind him with a curt pull it unease trickled through me but minias didnt seem to be troubled jenks pinched my ear when tom moved to stand before me and i jerked out of my reverie you shouldnt have turned us down morgan the witch said so close i could smell a witchs characteristic redwood smell rolling off of him the more magic you practiced the stronger you smelled and tom reeked i thought of minias and felt a moment of worry he might look like a witch but he would smell like a demon and theyd seen me let him out crap think rachel dont react think somehow tom said softly threateningly i dont think your friend minias is going to have a record any record at all sort of like a demon my thoughts scrambled and i felt more than saw minias ease up behind me im sure mr bansen will find my papers are in order he said and i shivered when a chill ran through me pulled into existence from the draft of jenkss wings holy crap minias smells like a witch the pixy whispered i took a deep breath my shoulders relaxing when i found minias did indeed lack the characteristic burntamber scent that clung to all demons i turned to him in surprise and the demon shrugged twisting his hand it was still in a fist and my lips parted when i realized he hadnt opened his fingers since my mother had taken his hand eyes widening i spun to my mother to find her beaming shed given him an amulet my mother was crazy but she was crazy like a fox can we go i said knowing tom was trying to get a good sniff of him as well toms eyes narrowed taking my elbow he pulled me from minias that is a demon prove it and as you once told me its not against the law to summon demons his face went ugly maybe not but youre responsible for the damage they do a groan slipped from jenks and i felt my face go stiff she destroyed my store the woman wailed whos going to pay for this who an is officer approached with miniass id and while tom held up a finger for me to wait he talked to him my mother joined me and the people outside complained as an officer started to make them move on tom was frowning when the man left and bolstered by his show of bad temper i smiled cattily i was going to walk out of here i knew it ms morgan he said as he slid his wand away i have to let you go what about the store the woman wailed can it patricia my mother said and tom grimaced as if hed eaten a spider as long as you agree that demons were here because of you he added and you agree to pay for damages he finished handing minias his id back but it wasnt my fault my gaze scanned the broken shelves and scattered amulets as i tried to add up the potential cost why should i have to pay for it because someone sicced them on me i didnt summon them tom smiled and my mother squeezed my elbow youre welcome to come down to the is and file a countercomplaint nice ill accept the damages so much for the air conditioner fund come on i said reaching for minias lets get out of here my hand passed right through him i froze but i didnt think anyone had noticed glancing at his irate face i gestured sourly for him to go before me after you i said then hesitated i wasnt going to do this at the coffeehouse two blocks away not with the is buzzing like fairies around a sparrow nest my car is about five spots down its the red convertible and youre riding in back miniass eyebrows rose as you say he murmured rocking into motion looking proud and satisfied my mother snatched my purchases up linked her arm in mine and like magic the crowd parted to show us the door you okay jenks i questioned when the cool of the night hit us just get me in the car he said and i carefully wrapped my scarf about my neck once more to snuggle him in coffee with my mom and a demon yeah that was a good idea two the coffeehouse was warm smelling of biscotti and brewing beans jenks went to my moms shoulder when i loosened my scarf but i didnt take it off not knowing if my neck showed als fingerprints or not it sure hurt enough to al is out how am i going to shut this down gently rubbing my neck i lingered at the door to watch minias jenks and my mother find their place in line the heavycharm detection alarm was glaring a harsh redresponding to minias most likelybut no one in the crowded place was paying it any mind it was three days before halloween and everyone was trying out their spells the demon looked tall beside my mother as she fidgeted her creamcolored leather clutch purse matched her shoes to perfection i must have gotten my fashion sense from my dad i knew i had gotten my height from him putting me several inches taller than my mom and a shade shorter than minias even in my boots and my athletic build had certainly come from my dad not that my mom was a slouch but memories of afternoons at eden park and pictures from before he had died reassured me that i was as much my fathers daughter as my mothers it made me feel good thinking that a part of him lived on though hed been gone twelve years hed been a great dad and i still missed him when my life got out of control which was more often than i liked to admit behind me the irritating heavycharm detector gave a final pulse and went dark relieved i eased up behind minias making his shoulders stiffen hed been markedly quiet in the car giving me the creeps as he sat rigidly behind me while my mother sat sideways in her seat to watch him she had disguised the scrutiny by trying to engage him in conversation while i called ivy and left a message for her to run across the street and warn ceri that al was on the loose again the demons exfamiliar didnt have a phone which was getting tiresome i was hoping my mothers light banter had been a ploy to ease the tension and not her usual outoftouchwithreality mentality she and minias were on a firstname basis now which i thought was swell still if he had wanted to cause problems he could have done it half a dozen times between the charm shop and here he was biding his time and i felt like a bug on a pin my mother and jenks edged out of line to ogle the pastries and when the were trio ahead of us finished ordering and moved off minias stepped forward glancing indolently at the hanging menu a man in a business suit behind us huffed impatiently then went pale and backed up when the demon eyed him through his dark glasses minias turned back to the counter attendant and smiled latte grande double espresso italian blend light on the froth extra cinnamon use whole milk not two percent or halfandhalf whole milk put it in porcelain we can do that the kid behind the counter said enthusiastically and i looked up his voice sounded familiar and for you maam uh i stumbled coffee black thats it minias looked askance at me his surprise clear even through his dark glasses and the kid behind the counter blinked what kind he asked doesnt matter i shifted from foot to foot mom what do you want my mother cheerfully hustled back to the counter with jenks on her shoulder ill have a turkish espresso and a slice of that cheesecake if someone will share it with me i will jenks sang out startling the guy behind the register he still had that paper clip sword with him and it made me feel better my mom glanced at me and when i nodded that id have some too she beamed ill have that then with forks for all of us she shyly looked to minias and the demon stepped back almost out of my peripheral vision the kid snuck glances at jenks as he punched that in announcing fourteen eightyfive we have one more person here i said trying not to frown and jenks landed on the counter with his hands on his hips i hated it when people ignored him and asking him to share simply because he wasnt going to eat much was patronizing i want an espresso he said proudly black but give me the domestic blend that turkish crap gives me the runs for a week tmi jenks i muttered while i yanked my shoulder bag forward why dont you find a table maybe a corner without a lot of people with your back to the wall you got it he said clearly doing better in the shops moist balmy climate a sustained temp below forty would send him into hibernation and though cincinnati was regularly hitting that after dark the stump he and his huge family lived in would retain enough heat to keep them warm until almost midnovember i was already dreading his brood moving into the church ivy and i lived in but they would not hibernate and risk matalina his ailing wife dying of the cold jenks was why i wore the scarf it wasnt for my comfort glad for the warmth of the shop myself i unzipped my coat i handed the kid a twenty then dropped the change into the tip jar making the businessman wait while i scribbled client meeting on the receipt and tucked it away turning i found my mother and minias standing uneasily beside a table against the wall jenks was on the light fixture the dust slipping from him rising in the bulbs heat they were waiting for me to sit down before choosing their seats so grabbing some napkins i headed over this looks great jenks i said as i edged behind my mom to reach the chair against the wall immediately my mother sat to my left and minias chose the chair to my right shifting it a foot back before sitting down he was almost in the aisle apparently we both wanted our space i took the opportunity to remove my jacket and my expression froze when the bracelet kisten had given me slipped to my wrist pain hit almost panic and i didnt look at anyone as i tucked it behind the sleeve of my sweater i wore the bracelet because i had loved kisten and still wasnt ready to let him go the one time id taken it off i found myself unable to tuck it away in my jewelry box next to the sharp vampire caps hed given me maybe if i knew who had murdered him i could have moved on ivy hadnt had much luck tracking down the vampire piscary had given kisten to as a legal blood gift i had been sure that sam one of piscarys lackeys had known who it was but he hadnt the human polygraph test at the fib or federal inderland bureauthe humanrun version of the iswas pretty good but the witch charm i had around sams neck when ivy asked him about it was better that was the last time i helped her question anyone however the living vampire scared me when she was pissed that ivy wasnt getting results was unusual her investigative skills were as good as my ability to get into trouble since the sam incident we had agreed to let her handle our search and i was getting impatient at her lack of progress but my slamming vampires into a wall for information wasnt prudent what made it worse was that the answer was buried somewhere in my unconsciousness maybe i should have talked to the fibs psychologist to see if he could pull something to light but ford made me uneasy he could sense emotions faster than ivy could smell them uncomfortable i scanned the décor of the busy place behind my mother was one of those stupid pictures with babies dressed up as fruit or flowers or something my lips parted and i looked at jenks then to the counter where the collegeage kid managed the customers with a professional polish this was it i thought in a surge of recognition this was the same coffeehouse where ivy jenks and i had agreed to quit the is and work as independent runners but junior looked like he knew what he was doing now sporting a manager tag on his redandwhitestriped apron and with several underlings to handle the nastier parts of running the place hey rache jenks said as he dropped down to dust my sweater with gold isnt this the store we yup i interrupted him not wanting minias to be privy to more of my life than necessary the demon was unfolding a paper napkin and meticulously settling it across a jeansclad knee as if it were silk unease flowed through me as i remembered the night i decided to leave the is going clueless into an independent bounty hunterescort servicejackofallmagicaltrades runner service with a vamp had been one of the most stupid and best decisions of my life it went along with ivy and jenkss opinion that i lived my life to find the edge of disaster so i could feel the rush of adrenaline maybe i had once but not anymore believing i had killed jenks and ivy with one of my stunts had cured me one hundred percent and kistens death had slammed the lesson home hard and to prove it i wasnt going to work with minias no matter what he offered i wouldnt repeat the past i could change my patterns of behavior i would starting here watch me coffee up the kid shouted and minias took his napkin from his lap as if he was going to rise ill get it i said wanting to minimize his interactions with everyone minias eased down without a fuss i gathered myself to stand then frowned i didnt want to leave him with my mother either oh for gods sake my mother said standing to drop her purse loudly on the table ill get it minias touched her arm and i bristled if you would alice bring the cinnamon with you he asked and my mother nodded slowly pulling from his fingers she was holding her arm when she walked away and i leaned toward minias dont touch my mother i threatened feeling better when jenks took an aggressive stance on the table his wings clattering menacingly someone needs to touch her minias said dryly she hasnt been touched in twelve years she doesnt need to be touched by you i leaned back with my arms crossed over my middle my gaze went to my mother who was flirting in an oldlady way with the counter kid and i paused she hadnt remarried when dad died hadnt even dated i knew she intentionally dressed herself to look older than she was to keep men at a distance with the right haircut and dress we could pass as big sister little sister as a witch her life span was a good hundred and sixty years and while most witches waited until they were sixty before starting a family she had had robbie and me very early in her life giving up a promising career to raise us first maybe we were accidents passion babies that brought a smile to my face and i forced it away when i noticed minias watching me i straightened as my mom approached with a canister of cinnamon and her plate of cheesecake the kid behind the counter was following with the rest thank you mark she said as he placed everything on the table and backed up a step youre a sweet boy i smiled at marks sigh clearly he wasnt happy with the title he glanced at me then jenks his eyes brightening hey he said as he tucked the tray under his arm i think ive seen you somewhere i cringed most times people recognized me it was from the news clip of me being dragged on my ass down the street by a demon the local news had incorporated it into their front credits sort of like that guy on skis pinwheeling over the finish line in the agony of defeat no i said unable to look at him as i pulled the lid off my cup of coffee ah coffee yes he insisted weight on one foot youve got that escort service in the hollows i didnt know if that was better or not and i looked tiredly up at him id done escort service before not that kind of escort service but real stuff dangerous stuff i had a boat blow up around me once yeah thats me minias looked up from shaking cinnamon on his coffee jenks snickered and i bumped my knee on the underside of the table to make his espresso slop over hey he shouted rising up a few inches then settled back down still laughing the front door jingled and the kid shot off his gladtohaveyouhere spiel and left minias was the only one listening my coffee was steaming and i hunched over it while i watched the demon his long fingers were interlaced about the white soupbowl mug as if relishing its warmth and though i couldnt tell for sure because of the sunglasses i think his eyes closed as he took the first sip a look of bliss so deep it couldnt have been faked slipped over him easing his features and turning him into a vision of relaxed pleasure im listening i said and a mask of nothing fell between us my mother quietly ate her cheesecake her eyes flicking uneasily between us i had the distinct impression she thought i was being rude and im not happy i added making her lips press tightly you told me al was contained i lifted my coffee and blew across the top what are you going to do about him breaking his word and coming after me what do you think will happen when this gets out i took a sip forgetting for a moment where i was when it slipped down easing my slight headache and relaxing my muscles jenks cleared his throat bringing me back you wont have a chance of luring anyone into any agreements again i said as my focus cleared no more familiars wont that be nice i finished with a simpering smile his eyes on the delights of that fruitbaby picture minias sipped his drink with his elbows on the table and his mug propped up at mouth height this is much better this side of the lines he said softly yeah jenks said his espresso cup came up to his waist that burnt amber really sticks in your throat doesnt it a flicker of annoyance flashed across minias and a thread of tension entered his stance of relaxed idleness i took a deep breath smelling only coffee cheesecake and the characteristic redwood scent of a witch i was sure my mom had slipped him a charm and i wasnt looking forward to finding the cost of such an expensive amulet tacked on to the losses from the store but if it kept him from smelling like a demon and causing a panic i couldnt complain well what do you want i said setting my cup down i dont have all night my mom frowned but minias took it in stride easing back in his stiff chair and setting his giant mug aside al is being summoned out of confinement we figured that part out jenks said snottily jenks i murmured and the pixy walked across the table with his makeshift sword to the cheesecake weve never run into this before minias said hesitating as he took in jenkss whatever attitude because of his extraordinary amount of contact with this side of the lines al has arranged for someone to summon him every sundown they get what they want then release him without the compulsion to return to the everafter its a winwin situation for both of them and a loselose for me my thoughts flashed to my old boyfriend nick jenks eyed me over a chunk of cheesecake as big as his head clearly thinking the same thing nick was a thief who habitually used demons as a source of information thanks to glenn at the fib i had a copy of his file in my dressers bottom drawer it was so thick a monster rubber band barely kept it shut i didnt like thinking about it someones freeing a demon without compulsion to return to the everafter i managed my eyes lowered thats not very responsible its extremely clever for al miniass one elbow found the table as he took a draught i cringed fully conscious of my mom listening quietly you think someones doing this to kill me i finally asked minias shrugged i dont know nor do i care really i simply want it to stop a reproachful huff came from my mother and minias pulled his elbow from the table we can regain control of him after sunup the demon said his eyes hidden behind his glasses when the lines close to crosstraffic hes snapped back to our side finding him then is just a matter of using his demon marks i pulled my hands from atop the table my fingers pushing aside kistens bracelet to feel the raised scar the demon mark had flared into pain just before al showed up and a new worry settled in beside the old ones thats how al had found me crap i didnt like feeling like a tagged antelope al doesnt have access to a lab while in custody minias said drawing my attention back so he only has simple easily performed curses but hes exceptionally adept at line jumping well hes been in someones kitchen he looks like he always does and i know thats not his natural form i dont want to know what he looks like i really dont miniass head moved up and down once and he swallowed his coffee yes he said softly as he leaned back someone has been helping him that he tried to take you tonight went a long way toward convincing me it wasnt you me i blurted you really think id work with him then my fingers gripping my coffee went weak appearance charms didnt just happen in one night that meant that almy eyes rose and i wished minias would take off his glasses how long has al been slipping your containment miniass lips twitched this is the third night in a row fear jolted me and jenks rose from the table red dust slipping from him and you didnt think i might want to know that i exclaimed in a smooth motion minias took off his glasses his arm flat on the table he leaned in to me how much effort do you expect me to exert he said tightly and i blinked at the irate emotion reflected in his goatslitted eyes we dont care if he kills you or not i have no reason to help you but you did i said belligerently thinking anger seemed better than fear why immediately minias backed down and seeing there was something here he didnt want to talk about i decided i did i was tracking al the demon said that you were there was merely helpful jenks began laughing and all eyes turned to him as he rose several inches you got sacked didnt you he said and minias stiffened my first impulse to protest died at miniass stoic face you got fired the demons reach for his oversize mug almost smacked jenks in its quickness why else would he be tracking al instead of watching tv with newt jenks said flitting to the safety of my shoulder you got canned outsourced pinkslipped handed your walking papers given the go light slipped on the banana served the dead slug minias put his glasses back on ive been reassigned he said tightly suddenly i was afraid really afraid you arent watching newt i whispered and minias looked surprised by my fear who is newt my mother asked dabbing a napkin at her lips and sliding the last half of the cheesecake to me shes just the most powerful demon they got over there jenks boasted as if he had something to do with it minias was her babysitter shes more dangerous than a militant fairy on brimstone and shes the one who cursed the church last year before i bought it didnt twitch a wing shes got a major burr up her ass about rachel minias bit back a snort and i wished jenks would shut up my mother hadnt known about the blasphemy incident there are no female demons my mother said fumbling in her purse to bring out a compact and her lipstick your father was very clear on that apparently he was mistaken i picked up a fork but immediately set it down id lost my desire for cheesecake about five surprises ago gut clenching i turned to minias so whos watching newt the demons face lost all its amusement some young punk he said sullenly surprising me with the modern phrase jenks though was delighted you lost newt one too many times and they replaced you with a younger demon oh thats beautiful miniass hand quivered his fingers abruptly loosening on his mug when a soft crack rang out from the porcelain stop it jenks i said wondering how much of minias losing his job was due to newt slipping away on his watch and how much was from the demons inability to make impartial decisions regarding her security id seen them together and minias clearly cared for her too much to lock her up when she needed it probably how do they expect me to seduce her and maintain her adherence to the law simultaneously he snarled it cant be done damned fool bureaucrats dont know the first thing about love and dominance seduce her i arched my eyebrows but an icy sensation rippled through me at the glimpse of his anger and frustration silence thick and uncomfortable took over making the surrounding conversation seem louder seeing us staring minias forced his tension from him his sigh was so soft i wasnt sure i hadnt imagined it al cant be allowed to flaunt the rules he said as if he hadnt just shown us the pain in his soul if i can contain him i can return to supervising newt rachel my mother exclaimed and i turned to see a familiar mask of lighthearted ignorance on her hes a runner just like you you should go out to a movie or something mom hes a i hesitated hes not a runner i said stopping just short of saying he was a demon and he certainly isnt date material guilt hit me id pushed her and she was slipping into old patterns cursing myself i pulled my attention to minias just wanting to wrap this up and get out of here sorry i said to apologize for my mother miniass face was still empty i dont do witches i had a hard time not finding offense in that but jenks saved me from making a total ass out of myself by buzzing his wings to gain everyones attention so let me get this straight he said hovering a breath above the sticky table with one hand on his hip the other pointing that plasticcoated paper clip at minias you lost your cushy babysitting job and are now trying to gain control of a demon who has limited power and resources and you cant do it its not a matter of gaining control over him minias protested indignantly we can catch him we simply cant contain him after sunset as i told you someone is summoning him out of confinement and you cant stop them i questioned thinking of the charmed zipstrips that the is used to keep ley line practitioners from jumping out of custody via a ley line minias shook his head and his glasses caught the light no we catch him confine him and when the sun goes down he pops out rested and fed hes laughing at us me i disguised my shiver by taking a sip of my coffee any idea whos doing it my thoughts went to nick and the coffee turned to acid in my stomach not anymore his boots scraped against the gritty floor soon as i find out they die nice fumbling for my moms hand under the table i gave it a squeeze do you have any idea as to who might be helping him minias asked next and i forced myself to keep breathing nick i thought but i wouldnt say it aloud not even if he was sending al to hurt mebecause if it was nick id take care of him myself i could feel jenkss eyes on me wanting me to say it but i wouldnt why dont you just get rid of his summoning name i said looking for other options you do that and he cant be summoned out the skin visible past miniass sunglasses tightened he knew i wasnt saying something you cant throw away a password once you have one its yours he hesitated and i felt the gathering of trouble you can exchange it with someone elses though the ribbon of tension around my chest squeezed and all my warning flags went up if someone exchanged names with him minias drawled into the conversationrich air we could contain him unfortunately because of his job hes been very lax with his summoning name there are an astounding number of people on this side of the lines who know it and no demon will willingly take it minias stared at me they have no reason to my fingers tightened on my waxed paper cup sure now i knew why minias was sitting at a table sipping coffee with me i had a password i had a reason to trade i had a major problem so what does that have to do with my daughter my mother said her voice thick with warning fear caused her to drop the scatteredthoughts image she used as a buffer to hide the damage my dads death had wrought minias adjusted his glasses to give himself time to weigh the emotions at our table i want your daughter to exchange passwords with al no fairycrap way the dust slipping from jenks was a red so deep that it seemed black absolutely not i echoed i scowled and slid my chair back unperturbed minias shook more cinnamon into his coffee then hell kill you i dont care obviously you do or you wouldnt be here i said sharply you cant hold him without my name you dont care if i live or die its you youre worried about my mom sat stiff and miserable will you remove her demon marks if she does this all of them mom i exclaimed not aware that she even knew about my demon marks green eyes full of pain she took my cold fingers in hers your aura is filthy honey and i do watch the news if this demon can remove your marks and purge your aura then you should at least find out what the consequences or possible side effects are mom its not just a password its a summoning name minias gazed at my mother with a new interest its a summoning name that has no pull on you he said the most that will likely happen is you fielding a few months of redirected calls to al i took my hand from my mothers not believing this was happening you said i had to pick a name no one could figure out that if someone did they could make my life miserable do you know how many people know als name i dont but its more than know mine done with this i pushed myself from the table the chair scraped and the vibration went all the way up my spine and made me shiver thats the point witch minias said making the word an insult if you dont youre going to die i intervened tonight in the hope youd be willing to come to an arrangement but i wont do it again i simply dont care fear or maybe adrenaline sparked through me arrangement he meant a deal a deal with a demon my mothers eyes pleaded with me and jenks lifted his poker bristling is that a threat he snarled his wings going red with his increased circulation a statement of odds minias set his cup down with a sense of finality the napkin was next folded and laid flat beside it yes or no pick someone else i said there are millions of witches someone has got to be more stupid than me and say yes give them a name and exchange it with al he looked at me from over his shades youre one of two witches this side of the lines whose blood is capable of making a strong enough bond yes or no oh back to the demon magic thing swell so use lee i said bitterly hes stupid as well as aggressive ambitious and now a basket case from having been als familiar for a couple of months before i rescued him sort of god no wonder al hated me minias sighed and crossed his arms over his chest a faint whiff of brimstone tickled my nose he has too close a tie to al he said his gaze on the ceramic mug cradled in his hands he wouldnt do it i asked the man is a coward my neck stiffened and if common sense makes me say no then im a coward too you cant be summoned he said as if i was being obstinate why are you balking al would know my name just the thought made my pulse quicken you know his for one brief moment i considered it then the thought of kisten flashed through me i couldnt take the chance not again this wasnt a game and there was no reset button no i said abruptly were done here my mothers shoulders eased and jenkss feet touched the table i was wire tight wondering if this truce would last now that i had said no whereupon hed return to a normal demonic frame of mind and trash the place along with what was left of my reputation but minias finished his coffee in a final swallow raising his hand and motioning for the clerk to make one more to go he rose and my held breath escaped as you want it minias said as he picked up the cinnamon and stood i wont be conveniently coming to save you a second time i was about to tell him where he could shove his convenience but al was going to show up again and if i could call minias to collect him my chances of survival would increasei thought i didnt have to take minias up on his offer just survive until i figured out who was summoning al and deal with him or her myself demon summoning wasnt illegal but my foot in their gut a couple of times might convince them it was a really bad idea and if it was nick well that would be a real pleasure what if i think about it i said and my mother gave me a nervous smile and a pat on my arm see i can use my brain too minias smirked as if he saw right through me dont think too long he said accepting the paper cup junior was extending to him ive gotten word that they caught him on the west coast trying to ride the shadow of night into tomorrow the patternshift indicates he has everything he needs and all thats left is implementing it i refused to show my fear not swallowing though my mouth was dry minias leaned close the scent of burnt amber high in my imagination as his breath shifted my hair youre safe until the sun goes down tomorrow rachel mariana morgan hunt fast jenks rose up on his dragonfly wings clearly frustrated as he stayed just out of the demons easy reach why dont you just kill al tucking the entire container of cinnamon into a jacket pocket minias shrugged because we havent had a demon birth in five thousand years he hesitated then shook his arm to cause an amulet to slip from his sleeve and fall into his fingers thank you alice for the use of your amulet if your daughter is half as skilled in the kitchen as you she would make a fine familiar mom had made it herself i thought not simply invoked a pilfered one the cloying scent of burnt amber rolled over me and my mother blushed it was obvious by the protests of the surrounding people that they had noticed the stench as well and minias smiled an empty smile behind the mirrored black glasses if you would banish me id totally forgotten oh sure i mumbled as the people behind him turned with their hands over their noses in complaint ah demon i demand that you depart here and return directly to the everafter to not bother us again this night and with a nod minias vanished the people behind him gasped and i waved university professor late for a class i lied and they turned laughing at their fear and dismissing the stench as an early halloween prank lord help you rachel my mother said sourly if thats how you treat men its no wonder you cant keep a boyfriend mom hes not a man hes a demon i protested softly pausing as she pocketed that charm clearly hair straighteners werent the only thing she was trading to patricia scent amulets werent hard to make but one strong enough to block out a demons stench was highly unusual talk about your niche market maybe she was specializing in charms no one else bothered with to avoid competitionand thus lawsuitsfrom annoyed licensed charm makers eyes on my coffee i said mom about those amulets youve been making for patricia jenks took to the air and my mother huffed youre never going to find mr right if you dont start playing with mr right now she said gathering everything up on her plate minias is obviously mr never but you could have been a little nicer jenks shrugged and i sighed i noticed he didnt offer to get the tab though did he my mother finished i took another swallow of my coffee and gathered myself to rise i wanted to get home to my sanctified church before any more demons popped into my life with nasty solicitations not to mention i had to talk to ceri make sure ivy had told her al was out as i slowly followed jenks and my mom to the trash and then the door my thoughts swung back to what minias had said about no new demons being born for the last five thousand years he was at least five thousand years old and had been assigned to monitor and seduce a female demon and why no new demons was it because there were so few female demons left or because having sex with one could be deadly three i set the stack of unopened desk organizers id bought last month on the scratched hardwood floor of the sanctuary wincing at the highpitched squeal of pixy children as they swarmed into the nook of my desk that i had just opened up they werent moving in for the winter yet but matalina was getting a jump on prepping my desk i couldnt blame her for the fall cleaning i didnt use my desk much and there was more dust gathering than work done at it the urge to sneeze took me and i held my breath eyes watering until the feeling evaporated thank you god i glanced at jenks at the front of the church where he was keeping a fair number of his younger kids busy and out of the way with decorating the sanctuary for halloween he was a good dad a part of him that was easy to overlook when he was out busting bad guys with me i hoped i found half as good a man when i was ready to start a family the memory of kistenblue eyes smilingswam up and my heart seemed to clench it had been months but reminders of him still came fast and hard and i didnt even know where the thought of children had come from there wouldnt have been any with kisten unless we fell back on the ageold tradition of borrowing a girlfriends brother or husband for a night practices born long before the turn when to be a witch would sign your death warrant but now even that hope was gone jenks met my eyes and a gentle dusting of gold contentment slipped from him as he watched matalina his pretty wife looked great she had been fine all this summer but i knew jenks was watching her like the proverbial hawk with the onset of the cold matalina barely looked eighteen but pixy life spans were a mere twenty years and it made me heartsick that it was only a matter of time before wed be doing this with jenks as well a secure territory and steady food supply could do only so much in lengthening their lives we were hoping that by removing the need for them to hibernate they all would benefit but there was a limit to what good living willow bark and fern seed could do turning away before jenks could see my misery i put my hands on my hips and stared at my cluttered desk scuse me i said pitching my voice high as i edged my hands among the darting shapes of matalinas eldest daughters they were chatting so fast that it sounded like they were speaking another language let me get those magazines out of your way thank you ms morgan one hollered cheerfully and i carefully pulled out the stack of modern witchcraft for todays young woman out from under her as she rose up i never read them but i hadnt been able to turn down the kid on my doorstep i hesitated with the stack in my arms not knowing if i should throw them out or put them next to my bed to someday read maybe finally dumping them on the swivel chair to deal with later a fluttering of black paper rose up as jenks flew into the rafters with a small paper bat trailing after him by a thin thread the smell of rubber cement mixed with the spicy scent of chili slowcooking in the crockpot ivy had bought at a yard sale and jenks taped the string to a beam before dropping down for another the swirl of silk and fourpart harmony pulled my attention back to my desk now barren making the tiny nooks and drawers a pixy paradise done in oak all set matalina i asked and the tiny woman smiled with a duster made from the fluff of a dandelion in her hand this is wonderful she said her wings a blur of nothing you are too generous rachel i know how much of a bother we all are i like you staying with us i said knowing id find pixy tea parties in my spice drawer before the week was through you make everything more alive noisy rather she said sighing as she looked to the front of the church and the papers ivy had spread to protect the hardwood floor from the arts and crafts pixies living in the church was a bloody nuisance but id do anything to put off the inevitable another year if there was a charm or spell id use it in a heartbeat regardless of its legality but there wasnt i had looked several times pixy life spans sucked i smiled wistfully at matalina and her daughters as they set up housekeeping and after rolling the top of the desk down to leave the nowtraditional oneinch gap i grabbed my clipboard and looked for somewhere to sit on it was a growing list of ways to detect a demon summoning in the margin was a short list of people who might want me dead but there were safer ways to kill someone than sending a demon after them and i was betting the first list would get me closer to who was summoning al than the second after i exhausted the local stuff id look out of state the lights were high and the heat was on against the hint of chill in the air turning the autumn night to a noon summer the churchs sanctuary wasnt much of a sanctuary anymore the pews and altar had been removed even before i had moved in leaving a wonderfully open space with narrow stainedglass windows stretching from knee height to the tall ceiling my desk was atop the shallow stage up front to the right of where the altar had been back by the dark foyer was ivys seldomplayed baby grand piano and tucked into the front corner across from my desk was a new cluster of furniture to give us somewhere to interview prospective clients without dragging them all the way through the church to our private living room at the back ivy had a plate of crackers cheese and pickled herring arranged on the low coffee table but it was the pool table my gaze lingered on it had been kistens and i knew that the reason i was drawn to it was because i missed him ivy and jenks had given the table to me on my birthday it was the only piece of him ivy had taken besides his ashes and her memories i think shed given it to me as an unspoken statement that hed been important to both of us he had been my boyfriend but he had been ivys onetime livein and confidant and probably the only person who truly understood the warped hell that their master vampire piscary had put them through with his version of love things had changed radically in the three months since ivys former girlfriend skimmer had killed piscary and landed herself in jail under a wrongfuldeath charge instead of the expected turf war with cincys secondary vampires struggling to assert their dominance a new master vampire had stepped in from out of state one so charismatic that no one rose to challenge him id since learned that bringing in new blood was commonplace and there were provisions set up in cincinnatis charter to deal with the sudden absence of a city power what was unusual though was that the new master vampire had taken in every single one of piscarys displaced vamps instead of bringing his own camarilla the small bit of kindness cut short an ugly mess of vampire misery that would have put me and my roommate in serious jeopardy that the incoming vampire was rynn cormel the very man who had run the country during the turn probably had a lot to do with ivys quick acceptance respect usually came slowly from her but it was hard not to admire someone who had written a vampire sex guide that sold more copies than a postturn bible and had been president i had yet to actually meet the man but ivy said that he was quiet and formal and that she was enjoying getting to know him better if he was her master vampire they were going to have a blood tryst at some point euwie i didnt think they had yet but ivy was private about that sort of thing despite her wellearned reputation i suppose i should have been thankful he hadnt taken ivy as his scion and made my life hell rynn had brought his own scion and the woman was just about the only living vamp to come with him from washington so after kisten died ivy got a new master vampire and i got a pool table in my front room id known that a bloodchaste witch and a living vampire could never make it work in the long run regardless i had loved him and the day i found out who piscary had given kisten to like a thankyou card i was going to sharpen my stakes and go for a visit ivy was working on it but piscarys hold on her had been so heavy the last few days of his existence that she didnt remember much at least she no longer believed she had killed kisten in a blind jealous rage i eased myself up to sit on the edge of the table smelling the scents of vampire incense and old cigarette smoke rise from the green felt like a balm it mixed with the odor of tomato paste and the sound of melancholy jazz filtering in from the back of the church bringing to mind my early mornings spent in the loft of kistens dance club inexpertly knocking pool balls around while i waited for him to finish closing up closing my eyes against the lump in my throat i pulled my knees up to prop my heels against the bumper and wrapped my arms around my shins the heat coming from the long tiffany lamp ivy had installed over the table beat on the top of my head hot and close my eyes started to fill and i pushed the pain down i missed kisten his smile his steady presence just being with him i didnt need a man to feel good about myself but the shared feelings between two people were worth suffering for maybe it was time to stop saying no to every guy that tried to ask me out it had been three months did kisten mean that little to you came an accusing thought and i held my breath get off the felt came ivys voice out of my swirl of emotions and my eyes flashed open i found her at the top of the hallway leading to the rest of the church a plate of crackers and pickled herring in one hand two bottled waters in the other im not going to tear it i said as i dropped my knees to sit crosslegged loath to move since the only other place to sit was across from her it was easier to keep our distance than deal with the building pressure of ivy wanting to sink her teeth and my wanting her to both of us knowing it would be a bad idea wed tried it once and it hadnt worked out well but i was a getbackonthehorse kind of girleven when i knew better almost of their own accord my fingers rose to my neck and the nearly unnoticeable bumps of scar tissue marring my otherwise absolutely pristine skin seeing my hand where it was ivy folded herself gracefully into a chair behind the plate of crackers she shook her head at me making the gold tips of her short sinblack lusciously straight hair glimmer frowning at me like a tickedoff cat i pulled my hand down and pretended to read the clipboard now propped in my lap despite her grimace ivy seemed relaxed as she eased into the black leather looking pleasantly exhausted from her workout this afternoon she was wearing a long gray shapeless sweater over her tight exercise outfit but it couldnt hide her trim athletic build her oval face still carried the glow of exertion and i could feel her brown eyes watching me as she worked to quell the mild blood lust stirred by the spike of surprise that i had given off when she had startled me ivy was a living vampire the last living heir of the tamwood estate admired by her living vampire kin and envied by her undead ones like all highblood living vampires she had a good portion of the undeads strengths but none of the drawbacks of light vulnerability or the inability to tolerate sanctified ground or artifactsshe lived in a church to irritate her undead mother conceived as a vampire shed become an undead in the blink of an eye if she died without any damage for the vampire virus to repair only the lowborn or ghouls needed further attention to make the jump to a damned immortality moved by scent and pheromones it was an ongoing ballet between us of want and need desire and will but i needed protection from the undead who would take advantage of me and my unclaimed scar and she needed someone who wasnt out for her blood and had the will to say no to the ecstasy a vampire bite could bring plus we were friends we had been since working together in the is an experienced runner showing a newbie the ropes id um been the newbie ivys blood lust was very real but at least she didnt need blood to survive as the undead did i was fine with her sating her urges with anyone she wanted seeing as piscary had warped her such that she couldnt separate love from blood or sex ivy was bi so it wasnt a big deal to her i was straightlast time i checked but after getting a taste of how good a blood tryst felt everything was doubly confusing it had taken a year but i finally admitted that i not only respected ivy but loved her toosomehow but i wasnt going to sleep with her just to have her sink her teeth in me unless i was truly attracted to her and not just to the way she could set my blood burning aching to fill the hole piscary had carved into her soul year by year bite by bite our relationship had gotten complicated either i had to sleep with her to safely share blood or we could try to keep it to a blood exchange alone and run the risk that she would lose control and id have to slam her against the wall to get her to stop before she killed me in ivys words we could share blood without hurt if there was love or we could share blood without love if i hurt her there was no middle ground how nice was that ivy cleared her throat it was a small sound but the pixies went silent youre going to damage the felt she almost growled my eyebrows rose and i turned to look at the table already knowing its surface like the palm of my hand like its in such good shape i asked dryly i cant make it any worse theres a dent in the slate the size of an elbow by the front left pocket and it looks like someone stitched up nail gouges there in the middle ivy reddened picking up an old issue of vamp vixen that she had out for clients oh my god i said untwisting my legs and jumping off as i imagined just how gouges like that could get there ill never be able to play on it again thanks a hell of a lot jenks laughed to sound like wind chimes and he joined me as i headed over for some of the pickled herring the puff of leather was soothing as i flopped into the couch across from ivy dropping my clipboard beside me and reaching for the crackers the blood came right out she muttered i dont want to know i shouted and she hid behind her magazine the cover story was six ways to leave your shadow begging and breathing nice silence slipped between us but it was a comfortable one which i filled by shoving pickled herring into my mouth the tart vinegar reminded me of my dadhe had been the one whod gotten me hooked on the stuffand i settled back with a cracker and my clipboard what have you come up with so far ivy asked clearly looking for a shift in topics i pulled the pencil from behind my ear the usual suspects mr ray mrs sarong trent beloved citys son playboy murdering slickerthanafroginarainstorm bastard trent but i doubted it was him trent hated al more than i did having run into him once before to come away with a broken arm and probably a recurring nightmare besides he had cheaper ways to knock me off and if he did his secret biolabs would hit the front page jenks was jabbing the point of his sword into the holes of the crackers to break them into pixysize pieces what about the withons you did bust up their plans to marry off their daughter nah i said not believing anyone could hold a grudge for that besides they were elves they wouldnt use a demon to kill me they hated demons more than they hated me right jenkss wings blurred and the table was cleared of the crumbs he had made eyebrows raised at my doubt he started layering herring bits on his tiny crackers each the size of a peppercorn how about lee he said minias said he didnt trust him i set the arches of my feet on the edge of the coffee table which is why i do i had gotten the man away from al one would think that would be worth something especially when lee had taken over cincys gambling when piscary died maybe i should talk to him ivy frowned at me over her magazine i think its the is theyd love to see you dead my pencil scratched against the yellow tablet inderland security i said feeling a ping of fear drop through me as i added them to the list crap if it was the is i had a big problem jenkss wings hummed as he exchanged a look with ivy theres nick i unclenched my jaw almost as fast as it tightened up you know its him the pixy said hands on his hips as ivy peered at me over the magazine her pupils slowly dilating why didnt you tell minias right there you had him rachel minias would have taken care of it and you didnt say a thing lips pressed tight i calculated the odds of me hitting him with the pencil if i threw it at him i dont know its nick and even if it was i wouldnt give him to the demons id take care of it myself i said bitterly think with your head rachel not your heart but maybe ill give the cookie a call ivy made a small noise and went back to her magazine nicks not that smart hed be demon fodder by now he was that smart but i wasnt going to start a witch hunt or stupidhuman hunt rather my blood pressure though had gone back down at her low opinion of him and i reluctantly added his name to the list its not nick i said its not his style demon summoning leaves traces either in collecting the materials to do it the damage done while hes there or the increase in educated young witches dying of unnatural causes im going to check with the fib and see if theyve found anything odd the last few days ivy leaned forward knees crossed as she took a cracker dont forget the tabloids she offered yeah thanks i said adding that to the list a demons took my baby story could very well be true propping the tip of his metal sword on the table jenks leaned against the wooden hilt and let out a piercing chirp by rubbing his wings together his kids flew up in a noisy flurry by the door and i held my breath fearing they were all going to descend on us but only three came to a swirling wingclattering stop their fresh faces smiling and their innocence beguiling they were capable of murder all of them down to his youngest daughter here he said handing a cracker to one of his sons see that your mom gets this kay papa he said and was gone his feet never having touched the table the other two ferried the rest of the portions out in a wellorganized display of pixy efficiency ivy blinked at the normally nectarivorous pixies descending on the pickled herring like it was maple syrup theyd eaten an entire fish last year for an extra boost of protein before their hibernation and though they werent going to hibernate again this year the urge was still there sourly contemplating my new and improved list i cracked the bottled water ivy had brought me i thought about heading into the kitchen for a glass of wine but after glancing at ivy i decided to make do with what i had the pheromones she was kicking out were enough to relax me as much as a shot of whiskey and if i added to it id probably fall asleep before two in the morning as it was i was feeling pretty damn good and i wasnt going to feel at all guilty that most of it stemmed from her it was a thousand years of evolution to make finding prey easy but i felt i deserved it for putting up with all the crap living with a vampire brought not that i was that easy to live with either i tapped the eraser against my teeth and looked at my list the weres were probably out and lee i couldnt imagine the withons would be that ticked even if i had busted up their daughters marriage to trent trent might be angry though seeing as id gotten him jailed for all of three hours a sigh lifted through me id built up a lot of animosity with some pretty big people in a remarkably short time my special talent i should concentrate on finding traces of demon summoning and go from there rather than investigating people who might hold a grudge the dinner bell ivy and i used as a doorbell bonged startling us a jolt of adrenaline pulsed through me and ivys eyes dilated to a thin rim of brown ill get it jenks said as he flew up from the coffee table his voice almost lost in the commotion his kids were making from the front corner of the newspaperplastered sanctuary as ivy went to turn down the music coming in from the back room i wiped my mouth of cracker crumbs and did a quick tidy at the table ivy might take a job two days before halloween but if they were looking for me they were going to be sadly disappointed jenks worked the elaborate pulley system wed rigged for him and as soon as the door cracked an orange cat streaked in cat the pixy shrilled as the tabby headed right for his kids i bolted upright breath catching as every pixy in the sanctuary was abruptly eight feet higher shrieks and calls echoed and suddenly the air was full of little black paper bats dangling enticingly from thin strings rex jenks shouted darting to land right before the blackeyed animal which was entranced and frozen by the overwhelming sensory input of twentyplus dangling bits of paper bad cat you scared the fairyloving crap out of me his gaze went to the rafters everyone up there a shrill round of yes dad made my eyeballs hurt and matalina came out of the desk hands on her hips she whistled sharply a chorus of disappointed complaints rose and the bats fell a flow of pixies vanished inside the desk leaving three older kids to sit and dangle their feet from the rafters as casual sentries one of them had jenkss straightened paper clip and i smiled jenkss cat patted one of the fallen paper bats and ignored her tiny master jenks matalina said in warning we had an agreement hooooney jenks whined its cold out shes been an inside cat since we got her its not fair to make her stay outside just because were inside now her tiny angelic face tight matalina disappeared into the desk jenks streaked in after her a mix of young man and mature father grinning i snagged rex on my way to the door and the two shadows standing hesitantly in my threshold i had no idea how we were going to handle this new wrinkle maybe i could learn how to make a ward to let people through but keep felines out it was just a modified ley line circle id seen someone do it by memory once and lee had put a ward up across trents great window how hard could it be my smile widened when the light from the sign over the door illuminated who was there it wasnt a potential client david i exclaimed when i saw him next to a vaguely familiar man i told you i was okay earlier you didnt have to come over i know how you downplay things the younger of the two men said his face easing into a few smile wrinkles as rex struggled to get away from me fine can be anything from a bruise to almost comatose and when i get a call from the is about my alpha female im not going to take that at face value his eyes lingered on the faint mark on my neck where al had gripped me dropping the wildly wiggling cat i gave him a quick hug the complicated scent of were filled my senses wild rich and full of exotic undertones of earth and moon that most weres lacked i drew back my hands still on his upper arms peering into his eyes to evaluate his state of being david had taken a curse for me and though he said he liked the focus i worried that one day the sentient spell would risk my anger and take him over davids jaw clenched as he reigned in an urge to flee that stemmed from the curse not himself then smiled the thing was terrified of me still got it i said letting him go and he nodded still loving it he said dropping his head briefly to hide the need to run shimmering behind his dark eyes he turned to the man beside him you remember howard my head bobbed oh yes from last years winter solstice i said wiggling my foot at rex so she wouldnt come in and reaching to shake the older mans hand his grip was cold from the night and probably poor circulation how you been doing im trying to stay busy he said the tips of his gray hair moving as he exhaled heavily i never should have taken that early retirement david scuffed his boots muttering a quiet i told you well come on in i said waving my foot at the disgusted cat so shed go away quick before rex follows you we cant stay david hotfooted it inside his old business partner quick on his heels despite his accumulated years were on our way to pick up serena and kally howard is driving us out to bowman park and were going to run the licking river trail can i leave my car here until morning i nodded the long stretch of railroad track between cincy and bowman park had been converted to a safe running surface shortly after the turn this time of year youd only find weres on it at night and the railstotrails path ran fairly close to the church before it crossed the river into cincinnati david had used the church as an endpoint before but this was the first time he had the ladies with him i wondered if it was their first long fall run if so they were in for a treat to run full out and not get hot was exquisite i shut the door and ushered the men from the unlit foyer into the sanctuary davids duster brushed his worn boot tops and he took off his hat as he entered clearly uncomfortable on the holy ground as a witch howard didnt care and he smiled and waved at the tiny hellos from the ceiling i probably owed howard a big thankyouit had been his idea that david should take me as his new business partner david set his worn leather hat on the piano and rocked from heel to toe looking every inch the alpha male albeit an uncomfortable one the faint hint of musk rose from the sturdy but graceful man and his hand nervously ran across the hint of stubble the almostfull moon was causing he wasnt tall for a man standing almost eye to eye with me but he made up for it in sheer presence sinewy would be the word id use to describe him or maybe yummy if he were in his running tights but like minias david had a problem with the differentspecies thing hed been forced to assume the title of alpha male for real when he accidentally turned two human women into weres it wasnt supposed to be possible but he had been in possession of a very powerful were artifact at the time watching david accept his responsibility left me both proud and guilty since it was partly my fault okay mostly my fault it would be a year come the winter solstice since david had started a pack with me pressured into it by his boss and obstinately choosing a witch instead of a were female so he wouldnt have to take on any new responsibilities it was a winwin situation david got to keep his job i got my insurance cheap but now he was an alpha for real and i was proud of him for accepting it with so much grace he went out of his way to make the two women he had turned with the focus feel wanted needed and welcome taking every chance he could to help them explore their new situation with joyous abandonment but i was most proud of his refusal to show the guilt he lived with knowing that if they knew how bad he felt for changing their lives without their consent they might feel that what they had become was wrong he had gone on to prove his nobility by taking the were curse from me to save my sanity the curse would have killed me by the first full moon david said he liked it i believed him though it worried me i appreciated david for everything he was and who he was becoming hi david howard ivy said from the top of the hall her hair freshly brushed and shoes now on her feet can you stay for dinner we have a slow cooker full of chili so theres plenty ivy however just wanted to get in davids pants david had started at her voice shifting his long coat closed he took a step back as he turned thanks but no he said eyes down im going for a run with the ladies howard might want to come back after dropping us off though howard mumbled something about a meeting and ivy turned to the stainedglass window and the moon just shy of full but hidden behind clouds weres could change anytime but the three days of a full moon were the only time it was legal to roam the citys streets on four paws tradition turned to law by paranoid humans what weres did in their own houses though was their own business the moonlit trail would be busy tonight ivys foot twitched like a cats tail as she sat turning her magazine over to hide the headline i had to work to keep a straight face it wasnt often that she was smitten enough by anyone to look like a high schooler with a crush and it wasnt that she was obvious about it but she was so closed with her emotions that any indication of attraction was as clear as finding love notes strewn on her bedroom floor shed probably recognized the sound of his car and had gone to tidy up using the excuse of lowering the music you should have called me when the demon showed david said edging to the door jenkss wings clattered as he darted from the desk to the center of the room i was there to save her ass he said belligerently then added a belated hi david whos your friend this is howard my old partner david said and jenkss head bobbed up and down oh yeah you stink for a witch whatcha been doing howard laughed the sound echoing into the rafters and setting the pixies giggling some freelance work thank you mr jenks ill take that as a compliment its just jenks the pixy muttered giving howard an unusual cautious look as he landed on my shoulder ivy was making eyes at david from over the crackers and the small man started edging toward the door in earnest do you want me to stay until sunup just in case good god no i exclaimed im on holy ground im as safe here as if i was in my mothers arms weve met your mother ivy said lightly that doesnt instill any confidence what is this pickonrachel night i said tired of it i can take care of myself no one said anything the silence broken by a stifled laugh from the rafters i looked up but the pixies had hidden themselves guess what shes doing tonight jenks said leaving me to escort a quickly retreating david and howard to the door making a list of people who want to kill her followed by ways to detect demon summoning she told me david retied his coat closed and headed for the door dont forget to put nick on there got him i said flopping into my chair and scowling at ivy she chased david away almost every time thanks jenks i shot at the pixy but he wasnt listening as he opened the door for david and rose up out of the cold draft david turned at the threshold behind him howard was heading down the steps to an unfamiliar station wagon parked by the curb was davids gray sports car bye rachel david said the light over the door glinting on his black hair call me tomorrow if i dont see you summoning demons usually results in a claim or two being filed when i get back to the office ill see if anything unusual has come in my eyebrows rose and i made a mental note to add insurance claims to the list david worked at one of the largest onpaper insurance companies in the united states and had access to just about everything given time actually maybe id call glenn at the fib to see if they had any complaints recently they kept great records to compensate for their utter lack of inderlander talents thanks ill do that i said as david followed his old partner out and shut the door ivy frowned at the dark foyer sipping her drink as one foot bobbed up and down seeing me track the motion she forced it still i jumped at the highpitched burst of noise from my desk eyes widening as four streaks of silver raced out from it and into the back of the church a crash brought me around in my seat and i wondered what had just fallen off the overhead rack in the kitchen and so it begins jack came matalinas shrill cry and she zipped out of the desk after them jenks intercepted her and the two had a rapid highpitched discussion in the hallway punctuated by bursts of ultrasonic sound that made my head hurt honey jenks coaxed when she slowed enough that we could hear them again boys will be boys ill talk to them and make them apologize what if they had done that when your cat came in she shrilled what then but they didnt he soothed they waited until she was secure hand shaking as she pointed to the back of the church she took a breath to start in again gulping it back when jenks kissed her soundly wrapping her slim form in his arms and body their wings somehow not tangling as they hovered in the hallway ill take care of it love he said when they parted his emotion so earnest that i dropped my eyes embarrassed matalina fled to the desk in a dusting of mortified red and after grinning at us in some masculine display ofmasculinity jenks flew to the back of the church jack he shouted the dust slipping from him a brilliant gold you know better than that get your brothers and get out here if i have to dig you out im going to clip your wings huh ivys long fingers carefully picked up a cracker ill have to try that what i asked shifting to prop my clipboard up on my knees ivy blinked slowly kissing someone from agitation into bliss her smile widened to show a slip of teeth and a sliver of ice dropped down my spine fear mixed with anticipation as unstoppable as jerking my hand from a flame and ivy could sense it as easily as she could see my embarrassed flush pulling herself upright she stood i blinked up at her as she stretched and brushing past me in a wave of vampire incense she headed for the door as the doorbell rang i got it she said her pace provocative david left his hat my exhaled breath was slow and long damn it i was not an adrenaline junkie and ivy knew we werent going to shift our relationship in either direction stillthe potential was there and i hated that she could flip switches in me as easily as i could flip them in her just cause you can do something doesnt mean you should right exasperated with myself i grabbed the empty cracker plate and headed for the kitchen maybe i needed a midnight run myself to clear my head of all the vamp pheromones in there cat in the house came ivys call and then a different voice filtered in stopping me cold hi im marshal if the mellow attractive voice hadnt jerked me to a halt the name would have and i spun in the hallway you must be ivy the man added is rachel in four marshal i exclaimed as my thoughts realigned and i figured out who was standing in our threshold what are you doing here i added as i headed back he shrugged and smiled and the cracker plate dangled from my hand as i pushed past a belligerent ivy to give him a onearmed hug dropping back a step i warmed but damn it was good to see him i had felt really guilty watching him swim back to his boat last spring having to go on hearsay that he made it back all right and that the mackinaw weres were leaving him alone but not contacting him had been the best thing to ensure his anonymity and safety the tall wideshouldered man continued to grin jenks left his hat on my boat he said extending the red leather cap to me you did not come all the way down here for that i said as i took it then squinted at the dark shadow of an infant beard on him youve got hair when did you get hair taking off his knitted cap he ducked his head to show its fuzz last week i brought the boat in for the season and when im not wearing a wet suit i can let it all grow back his brown eyes pinched in mock agony i itch like crazy everywhere ivy had moved back a step and setting the cracker plate on the table beside the door i took his arm and pulled him in the scent of his short wool coat was strong and i breathed it in thinking i could smell gas fumes mixing with the strong redwood smell that meant witch come on in i said waiting for him to finish wiping his boots on the mat before he followed me into the sanctuary ivy this is marshal i said seeing her with her arms crossed over her middle and davids hat in her grip the guy who got me out to the island at mackinaw and let me run off with his diving gear remember it sounded stupid but she hadnt said anything yet and i was getting nervous ivys eye twitched of course but jenks and i didnt see him at the high school pool when we returned his stuff so i never met him its a pleasure dropping davids hat on the small table beside the door she extended her hand and marshal took it he was still smiling but it was growing thin well this is it i said gesturing to the sanctuary and the rest of the unseen church proof that im not crazy you want to sit down you dont have to leave right away do you jenks will want to say hi i was babbling but ivy wasnt being nice and shed already driven one man out of the church tonight sure i can stay for a minute marshal took his coat off as he followed me to the furniture clustered in the corner i watched him take a deep breath of the chiliscented air and i wondered if hed stay if i asked plopping myself down in my chair i gave him a onceover as marshal eased his lean swimmers body down to the edge of the couch clearly not yet ready to relax the tall man sat on the edge with his arms flat on his legs marshal was wearing jeans and a dark green pullover that had a backwoods look to it the color going well with his honeycolored skin he looked great sitting there even if his eyebrows werent grown in yet and hed nicked himself shaving i remembered how utterly in control he had looked on his boat dressed in a swimsuit and an unzipped red windbreaker that showed skin so smooth it glistened and beautiful beautiful abs god he had had nice abs must be from all the swimming suddenly shocked i froze guilt turned my skin cold and i settled into my chair heartache riding high where enthusiasm had just flowed i had loved kisten i still loved him that id forgotten for even an instant was both a surprise and a pain id been listening to ivy and jenks long enough to know this was part of my pattern of getting hurt and then finding someone to hide the pain with but i wasnt going to be that person anymore i couldnt afford to be and if i saw it i could stop it but it was really good to see marshal he was proof that i didnt kill everyone i came in contact with and that was a welcome relief uh i stammered when i realized no one was talking i think my old boyfriend stole some of your gear before he went off the bridge sorry marshals wandering attention lighted briefly on the bruise on my neck before rising to my eyes i think he recognized something had shifted but he wasnt going to ask the fib found my stuff on the shore a week later no problem i didnt have a clue he was going to do that i said im really sorry he smiled faintly i know i saw the news you look good in cuffs ivy leaned against the wall by the hallway where she could see both of us she looked left out but that was her own fault she could sit down and join us i flashed her a glance which she ignored then turned to marshal you didnt really drive all the way down here to give jenks his hat did you no marshal dropped his head im here for an interview at the university and i wanted to see if you were jerking me around or if you really did have a job where you thought you could take on an entire were pack alone i wasnt alone i said flustered jenks was with me ivy uncrossed her ankles and pushed herself away from the wall an instant before jenks zipped in wings clattering marshal the exuberant pixy shouted dust slipping from him to make a sunbeam on the floor holy crap what the hell are you doing here marshals jaw dropped for an instant i thought he was going to stand up but then he fell all the way back into the couch jenks he stammered his eyes were wide as he looked at me and i nodded i thought you were kidding about him being a pixy nope i said enjoying marshals disbelief what you doin here old dog the pixy said darting from one side of him to the other marshal gestured helplessly i dont know what to do you were six feet tall the last time i saw you i cant shake your hand just stick your hand out ivy said dryly let him land on it anything to get him to stop flying around i said loudly and jenks settled on the table his wings going so fast i could feel a draft its great to see you jenks said again making me wonder just why we were so glad to see marshal maybe it was because he had helped us when we really needed it at great risk to himself when he owed us nothing crap on my daisies jenks said rising up and settling back down ivy you should have seen his face when rachel told him we were going to rescue her exboyfriend from an island full of militant weres i still cant believe he did it marshal smiled neither can i she looked like she could use some help was all ivy made a questioning face at me and i shrugged okay seeing me in a tight rubber suit might have swayed his decision but it wasnt as if i had dressed up to romance help out of him marshals eyes darted to ivy when she pushed herself into motion sleek and predatory she eased onto the couch beside him angling herself so her back was to the armrest one knee pulled up to her chin the other draped over the edge of the couch her magazine slid to the floor when she bumped it and she pointedly set it on the table between us with the headlines showing she was acting like a jealous girlfriend and i didnt like it huh jenks said a smile on him as he looked at me sitting with my hands clasped primly in my lap and that unusual amount of space between marshal and myself i guess you can teach a young witch new tricks jenks i exclaimed knowing he was talking about me distancing myself from marshal but the poor witch didnt have a clue thank god incensed i made a snatch for the pixy and the laughing fourinch man settled himself on marshals shoulder marshal stiffened but didnt move but for tilting his head and trying to see jenks you said you were here for an interview ivy said pleasantly but i didnt trust her mood as far as i could throw her which was about three feet on a good day moving carefully as if jenks might leave marshal eased into the cushions and away from her at the university he said showing signs of nervousness whats the job ivy questioned and i could almost hear her think janitor though not saying one cross word she wasnt being nice like id asked him to come over to betray kistens memory marshal must have picked up on it too for he shifted his wide shoulders and tilted his head to crack his neck clearly a nervous tick id be coaching the swim team but once im on the payroll i can put in for a real teaching position teaching what jenks asked suspiciously at that marshal smiled minor ley line manipulations more of a high school course than anything else a primer to bring deficient students up for the hundredlevel classes clearly ivy wasnt impressed but she probably didnt know that he had to be at a fourhundred level to instruct anyone in anything i had no idea where my ley line proficiency put me seeing as i was picking it up as i went along learning what i had to when i needed it not what was safe or prudent in a steady progressive pace cincinnati doesnt have a swim team ivy said sounds like quite a job to build one marshals head bobbed and the stubble on it caught the light it will be normally i wouldnt even try for the position but i earned my bachelors here and coming back feels right hey jenks exclaimed and i shivered in the draft from his wings youre a cincy boy what year did you graduate class of he said proudly holy crap youre almost thirty the pixy said damn you look good almost no im past it he said clearly unwilling to divulge just how much but since he was a witch it didnt really matter its the swimming he said softly then looked at ivy as if he knew she was going to look up his records i majored in business management and i used my degree to start marshals mackinaw wrecks disappointment flickered over him but thats not going to work anymore so here i am too cold jenks said either ignoring that we were likely the reason it wasnt working anymore or trying to make light of it god i froze my nuggie plums off in that water i winced thinking jenkss mouth was getting steadily worse almost as if he had to prove he was a man in front of marshal and the way to do it was to be as raunchy as he could but i had heard the hint of blame in marshals words the mackinaw weres found out you had something to do with me getting onto the island didnt they i said knowing i was right when he looked at his waterstained yellow leather boots shit im sorry marshal i said wishing now id just knocked him on his head and stolen his stuff at least hed still have his business id done the right thing and it had hurt him in the long run where was the justice in that his smile was tight when he pulled his head up and even ivy looked apologetic dont worry about it he said i didnt lose anything that mattered in the fire fire i whispered appalled and he nodded it was time for me to come back he said one shoulder rising in a shrug i only started the diving business so i could build the capital to get my masters ivys fingers drumming on the couch went still youre finishing your degree saying nothing marshal ran his gaze over her as if estimating how great a threat she was and nodded hey i have to go ive got a couple of apartments im looking at tonight and if i dont show on time the realtor will probably figure it was a halloween prank and leave he stood and i found myself rising as well jenks darted into the air grumbling about not having anything comfortable to put his ass on in the entire church before he landed on my shoulder i wanted to go with marshal so the realtor wouldnt convince him to take a rattrap that would be noisy with humans after sunup but he probably knew cincinnati as well as i did not much changed fast despite the size of the city besides i didnt want to give him the wrong idea ivy stood as marshal shrugged into his coat nice to meet you marshal she said then turned her back on him as she walked out five seconds later i heard her taking the lid off the slow cooker and a new wave of tomato beans and spices wafted out can you stay for dinner i found myself asking not knowing why except that he had helped jenks and me and i owed him we actually cooked tonight chili marshals eyes went to the top of the dark hallway no but thank you im having dinner with a couple of guys from school i just wanted to bring jenks his hat and say hi oh okay of course hed have friends here i was being stupid i followed him to the door to see him out my eyes landing on jenkss leather cap back after months of being with marshal i was glad to see him and i wished he could stay but it was tinged with depression from the guilt that i even wanted him to glowing a hot gold jenks hovered at eyeheight beside marshal as i reached to open the door its good to see you marshman he said if it was warmer id show you my stump the way he said it almost sounded like a threat and i could see marshal thinking about it as he slowly buttoned his coat probably trying to decide if he was serious or not i wanted to talk to marshal alone for a moment but jenks wasnt leaving jenks suddenly noticed that neither of us was talking and when i made a face at him he dropped in height if you want me to go you just have to say so he said sullenly then darted off to leave a fading sprinkling of pixy dust to glow on the floor for a moment my blood pressure dropped and i smiled at marshal that was the most excellent charm ive ever seen marshal said softly his eyes dark to take in the limited light in the foyer making him humansize then small again its not half as excellent as the person who actually made it for me i said thinking that ceri should get her just dues i just invoked it marshal took his hat out of his wide pocket and put it on i felt a twinge of relief when he reached for the door then guilt that id enjoyed seeing him again god how long will i have to live like this marshal hesitated turning back he searched my face i silently waited not knowing what might come out of his mouth i ahim not interfering in something am i he asked with your roommate i grimaced cursing both ivy for her jealousness and jenks for his protective nature god help them were they that obvious no i said quickly then dropped my gaze its not that my boyfriend i took a breath and lowered my voice so it wouldnt break i just lost my boyfriend and they both think ill jump into bed with the first guy to come into the church simply to fill the ache he left behind a fear that is both understandable and at the same time unnecessary marshal shifted his weight back the guy that went over the bridge he asked quizzically i thought you didnt like him not him i said flicking my eyes to his and away my boyfriend after him kisten wasimportant to both ivy and me he died to prevent an undead vampire from binding me to himi dont remember it but i know he did and i still i closed my eyes a lump in my throat i still miss him i said miserably i looked at marshal needing to see what he thought his face was carefully blank of expression he died he said and i nodded looking away i think i understand he said as he reached to touch my shoulder and guilt tweaked through me as i soaked in the support radiating from him im really sorry about your boyfriend umi didnt know i should have called before coming over ill just uh go his hand slipped away and my head came up marshal i said reaching to take his sleeve and he stopped i let go then glanced behind me at the empty church then back to him i loved kisten but i had to try to start living again the pain would ebb only if i pushed it out with something good marshal patiently waited and i took a deep breath id like to see you again i said miserable if you want i mean i really cant handle having a boyfriend right now but ive got to get out of this church do something his eyes widened and i blurted never mind no no he said thats cool he hesitated then shrugged to be honest im not looking for a girlfriend either i kind of doubted that but i nodded grateful he pretended to understand there used to be a place by the waterfront that had really good pizza he offered piscarys i almost panicked not kistens old dance club uh its closed i said which was the truth the elaborate apartments underground were now the property of rynn cormel and since he wasnt a partier he had gutted the upper rooms and turned them into a day residence for his living guests and staff but it still had one hell of a kitchen or so ivy said weight shifting to one foot marshal frowned in thought dont the howlers have an exhibition game this week i havent seen them play in years im banned i said and he looked at me as if he thought i was joking from the howlers he said maybe we could just have lunch or something okay i said slowly not knowing if i could actually do this his smile widened and he opened the door i have that interview tomorrow but i was going to go look at some apartments before that if i treat you to coffee will you tell me which ones are overcharging me unless youre working two days before halloween i clasped my arms about me in the sudden chill i hadnt expected to do anything this soon and now i was having second thoughts i thought of backing out on the excuse of needing to track down a demon summoner before sundown tomorrow but i had to give my sources time to work i stunk at research and i knew enough people who enjoyed it to pass it off on them sure i reluctantly said it was coffee how bad could it be perfect he said and i froze when he eased forward before it could become a hug or worse a kiss i stuck out my hand marshal tried to make his shift to my hand natural but it was kind of obvious and his fingers slipped from mine almost immediately embarrassed by my guilt and misery i looked down im sorry youre still hurting he said sincerely as he stepped back onto the stoop the light from the sign above the door made shadows on him his eyes when i met them held a soft emotion black from the low light nothing more ill see you tomorrow about noon i nodded as i tried to think of something to saybut my mind was empty marshal smiled one last time before taking the steps lightly and heading for the newmodel chromeplated sport utility at the curb numb i backed up into the church my shoulder thumping painfully into the doorjamb and startling me back into reality heartache swelled as i shut the door and leaned back against it to stare into the sanctuary i had to start living again even if it killed me five the soft click of teeth on the knob of my bedroom door stirred me but it wasnt until a wet nose snuffled in my ear that i truly woke up with a pulse of adrenaline that was better than chugging three cups of coffee david i exclaimed jerking upright and scooting back to the headboard my covers pulled to my neck how did you get in here pulse hammering my panic subsided turning to irritation when i saw his pricked ears and his doggy smile my gaze slid to my clock eleven damn it i had a good hour left before the alarm was going to ring irritated i flicked the alarm off no way would i get back to sleep now not after a weres version of a wet willy whats the matter your car not starting i asked the large gangly wolf but he only sat on his haunches and let his tongue loll as he stared at me with his luscious brown eyes get out of my room i have to get up im meeting someone for coffee i said making shooing motions with one hand at that david snuffed a negation and i hesitated im not meeting someone for coffee i said ready to believe him is ivy okay is it jenks worried i swung my feet to the floor david put his front paws each as big as a saucer to either side of me to keep me sitting his breath was warm and he gave me a comforting lick he wouldnt get this close in his people skin but wearing fur seemed to bring out the softer side of most weres i eased back deciding everything was okay he didnt look worried talking to you is like talking to a fish i complained and david huffed his claws clicking on the hardwood floor as he got off my bed you want some clothes i asked seeing as he probably hadnt woken me up for the hell of it if it wasnt car problems maybe he had forgotten to bring something to change into you might fit in jenkss old stuff david bobbed his head and after a brief thought of my almostnakedness i got out of bed and snagged my robe from the back of a chair i kept a pair of his sweats i said as i shrugged into the blue terry cloth and tied it closed with an abrupt embarrassed haste but david had turned to the hallway the perfect gentleman feeling awkward i dragged a box down from my closet shelf and dropped it on my bed not that we had a lot of naked men in our church but i wasnt going to throw out jenkss old clothes from when he had been peoplesize the scent of queen annes lace came to me when i wrestled the box open fingers searching through the cool fabric my slight headache eased and the smell of growing things and sunshine rose high jenks smelled good and it hadnt washed out here you go i said when i found the sweats and extended them to him his brown eyes sheepish david carefully took them in his mouth before padding to the dim hallway the oak floorboards glowing with morning sun reflecting in from the living room and kitchen shuffling to the bathroom i decided he had probably locked himself out of his car and change of clotheswhich left me curious as to where the ladies were david didnt seem to be distressed and i knew he would be if either one of them had a problem wondering how david knew i didnt have a coffee date when i hadnt even told him i had one to begin with i shuffled into the bathroom and quietly shut the door to keep everyone who was sleeping sleeping it was nearing the golden hour of noon when the church went silentivy and me asleep and the pixies just settling down for their fourhour nap hanging on the back of the door my costume thumped and i quieted it listening for the hum of pixy wings i fingered the supple leather in the silence hoping i would get a chance to wear it i was pretty much churchbound after dark until i nailed whoever was sending al after me and halloween wasnt a holiday to be missed since the turnthe nightmarish three years following the supernatural species coming out of the closetthe holiday had been gaining strength until now it was celebrated for an entire week becoming the unofficial celebration for the turn itself the turn actually began in the late summer of sixtysix when humanity began dying of a virus carried by a bioengineered tomato that was supposed to feed the growing populations of the thirdworld countries but it was on halloween that we celebrated it that was the day inderland had decided to come out of the closet before humanity found us by way of the why arent these people dying question it had been thought that halloween might ease the panic and it had most of the surviving human population thought it was a joke easing the chaos for a day or two until they realized that we hadnt eaten them yesterday so why would we today they still threw a bloodyhell tantrum but at least it had been aimed at the bioengineers who designed the accidentally lethal fruit instead of us no one had been so tactless as to make the holiday official but everyone took the week off human bosses didnt say er boo when their inderland employees called in sick and no one even mentioned the turn we did throw tomatoes instead of eggs though put peeled ones in bowls and called them eyeballs stacked them up on our porches along with carved pumpkins and generally tried to grossout the human population that wouldnt touch the nolongerlethal red fruit if i was stuck in my church for the night i was going to be ticked by the time i finished a quick morning prep and was headed for the kitchen david was changed and at the table with coffee brewing and two empty mugs waiting the hat he had forgotten yesterday was beside him and he looked good sitting there with a thick black stubble heavy on him and his long black hair loose and flowing id never seen him so casual before and it was nice morning i said around a yawn and he turned to acknowledge me did you and the ladies have a good run he was smiling his brown eyes showing his pleasure mmmm they headed home from here on paws confident enough without me thats why im here actually i sat at my spot at the table the bright sun and the scent of coffee making my head hurt there was a stack of latenight newspapers opened to the obituaries that id gone through before bed there had been nothing obvious but glenn my fib contact was running the three young witches id found there through their database to see if they were known acquaintances one had died of a heart attack at age thirty another of a brain aneurism and the third of sudden appendicitiswhich had once been a common preturn expression for a magic misfire soon as i got this mornings edition id pass any more likely candidates on to glenn he was working halloween since he was a human and didnt celebrate it he policed it i thought youd locked yourself out of your car i said and he chuckled no i would have just run the rest of the way home if i had i wanted to ask you about a pack tattoo my eyebrows rose oh most were packs had a registered tattoo but i hadnt seen the need and david was used to standing alone seeing my reluctance david shrugged its time serena and kally are confident enough to be on their own in fur and if they dont have a sign of pack recognition someone might think theyre curs he hesitated serena especially is getting cocky and theres nothing wrong with that she has every right but unless she has an obvious way to show her status and affiliation someone will challenge her the coffeemaker finished with a hiss i got up eager for the distraction id never given it much thought but the tattoos that weres decorated themselves with had a real and significant purpose they probably prevented hundreds of skirmishes and potential injuries allowing the multitude of packs that lived in cincy to get along with minimal friction okay i said slowly pouring out the coffee into his mug first what were you thinking of i dont want a tattoo the damn things hurt clearly pleased david took a mug when i came back and offered it theyve put their heads together and came up with something with you in mind images of broomsticks and crescent moons danced in my head and i cringed the were leaned forward the pleasant scent of musk giving away his eagerness a dandelion but with black fluff instead of white oh cool i thought and seeing my reaction david smiled with one side of his mouth i take it thats okay then he asked blowing across his coffee i suppose i ought to get one too i asked worried unless you want to be rude he admonished gently they put a lot of thought into it it would mean a lot to them if you would a breath of guilt wafted through me and i hid it behind a gulp of scalding coffee i hadnt done much with serena and kally maybe we could get our tattoos together oh god im going to be a hundred and sixty with a flower on my ass you ah said i dont have a coffee date i said changing the subject what do you know that i dont david nodded to a scrap of paper in the middle of the table and i pulled it closer jenks let me in before he headed off for his nap he said matalina his words drifted to nothing and i looked up from jenkss note what about her shes fine he said easing my worry but she was going to bed early and there was no need for him to stay up to man the door if i was here so i told him to go i nodded and turned my attention back to the note uneasy about matalina but glad that ivy and i had broken jenks of answering the phone without taking a message according to the note marshals interview had been moved from tonight to this morning and he wanted to know if we could get together at about three instead plenty of time to do something before al started gunning for me after sundown there was a number and i couldnt help but smile below it was another number with the cryptic message job and jenkss reminder that rent was due on thursday the first not friday the second or monday the fifth i should get home david said softly as he rose and took another gulp from his mug hat in hand he said thanks for the coffee ill let serena and kally know you like their idea um david i said and i saw his brow crease at the sound of ivy moving about do you think theyd mind if i went with them when they got their tattoos his sundarkened face broke into a smile the faint wrinkles about his eyes deepening in pleasure i think theyd like that ill ask them thanks i said and he jumped at a bumping sound from ivys room youd better get going unless you want to be here when she gets up he was silent as his face reddened ill lope in to work later and check out the recent claims for possible demon damage there wont be anyone in two days before halloween so i wont have to explain myself this isnt illegal is it i asked suddenly ive gotten you in enough trouble as it is davids smile was easy and a bit devilish no he said shrugging with one shoulder but why draw attention to yourself dont worry about it if someone in cincy is summoning demons any claims will be odd enough to be flagged for investigation at least youll know then if its a local threat help you narrow your suspects i drew my coffee closer and slumped into the hard chair thanks david i appreciate it if i can shut down the guy summoning al then i wont have to take minias up on his offer i didnt want a demons summoning name especially als unusable or not a sliver of worry slipped between my thought and reason and i forced my smile to be light but david saw it coming closer he put a small but powerful hand on my shoulder well get him dont do anything with that demon promise i winced and david sighed when i didnt say anything there was a soft creak of a door opening and david started like a deer ill uh bring jenkss sweats back later okay he muttered then grabbed his hat and almost ran for the back door red faced as i chuckled still smiling i stretched for the phone and brought jenkss note with the number for the potential job closer i wasnt going to work until after halloween but it would be nice to have something lined up for the first of the month besides i didnt have anything else to do this afternoon but surf the net for local demon sightings and bug glenn for his findings and that i thought as i reached for the phone would only slow him down six the muffled thump thump thump of the rubber seal of the revolving door overtook the street noise and turned into the echoing sound of sporadic voices as i entered carew tower it had grown warm so id left my coat in the car deeming jeans and a sweater would be enough until the sun went downand id be back in my church by then hoping i didnt lose my signal i tried to catch what marshal was saying as i held my phone to my ear and waited for my eyes to adjust to the dimmer light im really sorry rachel marshal said sounding embarrassed they asked me to come in early when someone canceled and it wasnt like i could say no no its okay i said glad i was my own boss even if my boss was an idiot sometimes stepping inside i shifted out of the foot traffic and took my sunglasses off i had an errand come up so this might work out better anyway you want to grab a coffee at fountain square three is good not breakfast not lunch a nice safe hour with no expectations attached the only thing is i have to be back on hallowed ground by sunset i added remembering ive got a demon gunning for me until i can figure out whos sending him to kill me and knock some sense into him or her as soon as i said it i couldnt help but wonder if i was trying to drive him away but marshal laughed quickly sobering when he realized i was serious uh how are your interviews going i asked to break the uncomfortable silence ask me in a few hours he groaned softly ive got two more people to meet i havent kissed so much ass since i accidentally knocked a customer off the dock i chuckled my gaze rising across the busy lobby to the signs directing people to the elevators my smile ended with a flash of guilt then i got mad at myself i could laugh damn it laughing was not saying i had cared for kisten less he had loved to make me laugh maybe we should try tomorrow instead marshal said softly as if he knew why i was suddenly silent tucking my shades into my bag i headed for the express elevators i was meeting a mr doemoe at the observation deck some people just love the cloak and dagger theres a coffee cart at fountain square i suggested with a bitter resolve i can do this damn it it was right next to a hot dog cart kisten had liked hot dogs a memory hit mean image of kisten in his snappy pinstriped work suit leaning casually next to me against the huge planters at fountain square smiling as he caught a drop of mustard from the corner of his mouth the wind ruffling his hair and him squinting from the sun i felt my stomach cave god i cant do this marshals voice intruded sounds great first one there buys i take a grande with three sugars and a hint of cream black straight up i said almost numb hiding in my church because of heartache was worse than hiding there because of a demon and i didnt want to be that person fountain square it is marshal said ill see you then you got it i replied as i passed the security desk and good luck i added remembering what he was doing today thanks rachel bye i waited until i heard the phone disconnect then whispered bye before shutting the phone and tucking it away this was harder than i had thought it would be my melancholy trailed behind me like a shadow as i went down the short hall my thoughts slowly turning to the upcoming client meeting the roof i thought rolling my eyes honestly mr doemoe had sounded like a mouse of a man when i called him earlier to set this up hed refused to come to the church and i hadnt been able to tell by phone if he was nervous because he was a human asking a witch for help or if he was just worried that someone was out to get him whatever the job couldnt be that bad i had told jenks to stay home since it was simply an interview besides i was running errands and dragging jenks around when i went to the post office and fib building was a major waste of his time my trip to the fib had been productive and i now had information on my original three witches plus an additional one from this mornings obituaries apparently two of the recently dead witches knew each other seeing as they had joint prior arrests for the crime of grave robbing i thought it interesting that the arresting is officer had been tom bansen the same nasty little twerp who had tried to arrest me yesterday this was looking easier all the time tom had all the motive he needed to call a demon to take me outseeing as id told him to shove his little demonsummoning club last year he also had the knowledge to do it being high up in the iss arcane division that in itself would make his demonsummoning hobby harder to trace and recruitment easy as hed run into all sorts of blackart witches eager to make a deal david was still checking recent claims for me and if any of them pointed to tom the is officer and i were going to have a chat we might have a chat anyway i really didnt think it was nick sending al after me i mean i had misjudged his character badly but actively sending a demon to kill me my gaze unfocused in the memory of our last conversation and as i turned the corner i saw one of the express elevator doors closing maybe i shouldnt have been so bitchy with him he had sounded desperate jogging forward i called out for whoever was in the elevator to hold it a weathered sturdy hand gripped the door at the last moment to wedge it open i darted inside the otherwise empty lift turning to the man to give him a breathless thanks but my words caught in my throat and i froze quen i snapped seeing the plaguescarred elf standing in the corner he smiled without showing his teeth and at the hint of amusement in his eyes it all fell into place oh hell no i said looking for the elevator panel for a button to push but he was standing in front of it youre mr doemoe forget it im not working for trent the older man hit the highest button adjusted his weight and clasped his hands before him i wanted to talk to you this was the easiest way you mean this is the only way cause you know id tell trent he can shove his problem up an orifice i said as professional as always ms morgan his gravelly voice was mocking and knowing i was trapped here until we reached the upper floors i slumped in the corner not caring if i looked sullen for the cameras i was sullen i wasnt going to tap a line you dont pull a gun unless youre going to use itand you dont tap a line in front of a master of ley line magic unless you want to be slammed up against the wall quens smile faded he appeared innocuous in his longsleeved shirt and matching black pants which looked vaguely like a uniform yeah he was innocuous like black mamba innocuous the man stood only a few inches taller than me in his flat softsoled shoes but he moved with a liquid grace that put me on edge as if he was able to see me react before i actually did i was trapped in a tiny metal box with an elf skilled in martial arts and black ley line magic maybe i should be nice at least until the doors open his complexion was marred by the scars a few inderlanders had come away with from the turn and his roughened dark skin only added to his presence a vampire bite marked his neck most of the white scar tissue hidden by his high black collar piscary had given the scar to him in anger and i wondered how quen was handling the new problem of having an unclaimed vampire bite now that piscary was truly dead i had one too but ivy would kill any vampire who broke my skin and all of cincy knew it quen didnt have any such protection perhaps the bite was why he wanted to talk to meif this wasnt about a run for trent quen was trent kalamacks eminently skilled security officer one hundred percent deadly though id trust him with my life if he said hed watch my back trent was just as dangerous without having earned my trust but he did his damage with words not actionsa stinking politician at his best a murderer at his worst the financially successful attractive charismatic hunk of man flesh efficiently ran most of cincinnatis underworld and the northern hemispheres illegal brimstone trade but what trent could go to jail for besides being a murdering bastardfor which id gotten him incarcerated for all of three hours a few months agowas his worldwide trade in illegal biodrugs what really stuck in my craw was that i was alive because of them id been born with a fairly common genetic defect among witches rosewood syndrome where my mitochondria kicked out an enzyme my body determined was an invader the result being that i should have died before the age of two because my dad had secretly been working closely with trents dad trying to save his species at the time trents dad had tinkered with the genetic makeup of my mitochondria modifying something just enough that the enzyme would be ignored i truly believe that he hadnt known the enzyme was what allowed my blood to kindle demon magic and i thanked god the only people who knew it were me and my friends and trent and a few demons and whatever demons they told and whomever trent told and lee of course the only other witch trents dad had fixed okay so maybe it wasnt that good a secret anymore trent and i were currently at an impasse with me trying to put him in jail and him trying to buy my services or kill medepending on his moodand while i could bring the house down on him if i went public about his illegal biodrugs id probably end up in medical confinement in siberiaor worse yet surrounded by salt water like alcatrazand hed be back on the streets and campaigning for reelection in less time than it takes a pixy to sneeze thats just the kind of personal power the man had and it is really irritating i thought shifting my weight to my other foot as the elevator dinged and the doors slid open immediately i got out and jabbed at the down button no way was i going to go through the halls to the closetsize secondary elevator and up to the roof with quen i was impulsive not stupid quen ghosted out as well looking like a bodyguard as he stood in front of the elevator doors until they closed again my eyes went to the camera in the corner its friendly red light blinking id stay there until another car arrived dont touch me i muttered there isnt enough money in the world for me to work for trent again hes a manipulative powerhungry spoiled onlychild who thinks hes above the law and he kills people like a homeless man opens a can of beans quen shrugged hes also loyal to those who have earned his trust intelligent and generous to those he cares about and those he doesnt care about dont matter hip cocked i silently waited getting more annoyed where in hell is the elevator i wish youd reconsider quen said and i jerked back when he pulled an amulet from his sleeve after giving me a higheyebrow look he turned a slow circuit attention lightly fixed on the redwood disk glowing a faint green it was probably a detection amulet of some kind i had one that would tell me if there were any deadly spells in my vicinity but id quit wearing it when it kept triggering the antitheft wards in the mall apparently satisfied quen slid the amulet away i need you to go into the everafter to retrieve an elven sample i laughed at that and anger flickered over the older man trent just got ceris sample i said pulling my shoulder bag tight to me id think that would keep him busy for a while besides you couldnt pay me enough to go into the everafter especially not for a chunk of twothousandyearold dead elf one of the elevators behind me dinged and i backed up to it ready to make my escape we know where a tissue sample is we just need to get it quen said his gaze flicking behind me as the doors opened i backed into it standing so he couldnt follow me how i said feeling secure ceri he said simply fear flashing in the back of his eyes the doors started to close and i hit the open button ceri i questioned wondering if this was why i hadnt seen much of her lately she knew i hated trent but she was an elf and he was an elfand seeing as she had been born into royalty and he was a zillionaire it would be foolish to think that they hadnt had some contact the last few months whether they liked each other or not seeing my interest quen took a more confident stance she and trent have been having tea every thursday he said softly sneaking a guilty glance at the hallway you should thank her hes absolutely obsessed with her even as her demon smut terrifies him i think thats part of the attraction actually but hes starting to consider that demon smut might not equal a bad person she saved my relationship with him she is a very wise woman she ought to be seeing as she had over a thousand years of servitude to a demon the doors started closing again and i hit the button for a few more seconds everything went to hell when trent found out you use black magic to protect him eh quen didnt shift even maintaining his sedate breathing but his very stillness told me i was right so i said belligerently so hes starting to entertain the thought that you might be trustworthy too will you at least consider it we need the sample the reminder of my own demonsmutlaced soul bothered me and i jabbed at the close button no freaking way get back to me later quen like a hundred years later we dont have a hundred years quen said desperation entering his voice we have eight months oh shit i pushed myself into motion my shoulder bag catching on the doors as i shoved my way past them quen had moved back his lips were tightly pressed as if he wished he hadnt had to say that to get me to listen what do you mean eight months as in one less than nine quen said nothing didnt even look at me and i didnt dare touch him he got her pregnant i exclaimed not caring who heard me the son of a bitch the stinking son of a bitch i was so angry i was almost laughing quens jaw had clenched so tight his pox scars stood out white and stark will you do it he said stiffly i want to talk to trent i said no wonder ceri was avoiding me the woman was recovering from a thousand years of demon servitude and trent goes and gets her pregnant where is he shopping my eyes narrowed where across the street he was shopping a hundred to one it wasnt for baby booties or a car seat remembering marshal and our coffee date i glanced out the cloudy window to estimate the time it couldnt be much past one oclock plenty of time unless this was a ruse and trent was going to try to kill mein which case i might run a little late i hit the down button hard and the elevator doors opened immediately shopping he was shopping after you i said and followed quen into the lift seven the thin heat from the sidewalk vanished when i turned the corner and entered the shadow of tall buildings where is he i said holding my hair out of my face when i looked to quen he was beside and a little behind me and it gave me the creeps the quiet powerful man pointed with his eyes across the street and when i followed his gaze i felt a wash of apprehension other earthlings costumer inc holy crap trent was picking out a halloween costume i pushed myself into motion and headed for the exclusive costumer well why not trent had parties to go to like anyone else probably more of them but other earthlings you needed an appointment just to walk in especially in october hesitating at the curb i felt quens presence slide up behind me will you stop guarding me i muttered and quen made a little start sorry he said then hastened to catch up when i crossed in the middle of the street i caught him glancing at the crosswalk and snickered yeah me bad after a moments hesitation at the brass by appointment only sign i reached for the door only to have someone from inside pull it open the doorman looked seriously braindead when i entered but before i could say anything an older woman in a crisp peach skirt and jacket clickclacked to us the sound of her heels muffled when they found the thick white carpet im sorry were closed to walkins the woman said her face a mix of cool professionalism and polite disdain at my jeans and sweater would you like to make an appointment for next year my pulse quickened and i cocked my hip at her obvious but unspoken opinion that hell would freeze over before id ever have enough money to buy even a complexion charm from them i took a breath to demand to see their hair straighteners knowing their claim to be able to straighten any hair wouldnt be able to touch mine when quen settled in behind me too close for my comfort oh youre with mr kalamack she said only the faintest blush marring the aged whiteness of her complexion i glanced at quen not really im rachel morgan and ive got something to say to mr kalamack i understand hes here the womans mouth dropped open and she came forward to take my hands youre alices daughter she said breathlessly oh i should have known you look just like her or you would if she wouldnt spell herself down it is such a pleasure to meet you excuse me she was pumping my arm up and down enthusiastically and when i looked at quen he seemed as mystified as me we dont have any openings today sweetheart she said and i blinked at her familiarity but let me talk to renfold hell stay late for you your mothers straightening charms have saved our reputation too many times my mothers hair straighteners i managed grabbing her wrist and extraditing my hand from hers i was going to have to talk to my mother this was so notgood just how long had she been making bootleg charms the woman sylvia according to a name tag outlined in green pearls smiled and winked at me as if we were grand friends you dont think youre the only person who has difficulttocharm hair she said then reached to touch my hair fondly as if it were a thing of beauty not a constant bother i will never understand why no one is satisfied with what nature gives them i think its wonderful that you appreciate yours appreciate wasnt the right word but i didnt want to stand here and discuss hair uh i need to speak to trent hes still here right the womans surprise that i was on a firstname basis with the eminently eligible bachelor flashed across her face she glanced at quen who nodded and with a soft this way please she led us through the store i felt better now that we were moving even if the staff was whispering as sylvia led us along a wandering path through racks of scrumptious clothing the store smelled wonderfully of expensive fabrics and exotic perfumes plus the snap of ozone that said ley line charms were made and invoked here other earthlings was an allencompassing costumer supplying the clothes prosthetics as needed and charms to make anyone into anyone else they werent online and the only way you could get their products was to make an appointment i couldnt help but wonder what trent was going for costumewise quen was behind me again and sylvia led us past a small back counter and to a short hall with four doors they were set back like the entries to highclass hotel rooms and from behind the last i could hear trents voice the soft murmur of it went right to my middle and twisted something god he had a beautiful voice low resonant and rich with unexplored undertoneslike shadowed moss in the sundappled woods i was certain his voice contributed to how well he did in the city electionsif the generous donations to underprivileged children and hospitals werent enough clearly not hearing anything in trents voice but words sylvia knocked smartly on the door and entered without waiting for an invitation i hung back and let quen go in ahead of me i didnt like being burst in upon by rude salespeople and they did sell clothes here and while seeing trent in his tightywhities would make my decade id found out long ago that i couldnt stay mad at a man wearing nothing but underwear they looked so charmingly vulnerable the rich smell of wool and leather struck deeper as i entered the lights were low at the perimeter of the comfortably warm lowceilinged room helping to hide the open cupboards filled with racks of costumes hats feathers wings and even tailsthings that ley line charms couldnt easily create to my right in the shadows was a low table holding wine and cheese to my left a tall screen smack in the middle and under can lights was an anklehigh round stage cradled in the lee of a trifold mirror low racks of amulets surrounded it the wood structures having the smoothness and color of hundredyearold ash and in the center of it all was trent he wasnt aware i was in the room clearly trying to fend off the overenthusiastic attentions of the witch helping him try on ley line amulets beside him was jon his freakishly tall lackey and i bristled remembering him tormenting me when i had been a mink trapped in trents office trent frowned at his reflection and handed the clerk an amulet his hair flashed back to its usual transparent whiteness that some children have and the witch began babbling deducing that he wasnt doing well trent was clean shaven and comfortably tan with a smooth brow green eyes that gorgeous voice and a cultivated laugh a politician through and through he wasnt much taller than me when i was in heels wearing his thousanddollar silkandlinen suit with the vote for kalamack pin well it accented his trim form making me believe he actually got out and rode his racewinning horses more than once every new moon when he played the huntsman in his fencedin oldgrowth planned forest he gave the witch a professional smile as he refused another amulet his unworked hands gesturing smoothly there were no rings on his fingers and seeing as i broke up his wedding by arresting him it was likely it would stay that way unless he was going to make an honest woman of ceri which i doubted trent lived by appearances and him publicly joining with a demons exfamiliar covered in smut any witch could see with their second sight probably didnt fit into his political agenda he hadnt seemed to have a problem knocking her up though trent ran his fingers over his carefully styled hair to flatten a few floating strands as sylvia approached shifting my shoulder bag forward i said loudly that suit would look better with a burping pad trent stiffened his eyes flicking to the mirror he searched the shadows for me at his side jon pulled himself upright the distasteful man holding a thin hand to his eyes to see through the glare the witch at his feet fell back and sylvia murmured an apology flustered as her most valuable client and the daughter of one of her suppliers glared at each other quen trent finally said his voice now hard but no less beautiful i dont doubt you have an explanation for this quen took a slow breath before he started forward you werent listening sahan i had to try another method to bring you to see reason trent waved the clerk away and jon strode across the room to flick on the main lights i squinted as light blossomed then smiled cattily at trent he had regained his composure remarkably fast with only the slight tightening of the skin around his eyes giving away his annoyance i was listening he said turning i choose to think other than you stepping from the stage the multimillionaire shook his sleeves down it was a nervous reaction he had yet to break himself of or maybe his jacket was too tight ms morgan he said lightly not meeting my gaze your services are not required you have my apologies for my security officer wasting your time tell me what i owe you and jon will draft you a check that was kind of insulting and i couldnt help my snort i dont charge if i dont do the run i said unlike some people i held my arms over my chest as a flicker of annoyance crossed trents face and vanished and i didnt come here to work for you i added i came because i wanted to tell you to your face that youre a lowlife manipulative bastard i told you if you hurt ceri that id be ticked consider yourself warned angry was good the pain from losing kisten disappeared when i was angry and right now i was pissed the witch who had been helping him gasped and sylvia started for me rocking to a halt when trent lifted his hand to stop her god i hated thatas if he had given me permission to call him names ticked i tilted my head waiting for his response is that a threat trent asked softly my gaze went to jon who was grinning as if my saying yes would please him immensely quens expression had gone dark he was mad but what had he really expected me to do still i did want to get out of here on my own power and not at the end of an is leash arrested for harassmentor whatever trent wanted he might own the is now that piscary was gone take it any way you want i said you are scum absolute scum and the world would be better without you i wasnt sure i truly believed that but it felt good saying it trent thought for all of three seconds sylvia if we might have the room i stood smug as the room emptied with soft murmurs of apologies given and reassurances offered jon he added as sylvia headed out see that we are not disturbed sylvia hesitated by the open door then vanished into the hallway to leave the door open the older mans craggy face went pale he was being gotten rid of and he knew it sahan he started cutting it short when trents eyes narrowed what a sissypants jons thin long hands clenched as he shot me a look and left the door shut softly behind him and i turned to trent ready to blast him i wasnt about to air ceris dirty laundry where it might get into the tabloids but now i could really say what i thought i cant believe you knocked ceri up god trent you are unbelievable i said gesturing she is just starting to rebuild herself she doesnt need this emotional crap trent glanced at quen the security officer had taken a widefooted stance before the closed door his arms loose at his sides and his face lacking emotion seeing his nonchalance trent stepped back onto the stage and began sifting through the charms none of this is your business morgan it became my business when you romanced information from my friend knocked her up then asked me to do something youre afraid to i said taking offense at his cavalier attitude trent bent over the metallic ley line charms as he watched me through the mirror and what have i asked you to do he said his voice rising and falling like a gust of rain my blood pressure spiked and i stepped forward halting when quen cleared his throat you are despicable i said you know the chances that id go into the everafter to help ceri are a hundred times better than me going to help you id hate you for that if nothing else how cowardly is that manipulating someone into doing something youre afraid to do yourself a stinking coward not willing to help your kin except for when youre safe and secure in your little underground labs youre a mouse burger trent straightened surprised mouse burger mouse burger i stated again arms crossed and hip cocked a weenie little man with the courage of a mouse a faint smile quirked the corner of his lips that sounds funny coming from a woman who dated a rat he wasnt a rat when we dated i shot back face flaming trents attention went to his image in the mirror and he pulled the pin on the ley line charm to invoke it a shimmer flared through his aura making it visible for an instant as the illusion took over i snorted trent now looked like he had gained twenty pounds of muscle his coat seeming to bulge with the illusion i didnt ask for your help with retrieving a sample of elven tissue he said turning sideways to see himself and frowning at the result behind me quen shifted uneasily it was a small motion but it rang through me like a gunshot the request for help could have been quen acting on his own hed done so before well quen did then i said knowing i was right when trents attention flicked to the security officer through the mirror apparently trent said dryly but i didnt grimacing he felt his face it looked like hed been pumping iron bulgy and ugly i dont need your help i will go into the everafter myself and retrieve the sample ceris child will be healthy i couldnt stop my laugh at the mental image of trent standing in the everafter and the man reddened relaxing i slumped into one of the cushy chairs by the wine and cheese and sat with my feet spread wide i can see why you came to me i said to quen you think you can handle the everafter this was directed at trent you wouldnt last a minute not a freaking minute i eyed the cheese i hadnt eaten anything since this morning and my mouth started to water at the sharp scent the wind might muss up your hair i said lightly quen stepped from the door so youll go in his stead reaching for a cracker i hesitated until trent grimaced but he hadnt said i couldnt have it so i snapped the cracker in two and ate half no looking like a steroid poster boy trent frowned at quen morgan doesnt need to be involved in this his gaze went to me rachel leave as if i ever do anything he tells me to do trents fingers sifted through a display of amulets choosing one that added eight inches to his height the fake bulk thinned a little but not much i could feel the tension rise as i stayed where i was quen would have to work to get me out of here and i knew hed rather wait until i was ready lowlife romeo i said taking another cracker and adding a piece of cheese slime of the earth i knew you were a murderer but knocking up ceri and abandoning her thats pathetic trent even for you at that trent turned i did nothing of the kind he said his voice rising she is getting the finest care her child will have every opportunity i smiled it wasnt often i could get him to lose his professional edge and act his age he wasnt much older than me but he got precious little chance to enjoy his wealthy youth ill bet i said egging him on who are you trying to be here i asked gesturing to the charms frankensteins monster his neck went red and trent took off the height and weight charms youre embarrassing yourself not me he said once again his usual size and shape i offered to move her into my compound i offered to put her anywhere she liked from the alps to zimbabwe she chose to stay with mr bairn and whereas i might object bairn i gasped jerking upright my fake indolence vanishing you mean keasley i stared into trents mocking green eyes leon bairn but hes dead trent was positively smug showing me his back he rifled through a rack of earth charms and watched his hair shift color and whereas i might otherwise object bairn did the investigation on your parents deaths i interrupted thoughts scrambling and my dads bairn is supposed to be dead why is he across the road pretending to be a kind old man named keasley and how did trent know who he was his hair now an authoritative gray trent frowned and whereas i might otherwise object he tried again quen assures me that between bairn and two pixies two i blurted jih took a husband damn it rachel will you shut up my attention fixed on him and i hesitated trents face was longer kind of creepy he had the bulkingup charm on again but with the extra height the roundness had been lost i blinked at him then closed my mouth trent was giving me information that didnt happen very often maybe i should shut up i forced myself to recline in the chair pantomiming zipping my mouth shut but my foot was jiggling trent watched it for a moment then turned to the mirror quen assures me that ceridwen is as safe in that nasty little hole of a house as she would be with me shes agreed to receive medical attention at my expense and if shes lacking anything its because she has stubbornly refused to accept it the last was said rather dryly and i couldnt help my rueful smile as trent studied his reflection clearly not pleased with what he saw i understood completely though mild mannered most times when ceri set her mind to something she was quietly adamant then aggressively so if she didnt get her way she had been born into royalty and i had a feeling that apart from having to be submissive to al when she was his familiar she had pretty much ruled the rest of his household until her mind had broken and she lost the will to do anything at all trent was watching me when i met his gaze clearly bewildered at my fond smile shrugging i ate another cracker what are her chances for a healthy baby i asked wondering how guilty i was going to have to feel about my refusal to go into the everafter a silverhaired trent went back to the ley line charms he was silent and i imagined he was weighing his words carefully if she had a child with someone from her own period chances would be good that her child would be healthy with a minimal amount of genetic intervention he finally said choosing another ley line charm he invoked it a shimmer cascaded over him and his height grew by almost three inches tossing the invocation pin aside he kept the charm his fingers among the shards of metal he almost whispered having a child with someone of our generation the chances of a healthy child are only marginally better than anyone elses without intervention though some of the repairs my father and i have managed are hooked into mitochondrial dna and therefore passed from mother to child most arent and we are limited by the health of the egg and sperm at the time of conception ceris reproductive capabilities are excellent his eyes met mine every drop of emotion gone its those of us who are left that are failing her i wouldnt look away though guilt smacked me a good one trents father had kept me alive by modifying my mitochondria even if i conceived a child with a man who carried rosewood syndrome our child would survive free of the genetic aberration that had been killing thousands of witches in infancy for millennia my attention rose from the halfeaten cracker in my hands it seemed unfair that elven efforts could save a witch but not the elves themselves trent smiled knowingly and i dropped my gaze he had to guess where my thoughts were and it made me uncomfortable that we were starting to understand what drove each of us even if we didnt agree on each others methods life had been easier when i had been able to pretend i couldnt see shades of gray who are you trying to be i said suddenly trying to change the subject and gesturing at the amulets so he knew what i was talking about quen shifted into a more comfortable position and trent sighed going from successful business executive to embarrassed young man in an instant rynn cormel he said hesitantly its awful i said and trent nodded as he looked at his reflection yes it is i think i should try for someone else something lessominous he started taking off charms and gathering myself i lurched out of the chair and brushed my sweater free of crackers leaving my shoulder bag on the table i headed to the open closets here i said giving him an oversize black suit coat thats too big he said but he took it the only charm he still had was the earth charm that turned his hair gray and the silver gave him a more distinguished look its supposed to be big just put it on i griped watching as he shuffled out of his linen coat and handed it to me a puff of scent rose as i took it and i breathed deeply sort of a mix of mint and cinnamonwith a little bit of crushed leaves and oh was that a hint of leather from the stables damn he smelled good trying not to be obvious about my sniffing i draped it over one of the amulet racks and turned to find trent wearing the coat the sleeves covered his hands but for his fingertips it was clearly too long the starkness of the black fabric looked bad with his complexion but when i was done with him it would be perfect trent moved to take it off and i waved for him to wait try this i said handing him a ley line charm to add about six inches of height he could make up the rest with his shoes and it wouldnt cost him beaucoup bucks the usual rate was a thousand dollars an inch but here it was probably more he put the charm on but i didnt wait to see the result already back among the amulets and the more familiar earth charms longer longer i muttered dont they have these in any order ah here it is pleased i turned almost smacking into him trent backed up and i extended the charm this will add a few inches to your hair hold on i shuffled through the clutter found a finger stick pricked my finger and while trent watched invoked the amulet with three drops of my blood now try it i said trent took it his silverenhanced hair growing the instant his fingers encircled the redwood disk unlike ley magic charms earth magic needed to be touching the skin not just within a persons aura okayyou dont want a bulkup amulet i directed you dont need muscles you need mass i turned with the proper ley line charm try this i said and he silently took it his weight seeming to grow to match his new height i smiled as i eyed my efforts it was a delicate balancing act one id practiced with my mom for the better part of two decades before id moved out and having this much variety at my fingertips made it a real pleasure rynn cormels facial structure is kind of spare i murmured fingers dancing through the ley line charms we dont want to mess with your weighttoheight ratio so if we add a few years with an age amulet and then add a complexion charm to remove the wrinkles i quickly chose the age ley line charm then hesitated if it were me id spring for the earth magic complexion amulet rather than a ley line spell of illusion in case someone touched my face then i shrugged like anyone would be touching trents face at a party and a second ley line charm joined the pile your chin needs to be longer i murmured rifling through the labeled ley line charms get rid of the tan a wider brow thicker eyebrows shorter eyelashes and ears i hesitated my focus blurring as i brought the undead vampires face to mind his ears dont have much of a lobe and are round i glanced at trent yours are kind of pointy at the top he cleared his throat in warning here i said invoking the charms i had selected as i dropped them one by one into his hand now lets see what you look like trent slipped them into a pocket and i turned to the mirror slowly i smiled trent said nothing but quen swore softly his steps unheard on the carpet as he came forward i went to a drawer marked glasses and after shuffling around pulled out a pair of modern wirerims i gave them to trent and when he put them on quen whistled low and long morgan quen said shooting me a wary but impressed glance that is fantastic i am going to install a few more charm monitors in the hallways thank you i said modestly beaming i stood beside trent and admired my handiwork you need teeth yet i said and trent nodded slowly as if worried he might break the spell if he moved too fast are you going with caps or a charm i asked charm trent said absently turning his head to get a better glimpse of himself caps are more fun i said inordinately pleased there was an entire bin of teeth charms and i went ahead and invoked the ley line spell and dropped it into his pocket and you would know that how trent asked slyly because i have a pair i said refusing to show any pain about kisten in front of trent but i couldnt meet his eyes done i stood beside trent as he smiled at the illusion of longer teeth somewhere along the line id joined him on the stage not wanting to get down and look subservient i quieted my sudden nervousness at how close we were and neither of us was trying to kill or arrest the other huh how about that what do you think i asked since i had yet to hear trents opinion standing beside me trent who now had distinguished gray hair a thin almost hollowed face six more inches and fifty more pounds shook his head looking nothing like himself and everything like rynn cormel damn i should have gone into showbiz i look just like him he said clearly impressed almost more pleased than i wanted to be by his approval i invoked and handed him one last ley line charm trent took it and my breath caught his eyes had gone pupil black hungry vampire black a shiver rose through me holy crap i said pleased can i play dressup or what this isimpressive trent said and i got off the stage youre welcome i said dont let them overcharge you there are only thirteen charms there and only the two for your hair are earth magic and not pure illusion i glanced at the plush surroundings deciding that they wouldnt sell temporary ley line spells with a reduced life maybe sixteen grand for the entire outfit if they put it all in two charms you can triple that considering who youre buying them from doppelgänger charms were legal on halloween not cheap trent smiled a truly vampiric smile charismatic dangerous and ohsoseductive oh god i had to get out of there he was hitting all my buttons and i think he knew it ms morgan trent said his suit rustling as he followed me off the stage i do believe youre betraying yourself swell he totally knew it dont forget to pick up a charm to change your scent i said as i went to get my shoulder bag you wont be able to match cormels individual smell but a generic scent charm ought to fool everyone i plucked my bag up then turned taking one last look at him damn everyone except those who know his scent of course trent glanced at quen who was still staring in disbelief ill keep that in mind trent muttered i headed for the door my pace faltering when quen said rachel please reconsider my good mood crashed and i stopped two feet from the door with my head bowed quen was asking but i knew he was asking for trent i thought of ceri and the happiness a healthy child would bring her the healing that could come of it trent i cant the risk what would you risk for your child to be healthy trent interrupted and i turned around surprised at the question what would any parents do tension pulled me stiff and hearing the accusation of cowardice in his voice i hated him more than i ever had before id never thought about children much until i met kisten and then it had always been with a melancholy sadness that they wouldnt have his beautiful eyes but if i had a child and that child was suffering as i had in my past yeah id risk it all trent seemed to see it in my eyes and a hint of victory quirked his lips but then i thought of al id been his familiar once sort of and it was hell on earth that was assuming he wouldnt outright kill me i wouldnt chance it i was going to think with my head this time and not be goaded into a stupid decision by trent pushing my buttonsand i wasnt going to feel guilty about it either a shiver lifted through me and was gone lifting my chin i stared until the disgust i directed at him made his eye twitch no i said my voice shaking i wont i go in the everafter and al will pick me up three seconds after i tap a line after that im dead its that simple you can save your own damn species we dont need morgans help trent said his voice tight but i noticed hed waited until i refused before he said it ceri wasnt the only stubborn elf and i wondered if trents new desire to prove his worth came from his trying to impress her this isnt my problem i muttered hiking my shoulder bag up i have to go feeling ugly i opened the door and walked out bumping jon in his gut with my elbow when he didnt get out of my way quick enough i had never cared about trents grand plan to save the elves before but this wasnt sitting well with me i consoled myself that ceris child would survive whether they had a thousandyearold sample from her or a twothousandyearold sample from the everafter the only difference was the amount of tinkering that they would have to do to the child my mouth twisted into a grimace as i remembered my three summers spent at trents fathers makeawish camp for dying children it would be stupid to believe that all the children there were on the roster to save they were a living camouflage for the few that had the money to pay for a kalamack cure and i would give anything to have escaped the pain of making friends with children who were going to die the chatter of the people up front changed when they caught sight of me and i waved so theyd leave me alone i stormed to the door not caring if jon thought his boss had gotten the best of me i didnt stop or slow down until my feet reached the sidewalk street noise hit me and the sun slowing i remembered where i was and did an aboutface my car was the other way i didnt look up as i passed the front window hiding my eyes as i dug my phone out of my bag bothered i hit the returnlastcall number to tell marshal i had a friend emergency and id let him know if i couldnt make fountain square by three i had to talk to ceri eight i cut a sharp left into the carport taking it fast because of my lingering anger at trent habit alone kept the paint unscratched i loved my car and though i was jamming the gearshift like an indy driver i wasnt going to do anything to hurt my mobile icon of independence especially after finally getting my license back and the dent i didnt remember putting in the car repaired fortunately the church was in a quiet residential area and only the sixtyyearold oaks lining the street saw my ugly temper i hit the brakes sharply and my head swung forward and back a perverse sense of satisfaction filled me the grille was four inches from the wall perfect grabbing my bag from the backseat i got out and slammed the door it was edging two ceri was probably still asleep seeing as elves kept the same sleeping habits as pixies when they could but i had to talk to her i heard the dry clatter of pixy wings when my feet hit the walk and i swung my hair out of the way for whomever it was my money was on jenks it was his habit to stay awake with the few kids on sentry duty sleeping odd hours when everyone else was up rache jenks said in greeting his swooping dart to land on my shoulder shifting at the last moment when he saw my sour expression hovering he flew backward in front of me i hated it when he did that ivy called you huh he said his attitude one of affronted righteousness its in the eaves in the front i cant wake the damn thing up you need to use a spell or something my eyebrows rose its in the eaves whats in the eaves a gargoyle jenks said angrily and my alarm vanished a clumsyass pimplyfaced bigfooted gargoyle really i said as i stopped right there and peered up at the steeple not seeing the gargoyle how long has it been here how the hell should i know he shouted and i realized that was where his anger was coming from someone had slipped through his lines and he didnt like it jenks saw my smile and he put his hands on his hips as he hovered backward whats so funny nothing i pushed myself into motion making a left on the sidewalk to go to keasleys instead of the church jenkss wings hummed when i took the unexpected direction and he hastened to catch up well talk to him or her tonight okay i said wanting to get ivys take before we made any sweeping decisions if its young its probably just looking for somewhere to hang they dont hang they lurk he muttered wings clattering aggressively somethings wrong with it or it would be with its kin they dont move rachel unless they did something really bad maybe hes a rebel like you jenks i said and the pixy made a tiny huffing sound where are we going he asked shortly as he turned to look at the church behind us immediately my bad mood returned to talk to ceri i ran into trent trying on costumes what does that have to do with ceri jenks interrupted as protective of the small but selfassured woman as i was toes edging the drop off of the curb i pulled myself to a stop so i could watch his expression he got her pregnant pregnant the shrill shout was punctuated by a flash of dust i could see even in the strong afternoon light it gets better i said stepping into the empty street and heading for the tired sixtyplusyearold house ceri and keasley shared he wants me to go into the everafter to get a sample so their child will be born without any effects of the curse tried to guilt me into it and it almost worked pregnant jenks repeated his angular face showing his shock i gotta smell her the scraping of my boots on the pavement faltered you can smell it when someones pregnant i said somewhat appalled jenks shrugged sometimes i dont know about elves he darted to the sidewalk then back to me can you walk a little faster id like to get there before the sun sets and that thing in the eaves wakes up my gaze went three houses down to find keasley outside enjoying the fall weather raking leaves great hed seen me tear into here like a bunny on fire jenks i said suddenly im going to do the talking not you yeah yeah yeah he said and i fixed my gaze on him with a threatening sharpness i mean it ceri might not have told him yet the hum of his wings dropped in pitch though he didnt lose a millimeter of height okay he said hesitantly my boots hit the sidewalk and the dappled pattern of sun that made it through the colored leaves still clinging to the dark branches keasley is leon bairn i thought as i looked him over leon was the only other person besides me to quit the is and survive though hed apparently had to fake his death to do it i was guessing that trent knew it because he had helped he would have been about fifteen then but just coming into his parents legacy and eager to show his stuff i glanced at jenks remembering how mad the pixy had been when i hid from him that trent was an elf if keasley was leon then he was a runner and jenks wouldnt violate that trust for anything jenks can you keep a secret i said slowing when keasley saw us and stopped his work to lean on his rake the old man suffered from arthritis so badly that he seldom had the stamina for yard work despite the pain charms ceri made for him maybe the pixy said knowing his own limits i gave him a sharp look and he grimaced yeah ill keep your lameass secret what is it trent wears a manbra a smile quirked my lips before i grew serious keasley is leon bairn holy crap jenks said a burst of light glowing against the bottom of the leaves i take the afternoon off and you find out ceris pregnant and sharing a roof with a dead legend i grinned at him trent was chatty today no fairyass kidding his wings went silver in thought so why did trent tell you i shrugged running my finger against the thumpbump of the chainlink fence surrounding keasleys yard as i walked i dont know to prove he knew something i didnt did jih tell you that shes shacked up with a pixy buck what his wings stopped and my palm darted out with a flash of adrenaline but he caught himself before he could drop into my palm jenks hovered his face a mask of parental horror trent he squeaked trent told you and when i nodded he turned his gaze to the front gardens of the house just starting to show the grace of a pixy presence even in the fall sweet mother of tink he said i have to talk to my daughter without waiting for my reply he darted away only to jerk to an abrupt halt at the fence slipping several inches in height he yanked a pixysize red bandanna from a pocket and tied it about his ankle it was a pixys version of a white flag a promise of good intention and no poaching hed never worn it before when visiting his daughter and the acknowledgment of her new husband had to be bittersweet his wings a dismal blue he zipped over the house to the backyard where jih had been concentrating her efforts on building a garden smiling faintly i raised a hand to keasleys hail opened the gate and entered the yard hi keasley i called looking him over with a new interest born of knowing his history the old black man stood in the middle of his yard his cheap sneakers almost hidden by leaves his jeans were faded by work not distressing stones in the wash and his redandblack plaid shirt looked a size too big probably gotten at discount somewhere his wrinkles gave his face texture that made his expressions easy to read the tinge of yellow in his brown eyes had me worried but he was healthy apart from old age and arthritis i could tell that hed once been tall now though i could look him eye to eye age was beating hard upon his body but it had yet to touch his mind he was the neighborhood wise old man and the only one who could give me advice without triggering my resentment but it was his hands that i liked the most you could see how he had lived his entire life in them dark spare knobby with stiffness but not afraid of work able to stir spells stitch vampire bites and hold pixy children he had done all three in my sight and i trusted him even if he was pretending to be something he wasnt didnt we all good afternoon rachel he called his sharp gaze coming back from the roofline and jenkss disappearing trail of pixy dust you look like a piece of autumn in that sweater i glanced down at the blackandred pattern never having thought about it before thanks you look good out here raking your knees doing okay the old man patted the worn spots squinting in the sun theyve been better but theyve been a lot worse too ceris been in the kitchen a lot lately trying things out i slowed my feet still on the cracked walk to the front porch grass had encroached upon it until it was only eight inches wide i suppose i said softly chasing bad guys all your life can really damage a person if they arent careful he didnt move going still as he stared at me i uh talked to someone today i said wanting to hear it from him he said who he rasped and my face lost its expression he was frightened terrified almost trent i said pulse quickening as i came forward trent kalamack he acted like hes known for a long time my shoulders tensed and the dog barking nearby made me nervous exhaling long and slow keasley replaced his fear with a relief so deep i could just about feel it he has he said a shaky hand going over his tight graying curls i have to sit down he turned to his house it needed new shingles and paint in the worst way do you want to sit for a moment i thought about ceri then marshal then there was the gargoyle jenks was going on about too sure keasley made his slow way to the sagging porch steps propping the rake against the rail before easing himself down in stages with a heavy sigh a basket of cherry tomatoes decorated the railing to be given out for trickortreat and two pumpkins waited to be carved i gingerly sat beside him my knees even with my chest are you okay i asked hesitantly when he didnt say anything he looked at me askance you know how to get an old mans heart going rachel do ivy and jenks know jenks i said guilt pinching my brow and he raised a hand to tell me it was all right i trust he will keep his mouth shut he said trent gave me the means to stage my death actually all he gave me was the dnadoctored tissue to smear over my front porch but he knew gave him tissue theres a nice thought then you really are my words cut off when his twisted hand landed warningly on my knee in the street five sparrows fought over a moth they had found and i listened to them squabble hearing in his silence his request that i not even say it its been over a decade i finally protested his eyes tracked the birds as one gained the moth and the rest chased the bird across the street it doesnt matter he said like a murder charge the file stays open i followed his gaze to the church ivy and i shared thats why you moved in across from the church isnt it i asked remembering the day keasley had saved my life by removing a delayed combustion charm someone had slipped me on the bus you figured if i could survive the iss death contract you might find a way too he smiled to show his yellowing teeth and he pulled his hand from my knee yes maam i did but after seeing how you did it keasley shook his head im too old to fight dragons ill stay keasley if you dont mind i thought about that cold despite the sun on us becoming anonymous was just something i couldnt do you moved in the same day i did didnt you you really dont know when ivy rented the church no his eyes were on the steeple the top hidden behind the trees but i watched her patterns close that first week and im guessing shed been there for at least three months my head was going up and down i was learning a lot today none of it comfortable youre a good liar i said and keasley laughed used to be liar i thought and then my mind drifted to trent uh is ceri up i have to talk to her keasley shifted to look at me in his tired eyes was a deep relief i had learned his secret and freed him of the necessity to lie to me but what i think he was the most grateful for was that i didnt think any less of him for it i think shes asleep he said smiling to tell me he was glad i was still his friend shes been tired lately ill bet giving him a smile i stood and tugged my jeans straight id long assumed that ivy had moved in before me having only pretended to move in the same day to ease my suspicions now that i knew the truth i might confront ivy about it maybe it didnt necessarily matteri understood her reasons and that was enough sometimes just let sleeping vamps lie i extended a hand to help keasley rise will you tell ceri i came over i asked as i held his arm until i knew he had his balance the porch creaked behind us and i whipped my head around ceri was standing behind the closed screen door in a sweaterdress that made her look like a young wife from the sixties a jumble of emotions hit me as i took in her somber guilty stance she didnt look pregnant she looked worried did jenks wake you i said in greeting not knowing what else to say she shook her head no with her arms crossed over her middle her long translucent hair was done up in a complex braid that needed at least two pixies to manage it even through the screen i could see her cheeks were pale her green eyes wide and her narrow chin raised defiantly though delicate and petite her mind was resilient and strong tempered by a thousand years of serving as a demons familiar elves didnt live any longer than witches but her life had paused the moment al took her my guess was shed been in her midthirties she was barefoot as usual and her purple dress had black and gold accents they were the colors that al made her wear though admittedly this wasnt a ball gown come in she said softly vanishing into the dark house i glanced at keasley he had a wary sharpness to him having read my tension and the shame she was hiding under her defiance or maybe it was guilt go on he said as if wanting us to get this over with so hed know what was the matter leaving him i went up the stairs my tension easing as the shelter of the house accepted me i didnt think shed told him yetwhich meant id been seeing guilt the screen door squeaked and now knowing keasleys past i was sure the lack of oil was intentional the scent of redwood struck me as i followed the sound of her fading steps down the lowceilinged hall past the front room the kitchen and all the way to the back of the house and the sunken living room added on at some point the older house muffled outside sounds and i stood in the middle of the back living room i was sure this was where she had gone my gaze traveled over the changes shed made since moving in asters arranged in masonjar vases live plants bought off the sale rack and nurtured back to health clustered at the lacecurtained windows bits of ribbon draped over mirrors to remind wandering spirits not to cross into them yellowed doilies bought at yard sales decorating the padded arms of the couch and faded pillows and swaths of fabric disguising the old furniture the combined effect was clean comfortable and soothing ceri i finally called not having the slightest idea where she was out here she said her voice coming from beyond the door which was propped open with a potted fig tree i winced she wanted to talk in the gardenher stronghold great gathering myself i headed out to find her seated at a wicker table in the garden jih hadnt been tending it very long but between the enthusiastic pixy and ceri the tiny space had gone from a scuffedup scrap of dirt to a bit of paradise in less than a year an old oak tree thicker than i could get my arms around dominated the backyard multiple swaths of fabric draped over the lower branches to make a fluttering shelter of sorts the ground under it was bare dirt but it was as smooth and flat as linoleum vines grew above the fence to block the neighbors view and the grass had been allowed to grow long past the shade of the tree i could hear water somewhere and a wren singing as if it were spring not fall and crickets this is nice i said in understatement as i joined her there was a teapot and two tiny cups on the table as if she had been expecting me i would have said trent had warned her but keasley didnt have a phone thank you she said modestly jih has taken a husband and he works very hard to impress her i brought my attention back from the garden to focus on ceri and her anxiety is that where jenks is i asked wanting to meet the newest member of the family myself a smile eased her tight features yes can you hear them i shook my head and settled myself in the bumpy wicker chair now what would be a good segue so i hear jih isnt the only one whos been knocked up ceri reached for the teapot her motions wary i imagine this isnt a social call but would you like some tea no thanks i said then felt a tug on my awareness as ceri murmured a word of latin and the pot began to steam the amber brew tinkled into her tiny cup the click of the porcelain sounding loud among the crickets ceri i said softly why didnt you tell me her vivid green eyes met mine i thought youd be angry she said with desperate worry rachel its the only way i can get rid of it my lips parted you dont want it ceris expression blanked she stared wonderingly at me for a moment what are we talking about she asked cautiously your baby her mouth dropped open and she flushed scarlet how did you find out my pulse had quickened and i felt unreal i talked to trent this afternoon i said and when she just sat there staring at me with her pale fingers encircling her teacup i added quen asked me to go into the everafter for a sample of elven dna that predates the curse and i wanted to know what the rush was he kind of blurted it out panic filled her showing as her hand flashed to set her cup down and grip my wrist shocking me no she exclaimed softly eyes wide and breath fast rachel you cant you cant go into the everafter promise me right now that you wont ever her fingers were hurting me and i tried to pull away im not stupid ceri promise me she said loudly right now you will not go into the everafter not for me not for trent not for my child never i wrenched my wrist away from her taken aback at her extreme reaction i had been in the everafter before and i wasnt about to go back i told him no ceri i cant someone is summoning al out of confinement and i cant risk being off hallowed ground after sunset much less go to the everafter the pale woman caught her emotions clearly embarrassed her eyes flicked to my reddened wrist and i hid it under the table i felt guilty about the stand i was taking to stay out of the everafter even if it was a smart decision i wanted to help ceri and i felt like a coward im sorry i said then reached for the teapot wanting a cup of something to hide behind i feel like a pile of chicken crap dont ceri said shortly and my eyes met hers this isnt your war it used to be i said my thoughts going to the widely accepted theory that the witches had abandoned the everafter to the demons three thousand years before the elves gave up before that there was no witch history except what the elves remembered for us and very little elf history either ceri intercepted my reach for the teapot pouring it out for me and carefully handing me the cup and saucer with the grace of a millennium of practice i accepted it and took a sip it wasnt coffee but i could still feel the caffeine rush and i eased into the wicker and crossed my legs i had time and ceri nervous and flustered clearly was in no state for me to leave yet ceri i said putting a tone of pride in my voice youre something else if i found out that i was pregnant unexpectedly id be falling apart i cant believe trent did this to you ceri hesitated over her cup then took a delicate sip he didnt i shook my head you cant take the blame for this i know youre a grown woman and you make your own decisions but trent is devious and manipulative he could charm a troll out of her bridge if he tried a faint rose color tinged her cheeks i mean its not trentons child i stared at her if it isnt trents its quens she said her eyes on the swaths of fabric fluttering overhead bbut i stammered oh my god quen suddenly his awkward silences and stiff looks meant something completely different trent never said anything neither did quen they just stood there and let me believe its not their place to say anything ceri said primly then set her teacup down with a sharp clink the breeze shifted the wispy strands of her hair that had slipped her braid as i realigned my thinking thats why quen had gone behind trents back to ask for my help thats why hed seemed guilty but i thought you liked trent i finally managed ceri made a face on me it would have looked ugly on her it looked comely i do she said sourly he is kind with me and gentle he is clever with words and quick to follow my thoughts and we enjoy each others company his bloodline is impeccable she hesitated her eyes going to her fingers now sitting still in her lap a deep breath lifted through her and was gone and he wont touch me without fear my brow furrowed in anger its the demon smut she said distantly shame in her gaze darting about he thinks its the bloody kiss of death that im filthy and foul and that its catching i could not believe this trent was a murdering drug lord and he thought ceri was dirty well she said sourly as if shed heard my thoughts technically hes right i could slough it off on him but i wouldnt her eyes came up to find mine dark with unshed misery you believe me dont you i thought back to trents reaction to black magic and my jaw clenched yeah yes i amended he wont touch you huh ceris expression went pleading dont be angry with him bartholomews balls rachel she cajoled the man has a right to be scared im mean im nasty overbearing temper driven and im covered in demon smut the first time we met i knocked quen out with a black charm and then i threatened him the man was trying to drug me with an illegal charm i said what were you supposed to do ask him to play nice quen understands she said her eyes watching her still fingers i dont have to explain myself or my past to him her head came up i dont even know how it happened uh i murmured sensing a story coming that i really didnt want to hear i agreed to meet with trent i wanted to apologize for threatening him she said i wanted to hear how his genetic treatments are keeping our species alive when magic could not the afternoon went surprisingly well and his gardens are so lovelysilent but lovelyso we had tea the following week and i told him of my life with al a tear spilled over and ran a quick path to her jawline i wanted him to know so hed understand that the demon smut wasnt a sign of ones morals but simply a mark of imbalance upon ones soul i thought he was beginning to understand she said softly we even laughed at a shared jest but when i touched him he jerked back and though he apologized and turned red i saw the entire afternoon was a sham he was entertaining me because he felt he needed to not because he wanted to i could see it clearly in my mind trent was slime so i finished our tea playing the part of a courtesan entertaining the son of a potential ally she said and i felt her hurt pride and the shame her words couldnt hide i thank god that i saw his true feelings beforemy heart softened to him ceri sniffed and i handed her one of the cotton napkins she had arranged about the teapot though she said she didnt care for him i saw that it had wounded her deeply probably too far for trent to ever make amends to the selfadmittedly overly prideful woman thank you she said dabbing at her eyes quen drove me home that afternoon as usual he had witnessed the entire miserable affair and when i fled his car to find solace in my garden he followed me taking me into his arms and telling me i was beautiful and pure everything i wanted to be everything i know im not i wanted her to stop but she had to tell someone and i knew how she felt wanting to be loved acceptedonly to be reviled for things she couldnt control a hot tear spilled over and ran a quick path to my chin when ceris eyes rose to mine red and swimming i spend time with trent now simply so that quen may escort me there and back she said softly i think trent knows it but i dont care quen is confident and secure in his mind when im with him i feel beautiful and unsullied i didnt have the ability to say yes or no to a mans attentions for a thousand years she said her voice gaining in strength i was a thing to al something to teach to showcase his talents and when quen stirred my passions after a particularly trying engagement with trent i realized i wanted more than his gentle words my throat was tight when her gaze found mine kisten i knew what she meant and he was gone utterly gone i wanted to give myself to a man who would give himself in return she said pleading for understanding when i had already given it not just sharing the ecstasy our bodies could bring each other but sharing our thoughts as well quen is a good man she said as if i would deny it he will instill my child with a proper frame of beliefs id rather have as my husband a man of mixed birth who accepts me than a pureblood who deep in his soul thinks im tainted my hand went out finding hers ceri she pulled away apparently thinking i was going to argue with her nothing could be further from the truth quen is as noble as any man in my fathers court she said hotly and more honorable than trent i said cutting her argument short its a good decision relief cascaded over her melting the tension and widening her eyes she went to say something then stopped steadying herself she tried again managing a high squeaky would you like some more tea my cup was full and i smiled back yes thank you she topped it off and i took a sip hearing a new understanding in the cricketfilled silence between us i knew what it was like to seek that feeling of being wantedthough i was going to play it smart with marshal i was the last person to say she should have been stronger stronger for what what was she saving herself for and i knew quen would be honest with her he probably needed an understanding soul as much as she did i saw quen today i said and her expression grew eager telling me she loved him he looks good worried about you i think god i felt like i was in high school but who else did ceri have to bubble and overflow with the woman was in love and couldnt tell anyone im fine she said flustered smiling at seeing her in such a state i settled back with my tea i had some time yet before i had to go marshal could wait have you given any thought to moving closer to him i said trent offered to put you up in hiscompound im safe here she said softly eyes lowered telling me she had considered it i wasnt thinking about safer i said laughing i just dont want quen coming over here all the time parking his bigass limo at the curb driving in and out at all hours waking me up at sunrise when he beeps his horn for you to come out she blushed delicately im going to stay with keasley my smile faded and though i didnt want her to leave i said you could both go jih and her new husband she protested but i could see her desire to be closer to quen i bet trent would let pixies in his garden if you asked i said with a smirk imagining the man covered in them quen is trying to convince trent how good pixies are at detecting intruders brandnew gargoyle in our eaves aside and trent is trying to impress you even if hes as ignorant as a duck her eyebrows were high in speculation and i added he insists hes going into the everafter to get that tissue sample he can do more good in his lab she said caustically thats where he belongs i agreed taking a sip of tea little mouse burger ceris eyebrows went up and she lost her stiff formal stance im safe here she reaffirmed nothing will harm me or keasley i have defenses that i can raise in an instant i didnt doubt it but demons were able to pop in anywhere but holy ground theres al to think about i added hes gone rogue ivy told you yes she nodded eyes on the distant vines and i felt a frown come over me someone has summoned him out of confinement and let him go three nights in a row i said sourly david is checking the incoming claims to see if its someone local out to get me or if its just al giving some nameless idiot a wish per night to let him go my lips pressed together and i thought of nick my gut said no and i was going to believe that he tried to kill me last night i said while i was shopping with my mom kkill you my attention swung back at her faint stutter he says hes got nothing to lose so hes not going to hold to his agreement to leave me or my kin alone i hesitated does that mean i can teach anyone how to spindle line energy demon immunity for keeping our mouths shut had been the deal he said he wasnt going to hurt you she said looking rightly frightened i mean they arent going to let him get away with breaking his word are they did you call minias i let out a puff of air not eager for the bill from the charm shop to hit my desk i didnt have to he showed up and chased him off i said wondering whether if i asked if she would come over and sleep in the sanctuary until they found a way to contain al minias doesnt even care that als breaking his word hes only upset that hes slipping their cell they pulled minias off babysitting newt and put him on demoncatching detail i looked up seeing an almost panicked look on her face its not that als breaking his word thats got them in a tizzy i said its that hes escaping minias expects me to exchange names with al so he cant be summoned out of confinement rachel no she cried shocking me as she reached across the table you cant i blinked surprised i wasnt planning on it but if i cant find out who is summoning al and letting him go it might be the only way to get my nightlife back ceri drew away her hands clasped in her lap sitting very straight why in the turns sake would i take als name when all i have to do is kick some demonsummoners ass i muttered and her narrow shoulders relaxed good she said seemingly embarrassed at her strong outburst you dont need to deal with them ill help you if you need it dont go to the demons even if you need to exchange names with al ill find the curse for you curse yeah it would be a curse i needed to save my neck again i was really going to have to put some effort into getting als getoutofjailfree card away from him i cant believe they put him in jail just for letting you live knowing how to spindle line energy i mused taking a sip of tea and startling myself when it wasnt coffee stripped him of his accumulated potions everything no wonder he wants me dead if it got out it would limit their pool of familiars she mumbled obviously wanting to drop the subject yeah well hes got someone cooking spells for him he was his usual crushedgreenvelvet self i swear if its nick im going to kick his butt back off the mackinac bridge that is if al hasnt chewed it off him by then that demon is going to kill me if im not careful no ceri rushed al wouldnt its got to be a bluff he said her words cut off and my focus sharpened on her suddenly distressed almost panicked features my runner training kicked in and my heart pounded he said ceri had talked to him to al you i stammered scrambling to my feet youre summoning him no she protested her face going whiter rachel no im only making appearance charms for him please dont be angry aghast i tried to find words hes been loose every night for three days and you never told me he said he wouldnt attack you she said standing i thought you were safe he cant attack you he promised he did attack me i shouted not caring if the neighbors heard me hes going to freaking kill me because hes got nothing to lose and youre making him curses its a good deal she shot back for every thirteen he takes a days worth of smut off of me ive already lightened my soul by a year i stared at her she was voluntarily making al curses well merry freaking good for you i snapped her face flashed red in anger its the only moral way i can get rid of the smut she said the loose strands of her hair starting to float he promised me he wouldnt go after you her eyes widened and she put a hand to her upper chest her mood shifting like a kite they want you to help capture him rachel dont say yes no matter what they offer if al has gone rogue he will be as slippery and devious as a stingray you cant trust him now like i ever have i cant trust him now i exclaimed what kind of game is this when the rules keep changing ceri appeared affronted as she looked me up and down well did he actually hurt you he picked me up by the neck and shook me i shouted she was defending him she was defending al if that was all he did then whether he broke his word might be open to interpretation she said sharply he is bluffing i do not believe this i freaking do not believe this youre siding with him i am not she exclaimed red spots showing on her cheeks im telling you how their law system works if there is a loophole theyll allow him to use it and i only made him disguise charms i would never do anything that might hurt you youre working for al and you didnt tell me i didnt tell you because i knew youd get angry well you were right i yelled heart pounding i got you free of him and now youre right back at it again just another potential familiar who thinks theyre smarter than a demon ceris red face went ashen get out with pleasure i dont even remember walking through the house i do remember storming down to the walk because i jumped when the screen door slammed behind me keasley was sitting on the steps three pixies on his hand they flew up when the door banged and he turned to look at me all set between you twoladies he said his eyes widening when i stomped past him and a frustrated scream from the backyard echoed over the neighborhood there was a booming noise and the pixies yelped at the sudden pressure shift ceri was throwing a tantrum congratulations jih i said as i jerked to a halt at the bottom of the steps id like to meet your new husband properly but i dont think im welcome here anymore i turned to keasley if you need me you know where i am saying nothing more i left my pulse was fast and my breath was short i felt my expression turn ugly when jenks joined me flying at eye height uh rache whats up is ceri okay ceri is juuuust fine i muttered slamming the latch to the chainlink fence down and chipping a nail shes always fine shes working for al shes summoning him out of confinement jenks squeaked no shes making appearance curses for him to get the smut off her soul i paced across the street and at his continued silence i looked up his tiny face was pinched and he seemed torn you dont see a problem in that i said in disbelief well he hedged i did not believe this thats how it starts jenks i said recalling my days as an is runner bringing in witches who had gone wrong then its one black curse that he promises to use for a good reason and he offers so much in return that you cant resist then another then another and then youre his familiar for real well if she wants to throw her life away again thats not my problem jenks flew beside me silently then spoke ceri knows what shes doing my feet found the wide worn steps of the church and i stopped storming in like this with me out of control was asking for trouble ivys blood lust was triggered by high emotions and i knew better turning i looked across the street at keasleys house a red film enveloped the oak tree making it look like it was on fire people were coming out of their houses to gape at the phantom flames as ceri raged but i knew she wouldnt hurt the tree i hope so jenks i really hope so nine hush quiet one of jenkss kids said in a loud whisper youre scaring her a chorus of denials rose and i smiled at the eager little pixy girl standing on my knee her wings blurring for balance and her pale green silk dress drifting about her ankles i was sitting crosslegged on the floor beside the couch in the sanctuary covered in pixy kids colorful fabric billowed in the breeze kicked up by their dragonflylike wings and their dust was making me glow in the latehour dusk rex was under ivys piano and she didnt look scared she looked predatory the small orange cat was crouched by a polished leg her tail twitching her ears pricked and her eyes black in a classic prestalking posture matalina had relented in her stand having admitted herself that even their smallest child could outfly a cats pounce and after jenks pointed out that rex wintering indoors wouldnt allow them to become lazy sentries the cats place inside was assured the theory now was that if the pixy kids whom rex loved could get her to come to them while they were with me rex might start to like me too nice thought but it wasnt working rex hadnt liked me since i used a demon curse to go wolf i had returned back to myself with pristine skin and no fillings but id rather have freckles than the demon smut that had come along with the unexpected makeover not to mention rex might willingly let me touch her i think she was waiting for me to change into a wolf again this isnt working i said turning to jenks and matalina who had perched on my desk in the heat of the lamp to watch the drama unfold the sun had set and i was surprised jenks hadnt moved everyone out to the stump but maybe it was too cold tonight it was either that or he didnt want his kids outside when that gargoyle was lurking about i didnt know why jenks was so upset the thing was only a foot tall i thought he looked kind of cute on the edge of the roof and if i could go outside id try to coax him downnow that he was probably awake i told you that wouldnt work jenks said snarkily youd better utilize your time coming up to the belfry and talking to that hunk of rock better utilize my time it was the gargoyle im not going to lean out the belfry window and shout at him i muttered when the pixies squealed ill talk to him when he comes down youre just mad that you cant make him leave shes coming rex is coming one shrilled loudly enough to make me wince but the cat was only stretching settling in for a good long stare session thats all she didstare at me here kitty kitty stupid kitty i coaxed hows my little chickenass feline today i crooned holding out a hand as i sat on the floor one of jenkss daughters walked down the plane of my arm her own hand outstretched im not going to hurt you you sweet little bundle of asinine orangefurred weretoy of a cat okay maybe that was harsh but she couldnt understand me and i was tired of trying to get her to like me jenks laughed i would have been embarrassed by my word choices but his kids had heard worse from their dad and in fact the pixies ranging about me had taken up my crooning singing insults heavy on the earthy vulgarity disheartened i let my arm fall and sent my eyes past the hanging paper bats to the stainedglass windows the colors muted from the late hour marshal had called to tell me that he was still stuck in interview hell and wouldnt be able to have coffee that had been hours ago the sun was down now and i couldnt safely leave the church lest i become demon bait my jaw tightened maybe someone was trying to tell me it was too soon im sorry kisten i wish you were here but youre not the buzzing of my vibrating phone cut through the pixy chatter and they all flew up and away when i stretched to reach my bag on the nearby couch as i lay almost flat my fingers brushed my bag and i yanked it down i sat up with an exhalation flipping my hair back and digging out my phone the number was unfamiliar marshals landline maybe hi i said casually seeing as it was my cell and not the business phone realizing i was covered in pixy dust i slapped at my jeans to get it off rachel came marshals apologetic voice and the pixies clustered by the desk hushed themselves so they could hear rex stretched and padded over to them now that they werent sitting on me and i frowned at her stupid cat hey im sorry marshal continued to fill the silence i dont know why theyre taking so long but it looks like im not going to get out of here for a few hours more youre still there i asked glancing at the dark stainedglass windows and thinking that what time his interviews ended didnt matter anymore its down to me and one other guy marshal rushed to say they want to make a decision today so im stuck trying to impress the hell out of these people over pasta and sparkling water resigned to another evening alone with the pixies i picked at the edge of my chipped nail and wondered if i had a file in my bag rex was on her back the pixies hovering just out of her playful lethal reach no problem well do it some other day i said as i rummaged for the file disappointed even as i was sort of relieved i must have met with six people already he complained honest they told me it was going to be a twohour interview when i came down here my fingertips brushed the rough surface of a file and i tugged it out three quick swipes and the damage was smoothed out if only it were that easy for everything else ive got to be done by midnight he continued at my silence you want to go out to the warehouse for a beer the guy im interviewing against says they let you in free this week if you come in costume my gaze slid to the dark windows as i slipped the file away marshal i cant why he started then went silent oh he continued and i could hear him kicking himself i forgot um im sorry rachel dont worry about it i said feeling guilty about my relief then determined to get past it i took a slow breath steadying myself you want to come over when youre done ive got some reports to go over but we can play pool or something i hesitated then added its not the warehouse but god i felt like a coward hiding in this church yes he said his warm voice making me feel a little better yeah id like that ill bring dinner you like chinese mmmm yes i said feeling the first hints of enthusiasm no onions no onions he acknowledged and i heard someone in the background call his name with authority i hate to keep saying this but ill call you when im done marshal i said dont worry about it its not like its a date i said remembering kistens calm acceptance of my breaking our arrangements because of lastminute runs he had never gotten upset maintaining the belief that when he had to do the same id respond in kind it had worked and now i could take a lot of lastminute cancellations before i let it get to me marshal had called he couldnt make it case closed besides it wasnt like we wereanything thanks rachel he said sounding relieved youre something else i blinked fast remembering kisten saying the same thing okay um ill see you later then bye marshal i said making sure my voice didnt betray me unclenching my fingers from the top of my right arm i hit the end button and closed the phone torn between feeling good at marshals last words and depressed at the reminder of kisten knock it off rachel i thought taking a cleansing breath and tossing my hair byyyyyye marshal jenks mocked from the safety of my desk and i turnedjust in time to see matalina backhand him on the shoulder jenks i said wearily as i lurched to a stand shut up matalina rose her wings a pale pink jenks dear she said primly can i see you in the desk for a moment what he complained then yelped when she pinched his wing and jerked him through the crack of the rolltop desk the kids cheered and their eldest daughter grabbed the hand of the youngest flying the toddler away from the desk and to some pixy distraction smiling at the thought of a seasoned warrior being dragged about by his justasdeadly wife i straightened my legs which ached from being motionless so long on the hardwood floor i really needed to do some stretches to loosen up and i wondered if marshal liked to run id be willing to get him an earlyhours runners pass for the zoo just for the company no expectations no hidden agendas just someone to do something with kisten had never run with me maybe it would help if i did different thingsfor different reasons i scooped up my bag and headed to the kitchen and my reports my mood changing to one of surprising anticipation as i planned out my night marshal could tell me all about his interviews and i could tell him all about my demon death mark ought to make for interesting conversation over rice and if that didnt scare him away then he deserved everything he got going sourly introspective i slapped at the pixy dust on me again as i entered the hall the dust glowed briefly from the friction as it sifted from me to light the darker space i passed the old hisandhers bathrooms converted on ivys side to a conventional bathroom and to a bathroomlaundry room on my side our bedrooms had once been clergy offices and what was now the kitchen and living room had been added on to provide the longabsent congregation with a place to prepare and serve church suppers i leaned into my room to throw my bag onto the bed and my cell phone rang again digging it back out i sat on my bed to take my boots off and flipped the top open back already i said letting my voice hint at my anticipation maybe marshal was done sure i only had to check three days of records davids rich voice said startling me oh david i said getting one lace undone and kicking my boot off i thought you were marshal uh no he drawled the question clear in his voice phone tucked between my shoulder and my ear i swung my other foot up just some guy i met up in mackinaw i said hes moving to cincinnati and coming over for dinner so neither of us have to eat alone good its about time he said with a small laugh and when i cleared my throat in protest he continued ive been through the recent filings theres been a spate of interesting claims out at the smaller cemeteries as i worked the laces onehandedly my fingers slowed you could get just about all the parts you needed to do black magic from any charm shop but the ingredients were regulated and oftentimes people just collected their own grave robbing actually there was a rustling of papers i dont know youd have to go to the fib or the is for that but theres been a statistically large increase in the amount of damage to small cemeteries so you might want to keep a closer eye on yours only the active ones have been hit so far damage to monuments broken gates cut locks ruts in the landscape it could just be kids but someone stole the equipment to dig up the comfortably dead my guess is someone is setting themselves up for a longterm commitment either to supply black witchcraft and demon summoners on a commercial basis or just themselves you should check with your fib guy i wont hear about grave robbing unless somethings been damaged or stolen seeing as we dont insure the truly dead thanks david i said ive been talking to glenn already my gaze slid to the four reports on my dresser sandwiched between the perfume bottles ill ask him if any bodies are being moved out i appreciate you checking i hesitated kicking my second boot off you didnt get in trouble did you for working before halloween he said around a guffaw not likely i do have one thing before i let you go ive got a minordamage claim that came in from a woman just outside the hollows im not scheduled to be the field adjuster for it but if i can trade do you want to come with me and check it out an entire basement wall is bowing out from water damage it could be a typo seeing as water bows walls in not out but even so we havent gotten much rain in months i leaned across the space to my dresser and brought my fib reports over where is it there was a soft shuffling of paper ah hold on there was another moment of silence nine thirtyone palladium drive a quiver started in my belly as i snatched the reports off my dresser and the addresses leapt out at me bingo david get that claim im looking at the obituary of the guy who owned that house and get this he had a record of grave robbing while in college davids laugh was low and eager rachel my boss ought to be paying you for all the money youre saving him the damage was demon wrought probably damn this was coming together nicely i deserved a night off and if i stayed in my church id live through it please dont let this be nick okaaaaay david said his voice tight and eager promise me you wont move tonight ill see about getting the claim and well go from there you need anything ice cream popcorn i want you to stay in your church my head shook though he couldnt see it im fine let me know when youre ready to go out the sooner the better his thoughts already on other matters he growled a goodbye i wasnt much better mumbling something before i hung up and headed for the kitchen i loved kicking ass but the next best thing was making the spells that made kicking ass easier i was deep in anticipation when i found the hall my mind already going over what id want to take to confront experienced demon summoners specializing in ley line manipulation heavy magicdetection charmsmaybe a disguise amulet for that precious moment of distraction that could be the difference between falling down or staying uprighta couple of the zippy strips glenn had traded me for ketchup that kept ley line witches from tapping a line and using ley line magic i was going to have a busy night the hallway was dark and i jerked to a halt just past my door frowning ivy had put up a sign dangling by threads from the ceiling clearly jenks had assisted her god help her she had used a stencil and i snatched at the yellow poster board reading beyond this point there be demons in bright red lettering crap on toast i had forgotten about that when jenks had bought the church from piscarys estates he had insisted i pay to get it resanctified and though i had protested i eventually agreed to keep the back end of the church unsanctified as it had been originally not all of our clients were living and ivy said that interviewing the undead on the porch steps was unprofessional the result was the kitchen and back living room werent holy in the past al had always seemed to know when i stepped from secure ground and after my wrist had flamed in agony before he showed up to trash patricias charm shop i figured i knew how he did it i have to get rid of this thing i thought gently rubbing the raised scar as i hesitated in the dark weighing my risk the front doorbell rang immediately i spun on my heel i got it i shouted before jenks could leave the desk he and matalina got precious little time alone as it was they may have gone into the desk arguing but i knew they wouldnt end that way the man had fiftyfour kids rex skittered past me when i burst into the sanctuary at an easy jog the fluffytailed cat thinking i was going for her it was too soon for marshal and if it was some early trickortreaters i was going to mess with their minds i hadnt even gotten my tomatoes yet i slapped ivys sign down upon her piano for her to find then padded into the dark foyer in my stocking feet i paused to let my eyes adjust to the close darkness of the narrow room between the sanctuary and the front door one of these days i was going to invest in a drill and peephole ready to give whoever was begging early some grief i pushed the heavy wooden door open and the yellow glow of the light illuminating the sign above the door spilled in a soft scuff of dress shoes drew my attention and i crossed my arms over my middle as i saw who it was whose jag was idling at the curb well well well i drawled seeing trent in full costume its a little early for trickortreats but i might have a few pennies to give you excuse me the spellenhanced rather imposing man said his charmedbrown eyes widened and he turned to his car in a rustle of silk and linen taking off a smartlooking hat to show off his midlength black hair restyled to rynn cormels latest photo man he looked good slightly older taller and somehow more sophisticated sort of like the reverse card of himself dark where he was usually light and vice versa same build though trim and leannice i liked tall the black overcoat he had on went down to his ankles and contrasted beautifully with his new pale complexion as id known it would he had taken my advice and picked up a charm to change his scent and the delicious aroma of vampire eased over me mixing with a hint of expensive cologne he wasnt wearing the glasses but they peeked out from the top of an exterior breast pocket of his coat a gray cashmere scarf fluttered about his neck and i noticed it matched his shoes now a nice flat black instead of his usual shiny ones wow i said cocking my hip and putting my hand against the door frame to prevent him from coming in they even did the voice i didnt think they could do that how much did that set you back trent brought his attention down from the bats hanging in the sanctuary to give me a closedlipped smile from under his raised eyebrows they were thick and black very unlike his pale wisps and it made reading his emotions easier he looked highly amused as his smile widened showing a slip of long canine hed gone for the more realistic caps and i felt an unhelped pulse of adrenaline dive to my middle at the mix of vampiric threat and lure i wondered if that was why trent was standing on my doorsteptrying to get a rise out of me or maybe he was rethinking his stellar decision to go into the everafter and thought showing me his twentythousanddollar costume would impress me suddenly wishing id never helped him i blanked all the emotion from my face except for a bothered annoyance what do you want i said snidely is this about ceri you know letting me walk out of there thinking you got her pregnant was low even for you if i wasnt going to go into the everafter for you then i sure as hell wouldnt work for you now yeah i was mad at ceri but i was still her friend trents eyes fixed on me his pupils widening slightly in surprise im very glad to hear that ms morgan avoiding mr kalamack is one of the items i wanted to talk to you about i froze alarmed not only had his voice lacked its musical cadence but the accent was very new york the sound of a car door opening jerked my attention past trent to the curb the man getting out of the drivers side wasnt jonathan or quen no this guy was bigger with wide shoulders and arms as big as my legs i could tell by his grace that he was a living vampire trent didnt employ vampires unless absolutely necessary the man in black pants and a stretchy black tshirt by the car crossed his arms over his chest and fell into a parade rest that looked threatening even at forty feet away swallowing hard my gaze returned to the man on my stoop i didnt think it was trent anymore youre not trent are you i said and i flushed when he flashed me the beautiful smile rynn cormel was known for no oh god im sorry mr cormel i stammered wondering if i could make this any worse ivys number one was standing on our doorstep and id just insulted him ivys not here right now do you want to come in and wait looking utterly alive the man threw his head back and laughed long and deep i warmed damn it he was undead he couldnt come in on holy ground and asking him to wait had been stupid like he had time to wait for my roommate im sorry i blathered wanting to curl up and die youre probably really busy would you like me to tell her you called i can try to reach her cell my thoughts flashed to the vampire dating guide he had written to help increase a shadows life expectancy it was currently shoved to the back of my closet ivy had given it to me on our second night sharing the same roof so id quit pushing her vampire buttons reading it had been an education one that left me wideeyed and a little ill some of the stuff they did in the name of pleasure rex appeared at my feet pulled out from the depths of the church by the scent of vampire something she associated with ivy the stupid cat rubbed against me by mistake before going to twine about cormels feet shaken from my musings i lunged for her and when she spat at me mr cormel picked the cat up crooning to the animal as he looked at me from between her ears rynn cormel had run the world during the turn his living charisma somehow crossing the boundaries of death to give his undead existence an uncanny mimicry of life every move was a careful study of causality it was highly unusual for so young an undead vampire to be so good at mimicking having a soul i figured it was because he was a politician and had had practice way before he died actually he said its you ive come to see did i catch you at a bad time i choked on my breath and the corners of his mouth rose in amusement what did ivys master vampire want with me uh i said backing up into the black foyer he was an undead he could ask anythingand if he insisted i wouldnt be able to say no oh god table had he reallyi mean you have to try stuff before you can print it right it will only take two minutes of your time i breathed a little easier everything in the guide would take at least twenty minutes unless he was working on a sequel how to nail your shadow and leave them breathing in two minutes letting the cat slip from his arms he brushed at his somehow immaculate coat rex continued to purr and twine her attention went behind me and the clatter of pixy wings became obvious rachel its getting late jenks said his voice high and preoccupied im moving everyone out to the stump for the night but his entire demeanor changed when he came wing to shoulder with me holy crap he swore pixy dust sifting from him to make sunbeams at my feet rynn cormel you gotta be pissing on my daisies rache he exclaimed flying an erratic path between us its rynn cormel then he stopped as if hed been nailed to the air im giving you fair warning mr cormel if you bespell rachel ill open up your head for the sunshine to come in i cringed but the dignified man clasped his surprisingly ugly hands before him and gave jenks a respectful nod not at all i want to talk to ms morgan thats all he hesitated and i flushed when his gaze dropped to my stocking feet is there a more comfortable place oh god i hate it when this happens um i hedged then winced would you mind coming around the back mr president we have two unsanctified rooms for our undead clients im really sorry for asking you to come in the back door but the majority of our clients are living its just rynn he said smiling as if he were father christmas i was never sworn in actually he rocked back and glanced at his bodyguard id be happy to join you in back is it just that way he asked leaning to his right i nodded glad ivy and i had put in a slate walk then wondered if we had gotten the trash out this week crap i hoped so jenks if its warm enough could you escort mr cormel a flash of dust slipped from him and he darted outside you bet he flew down the stairs and then back up this way please his tiny voice was sarcastic and i wouldnt be surprised if jenks took the opportunity to threaten him again he had no respect for titles law or anything but a pixy sword and he took his job of keeping my ass above the grass seriously giving me a smile that would have twitterpated genghis khan the vampire took the stairs i watched his confident pace as he made his way to the sidewalk shoes clicking smartly listening to everything seeing everything a master vampire the master of this city what did he want with me if it wasntblood i ducked inside and shut the door relieved that cormel had motioned for his bodyguard and driver to stay put i didnt want them in my church even if jenks was with me three vampires opened the door for a lot of misunderstandings matalina i said loudly as i padded through the sanctuary we have a client but the pixy woman had already hustled the last of her brood down the hall and out through the chimney in the back living room it was only the youngest that were giving her trouble not remembering the drill from last year they would stay out of the church until rynn cormel left or theyd be cleaning my windows tomorrow i scuffed on my slippers by the back door and unlocked it darting into the kitchen to see if i could do a quick tidy i elbowed the rocker switch for the lights already reaching to shove a crumbstrewn plate into the dishwasher before the fluorescent tubes finished flickering to a bright steady glow mr fish my betta flipped his tail nervously at the sudden light and i made a mental note to feed him beside him on the sill was a tiny pumpkin that i had bought for jenks and his kids hoping that they would go for it instead of the huge pumpkin theyd grown off the compost pile this summer chances looked slim since the obnoxious but beautiful vegetable was sitting under the table warming up the thing was huge and i wasnt looking forward to a repeat of last years fiasco pumpkin seeds could be shot with painful accuracy it turns out i loved my kitchen with its expansive counters two stoves and huge stainlesssteel fridge that was big enough to hold a goat at least in theory there was a heavy antique table against the interior wall holding ivys computer printer and desk stuff one side of it was mine and lately id lost all but the last corner of it having to continually shove her stuff back so id have somewhere to eat i had taken the center island counter for me though so fair was fair the small island counter was covered in herbs i was experimenting with last weeks mail stacked on a corner and threatening to spill off and a mishmash of earthmagic spelling hardware copper pots and utensils hung over it from a huge rack where the pixies loved to play hideandseek among metal that wouldnt burn them below the counter was the rest of my spelling stuff jammed together in no particular order as it was mostly ley line paraphernalia that i didnt know what to do with my splat gun with its sleepytime charms was nestled in another set of nested copper pots and my small library of spell books was propped up with my more mundane cookbooks on a low shelf that was open on both sides three of them were demon curse books and they gave me the willies but i wasnt going to store them under my bed everything looked halfway decent and i flicked on the coffeemaker ivy had already prepped for breakfast tomorrow mr cormel probably wouldnt drink any but the smell might help block the pheromones maybe concerned i put my hands on my hips the only thing i might have done had i some warning would be to sweep the salt out of the circle etched in the linoleum surrounding the center island counter the air pressure shifted and i turned but my welcoming professional smile froze as i realized i hadnt heard the back door click open shit i breathed tensing as i realized why id stepped off hallowed ground al was here ten jenks i shouted stumbling backward i prayed al would start talking but his elegant chiseled features twisted in anger and he leapt at me whitegloved hands reaching i fell back against the sink arms braced i swung both feet up to hit him square in the chest oh god i was dead he wasnt gloating he wanted to freaking kill me if i was dead no one would know he broke his word not only was ceri an idiot for making charms for him she was wrong too panic took me when my feet went right through him gasping i fell sliding down the face of the cupboards to land on my butt my gaze went to my spell books minias my new calling circle was under the counter with my books i had to get to it i scrambled forward pain made me slow and as adrenaline pulsed through me als thick gloved hand grabbed me by the throat and hauled me up i choked ugly sounds making it past my lips my eyes bulged and my body went flaccid he shook me and the scent of amber rolled over me you are a reallystupidwitch he said giving me another shake with his accented word sometimes i wonder how you expected your genes to get to the next generation he smiled and fear wrapped around my heart as i gazed into his red goatslitted eyes and saw his anger he had nothing to lose nothing panicking i struggled he couldnt go misty to avoid my strikes and still hold on to me i had a chance al grunted when i scored on his shin and he let go i took a gasping breath of air my feet hit the floor knees crumpling i screamed when i was jerked back upright by my hair im going to freaking kill you al if you dont get the hell out of my kitchen i vowed not knowing where the threat was coming from but i was pissed scared absolutely terrified a velveteen arm went around my neck a cry slipped from me when his grip on my hair tightened pulling my head up so i looked at the ceiling pain struck through my neck and scalp i reached backward and he grunted when i got a fistful of his hair but he wouldnt let go even when i yanked it out by the roots and sent my hands scrabbling back for more stop it he said grimly jerking me into motion we have an appointment the hell we do i panted finding an ear and digging my nails in where is jenks al grunted tightening his grip until i let go i wasnt dead i wasnt dead he wanted me alive for the moment for an appointment you are going to clear my name he snarled bending to mouth my ear as if to bite it off i fought him until he pulled my hair so hard that tears started i could smell blood but i didnt think it was mine i thought id broken his nose when i had flung my head back i tried to shove against the counter and al dragged me away i asked you nicely but like the spoiled brat you are you refused he said i dont mind doing it the hard way you are going to testify to the courts that ceridwen merriam dulciate is limited to teaching one child how to spindle line energy that the damage is contained i wont do time for an exfamiliar who would be dead but for you my breath seemed to freeze in me testify he meant in the everafter he expected me to stand in a demon court why should i trust you i panted fingertips squeaking as he pulled my grip off the counter again it might make things easier he suggested sounding almost bitter that i didnt easier i thought it might also make me dead i struggled my slippers sliding on the linoleum as he yanked me backward to the hall my pulse leapt when the back door opened and the skittering of cat claws rasped i tried to see but it was hard with als arm around my neck bout time jenks i exclaimed what were you doing showing him your stump my bravado died at the snarl that rumbled slowly to life and vibrated to my very nerve endings reaching deep into my psyche and clenching around my primitive brain to reduce me to fight or flight cormel that ugly sound was coming from him holy shit jenks shrilled and als grip on my hair loosened taking a gasp of air i twisted falling away and smacking the flat of my foot square across the demons right cheek al rocked back his eyes never leaving rynn cormel who was standing in the threshold to my kitchen get back i shouted at the vampire but he never even looked at me al too was a hunched shadow ignoring me mostly rynn matthew cormel the demon drawled a brief shimmer of everafter cascading over him to leave his nose unbloodied and whole as he straightened what brings you slumming here the elegant vampire loosened his coat you in a roundabout way i flicked my gaze between them and felt my neck for the new bruise that was bound to show up jenks hovered beside me spilling red dust that puddled on the floor im honored al said tension in his voice and posture youre dead cormel said morgan is mine you will not touch her oh thats nice maybe al laughed as if you have a say in the matter that was even freaking better my breath came in sharply and i scrambled back when cormel jumped at al arms reaching and an ugly sound erupting from him a muffled curse slipped from me and my back hit the fridge i watched shocked as the two grappled both moving incredibly fast al blurred in and out of existence making the vampire look like he was trying to catch moving sand i couldnt take my eyes away and my pulse hammered if al won i was going to be bail money if rynn cormel won i was going to have to deal with a master vampire hyped up on fear and anger who thought i was his look out i cried when al got a grip on him but the vampire twisted with an inhuman bonelessness dislocating his own shoulder to fix his teeth on als neck al screamed and went misty reforming to push rynn backward into the sink mr fishs bowl teetered and when the vampire launched himself at al his fangs sheened with blood i darted to rescue the betta water sloshed as i retreated not looking at what i was doing i shoved the fish onto the back of the counter my gaze went to the books hiding my scrying mirror minias i could call minias yeah one more demon ought to make this farce complete al hit the wall beside ivys computer and the lights flickered gathering my courage i darted forward fingers slipping on the cold glass as i found the mirror oh god oh god oh god i whispered not remembering the word to invoke the charm rachel jenks cried they were coming right at me eyes widening i curled my body over the mirror and dove out of the way al and cormel crashed into the fridge the clock above the sink fell shattering to send the battery rolling into the hall al had cormels face in his hands and was squeezing with a supernatural strength but the vampires teeth were red i watched unable to look away as cormel reached up and dug his ugly fingers into als eyes screaming the demon flung himself back but the vampire was after him the two rolled on the floor both struggling for control they were going to freaking kill each other in my kitchen and wouldnt ivy be ticked at me for that jenks i said seeing him hovering at the ceiling just as captivated as i was his face was white and his wings made a highpitched whine ill get them apart you set the circle he said i nodded and shoved my sleeves up past my elbows the simplest plans were the best my heart pounded and jenks hovered over them they had regained their feet struggling like wrestlers als green frock making an odd statement against rynns elegant business suit hey demonass jenks shouted and al looked up a burst of pixy dust sifted down al screamed and went misty rynns hands scrabbled on air and when al reformed he was hunched over still rubbing at his eyes damn you to hell you burning firefly the demon shouted rynn gathered himself and i sprang into motion get out of the circle i shouted grabbing the vampires arm and swinging him into ivys desk with a crash the heavy table remained standing but the faint scent of broken technology mixed with the acidic smell of burnt amber and the rich tang of angry vampire the former world leader snarled at me when he found his balance my face went cold and i wondered if id fare better in the circle with al rache jenks shouted clearly annoyed and i slapped my hand down on the salt circle rhombus i said with relief and the connection to the ley line out back formed with a satisfying speed quicker than thought a sheet of everafter rose from the circle i had already scribed on the floor made strong by my will and the salt id used rynn skidded to a halt as the circle formed his long coat unfurling to brush the impenetrable barrier on the other side al pulled himself upright howling ill tear you apart he screamed his eyes still watering from jenkss dust morgan ill kill you myself i will notyou cant do this to me not again you are just a stinking little witch i fell back to sit on my butt carefully pulling my feet to me so i wouldnt accidentally touch the bubble and send it crashing down tag i breathed heavily looking around my demolished kitchen mr fish was quivering but at least the fishand jenkss pumpkin under the tablehad survived my jaw clenched in fear when i found rynn cormel the vampire was completely flaked out his pupils wide and his movements sharper and brighter than broken glass he stood in the corner as far away from me as he could get and i knew from living with ivy that he was working hard to get control of his instincts he held his coat closed and the hem quivered as he fought his need to leap at me morgan al raged and reaching up he pulled on the rack hanging overhead wood splintered and split and i scrambled up with a gasp when the ceiling cracked but it was the rack that broke and stuff went everywhere rolling until it found the interior of my circle and stopped but he was contained and as al threw a temper tantrum i worried more about rynn are you okay sir i said meekly the vampire brought his head up and fear slid anew around my skull his presence was thick in the room his scent filling me inside and out a tingling had started at my old demon scar and i saw him swallow um im going to open a window i said and when he nodded i carefully got up al threw himself at my circle and i jumped finding myself sweating when it held firm im going to kill you witch the demon said panting as he stood before me the rack broken and scattered over the interior of the circle im going to kill you then mend you im going to drive you insane im going to make you beg for your death im going to defile you cut you from the inside out put things in you that crawl around and burn your skull will you shut up i interrupted him and he howled his face going red you i said to rynn you just stay there will you i have to take care of this i didnt trust his silent posture but he hadnt ruled the free world by lacking control moooorgaaaan al crooned and i turned from scooping up my scrying mirror my face lost its expression as i found him with one of my earth charm spell books put that down i demanded his eyes narrowed i may not have a lifetime of curses stored in me anymore he said threateningly but i do know a few things by heart stop it i said as he swiped an arm across the counter and everything went to the floor jenks landed on my shoulder sending the sharp scent of broken chlorophyll over me i dont like this rache he whispered i said stop i exclaimed as al sketched a rude pentagram and put my book in it celero inanio he said and i jumped when my charm book burst into flames hey i shouted suddenly pissed knock it off als goatslitted eyes narrowed with a stiff motion he dropped another book in its place the thump of it reverberated through me his gaze behind the sheet of blackstained everafter was heavy with new hatred i had bested him again me a stinking little witch i stared thinking before i went with my first gut reaction of calling minias i could leave al there to burn all my books but with him in my circle id know where he was and be safe that night or i could call minias to drag als butt out of here and hope that no one summoned him again before the sun rose but something in als angry expression made me pause behind the fury he was tired he was tired of being hauled around and shoved into a little room he was tired of trying for me and failing and to have minias know it to be carted off under his leashit was almost insulting maybe if i gave al a night of peace to lick his wounds and his pride he would grant that same courtesy to me the moment hesitated the kitchen was eerily silent without the noise from the clock now broken on the floor al slowly straightened as he realized something was sifting through my brain that i was considering justletting him go do you feel lucky witch the demon growled his lips pulling back from his teeth as he smiled it was a dangerous smile that went right to my core but the thing was even though he could kill me i wasnt scared of him anymore as he had said i had circled the bastard one too many times he was tired and by that comment earlier maybe a little hungry for trust als eyes slid to the scrying mirror in my hand and his gaze went introspective as he saw me weighing my options one nights truce he said inquiringly i bit my lip and listened to my pulse in my ears get the hell out of here al i said not bothering to put any more direction behind it he blinked slowly his features smoothed out and a real smile curved over his face youre either really smart or even more stupid than i thought al said then vanished with a dramatic flair of red smoke rachel jenks shouted buzzing furiously in my face and shedding dust what the hell are you doing hell come right back i took a slow breath and straightened scrying mirror in my grip i carefully listened to the church feeling the air for any sign of demons my hand ached and i flexed it plucking a few of als hairs from under my fingernails in disgust let it go jenks i said something was shifting between al and mehad shifted i didnt know quite what but i felt different maybe because i wasnt whining to minias maybe me treating al with more respect might just get me a little more respect from him maybe you stupid witch jenks was shouting get your lilywhite ass on holy ground hes going to come back not tonight he wont the adrenaline crashed and i found my knees shaking my gaze slid to rynn cormel standing in the corner trying to control himself and i took another even breath to try to slow my pulse and not smell so tempting the vampire still hadnt moved but he was starting to look more human tired i slid the scrying mirror back where it belonged between my three untouched demon books al had burned a mundane earth charm book rynn took a step forward jerking to a halt when jenks got between us and buzzed a warning the vampire was disgusted you let him go the man said with no compulsion you do deal in demons the coffee was done and i crossed the room trailing my trembling fingers through the plane of the bubble to break it as i passed i settled against the counter where i could see both the man and the arch to the hallway taking a steadying breath i poured a cup of coffee and after asking rynn cormel with a gesture if he wanted any i took a sip i dont deal in demons i said when the first of it slipped down my throat they deal in me thanks for trying to help but jenks and i had it under control i didnt want him thinking i needed his protection vampire protection came at a costone i wasnt going to pay rynn cormels eyebrows rose had it under control i saved your life jenks huffed saved our lives your hairy ass rachel was the one that saved yours she circled him the pixy turned to me missing rynns dark expression rache he fussed get on holy ground he might come back i frowned at him while my free hand prodded my ribs for a possible bruise im fine take a chill pill before you set your dust on fire the pixy sputtered and i looked at the master vampire do you want to sit down jenks made a burst of frustrated noise im going to check on my kids he muttered then darted out rynn cormel watched him leave he gauged my fatigue then eased across the room to sit in ivys chair before her cracked monitor there was a long bloodless scratch on his cheek and his hair was mussed he was burning your books he said as if it was important to him i glanced at the pentagram al had sketched on my counter and the second book sitting in a pile of ash he wanted out i said he was burning my books because he was pissed i was going to call another demon to put him in custody im hoping that because i gave him a night of peace he will give me the same god help me im trusting a demon to make a moral decision based on respect the vampires expression shifted to understanding ahhhhh you chose the harder riskier path but by doing so it told him you werent going to rely on another for your safety that you dont fear him his head tilted you should you know i nodded i should fear al i did but not tonight not after seeing himdisheartened if he was depressed that a stinking little witch kept evading him then maybe he should stop treating me like a stinking little witch and treat me with some respect deciding rynn cormel was fully in control of himself my shoulders started to relax so what did you want to talk to me about he allowed himself a slow charismatic smile i was alone with rynn cormel politician extraordinaire master vampire and once ruler of the free world i pulled the sugar closer to the coffee i was starting to shake and i was going to blame it on low blood sugar yeah that was it you sure you dont want some coffee i said ladling in a third spoonful of sugar its fresh no no thank you he said then winced looking utterly charming ah i find im in the position of being embarrassed he said and i caught back my snort i came here to assure myself that you were well after your demon attack yesterday and i see that not only are you fine but that youre fully capable of protecting yourself ivy was not overestimating your skill i owe her an apology smiling faintly i pushed the sugar away it was nice to hear a compliment once in a while but undead vampires dont get embarrassed he was a young sweettalking very experienced master vampire and i watched his nostrils expand as he breathed in ivys and my mingled scents the vampire shook his head in a very human gesture the woman has a will like no other he said and i knew he was talking about ivy besting her instinct to bite me it was hard when we lived together like this tell me about it i said all of my awe from sitting in my kitchen with rynn cormel washed away by the panic of fighting for my life i think she uses me to test herself rynn cormels gaze came back from mr fish is that so the questioning tone in his voice made me nervous and i watched him catalog the mixing of ivys life and mine standing straighter i gestured with my coffee mug what can i do for you mr cormel rynn please he said flashing me one of his famous smiles that had helped save the free world i think after that we should be on a firstname basis rynn i said cautiously thinking this was really weird i took a sip of coffee and eyed him over it if i didnt already know he was dead id never have guessed he wasnt alive dont take this the wrong way but why do you care if im okay or not his smile widened youre part of my camarilla and i take my duties seriously i suddenly wished jenks was here a spike of fear plinked through me and i became very interested in the whereabouts of my splat gun rynn wasnt living but the sleepytime charm would drop him as fast as anyone else i wont let you bite me i said the threat in my voice clear as i forced myself to take another drink of coffee the bitter smell seemed to help other than his pupils dilating he hid the effect my fear had on him i was impressed im not here to bite you he said pushing his chair back away from me an inch or so im here to keep anyone else from doing so i watched him suspiciously and uncrossed my anklesgetting ready to move if i had to he had told al that i belonged to him tried to save me from al because of that but you consider me part of your camarilla i said not dumb enough to tell him i didnt want his help just yet dont you bite everyone in it at that he relaxed leaning forward to push ivys keyboard out of the way and put his elbows on the table an eager light filled him and i marveled at how alive and excited he looked i dont know ive never had one he explained his dark eyes fixed earnestly on mine and ive been told im charmingly eager in my efforts to start one a politician cantit doesnt make for a fair race shrugging he leaned back looking very attractive confident and young and when the chance arose for me to prevent piscarys children from being scattered to take his wellstructured happy camarilla as my own and assert a claim on you and ivy he hesitated his attention traveling over my demolished kitchen it made my decision to retire very easy my mouth went dry he had retired to get closer to ivy and me rynn cormels gaze returned to me i came here tonight to make sure you were intact which i can see you are ivy said you were capable of protecting yourself but i assumed her assurances were simply another one of her ways to keep me from meeting you i glanced at the empty hall things starting to fall into place that run of hers tonight was fake wasnt it i asked but it wasnt a question the vampire smiled bringing a leg up to rest a foot on his knee he looked really good sitting there in my kitchen im pleased ivy was telling me the truth im suitably impressed youve been bitten more times than your skin shows again i felt uncomfortable but i wouldnt cover my neck that was an invitation to look you have very beautiful skin he added and i felt a dropping sensation quickly followed by a tingling surge damn it i thought reining in my emotions i knew my skinless than a year old and hiding an unclaimed vampire bitewas like a steak dangling in front of a wolf unless the wolf was very well fed he was going to go for it im sorry he apologized his voice a wisp of hollow sound i didnt mean to make you uneasy yes you did i thought but i didnt say it aloud i pushed from the counter needing the false security of more space between us are you sure you dont want some coffee i asked going to the pot to intentionally turn my back on him i was afraid but if i wasnt obvious about it hed back off im in cincinnati because of you he said piscarys children owe you thanks for their wellbeing i thought you should know that my lips pressed tight and with my arms wrapped about myself i spun to him ready for it the chitchat was over i heard about you and ivy living together in this church and what she wants from you he said and my face flamed if you can save her soul after her first death he continued it would be the most significant advance in vampire history since the livevideo feed ohthat i hesitated embarrassed this was not what i had expected the master vampire smiled lacking a soul is why most vampires dont continue past their thirtyyear death anniversary he explained by then the people who loved them and have been giving them blood are either undead as well or simply dead blood from someone who doesnt love you is a thin meal and without a soul an undead vampire has a difficult time convincing anyone that he or she loves them it makes it hard to form an emotional bond that is real and not contrived he shifted the scent of vampiric incense coming clear to me it can be done but it takes a lot of finesse somehow i didnt think rynn cormel had that problem so if i can save ivys soul i prompted not liking where this was going it will allow the undead to continue to form auratic bonds with new people extending their undead existence forever i leaned against the counter and crossed my ankles sipping my coffee i thought that over remembering that when ivy had bitten me she had taken a portion of my aura along with my blood the theory went along nicely with my private theory that an undead vampire needs the illusion of a soul or aura about it or the brain will realize it is dead and drive the vampire into the sun to kill it thus bringing the mind the body and the soul back into balance im sorry i said thinking that the pope would have a coronary at my thoughts it cant be done i dont know how to save ivys soul when she dies i just dont rynn cormels gaze roved over the scattered herbs crushed underfoot and i warmed wondering if he knew id been experimenting with ways to safely curb ivys blood lust youre the one who broke the balance of power between the vampires and the weres he accused so very softly and i felt cold you found the focus he continued and my pulse quickened my boyfriendmy exboyfrienddid that semantics he said waving a hand you brought it into the light and i buried it in a weres body he exclaimed showing a hint of anger it might have been to cow me but it had the opposite effect hell i had already bound a demon tonight i was on top of the world if you touch david i said setting my cup aside but rynn cormel only raised his eyebrows his anger disappearing at the amusement he found in my threats dont try to bully me rachel it makes you look foolish im saying you broke the balance the artifact is out power is shifting slowly with the gentle pace of generations but it will shift to the weres he stood i kept my attention off my splat gun but i could feel itutterly too far away if you can find a way for the undead to retain their soul then the numbers of the undead will grow at a similarly slow pace he smiled starting to button up his coat balance is maintained no one dies isnt that what you want i put a hand to my middle i suppose i shouldve expected this no good deed goes unpunished and all and witches and humans i asked he looked out my kitchen window and into the dark maybe thats up to you too but what i heard was who cares just wanting this to all go away i said i dont know how to do it youve got the wrong witch rynn cormel found his hat and with a graceful swoop plucked it from the floor i think i have the only witch he said brushing the matted dandelion seed from it but even if you dont find a way others will see what you accomplished and will build on that in the meantime what have i lost by declaring your blood offlimits to all but ivy what have i spent in making sure that you and she have a chance to develop a blood relationship free of stress and trouble i stifled a shiver and my hand rose up to cover my neck its no effort at all he said then put his hat on okay he was keeping my butt safe from vampires i appreciate that i said grudgingly thank you a copper spell pot grated against the salt when rynn cormel pushed it aside with the toe of his dress shoe thats hard for you isnt it owing someone i dont i started then grimaced rubbing my back where a cupboard knob had raked my skin yes i finally admitted hating it his smile grew to show a slip of teeth and he turned as if to leave then i expect you to honor that i dont belong to you i shot after him and he turned in the threshold looking good in his long coat and stylish hat his eyes were black but i wasnt afraid of him ivy was a bigger threat hunting me slowly but i was letting her do it too i meant i expect you to honor your relationship with ivy i do that already i said clasping my arms about myself then we are in perfect understanding he again turned to leave and i followed him into the hall my thoughts went to ivy then marshal he wasnt my boyfriend but he was new in my life and we were having the hardest time getting together to do the simplest thing are you the reason marshal and i werent able to get together this afternoon i accused are you going to drive him away so ivy and i will fall into bed together he was in my living room and from over his shoulder he said yes my lips pressed together and my slippers scuffed the wood floor we had found under the carpet leave marshal alone i said hands on my hips kistens bracelet fell to my wrist and i shoved it back into hiding hes just a guy and if i want to sleep with someone im going to you running off men isnt going to send me rushing into ivys arms its going to piss me off and make me miserable to live with got it i suddenly realized i was swearing at a past leader of the united states and i flushed sorry for barking at you i muttered as i fingered kistens bracelet and felt guilty its been a hard day my apologies he said so sincerely that i almost believed it ill stop interfering i took a breath and unclenched my teeth before i gave myself a headache thank you the sound of the front door crashing open made me jump rynn cormel took his hand from the door and turned to face the hall rachel came ivys worried voice rachel you okay theres a couple of guys out front in a car i glanced at rynn cormel his eyes had gone black hunger black uh im fine i sang out im back here uh ivy damn it all to hell she swore her boots clunking in the hall i told you to stay on holy ground she barreled into the living room almost pinwheeling to a stop she flashed red her short dark hair swinging as she stopped her hand went first to her bare neck then she forced it down to her leatherclad hip excuse me she said her face going pale ive interrupted rynn cormel shifted his weight and she cringed no youre fine ivy he said his voice now deeper and measured he had lightened his usual demeanor to lull me and it had worked im glad youre here ivy looked up clearly embarrassed im sorry about your men at the car i didnt recognize them they tried to stop me from coming in my eyebrows rose and rynn cormels laughter shocked both ivy and me if you bested them they deserved it and needed the reminder thank you for correcting their poor interpretation of your skills ivy licked her lips it was a nervous habit i didnt see often and my tension rose um she hedged trying to tuck her short hair behind an ear i think i ought to call an ambulance i broke a few things looking like he didnt care the master vampire eased forward and very slowly took her perfect hand in his scarred one youre too kind ivy looked at her fingers among his blinking fast rachel is a powerful young woman he said and i suddenly felt like id passed some sort of test i can see why you are attracted to her you have my blessing to cultivate a scion relationship with her if that is what you want my anger rose but ivy shot me a look to shut me up thank you she said and i got even more mad when rynn cormel smiled smugly knowing id held my tongue because ivy had asked me to then i thought so what why should i care what he thinks if hell leave us alone rynn cormel took another step closer to ivy curving an arm about her waist in a familiar fashion that i didnt like would you accompany me this evening ivy now that i have seen your friend i understand better id like totry another angle if you are willing try another angle i thought seeing the hinted hunger in him luring her working on a sequel are we i didnt agree with how vampire society worked but ivy took a relieved breath her eyes positively lighting yes she said quickly but then her gaze slid to me go i said sourly glad she hadnt seen the demolished kitchen ill be fine she eased closer to rynn cormel her lean leatherclad body looking fabulous next to his polished refinement youre not on hallowed ground she said al wont be back i glanced at rynn cormels light grip on her shoulder im fine ivy pulled away from him reaching for me he was here she said are you okay im fine i said backing up until her outstretched hand dropped my gaze went to rynn cormel and i didnt like the smile he was hiding i told you not to go onto unsanctified ground ivy almost scolded god rachel i made you a sign i forgot okay i shot back at her i took it down because it ticked me off and i forgot i was so flustered about your master vampire paying me a visit that i forgot ivy hesitated then said softly okay okay i repeated feeling my anger die at her quick admission wellokay i glared at rynn cormel who was adjusting his hat and smiling at the exchange ill get on hallowed ground i said just wanting her to leave ivy took a rocking step toward the door then hesitated what about dinner you cant order pizza al might deliver it marshal is coming over i said looking pointedly at rynn cormel as he evaluated the exchange hes bringing dinner a flash of jealousy passed over ivy dying fast rynn cormel saw both its birth and death and when he met my gaze i knew he realized ivy and i had already set up the rules for our relationshipand those rules included other people most vampiric relationships did though that did nothing for my sense of morality ill see you about sunrise she said and the master vampires eyebrows rose ivy gave me a tightlipped smile and turned to rynn cormel ivy he said offering his arm mr cormel she said back sounding flustered as she didnt take it um could you sign your book for me before we go my breath hesitated and i stiffened oh god not the vampire dating guide ivy turned to me her expression eager i didnt see this side of her often and it was kind of scary youve still got it dont you she asked is it still on your bedside table ivy i exclaimed backing up my face hot crap now he knows ive read it my thoughts flicked to page fortynine and i stared in horror when rynn cormel laughed at my expression it was so i would stop stomping on her instincts i babbled and he laughed all the more ivy was starting to look ticked and rynn cormel took her arm to escort her out i would love to sign your copy he said as he led her to the back door im sure rachel will find it for you and you can bring it over next time he smiled over his shoulder at me as he opened the door and the coolness of the night slipped in she might want to peruse it first he added and my jaw clenched ive already perused it i said loudly and the door shut behind them with a soft click god help me i muttered as i fell back into ivys old couch and breathed in the puff of vampire incense that id kicked up from the cushions if she wanted rynn cormel to sign her book she could damn well dig it out from the back of my closet herself i didnt even know for sure if it was still there but staring at the ceiling i wondered if ivy might find happiness in a real vampiric relationship with rynn cormel she seemed positively besotted my thoughts drifted to kisten and i wondered if she felt any of the guilt i did the quiet of the church soaked into me and in the distance i heard the sound of a car starting up kitchen i said to myself and sat up yeah i had told ivy id get on hallowed ground but i wasnt going to let that mess sit until tomorrow tomorrow i was going out with david and once i knocked some sense into a happy band of demon summoners id have my life back such as it was i stood in the threshold of the kitchen and sighed at the destruction maybe i could pay the pixies to clean it up but they were tucked into the stump until the warmth of sunrise so resigned to the mess i scuffed in my back hurt as i picked up the broken clock and set it on the counter most of the rack was on the floor and deciding id pile everything up now and sort it later i went to the cupboard to get the broom it was going to be a long night eleven the moon was shining in the kitchen window as i wiped my footprints off the island counter i was almost finished with cleaning up it had taken a twentypixyescort trip out to the shed for my toolbox but id found a metal plate and a few wood screws to tack the rack together i wasnt going to put anything heavier than herbs on it but at least it wasnt hanging cockeyed from the ceiling yes i had told ivy id get on sanctified ground but for some inane reason i trusted that al wasnt going to show up as some weird thankyou for not siccing minias on him tomorrow hed try to abduct me again but tonight i was safe and i never had told ivy when id actually get to holy ground besides marshal was coming over and the kitchen table was less datelike than the couch tossing the dishcloth onto the table i knelt before the open shelves under the counter i had simply shoved everything in there on my first pass through and it was a mess if i couldnt hang the smaller spell pots and utensils back up id have to do some rearranging my splat gun sat in the small spell pot nestled in with the rest on the bottom shelf right where id need it if i was crawling that was where it would stay but the ceramic spoons needed a new home gathering up the spoons and long utensils i arranged them in a glass vase id pulled out of the back of a cupboard i pushed my spell books down and used the vase as a bookend taking up the space where the book al had destroyed had been unhappy i sat back on my heels and considered my smaller library id never be able to replace the book he had burned sure i could pick up another at just about any charm shop but mine had had notes and everything in it i wondered if perhaps i ought to move the more valuable demon curse books onto hallowed ground id been lucky al hadnt destroyed one of them instead or maybe i was unlucky seeing as i still had them my fingers tingled as i pulled out the three books in question i stood and after running my arm across the counter to make sure it was dry i set them down moving them jenks questioned and i looked to where he was examining my handiwork his fists on his hips as he hovered at the mended rack maybe i said glumly his wings made a soft hum and i swung my hair out of the way as he approached but he landed on the counter instead if that gargoyle werent up there id say put them in the belfry a wince crinkled my eyes as i imagined the extreme temperatures hes in the belfry jenks lifted a shoulder and let it fall no but hes on the roof beside the window tinks titties i never see the thing move one minute hes here the next hes there and when hes not asleep i dont know where he is at any rate it might be better than putting them under your bed ivy said the guy who blessed the church said the belfry was super holy super holy eh maybe i should sleep up there worried i pushed the books to the corner to make room for the rest of the undercounter stuff i dont know my nose tickled as i weeded through the stack of herbs id been messing with to modify an existing charm to give ivy a measure of control over her blood lust it wasnt going well she didnt like trying them out taking them on her dates so if it didnt work i wouldnt have to fight her off nothing seemed to have an effect and i wondered if she was really trying them or just telling me she was ivy didnt like my magic touching her though she thought me blasting anyone else was cool jenks dropped to land beside the curse books his tiny features were worried as he watched me shake a sheaf of feverfew to get the tansy off it you arent going to keep that are you he asked and i glanced up from picking cat hair off it you dont think i should they arent pure anymore he kicked a dry stem making little chips fall off you got pieces of rosemary on the coneflower and coneflower seeds sticking to the dandelions who knows what they will do especially if youre experimenting i looked at the pile of dried herbs thinking it would be a lot easier to just chuck it out the back door but i was afraid that if i did that i might simply give up adapting charms was hard i could follow a recipe but my mother was like a gourmet chef and i had never appreciated that until i tried to do it myself maybe youre right mood souring i shook out a brown paper bag and shoved a years worth of gardening into it the rasping sound cut through the silence and i felt sick as i wadded the top of the bag down and jammed it all into the trash under the sink turning i deemed the kitchen reasonably clean the rack was empty and i wondered if i should just give up on the charm for controlling ivys blood lust ivy wasnt helping and it was really hard depressed i slumped into my chair at the table i dont know if i can do this jenks i said putting my elbows on the table and exhaling with a sigh my mother makes it look so easy maybe ill get farther if i mix some ley line magic with the earth charms i mean ley line magic is mostly symbolism and word choice making it more flexible jenkss wings blurred into motion and stopped tossing his blond hair from his eyes he frowned almost sitting on the demon text and catching himself at the last moment wings going full tilt mix earth and ley line magic isnt that what makes a demon curse fear slid through me and away it wont be a demon curse if i invent it will it his wings drooped and he seemed to slump i dont know marshals here i sat up and glanced over the kitchen how do you know he drives a diesel and one just pulled up to the curb a smile curved over me hes got a diesel engine spilling a glittering path of dust jenks rose probably needs it to pull his bigass boat out of the water ill get the door i want to talk to him jenks i warned and he laughed halfway to the hall about al being after you god rachel im not your daddy i relaxed then got to my feet and shoved the demon books under the counter vowing to do some rearranging tomorrow when the sun was up i heard the front door open before the bell even rang and a masculine greeting filtered softly back to me in a way that sounded reallycomforting is she all right came marshals soft query from the sanctuary but i didnt hear jenkss response no thats cool he added clearly closer and i spun to the hallway at the soft sound of the floorboards creaking and the smell of hot rice hi marshal i said glad to see him you made it marshal had taken the time to get out of his interview clothes and he looked good in jeans and a soft flannel shirt of rich blue there was a folded newspaper under his arm and he set it and the steamdamp bag on the table before taking off his coat i was starting to think the world was conspiring against us he said jenks said you had a rough early evening i glanced at jenks wondering what he had told marshal i shrugged arms wrapping around my middle i survived survived jenks landed on top of the rolleddown bag we kicked that demons ass from here to the turn dont sell yourself short rache marshal hung his coat on the back of ivys chair pausing to watch jenks manhandle the bag open i like your church he said gazing at the kitchen it suits you thanks a flash of gratitude went through me he didnt pry didnt ask why a demon had been in my kitchen didnt take my hand and peer into my eyes and ask me if i was okay and did i need to sit down didnt tell me i was going to die young and that i should take up canasta instead he accepted my explanation and let it go i didnt think it was because he didnt care either i think it was because he wanted to wait until i was comfortable and told him myself and that meant a lot kisten had been like that too i will not compare marshal to kisten i thought as i got two plates and the tea bag caddy jenks used as a dish ivy was out on a date she was able to move on with her life it would get better but only if i tried only if i wanted it to and i did i didnt like being unhappy i hadnt realized i had been until i started to feel good again where marshal said into the silence as he peered under the table did you get such a big pumpkin it is a pumpkin isnt it the man asked and jenkss wings increased their pitch its not one of those squash that looks like a pumpkin its a pumpkin jenks said his pride clear i grew it myself between the jamesons plots and the davaros statue out in the graveyard he added as if it wasnt obvious were going to carve it tomorrow just me and the kids give matalina a break matalina gets a break and i get pumpkin guts on my ceiling im sure it would start sedately enough but it wouldnt be long before they started pumpkin wars the sequel soooo i said as i hung up the dishcloth how did your last interviews go marshal edged closer when jenks got the bag open and the scent of sweetandsour came wafting out great he started removing takeout boxes and i looked up suddenly conscious that our shoulders were almost touching i got the job he said when our eyes met and i smiled marshal thats great i exclaimed then gave him a neutral swat on the shoulder when do you start i added not looking at him as i turned to fuss with the food maybe that was too much the man backed up a step and ran a hand over the new stubble atop his head november first he said but ill be on salary so i can go back and forth to sell the business if i need to until classes start up after the winter solstice jenks gave me a warning look and i scowled at him bumping the table to make him jump when i went to get a couple of serving spoons the scent of oil and gas blended with a witchs redwood smell making marshal seem like a yummy piece of northern exposure he dressed differently from anyone id spent much time with smelled different and had somehow skipped that uncomfortable stage of awkwardness most of my dates had slipping into my church like he belonged not that this was a date maybe that was why i had invited him over without any thoughts of a possible relationship and we both could relax but i expected the easy companionship was mostly because he had helped jenks and me when we had really needed it ivys chair bumped and scraped as marshal pulled it to the open spot and he sighed when he sat down it was one of the oddest interviews ive ever had he said as i rummaged for the chopsticks with my back to him they seemed to like me but i thought they were going to give it to the other guyand for the life of me i couldnt tell why he had developed a swim program for a high school down in florida but he didnt have either the dive time or ley line experience and thats what they were looking for i sat down kittycorner to him and his eyes flicked to the chopsticks then all of a sudden they made a decision and offered me the job he finished all of a sudden huh jenks said and i shot him a look to shut him up marshal didnt get the job because of rynn cormel but id be willing to bet the vampire had been leaning on the university to pick someone else until i had barked at him to get out of my life whereupon the university had chosen whom they wanted marshal was still looking at the chopsticks it was weird like id done them a favor or something by saying yes his gaze flicked from the chopsticks to me and he winced uh im going to need a fork i laughed and got back up sorry i felt his attention on me and feeling sassy i picked out two forks marshal was dishing out the food and it was nice being with someone who wasnt looking for anything you know since al showed up we dont have to hang around here rachel jenks protested and i turned bumping the drawer closed with my hip what i complained hes not going to come back tonight ive been on unsanctified ground this entire time and ivys going to have fairies coming out her ass when she finds out jenks said i plopped down not meeting anyones gaze marshal glanced from me to jenks watching us between tapping rice out on our plates jenks waved his hand no when marshal offered which didnt surprise me the small pixy wasnt happy and his wings were turning red as he grew upset and his circulation increased annoyed i set the forks clattering on the table hes not going to bother me anymore tonight jenks why because you didnt have minias cart him off when your deluded sense of siding with the underdog told you he was tired and he appreciated you trusting him tinks contractual hell rachel thats nuts slug nuts with slime on top if you die tonight its not my fault marshal continued to serve food and the spicy scent did nothing to ease my tension ah rachel you want to go rollerskating tomorrow he said clearly not liking jenks and me arguing it was an obvious attempt to change the subject but my ire evaporated and i uncrossed my arms and decided to ignore jenks do you know how long its been since ive been skating i said the pixy dropped to his empty tea bag caddy with his arms crossed over his chest shedding silver sparkles according to your mom not since you were banned for slamming quiet i said thumping the underside of the table with my knee but the antique ash was heavy and jenks didnt even jump this time dont you have somewhere to go gargoyles to spy on or something i complained my face warming they wouldnt still remember me at astons would they nope jenks said his face was creased in irritation and then seeing both of us looking at him he forced himself to relax how about putting some of that sake i smell on my plate marshman he said suddenly it was a change of mood i didnt trust but id go along with it looking chagrined marshal pulled a worn thermos from his jacket pocket it was supposed to be a surprise he said dryly as he set it between us im surprised i said as i got up to get the tiny seethrough ceramic teacups that ceri preferred to my thickwalled mugs they werent traditional sake cups but they looked better than shot glasses that will work marshal said as i set them down and he filled them halfway up before carefully tipping his cup over jenkss tea bag caddy to fill it right to the top this isnt like kisten i thought finding a hint of peace as i held my cup up in a toast jenks had never hung around when kisten and i were together and though marshal was fun to look at i was still too raw to be serious not having that willhewonthe stress to deal with was an unexpected pleasure to new jobs he said and we all took a sip me holding my breath so i wouldnt cough good stuff i said eyes watering and feeling the nasty stuff burn all the way down marshal set his cup down with a careful slowness the subtle easing of his posture telling me that just that little bit of alcohol had an effect on him but hell sake was potent stuff jenkss wings sped up and the soft slipping of dust ceased thanks for letting me come over marshal said as he took up his fork and arranged his dinner my hotel room isempty and i could use a little normalcy after today smirking jenks fanned his wings sending the scent of rice to me she fought off a demon with the help of rynn cormel we aint normal marshman it almost sounded like a warning and marshals laughter stopped short when he saw my mood go pensive rynn cormel he said as if trying to figure out if jenks was kidding him the vampire right i leaned over my plate and took a bite good rice sticks together but i wasnt going to use chopsticks if marshal wasnt yup i said when it became obvious that he was waiting for an answer he took in piscarys camarilla which means hes my roommates new master vamp and he came over to find out what my intentions toward ivy were sort of the truth but the entire truth was way too embarrassing oh it was an uncomfortable utterance and i looked up to see his brown eyes holding an uneasy warinesswhich made jenks all the more pleased apparently if his wing speed was any indication it wasnt a big deal i said trying to downplay it he got in the way more than anything else that didnt help at all and marshal swallowed to look ill i sat back gripping my plate and reaching for my sake cup you want to move to sanctified ground we can watch tv or something we have cable out there now marshal shook his head no if you say the demon wont show up i believe you a snicker came from jenks ticking me off i took another swallow of sake following it with the rice and meat it didnt burn this time and i thought as i chewed and swallowed this stank marshal wanted to take me skating what kind of friend makes a guy hide in a church because shes afraid of demons lips pressed i got up feeling the mens eyes on me as i plucked my compact from my bag and one of ivys fineline sharpies from her cup i had a stick of yew around here somewhere and the sake was probably a good substitute for wine uh rache jenks questioned im tired of hiding in my church i said thinking id have to get my scrying mirror out to remember what the glyph looked like if i wanted to reproduce the spell to make a calling circle its right before halloween for crying out loud rache i wouldnt look up if you want to come with us and babysit fine al isnt going to show besides he wants me alive not dead and i want to go out marshals fork scraped as he set it down what are you doing making something i probably shouldnt giving up on doing this from memory i pulled my scrying mirror out from under the island counter and carefully set it down i harbored a guilty thought that the thing was beautiful its crystalline lines of the symbols etched into its surface showing a sharp diamond clarity against the winecolored depths of the glass reflecting reality in deep shades of maroon something this evil shouldnt be beautiful ceri had helped me make this one after i broke the first over miniass head damn it why is she risking her soul like this again marshal was silent as he looked at it thats a calling circle he finally said i think ive never seen one like that jenks looked almost cocky when the dust slipping from him turned gold and he said thats because it goes through ley lines to summon demons i frowned but the damage had been done marshal stiffened carefully taking a bite of rice and vegetables as if it didnt bother him exasperated i looked at the sake and decided id had enough of jenks not the sake what is with him tonight it doesnt summon demons just lets me talk to them and opens a channel they can travel through marshal im a white witch really i looked at the pentagram and winced the thing is ive got a demon bent on dragging me into the everafter and having a calling circle gives me the option to call someone to pick him up when he shows hes supposed to be in jail but everything will be fine tomorrow after i go out with david and beat some sense into whoever is calling al and releasing him to get me it sounded lame even to me and marshal chewed his rice his attention never leaving mine as he weighed his thoughts his gaze flicked to the calling circle and then swung back to me you call it al he asked mildly i took a breath deciding to give him all the drama of my life at once if he was going to leave because of it i wanted to know now not after i started liking the guy the smut on my aura i got from using a demon curse to save my exboyfriend i said mostly and the two demon marks were accidents arent they all i mocked in my thoughts but marshal had taken a sip of his drink and leaned back rachel you dont have to tell me all this he said and i raised a hand yes i do eyeing the sake i slammed it wanting a loose tongue for a few minutes there is no way im going to have a boyfriend anytime soon i said as it burned so if youre looking for a fast hop in the sack you can just walk out the door right now actually you should get out now anyway uh marshal stammered and jenks snickered as he drank the last of his sake i have a risky job i said defensively as i put my arm flat on the table almost flipping my plate of rice i love it it might make you a target my jaw clenched kisten had died because he refused to kill me when piscary asked i was sure of it jenks took flight and i watched the sparkles as he landed on marshals shoulder and sighed shes such a drama queen he muttered a little too loudly ticking me off shut up jenks i said carefully so i wouldnt slur i wasnt drunk but the alcohol helped i turned to marshal i got a demon mark when my exboyfriend bought a trip through the lines when al tore my throat open i have another on my foot because some jackass pulled me through to the everafter to give me to al and i had to buy a trip home from another demon who is absolutely nuts and might show up at any time if she remembers me she marshal said sparse eyebrows high but accepting that i also have a couple of unclaimed vampire scars that make me susceptible to vampire pheromones i said not caring what he thought if it wasnt for ivy protecting me id be dead or out of my mind by now because of it jenks leaned toward marshals ear and whispered loud enough for me to hear i think she likes them if you ask me im trouble marshal i said ignoring jenks if you were smart youd walk out of my church get in your truck and drive away god i dont even know why youre here marshal pushed his plate away and crossed his arms over his chest his muscles bunched under his shirt and i forced my attention from him i wasnt drunk damn it but my eyes warmed are you done he asked i suppose i said depressed jenks do you mind if i talk to rachel alone marshal asked the pixys expression darkened and he put his fists on his hips but when he saw me glare at him he sulkily flew to the door ten to one he was going to listen from the hall but at least we had the illusion of privacy seeing him gone marshal leaned across the table and took my hands in his rachel i met you on my boat asking for my help to rescue your exboyfriend from a group of militant weres dont you think i know you leave a trail of bread crumbs for trouble to follow i brought my eyes up yes but my turn he said and i shut my mouth im not sitting in your kitchen because im new in town and looking for a curvy body in my bed im here because i like you i only talked to you for a few hours on my boat but in that little time i was seeing you as you no pretenses no games you know how rare that is he gave my fingers a gentle squeeze and my gaze rose you never see a person like that on a date not after a dozen dates sometimes you can spend years with someone and never really know what theyre like under the veneer we put on to make ourselves feel better i liked what i saw when you were under pressure the last thing i need is a steady girlfriend he let go of my hand and slid to the back of his chair my last one was a nightmare and id just as soon keep things casual like tonight minus the demon he smiled and i couldnt help but smile back id been around too many guys to take his words at face value but he was stifling a shudder born from something in his memory i dont want you to get hurt i mumbled embarrassed now the quickest way to get a man interested was to say you werent marshal sat taller ill be okay he said as he looked out the dark kitchen window and shrugged im not helpless ive got a degree in lowlevel ley line manipulations i ought to be able to manage a demon or two he smiled shortterm anyway this wasnt going well im noti cant i took a steadying breath im still hurting youre wasting your time he looked at the window and the dark square it made i told you im not looking for a girlfriend you women are all nuts but i like the way you smell and youre fun to dance with a quiver rose and fell in my middle then why are you here marshals eyes came back to mine i dont like being alone and you look like you need to be with someonefor a while slowly my gaze dropped and then returned to his could i trust that seeing my compact i picked it up weighed it in my palm then tossed it into my bag somehow i didnt feel like i needed to prove anything to him anymore and the entire idea had been bad to begin with god no wonder i kept getting into trouble so i couldnt go out so what you ah want to watch a movie i said embarrassed for having bared my soul though it had left me feeling refreshed marshal made a soft noise and stretched where he sat looking comfortable and content sure mind if i bring my paper in for the classifieds im still looking for an apartment sounds great i said that sounds really great twelve it was the softest sound of fabric sliding against leather that woke me in a pulse of adrenaline my eyes flashed open and my breath came fast the scratchy softness of an afghan brushed against my face and i sat up with a smooth fast motion i was on the couch in the sanctuary not my bed and the light coming in the tall stainedglass windows was bright with the sunrise across the coffee table marshal was frozen halfway to a stand from his chair his expression was one of shock wow he said as he straightened to his full height i was trying to be quiet youre a really light sleeper i blinked at him realizing what had happened i fell asleep i said stupidly what time is it with a soft exhalation marshal sat back down on the chair where he had spent most of last night a bowl holding leftover popcorn sat on the table with three bottles of pop and an empty bag of gingersnaps his stocking feet spread wide he squinted at his watch it was analog which didnt surprise me most witches shunned digital a little after seven he said his gaze rising to the muted tv and the puppets that were dancing there oh god i moaned falling back into the warmth of where i had been sleeping im so sorry marshal had his head down as he adjusted his socks for what i gestured to the stainedglass windows past the gently swaying bats its seven i dont have to be anywhere do you uh not until later my swirling thoughts slowed i didnt feel that good seeing as i still had a chunk of sleep waiting for me somewhere and i scooted myself up a bit so i wasnt soschlumpy looking hey you ah want to crash here for the rest of the morning i asked staring at the happy puppets on the tv must be a human thing to watch puppets at this hour because it sure as hell wasnt appealing to a witch we have a couch in the back living room its darker in there marshal pressed his lips together and shook his head no thanks i didnt mean to wake you i was going to leave you a note and slip out ive been on a human clock for three years im usually up by now my face twisted as i imagined that im not i complained ive got to get to bed he smiled as he gathered the empty bottles to take to the kitchen and i yawned dont bother i said ill take care of them if i dont rinse them out the rani of recycling yells at me smiling he pulled his hands away and stood leaving them where they were i have to check a few more apartments this morning but ill burn through my list in a few hours you want to get together later a spike of anticipation rose through me dulled by my sleepy state but i couldnt help but wonder where this was going last night with marshal had been fun comfortable true to what he had said earlier about wanting a break from a girlfriend we just sat around and watched tv i had brought all my runner instincts to bear on him and though it would be stupid to think that he might not be interested in more later right now he just seemed to appreciate the company god knew i did sure i said carefully but davids run out to that witchs house comes first i was reluctant to move feeling rumpled and ill from the early hour id thought it had been odd when hed fallen asleep in his chair at midnight right during the news but if hed been running on a human clock that would be late for him i had intended to let marshal sleep through the late movie and then wake him seeing as it was nice having company without having to worry about triggering any blood lust attacks when i got excited in a chase scene falling asleep during the slow spots had never crossed my mind but someone had turned the volume down so hed probably woken up at some point and let me keep sleeping that was nice you need any help at the house i mean marshal asked and i smiled up at him nope then ill get out of here he said then dropped down to crouch before me he was way too close and i drew back with my eyes wide youre funny he said as he got on his hands and knees and peered under the couch im not going to kiss you youre too much trouble to be my girlfriend too highmaintenance my boots are under there i grinned in embarrassment as he came up with his boots the click of the front door opening shot through me marshal got to his feet and turned in one smooth motion and i bolted upright ivy i called recognizing the sound of her boots clacking her path rulerstraight and her face placid she walked past marshal and me morning she said no clue to her mood in her voice as she vanished into the darkness of the hall the collar to her jacket was up and i think shed been bitten in an intentionally obvious place my thoughts jerked back to rynn cormel and a feeling of anger burned he had taken her last night making his claim in an obvious indisputable way id known it was coming and ivy said it was expected but it still seemed degrading to me marshal shifted uneasily and my attention returned to him he was standing over me and i suddenly realized what it must have looked like to ivy he hadnt been there to give me a kiss but he had been in the right place for it ivy slammed a kitchen cupboard door shut and marshal jumped id ah better go i pulled the afghan up around my shoulders as he started for the front door stretching to feel every ache the couch had put in me i followed him the pixies were loud outside and the shadows of their wings showed where they were clearing spiderwebs off the outside panes to help deter fairies from trying to take up residence my balance bobbled as i came around the coffee table and marshal caught my elbow thanks i mumbled looking up his considerable height i didnt like how awkward the early hour had made me but he looked fine standing there in his rumpled shirt and lightly stubbled face kinda klutzy in the morning eh he said then let go of my elbow when ivys boots clattered in the hallway he stepped back and i tried not to frown at ivy she had marshals coat from the kitchen and she draped it over my swivel desk chair do you want some coffee before you go she asked sounding sincere but the coat said different marshal cracked his neck his gaze sliding to his coat before returning to ivy who was framed by the hallway opening her hip cocked looking predatory in her sleek leather pants and coat no thanks i have an appointment see you later ivy he pulled his coat from the chair and as it slowly spun i followed him to the door fatigue made my feet heavy and i yawned trying to wake up god i must look terrible bye marshal ivy said still unmoving her face was empty telling me she wasnt happy i gave her a pointed look when marshal paused to put on his boots and finally showing her ire she turned and left immediately my tension eased in the dim gray of the foyer dont mind her i said as marshal laced his boots up she likes you could have fooled me he said as he tugged his coat on and the scent of oil gas and redwood came to me thanks for last night i didnt want to sit in my hotel room and im too old for the bar scene i feel like im using you to keep from being alone a smile came over me sort of sad but happy as well yeah me too i hesitated not wanting to sound pushy but it had felt good not to be alone so ill call you later this afternoon when i know my schedule he took a deep breath exhaling quickly as he gathered his thoughts not if i call you first smiling he opened the door and stepped out onto the stoop bye rachel bye i called after him i slumped until my back hit the door frame giving him an unsure smile when he looked up from the sidewalk with his keys in hand his boots were almost soundless on the walk and i watched him as the cooler air slipped in to make my ankles chill and a stray curl dance before my eyes i hoped this wasnt a mistake id had guy friends before but it usually slipped into something else before it ended the human neighbor down the street drove past in his minivan and when he slowed to check marshal out i ducked back inside seven oclock what was i doing up at seven oclock this was a stupidass hour to be up but i felt good sort of melancholy but good the darkness of the foyer was comforting and i wrapped my arms around my middle as i went back into the sanctuary grabbing the bowl and bottles on my way to the kitchen ivy was in there and i wanted to know if rynn cormel the charismatic world leader had taken advantage of my roommate and bitten her squinting at the brighter light and feeling the early hour all the way to my bones i rinsed the empty pop bottles before dropping them into the recycling bin and slumped into my chair with the last of the popcorn ivy was still wearing her coat sitting poised at her computer and checking email before bed an open box of flavored cereal was by her keyboard and she chewed slowly leaning i tried to catch a look at her neck and she jerked back so i couldnt he seems nice she said her face emotionless but i could hear a hint of annoyance he is i said defensively its nice of you to pretend to like him by the way thanks the corners of her eyes tightened what makes you think i dont like him oh that is just stupid because you never like anyone who pays attention to me i said feeling my pulse quicken angry that she would try to bullshit me i liked kisten she said bitterly emotion welled and i got even more angry that shed try to make me feel guilty for wanting to move past his death i tugged the afghan closer ticked the only reason you liked him was because he got me to loosen up and sleep with a vamp i said sullenly thats part of it she said mildly and because you knew he was never a real threat i added that if push came to shove kisten would back off you used him ivy stiffened her fingers danced over the keys until she hit send with an excessive amount of force that too she admitted softlyirritated but i also loved him suddenly i understood what this was about leaning back in my chair i crossed my arms over my chest spending time with marshal is not betraying kistens memory dont you dare think badly of me for that hes just a guy not my boyfriend ivy you just spent the night with rynn cormel got a new scar i mocked i leaned forward to shift her collar and her arm flashed to intercept me her arm met mine in a soft but certain whap and i jerked back surprised hes my master she said her eyes dilating its expected but she had turned and there was a new carefully given redrimmed bite something unexpected clenched in me and ivys pale complexion turned a soft blush damn it expected hell i know you enjoyed yourself i said hotly you enjoyed it and theres nothing wrong with that but if you feel guilty about it dont take it out on me ivys long hand trembled my heart gave a hard thump as she pushed from her computer and focused entirely on me in a familiar mix of anger and the sexual domination she used to protect herself i met her angry expression with my glare and a twinge came from my neck i ignored it the tips of her goldhighlighted hair shifted with her breath and a feeling of unease rose behind me like the creepycrawly things that live under the bed that only kids know are there the hair on the back of my neck prickled and my jaw clenched as i fought the urge to turn she was pulling a vampiric aura she hadnt done that in almost a year my own eyes narrowed in anger even as i shuddered and my palms itched maybe it was time to remind her that this witch had teeth too hes protecting me she said her low voice swirling like gray silk protecting us yeah i said sarcastically so he tells me were his freaking science experiment ticked i stood if she was pulling an aura it was time to leave and i didnt like the waves of sensation that pulsed down my neck and promised more my life is so messed up i said i headed for the hallway i had to get away from everything everything hes just another dead vamp sucking on your neck i muttered feeling every muscle tighten as i passed her and that bothers you ivy said loudly i turned before i reached the hallway ivy had spun in her chair to face me her legs still crossed at the knees and her working leathers making her look coy and sleek her eyes were black and full a sudden surge from my scar spilled down my side to pool in my middle warm and breath stealing i stiffened shoving the sensation away hes using you i said gesturing angrily god ivy dont you get it he doesnt love you he cant ivy gave me a knowing look goading arching her eyebrows in silent challenge she succinctly placed a cheerio in her mouth and crunched through it everyone uses people you dont think marshals using you that youre not using him to feel safe in the narrow acceptance of your wants excuse me i barked this is about me liking guys and not sleeping with you isnt it i said and she made a mockingly surprised face damn it ivy im going to sleep with who i want when i want i want to find a blood balance with you but your ultimatum of mywayornoway isnt going to wash im not going to sleep with you just to make this work and im busting my ass trying to find a way to tone your blood lust down so you dont lose control and we can at least share something ivy set the cereal box down with a sharp tap im not going to chemically neuter myself so you can continue to hide from who you are i almost choked on my outrage youve never even tried one have you i sputtered opening up my charm cupboard to show the slew of uninvoked potions i had been working on what did you do with the ones i gave you i exclaimed ivy lifted her chin the rims of brown about her pupils shrinking flushed them she was completely unrepentant and i shook with anger you threw them out i yelled furious do you know how long it took me to make them did you not see the hours i put into modifying them so youd be in control and could separate your blood lust from love how can you know what it will do if you dont try it once ivy closed the cover of the cereal box and stood pointing one long pianists finger at me how do you know you wont like sleeping with me if you dont try itonce she mocked every word clear and precise it was as if her words took the last of my reason tugging the afghan up i got in her face pissed that i had to look up at her in her boots you are not in charge of me i said neck flaming but i was so mad it didnt mean anything i am my own person dont you ever forget it and right now id rather sleep with trent than you i turned to leave gasping when she yanked me back into the room adrenaline sang as the world spun and i found my back against the island counter a pulse of fear dropped deep igniting my soul bringing me alive ivys eyes were black they were utterly beautifully black and they pinned me where i stood from my scar came a surge that made my knees threaten to give way i couldnt look from her eyes and i tried to figure out what had happened i wasi had been arguing with ivy stupid vamp no stupid witch suddenly stone cold sober i stared at her i wanted her to bite me but not until i knew she could handle it or perhaps more accurately until i knew i could and there was the ultimatum that she had thrown down last year all or nothing sex and blood both nuhuh not like this back off i said as i gave her a shove to get her out of my way im not doing this moving with a provocative slowness ivy put her hand on my shoulder and pushed me back her grip tightening to slow my backward motion until i hit the counter again a tingling of sparkles lit through my old vampire scar sending a twin pulse to ignite the one she had given me just this spring shit i said im not doing this i said ticked and scared all at the same time ivy i didnt start this and im not going to sleep with you to share blood get out of my way i started this and you dont have to sleep with me to share blood she said utterly still i froze i dont have to sleep with her my gaze rose to meet the faultless black her eyes now were and she smiled showing a slip of teeth what do you think rynn cormel and i have been doing together for the last two months she said softly my gaze darted to her new scar and rose to her eyes a shiver iced through me between thought and action she can separate the two i thought i stammered then mentally kicked myself rynn cormel wanted us to succeed in this of course hed be helping her learn to take blood without mixing it with sex breaking old habits my lips parted new angle he said not a sexual position but a new tack to help her find control again my attention went to her new bite now clearly visible as a badge of honor of success maybe almost as if shed heard my thoughts ivy leaned closer yes she said distinctly hitting the s with a sharp sound weve been practicing all month and this morning i did it no charms no drugs nothing it was the most frustrating thing ive ever done it left one part of me satisfied and the otherachingly empty i blinked fast to try to gain an understanding of what that meant everything shifted and i held my breath as i became afraid for another reason it was too easy for me to become drunk on sensation and do something that id hate myself in the morning for but this was something we both wanted how could it be wrong ivy tilted her head and smiling sent her sinblack eyes to drop languorously to my neck making her intentions clear desire pinged through me and i shuddered knowing i was lost or found about to be broken or made whole inches away ivy pulled in my scent as she closed her eyes bringing herself to a higher pitch driving herself crazy with denial even as i stood in front of her i can do this rachel i wanted this i wanted to feel good i wanted the closeness with ivy i knew a bite would bring i wanted to push away the pain we both felt from kistens death with something real and there was no reason not to i shuddered at the barest touch of her fingertip as she brushed the afghan from my shoulders and it pooled at my feet a shiver took me born from the cooler air hitting my skin and the heat she was pulling from my core vampire incense filled me on a slow intake of breath it rolled in my soul flashing up to make her light touch feel like electricity wait i said selfpreservation stronger than the remembered ecstasy she could fill me with a millenniumold payment that evolution had gifted us in return for freely giving what a vampires soul needed to survive and she waited my eyes closed i could feel her breath against my skin the heat from her body against mine though air stood between us and the tension making the air tingle against me i weighed her obvious desire against her slow movements and the fact that she had stopped when i asked i had to be certain she said she could do this but i didnt want to make another stupid mistake could she do it could i my eyes opened are you sure i asked searching her expression she leaned closer her lips parting to say something but then her brow furrowed and she stiffened dropping her grip on my shoulder she spun the clatter of pixy wings shattered the silence ivy jenks shrilled and i almost thought i heard her growl no its too soon i took a deep breath willing myself to stay upright i had forgotten the soporific effect vampire pheromones had and my heart pounded as i propped myself up i leaned against the counter as i took a deep breath to steady myself its okay jenks i said not looking up from my faintly trembling fingers ivys got a handle on this what about you he shouted darting from her to me his tiny features were pinched in worry and i could see a row of faces at the window watching until ivy closed the curtains sealing us in a soothing blue look at you he said the dust spilling from him turning a pale green you can hardly stand up and she hasnt even touched you yet ivy was standing at the sink arms crossed over her middle and her head bowed i didnt want it to end like this i cant stand up because it feels that good i shouted at jenks and he flew backward in surprise im fine so you can take your little pixy ass out of here she stopped when i asked her to wait shes over there right now noti hesitated feeling a surge of anticipation rise through menot ripping my throat open ivys head came up and she gripped herself tighter her eyes were absolutely black and adrenaline made a burning trail from my neck to my middle oh god this couldnt be a poor decision if we both wanted it so badly right please let this be a good decision i slaked my blood lust three hours ago she said her soft voice in contrast with her sharp body language i can do this if it gets to be too much for either of us i can stop so werefine i stated get out jenks youre not fine jenks got in my face to break my connection with ivy she is trying to overcome an addiction tell her to leave if she can leave then maybe she does have enough control and you can try again later just not today not today rachel i looked at ivy standing by the sink hunched with a need so deep it hurt to see it i had waited with kisten hadnt let him bite me and now he was dead i couldnt wait for later if there was a now i wouldnt i dont want her to leave i brought my gaze to jenks i want you to ivy closed her eyes and the tension in her face eased get out jenks she said her voice low and laced with a threat that set my insides quivering or stay and watch you perverted peeping tom i dont care just shut your damn mouth for a fucking five minutes he sputtered rising up out of her way as she pushed herself into motion and came to me my pulse was racing and i knew that the more fear i showed the harder it would be for her to find control we might not be good at this right away but we had to start somewhere and i wasnt going to be the one to fail ivy jenks pleaded its too soon its too late she breathed into my ear her fingers resting lightly on my shoulders the pounding of my heart was loud and i could feel my pulse lifting the skin at my throat jenks moaned in frustration after darting into my charm cupboard he zipped out of the kitchen ivys touch became liquid heat in his absence leaning forward she traced a path with her fingers across my neck searching for the unseen scar under my perfect skin i held my breath tension rising as she circled for it this had to be okay shed worked hard to find a way around her own desires and id be nothing but a damned tease to say no now my air came in fast as her touch turned into a firm grip on my shoulder i felt her weight shift and i opened my eyes surprised at the soothing blue the curtains made i couldnt see any of ivy but her hair she was that close god what is she waiting for let me she murmured her lips brushing the sensitive skin under my ear dropping lower lower as her head tilted the blue light making a glint in her hair i tensed at the sensation heart pounding her hands slid lower finding the small of my back leaning away she stilled her fingers until our gazes met let me she said again utterly lost in what was to come i knew she wouldnt say the entire thing let me take this give this to me asking permission was so ingrained into living vampires that if she didnt she would think she had bloodraped me even if i cut myself and bled into her mouth i gazed into her pupilblack eyes seeing her desperate need raw and unhidden instead of the impassive face she usually showed the world a last strike of fear lit through me at the chance i was taking a memory of her biting me almost to death in kistens van rose and fell i could feel the tension in her where we touched her right hand on my shoulder her left at my back one hip drifting close to mine she wouldnt overstep the bounds and would keep the sex out of it if she didnt id be gone and she knew it it was a cruel game she played with herself but i think she hoped that if she waited long enough id come to her maybe she was right if someone had told me last year that id be here now teasing a vampire into biting me i would have said they were insane my eyes closed it wasnt worth the effort to try to figure my life out i had to live it as it came take it i whispered locking my knees against the coming rise of feeling a sigh came from ivy and she pressed lightly into me her grip tightened and with absolutely no hesitation she tilted her head to meet my neck and sank her teeth ecstasy burned the pain of the bite shifting instantly into bliss i took a gasping breath then held it stiffening for a glorious instant before catching myself i couldnt lose myself to sensation it would all go wrong if i did and as ivys teeth sank deeper i vowed i wouldnt not this time i wouldnt let this become a bad decision her breath against me came and went in time with the pulls of her mouth drawing my blood into her to fill her my hand drifted up to touch her new scar and i pulled away in a flash of tension i brought myself back ivy slow down i breathed needing to know that she could stop fear pulsed through me when she didnt and when i hinted at pushing against her she pulled her lips from me with a ragged rough breath thank you god we could do this damn it we could do this pulse fast i did nothing as we stood our heads inches from each other i realized my hands were on her shoulders and i weighed the sensations flashing through me to gauge ivys control and my resolve not to slip into a vampirepheromoneinduced stupor that her instincts wouldnt be able to resist ivys head was bowed her forehead almost touched my shoulder as she steadied herself her breath on my broken skin made feeling ebb and flow building on each other as she tested her will not to move i felt the warm trickle of what had to be blood turn cool and still she did nothing though even i could smell it she wasnt losing control she was maintaining it this probably wasnt the best blood shed had but i was taking baby steps and she was charting a new path and i was ecstatic ivy scented my acceptance on the very air and slowly carefully until she knew it was welcome she leaned in again her lips meeting my neck in a soft pull turning the cold spot warm again tingles shot to my middle and grew slow i whispered not wanting her to stop though fear made me cautious this was working i didnt want to tear down this new balance with impatience so she lingered which in hindsight was probably more arousing than simply sinking her teeth again her lips moved to the tiny scar she had given me this spring teasing luring we can do this i thought and i let my shoulders ease glad i was standing under my own power i let the sensations rise and fall in me as she played and i listened to my body making sure she wasnt taking too much her vampiric need to dominate was tempered by the love she felt but she wasnt letting it slide into the erotic we could do this and i wondered what might happen if i dared touch her new scar my eyes closed as she bent to me again a soft sound slipped from me as her teeth pressed gently upon the scar threatening to break the skin and then her teeth iced in my knees went weak but i kept my balance she was playing with me oh god i was in the hands of a master and she was going to take me wherever she wanted she bore down her touch light on my shoulders under the cascading sensations was something headier tingling over my skin like the hum of a power line it was our auras blurring about the edges as she took what my soul could spare along with my blood i remembered feeling it before id almost forgotten ivy i whispered the feel of our auras mingling almost overshadowing the sensation of her teeth in me it was building to a rush an adrenaline rush i could feel it there was more here than just exquisite fulfillment i pulled away from her her teeth raking my skin and setting unexpected ribbons of ice scouring my bones her eyes flashed open almost panicked ii she stammered she felt it too but she looked bewildered with a swift intake of breath she tightened her grip i could feel the edges of our auras mingling but there was more dancing just out of my reach take it i breathed and her mouth met my skin again i gasped my fingers gripping harder so she wouldnt draw away the heat of my blood in her mouth hit her and she pulled again i breathed heavily struggling for air for control my grip strengthened and i refused to collapse we would not fail because of me my skin tingled everywhere her aura touched mine the different charges raking over my aura like silk on sand as the energy of my soul slipped into her along with my blood coating her being vampire pheromones were like liquid sensation racing through my body to set it alight i could feel the heat from her own skin rising as well something was happening with our auras and the more i gave to ivy the stronger i felt it become this i thought feeling her aura slip through mine as i gave myself freely and without fear i can give this to you and like water through sand our auras blended into one i gasped at the feeling her teeth slid across my neck as she pulled away and she would have fallen but for my hold on her eyes wide i stiffened our auras werent just mixing they were one we had one aura in shock i did nothing as a wash of endorphins spilled into me into us every cell sang with the release the surge of energy from our auras uniting chimed resonating in our souls my fingers slipped ivy staggered away to fall against the table my head came down as i felt her leave me my god i groaned and with my unique thought to divide us our auras separated it was gone i took a gasping breath and slumped against the counter my muscles wouldnt easily hold me and my arms trembled what in hell was that i panted torn between laughing at what had happened and being disgusted at how long it had taken us to find it i brought my head up ivy had some splaining to do i hadnt known auras could do that but i froze as i saw her crouching by the door in the cool restful blue of the sunlit curtains her eyes were black and they fixed on me with a predatory strength shit i was fine but ivy had lost it thirteen ivy i shouted fear took over and i backpedaled ivy moved when i did her expression one of the lost i didnt understand we had done it we had done it damn it but she was coming at me silent and with a deadly intent in her what in hell had happened she had been okay and thenshe wasnt my arm came up at the last moment and i knocked aside her hand as it reached for me ivy twisted and grabbed my wrist i had just enough time to gasp before she yanked me forward leveraging me into losing my balance i went down she went to drop to a knee and i rolled i was just ahead of her move and i smacked into her feet knocking her into a front fall i curled into a ball to avoid her and lurched upright i was too slow her vampiric speed had her standing and i rose right up into her grip ivy stop i exclaimed and she shoved me backward my arms flailed and i hit the fridge pain hit hard as i tried to keep upright and find my breath at the same time my eyes watered and she slowly followed me carefully placing her boots to just miss the patch of bluetinted sun glowing through the curtain she was powerful and lean in her work leathers walking with grace and a savage leashed strength smiling with her lips closed she moved arms swinging as she crossed the few paces between us she was in no hurry i was hers stop i gasped when i found my first clean breath ivy you want to stop stop my voice brought her to a halt three feet from me and my heart pounded a flicker of distress marred her confidence why she sighed her gray silk voice cutting through me faster than i could follow she pinned me to the stainlesssteel fridge one hand forced my shoulder back and the other was twined in my hair my breath came in a pained sound when she jerked my head to the side exposing my already bleeding neck god no not like this her body pressed into the entire length of mine one of her boots between my feet my pulse was fast and i was sweating i was pushing every button she had but i couldnt stop terrified i tried to see her but her grip on my hair wouldnt let me turn i was scared out of my mind and a thought of kisten surfaced and was gone ivy i rasped struggling to see her with my neck craned you can let go just dont look at me we can do this we can do this damn it why she repeated in that same calm voice she pressed harder against me but her grip on my hair eased and i turned to her i felt the blood drain from my face and ivy shuddered drinking my fear in like a blood aphrodisiac her eyes were utterly black her face was absolutely expressionless perfect and calm she stared at me breathing in my fear and feeding her blood lust it was as if she were dead already and from the back of my thoughts came another flash of kisten id seen his eyes like thison his boat just let go i whispered my breath shifting the hair about her face we did it ivy just let go a shimmer of distress crinkled the corners of her eyes i cant she said her sudden fear making an ugly crease in her forehead as she struggled with herself you gave me too much damn it i her expression smoothed as her instincts took over i want that again she said her voice dropping in pitch it sent a shudder through me and her grip tightened give it to me now i could see her conscious thought shutting down to protect her sanity i was losing her if i did i was dead panic burbled through my soul as she jerked my head to the side ivy i said struggling to keep my voice calm but failing wait you can wait youre good at that just wait listen to me my heart pounded but she hesitated im a monster she whispered her words on my skin sending ribbons of sensation through me even now as i saw my life ending the damned vampire pheromones tried to lie to me i cant stop her voice was almost her own again pleading for help youre not a monster i carefully placed my palm against her shoulder in case i had the chance to push her away piscary screwed you up and youre getting better ivy we did it all you have to do is let go im not better her voice was thick with bitter selfrecrimination its the same thing as before its not i protested feeling my pulse slow im conscious you didnt take enough to hurt me you stopped just let go i held my breath as she pulled her head from mine to look me in the face i could see myself in the black depths of her pupils my hair mussed and tracks of tears i hadnt noticed marking me i saw myself in her eyes and i rememberedid seen myself mirrored in someones eyes before as i stood powerless and fearing for my life id lived it and suddenly it wasnt ivys lilywhite fingers gripping my shoulder but a memory of someone elses fear came from my past shocking through me a flash of memory took the place of my reality kisten an image of being pinned to the wall of kistens boat yanked itself from my unconscious twining about the reality of my back against the fridge with a nauseating suddenness it coated my present in a choking layer of fear and helplessness a memory i hadnt known existed turned ivys eyes into someone elses her fingers in my hair became foreign in my thoughts her body pressing into me became coated in the alien scent of angry undead vampire bent on possession no i screamed ivys touch had sparked memories i hadnt known even existed fear electrified me and i shoved her away a burst of ley line energy swarmed out to find her and i yanked it back hunching over in agony as the force rolled under the skin of my palms burning until i finally pushed it back into the line and let go my wrist hurt a vampire had hurt me i had been pinned against the wall someone had pinned me against the wall andoh god someone had bitten me god help me what had i almost done panting i pulled my head up to see ivy slide down the cupboards across the kitchen to the floor her expression was unfocused and she looked out of it i pressed against the fridge holding my upper arm with helpless tears flowing ivy lurched upright her balance unsure rachel she whispered hand outstretched as if dizzy someone bit me i burbled the tears coming from nowhere on my lip tried to anguish coated my soul like black tar and i sank to the floor kisten was dead i sobbed knees coming to my chin as i sat against the fridge how could i forget he washe was dead the vampire who killed him i looked up more scared than id ever been before ivyhis murderer bit meso i couldnt fight ivys expression was utterly empty i stared at her one hand clenching the opposite arm until it throbbed god help me i was bound i was bound to kistens killer and id never even known it what else had i forgotten what else was waiting in my thoughts to crush me ivy moved and i panicked stay there i said heart jumping dont touch me she froze as my reality fought with the lies i had told myself my tongue ran over the inside of my mouth fear rising anew as i found the tiny almost nonexistent scar i am bound someone bound me nausea rose high and i felt like i was going to be sick rachel ivy said and my attention jerked to her she was a vampire i had fallen and id never felt my face hit the dirt terror made me scrabble upright and move until i found a corner hand on my neck to hide my blood from her i had been bound i belonged to someone ivys eyes were black at my fear chest rising and falling she held her fists at her sides rachel its okay she said her voice low and throaty you havent been bound i could tell she took a step forward and i flung out a hand stop i can tell damn it she shouted then lowered her voice im not going to bite you look at me im not that vampire rachel you are not bound fear spun liquid fibers through me like a spiders web and i tried to control it beneath my fingers my pulse hammered it was just ivy but she took a step forward and my will shattered i said stop i shouted pressing into the corner she shook her head grimly as she took a slow careful step forward stop stop or ill hurt you i demanded almost hysterical i had let go of the line but i could find it i could hurt her with it i had tried to hurt kistens killer and the vampire had bound me bound me so i would come crawling begging to be bled god help me i was someones shadow ivys hand shook and tears coursed down her perfect face as she reached out and set her fingers upon my shoulder her scent poured over me and her touch reached deeper than my broken memory until it struck the core of my being my terror dissolved like a filmy gauze it was ivy it was just ivy not my unknown tormentor she wasnt trying to kill me it was just ivy i started to cry huge racking sobs shook me kistens murderer had bound me they would crook their finger and i would beg writhe for it i had fallen and i never even saw the hole i was so stupid i had been playing with vampires i thought i could keep myself safe but it was all for nothing now i hadnt wanted this but it had happened rachel you are not bound ivy said giving me a small shake if you were i could smell it i could tell kistens killer might have tried but it didnt take i would sense it if it did listen to me youre okay my breath caught and i tried to stop crying im not bound i said tasting the salt of my tears as i looked up are you sure please god give me a second chance i promise i promise ill be good there was a soft hush of sound as ivy put her arms around me pulling me into her and rocking me as if i were a child as we stood in our bluelit kitchen you are not bound ivy whispered and i wept tears of relief into her shoulder as i started to believe but ill find out who did this to you and then ill make that bastard beg for your forgiveness i pinned everything on her soft graysilk voice pulling me back from the brink the surety and hot anger in her cut through my confusion i wasnt alone ivy was going to help me she said i wasnt bound i had to believe that gratitude flowed and every muscle seemed to relax ivy felt it and stopped rocking me suddenly i realized i was standing in my kitchen with ivys arms around me her pull on my unclaimed scars was gone and here i was feeling her warmth her strength her determination to protect me i looked up to find her brown eyes swimming inches from mine there was a shared pain in them as if only now was i able to even begin to understand her i licked my lips trying to figure out what i was feeling thank you i said and her pupils widened in a flash a shocking spark dove to my middle there was the clatter of pixy wings and we both looked to the hallway as jenks flew in im sorry he gasped struggling with a full vial am i too late my gaze rose to the open charm cupboard and then to the vial in jenkss unsteady grip from the front of the church came the sound of keasleys voice raised in worry rachel are you okay i reached out to stop him jenks no i cried guessing keasley had primed the spell but ivy had looked up and jenks did a smart backflip ivy got the potion full in the face her eyes went unfocused and as smooth and sweet as fresh laundry snapping on a line she dropped scrambling i caught her shoulders and eased her down jenks had swiped one of the pacification potions we were experimenting with but she wasnt supposed to go unconscious it was far too strong jenks got between us wings a blur as he hovered by her slackfeatured face her new bite looked livid and i thought of mine feeling what might be shame for the first time god i couldnt do this anymore i had risked everything there had to be a better way shes out shes breathing jenks said and i took a relieved breath modifying charms was chancy at best and i could have stopped ivys heart its too strong i said glad none of it had hit me shes not supposed to go unconscious remembering keasley i stood to find him standing in the doorway awkward and unsure in his thin brown pajamas you okay i asked him im not the one with the vamp bite he said eyes on my neck and i refused to cover it jenks said your roommate lost it the memory of the last ten minutes smacked me and i started to waver i thought i had been bound to kistens killer i hadi could have been bound to kistens killer i dont feel so good i said my blood dropping to my knees dizzy i took a breath my muscles going slack and my body starting to slip i stared at the floor numb ho there keasley exclaimed and then his thin arms were suddenly around me and he was struggling to get me to the floor without bending his knees im okay i mumbled clearly not as my legs went akimbo im okay blinking i sat against the sink cabinets beside ivy and dropped my head between my knees to keep from passing out jenks i breathed and he was on the floor between my feet looking up she bit you he said silver sparkles mixing with the spots of oblivion making a bid for my consciousness i told you she wasnt ready why doesnt anyone listen to me yeah she bit me i said as things started to fall into place i freaking wanted her to and its none of your damn businessyou little winged liar his wings clattered in anger but his words died in his throat when he saw my expression he flew up suddenly unsure and i lifted my head following him kistens murderer bit me too i said and he paled flying up to the counter and out of my reach i remembered it i said finding the strength to sit up at his show of guilt the vampire tried to bind me and i think you knew it start talking pixy i cant do this anymore im playing with fire and i have to stop in a burst of sparkles jenks darted away keasleys sneakers on his bare feet moved uneasily and i stood up angry and almost out of my mind with frustration seeing ivy on the floor i gritted my teeth and refused to cry i was so messed up my hand gripped my right shoulder until it hurt the memory of kistens death heavy on me this isnt fair this is bloodyhell not fair you were there jenks i said as i wiped my face to get the hair out of my eyes you said you were with me all night who bit me who gave me the forget potion i looked at keasley betrayal an angry lump in my gut was it you i barked and the old man shook his head so sadly that i believed him rache jenks stammered pulling my attention to him as he backed up on the counter dont you were crazy you were going to hurt yourself if i hadnt youd be dead my lips parted and i tried to breathe jenks had given me the potion i felt like i was going to pass out again reaching behind me i tipped my dissolution vat of salt water over ivy keasley shifted his faded sneakers as it poured over the counter and onto the floor drenching her i didnt take my eyes from jenks as she came to sputtering you were there i repeated to bring ivy up to speed as she scrambled up behind me you said you were with me all night you were there when kistens murderer bit me tell me who did it i screamed my throat hurting my pulse was fast as i stood over jenks i was mad scared terrified he would tell me it had been ivy maybe i was bound and she couldnt smell it because it had been her was that why i had said yes to her today oh god please no jenkss wings were a blur but he didnt move his attention going from me to ivy as we took three steps to loom over him my socks were soaked with salt water and i could hear ivys frustration and anger that my magic had dropped her but jenks had taken her out not me i dont know he yelped when ivy smacked a hand on the stainlesssteel counter and a splash of salt water hit his wing kisten was dead really dead when i caught up with you he said shamefaced i never saw his murderer rachel im sorry i didnt know what to do you were crying acting crazy you said kisten had bitten his murderer mixed their undead blood to kill them both for good ivy groaned and turned away and i touched her shoulder not looking from jenks but it didnt work jenks said gaze darting between us cause kisten hadnt been dead long enough so only kisten died right away you were going to go after the bastard to make sure he was dead rache you wouldnt have survived even if the vampire was almost dead youd been bitten you cant stand up to a dead vampire you cant my jaw clenched and i closed my eyes trying to remember as ivy shook silently beside me nothing only stark fear and a throbbing in my foot and my arm where someone had gripped me too tightly it was a pain born almost three months ago as sharp and real as if i had just been slapped you gave me the forget potion i whispered to jenks why i gestured helplessly was it worth all this i want to know who did it talk pixy ivy barked as she spun her pupils were dilated and red spotted her cheeks jenks stood miserably before us black dust sifting from him i had to he backed up his wings fanning into motion when his heel hit a napkin ivy snatched for him and he darted away i made the spell myself i put it together and got your blood into it you were going to go after kistens killer he exclaimed you would have died im only four freaking inches tall i dont have many options and i cant lose you now ivy slumped with her elbow on the counter and her forehead in her cupped hand her hair hid her face and i wondered what she was feeling damn it it wasnt fair we had done it managed a balance and then my memory had to return and screw it all up that vampire would have killed you jenks begged i thought if you just forgot time would take care of everything youre not bound so everythings okay its okay rache i prayed jenks was right but a shiver ran through me as i put a hand to my neck and covered my bites god help me ive never felt this vulnerable i had been playing with vampires id believed i had been bound i couldnti couldnt do this anymore ivy took a ragged breath her brow furrowed and as she stood upright i saw an inner pain deep behind her eyes cemented to her soul excuse me she said softly and i jerked when she darted out she fled with that eerie vampire speed her feet squeaking on the wet linoleum i reached out after her and her bathroom door shut with a loud thump i looked at jenks my life sucks tired i leaned back against the sink and tried to figure it out i didnt feel good i was running on a lack of sleep lack of food and lack of understanding i didnt want to think anymore i just wanted to hide or cry on someones shoulder my eyes pricked with the warmth of tears and i turned away i wasnt going to cry in front of keasley ceri and i were arguing ivy was hiding i didnt have any friends to turn to depressed i glanced at the two men both staring at me with an awkward concern i had to get out of here jenks i said breathily looking at the saltstrewn kitchen im going to my moms keasley im sorry i have to go feeling airy and unreal lightheaded i pushed past the solemn witch and followed the creeping path of the water into the hallway i was headed for the door and i grabbed my bag in passing i couldnt stay here my mom might just be nuts enough to understand and sane enough to help besides she might know a charm to reverse a forget potion and then ivy and i were going to nail kistens killer to a broomstick fourteen my moms kitchen had changed since the last time id sat at the table eating cereal a strong herb scent was heavy in the air though i didnt see any there werent any spell pots or ceramic spoons in the sink either but the redwood smell rolling off of her when shed answered the door in her fuzzy leopardprint robe told me that shed been spelling heavily recently now she smelled like lilac with only the faintest aroma of redwood to mar it i thought it funny she was trying to hide from me that she was making and selling charms under the table like i would turn my mom in the is wasnt necessarily generous in their pensions to widowseven those whose spouses worked in the arcane divisionand it probably wasnt enough to meet the soaring property taxes of what had once been a middleclass neighborhood the afternoon light coming in the kitchen window was bright as i sat glum and weary eating cereal out of a cracked bowl in my usual spot lucky charms i didnt know which was more disturbing the possibility that the box was the same one from the last time id had breakfast here or the possibility that it wasnt my gaze shifted to the pile of supermarket tabloids that my mother loved and i tugged one out of the pile when mourning sister finds kitty litter in twins urn caught my eye below it was a short article on cincys colorful history of grave robbing and how bodies were again turning up missing on both sides of the river a frown came over me there was only one reason why cremated bodies were replaced with kitty litteran offering of mortal ashes kept a summoned demon from appearing out of place like outside the circle i usually didnt bother with it but the demons generally crashed my life not the other way around the reminder of al prompted me to tug my bag across the table i hadnt given my mother a reason for showing up and falling into an exhausted sleep on top of my old coverlet on my bed depression had replaced my fear at the thought that id been bound and the beginnings of forgiveness to jenks for wiping my memory had taken hold he had done the right thing i could easily imagine the state i had been in and making me forget had probably saved my life a witch with a vamp scar couldnt stand up to the undead ivy would find kistens killer id take care of the demons rummaging in my bag i pulled out my phone and looked at the screen i had called jenks the moment id woken up to check on ivy she was depressed he said which was workable i wasnt looking forward to going back to the church and trying to patch things up i didnt know what i was going to say despite everything i was still happy that she was there maybe we could just ignore that shed put four new holes in my neck and that id flaked out believing id been bound to kistens killer i sighed as i checked the time it was just after three and still no call from glenn or david glenn would get bent out of shape if i bugged him but david wouldnt the clock above the sink ticked and i listened to the ugly thing while i scrolled through my short list for davids number robbie and i had bought the clock for mothers day ages ago when we still thought the bugeyed witch whose gaze and broom swept back and forth in time with the ticks was cool there was a spot of white ceramic where the paint had chipped off the broom when it had fallen and i wondered why she still had it it was really really nasty my attention went back to the phone when the line clicked open and davids confident hello filled my ear hi david i said got anything yet i heard him hesitate then ask cautiously didnt your mom tell you he knows im at my moms uh no i said scrambling how do you know im at my moms david chuckled she answered your cell phone this afternoon while you were sleeping we had a nice chat your mom isdifferent different how politically correct could you get thanks i said dryly i take it were not going out this afternoon if it had been otherwise i thought she would have woken me maybe ive got the claim sitting on my desk he said and i heard papers rustling tomorrow at two is the earliest i could nail the woman to a time he hesitated then quietly offered im sorry i know you wanted to settle this today but thats the best i could get i sighed and looked at the clock again the idea of hiding in my church another night had all the appeal of painting trents toenails i wouldnt be able to avoid ivy either two tomorrow is great i said thinking i ought to use the time to stock my charm cupboard for an assault on black witches id have to move everything to hallowed ground though what a pain in the butt thanks david i said when i remembered i was in the middle of a conversation i really think its them me too ill pick you up tomorrow at one get yourself dolled up will you he said amusement heavy in his voice im not taking you out in leather again my brow furrowed dolled up i started but the line was dead i stared at the phone for a moment then smiled as i closed it and tucked it away listening to the quiet house i ate my pink hearts saved for last as always slowly my mood returned to melancholy someone had killed kisten that same someone had tried to bind me to them so i wouldnt tear their freaking head off i had worked so hard to live with ivy and stay unbound and then a faceless monster killed my boyfriend and nearly bound me to it just that fast my life could have been changed beyond my control damn it all to hell i cant do this i cant risk it i canti cant let ivy bite me again ever the thought settled into me like lead i had been living with ivy for over a year and now that we finally got it to work i get smart a shiver went through me rattling the spoon against the bowl i couldnt play this game anymore i had briefly lived thinking i had been bound and they had been the most terrifying moments of my life turning me from a confident woman into a terrified plaything with no control over the degradation her life was to become that the fear turned out to be baseless didnt make the lesson any less real i could not let a vampire break my skin again would not and i didnt know how i was going to tell ivy worried i ate the last spoonful of marshmallows i listened carefully to the silent house and once i was sure my mom wasnt coming i picked the bowl up and drank the sweet milk my spoon clattered into the empty bowl and i sat back with my coffee not yet ready to move from the security of memories that muffled my thoughts of the future there was a small red cloth bag at the back of the table that held the charms my mom had deemed necessary for my halloween costume it didnt seem to matter anymore unless davids lead panned out and i nailed the demon summoners id be manning the door instead of partying tomorrow and wearing sexy leather to give candy and cherry tomatoes to eightyearolds had absolutely no appeal i sipped my coffee and stared at my phone willing it to ring i wondered if i should call glenn if my mom was answering my phone he wouldnt tell her anything my hand was reaching for the phone when the comfortably familiar pace of my moms steps came from the front of the house i pulled back no need to worry her more than our coming conversation would i still had to ask her about reversing a forget potion thanks for breakfast mom i said as she bustled in and headed for the coffeemaker shed been looking for a coat for me and i could hear it tumbling in the dryer to air out i really appreciate you letting me crash here this morning she eased herself into the chair across from me setting her coffee mug gently on the linoleum table whose pattern was faded by time and scrubbings i dont get to be mom much anymore especially when you wont tell me whats wrong she said her eyes on my two redrimmed bites and a stab of guilt made the sweet milk on my tongue go tasteless um sorry i said shifting my empty bowl away from her sharp gaze i felt sick memory potions were illegal because they didnt break cleanly unlike amulets and ley line charms they created a physical change in the brain to block the memories and physical changes couldnt be reversed with salt like chemical changes could i needed a counterspell gathering my courage i blurted mom i need to reverse a memory potion eyebrows high she looked at my neck again you want a pandora charm for who she wasnt nearly as mad as id thought shed be heartened by that as much as her knowing there was an actual name for what i wanted i winced me my voice had been pensive and hearing my guilt my mothers face grew almost scared what do you remember now that you had forgotten she demanded cradling my coffee in my hands i tried to warm my soul the furnace was on against the cold afternoon but it wasnt able to touch the chill at the pit of my being my fingers traced the lines of kistens bracelet it was all i had of himthat and the pool table being bitten by the vampire who killed kisten i whispered her entire posture melted and sighing with forgiveness she reached to take my hand her frumpy dress made her look middle aged but her hands gave her away i wished shed stop living like she was nearing the end of her life it hadnt even started yet sweetheart she said and i pulled my gaze to hers to see it pinched in compassion im so sorry maybe you should forget about it why do you even want to remember that i have to i said wiping my eye and pulling out of her reach someone killed him i was there i blinked fast trying to rein in my emotions i have to find out i have to know if you made yourself forget then you wont like what you find she said an old fear unrelated to me simmered in the back of her thoughts showing in her face let it go it was jenks i started but she took both my hands stopping my words tell me she said suddenly what were you doing when you remembered what triggered it i stared at her a hundred dodges flitted through me but nothing came out of my mouth and as i sat there it suddenly occurred to me that i had been spending so much time with my mother these last three months not because of her but because of me fragile after kistens death i lost it then dropping my head onto my folded arms on the table and choking the tears back this was why id come running to my mother not some stupid charm i knew she didnt have i had thought with the right spell i could help ivy i had thought i could help myself but now i couldnt help either of us we had gotten what we wanted and it set us back further than if we had let it alone i couldnt look at my mom but there was the scrape of her chair on the linoleum and an ugly bark of a sob escaped me when her hand landed on my shoulder damn it i had to grow up and be safe stop reacting when i should be acting i had to live with a vampire without even the cushion of pretending there would ever be a bite between us which just might send ivy away i wouldnt blame her but i didnt want her to leave i liked her hell i probably loved her and now it was done we couldnt go back and pretend that there was anything ahead of us rachel honey my mother whispered close and gentle with the scent of lilac soothing me as much as her voice its okay im sorry youre confused but sometimes souls are meant to be together and the gears just miss ivys a vampire but shes been your best friend for over a year youll find a way to make this work you know i warbled lifting my head to find a shared sorrow in her expression it would be hard to miss those bites she said and if anyone other than ivy put them there youd be in the morgue identifying a body not sitting in my kitchen pretending nothing is wrong i blinked up at her as she shifted my hair and made a worried face at my neck jenks called this morning and told me what happened he worries about you you know my lips parted and i drew out of her reach great who knew what he told her mom but she only pulled out a chair to sit beside me her hand still on my shoulder i loved your father with all my being dont take potions to forget it leaves gaps and then you dont remember why you feel the way you do it makes things worse i hadnt administered it to myself but that my mother had taken a memory potion was news to me you used one i asked wondering if this was why my mom was so nuts and she turned her lips in biting them clearly trying to decide what to say oh hell who hasnt she said then grew sad once she added softly when it got really bad they never last forever and there is no charm to bring it all back the spell to reverse it was lost before we migrated to this side of the lines trent might have it but getting an elf to share spells is like getting a troll out from under a bridge i wiped my face the tears gone you know hes she smiled proud of me as she patted my hand tell me if you get that stingy boy to let you into his library honestly you think hed have some respect for our family but he acts like youre the enemy not his saving grace whoa hold up i tucked a strand of hair behind my ear then shifted it back forward to hide my neck all thoughts of kisten and ivy and everything were shoved to the back of my mind im not trents saving grace hes a murdering sob i put him in jail once and id do it again if i thought it would stick my mother grimaced her fingers sliding from mine when she drew back small wonder he doesnt like you you have to stop that hes going to have something you want someday like a pandora charm i exhaled slumping back into my chair mom i complained and she lifted one eyebrow life is too short to not be with the people you love she said even if it scares you she was back to ivy mom im not going to let ivy bite me again even if we did okay she took a breath to speak some words of wisdom and i interrupted really she lost it for a minute and then i made things worse when i remembered kistens killer attacking me i thought i ran my tongue along the inside of my lip i thought his murderer had bound me but he didnt thank you god i promise i will be good it ended okay but i cant do it again i finished my throat tight i cant risk itanymore a smile of relief creased my mothers face her eyes went bright with unshed tears and she gave my hand a squeeze good she said im glad you feel that way but just because you cant share blood with ivy doesnt mean you have to end everything with her shes been too good for you made you grow up a little i like her she needs you and youre better with her than without i stared as i tried to figure out what she was saying i know i havent been the best mom she said as she let go of my hand and looked out the window but id like to believe i raised you to think for yourself though you do precious little of it sometimes i trust you to make good decisions when it comes to the people around you she smiled and what you do with them just where has she been the last ten years my decisions suck dishwater mom marshal for instance she said and i stared shocked she knows about marshal hes nice she continued gazing out the window at nothing too nice to be anything but a rebound guy but hed be good for you bless kistens undead soul but i was never too keen on him two vampires in one room with a witch is asking for trouble now two witches and one vampire her eyes danced does ivy like him god just kill me now ivy knows she cant give you everything you know my mother continued as if i wasnt blushing so hard i could set hell on fire shes wise beyond her years for being able to put aside her jealousy like that its so much easier when everyone understands you can love two people at the same time she flushed for different reasons and in different ways for a moment i couldnt speak trying to process that there were too many potential problems lying in wait for me to ask you know about marshal i finally got out touching her hair as if flustered she rose and went to the fridge he came over about noon to see if you were all right swell he was here my mother pulled a butterscotch pie from the fridge we had a nice talk about you and ivy she said as she set the pie on the counter and got out two plates we talked about a lot of things i think he understands now i sure as hell do he is coming off a bitch of a bad girlfriend thats why he likes you mom i exclaimed no youre not a bitch she cajoled i meant that youre excitable and fun he thinks youre safe because youre not looking for a boyfriend she laughed with a knife in her hand men are idiots about women sometimes when a woman says shes not looking thats when she is mom they talked about ivy and me she asked him about his girlfriends im just saying that hes like you in that he gets bored if a relationship is all roses and hearts it doesnt help that he likes to rescue pretty women thats probably why he looked you up he doesnt want a real girlfriend yet any more than you do but hes not going to sit at home and watch tv hes taking you out today you both need a break mom stop i exclaimed again i told you not to set up dates for me and especially not with marshal youre welcome sweetheart she said patting my shoulder get this little fling over with so you can move on with your life try not to hurt him okay i stared at my hands circling my coffee mug speechless this was not good how did he know where i was i asked depressed little fling i so did not need a date right now jenks was with him i exhaled long and slow as i pulled my fingers from worrying at my new bites that would explain it i thought the soft scrape of the serving knife on the glass pie dish was obvious and she silently put two slices on plates and licked the serving fork still silent she set the largest piece before me jenks said he knocked ivy unconscious by accident it didnt sound like a sleep charm she said her voice sharp with accusation embarrassed by my failed attempt at tweaking charms i shifted my plate until the pie was pointing at me this wasnt a topic i really wanted to explore but it was better than marshal i was trying to modify a sleep charm to give ivy some control over her blood lust but she lied to me about trying them out so the last batch was too strong jenks overreacted by hitting her with it in the first place we were fine we had everything under control by the time he showed back up that is i finished silently my eyes came up to see only interest in my mothers gaze she set a fork in front of me her plate in her hand she leaned against the counter looking years younger youre starting with a sleep charm as your base she smiled after seeing my nod and pointed her fork at me well theres your problem if youre trying to break the hold her instincts have on her actions you need to make her hyperalert not sleepy i wedged a forkful of pie into my mouth and chewed in thought the rich tang of butterscotch was sharp and i ate another bite pie for breakfast was one of the perks of a crazy mom a stimulant would work better i mumbled guaranteed confidence emanated from her but i wasnt convinced and i cringed at the thought of what would happen if it didnt have the desired effect besides it didnt matter anymore i was going to be the model roommate and never trigger ivys blood lust again that is if she didnt get mad and leave ticked at all the time she had wasted on me but if she stayed she might someday want a little something to take the edge off my mother came to sit across from me her eyes on her pie throw in a lot of crushed lime citrus sends everything deep and you want to stimulate the complex thought processes not the surface ones okay i said my gaze flicking to my disguise charms she was the expert thanks her smile widened and she became almost teary i want to help honey im sorry if ive been so odd in the past that you felt you couldnt come to me i smiled back feeling warm inside im sorry too she reached out and patted my hand marshal is worried about you im glad youre being honest with him about how dangerous your life is more honest than with me i hope here we go more guilt i didnt want you to worry i almost whined at my pie god i hated it when my voice did that giving my closed fist a sharp tap so that her wedding ring hit my knuckle she withdrew her hand i know how deep in the shit pit you usually are but tell him before he starts to really like you mom she sighed then following it up with a glum sorry i hid behind a bite of pie im okay i mumbled were doing okay again she smiled becoming my usual mother once more i know you are we both looked up when the doorbell rang that would be marshal she said as she rose and tugged her sweater straight i told him id have you up and ready for your date by three thirty you still have time before you have to be back on hallowed ground and a distraction is just what dr mom ordered i looked at the pie then picked up the half i had yet to eat mom i protested around a full mouth as i followed her down the hall i cant i have to go home and prep for a run ive got a lead on who might be summoning al and im going to lean on them tomorrow besides im not ready for a boyfriend my mother stopped in the long green hallway surrounded by pictures of my and robbies lives images of the past that she drew strength from i could see a masculine shadow moving outside on the steps but my mother put herself right in front of me filling my world i was unable to look away from the old regret in her eyes that is exactly why you need to go out with him she said her grip on my shoulder tightening to keep me silent prep your spells later youre strung out to the snapping point sweetheart you need to do something different to give your mind a rest and marshal is a good man hes not going to break your heart or take advantage of you justgo do something with him anything her mouth quirked well maybe not anything mom i protested but she stepped quickly to the door and opened it marshal was waiting and he took us both in his attention going back and forth comparing us as we stood sidebyside flustered i set the pie on the top of the hall bookcase and wiped my hands on my jeans i didnt think it was the pie that had his eyebrows so high my mother and i looked a lot alike apart from our hair and how we dressed hi mrs morgan he said smiling and then said to me rachel my mom smiled like the mona lisa and i rolled my eyes seeing his bigass suv at the curb hi i said dryly i hear you met my mom already marshal and i looked at your baby pictures while you were sleeping she said then stepped back come on in were eating pie marshal glanced at the halfeaten slice above our heads and smiled cracking his neck he stepped in just far enough to shut the door thanks mrs morgan but if im going to get rachel back to the church before sunset we really need to go now hes right i said not wanting to endure an hour of humiliation at my mothers hand besides the sooner we left the sooner i could apologize for my mom and he could make his escape i wasnt going on a date when ivy was home thinking she screwed up again she hadnt we had ended the entire freaking mess in success before jenks screwed it up but that didnt mean i was going to let her break my skin again i had to stop saying a decision was good just because it made me feel better but being good really good really sucked oh my mom chirped your coat i think you left your bag in the kitchen too she hustled down the hall and marshal looked over my shoulder when i heard the dryer door open i shifted in the reflected green light of the hallway uncomfortable not knowing what theyd talked about my pie sat over us and i wondered if hed mind if i ate it im really sorry about this i said sending my attention down the empty hall its my moms mission in life to find a boyfriend for me and she doesnt listen when i tell her to stop marshals gaze shifted over the pictures before him with interest it was my idea a warning flag went up in me he had to know what had happened after he left at sunrise this morning i mean he had talked to jenks and the bite marks on my neck were obvious if it had been me i would have been halfway to mackinaw by now marshals gaze was on my favorite picture of me in the fall leaves when he said jenks wanted me to tell you ivy said shell be out late tonight getting her old friends sugared enough to talk about the night your boyfriend died the hesitation before he took a breath told me he had wanted to add something but he stayed silent thank you i said cautiously trying to figure it out she said shed be back by sunup he added and i shifted to make room for my mom as she approached my coat over her arm my bag in one hand and a slice of pie on a napkin in the other maybe he thinks he can rescue me no one is that stupid thanks mom i said taking my coat and bag as marshal flushed and made awkward comments about the pie she was pushing at him the cooler air coming in had tripped the furnace and i shrugged into my coat to relish the warmth soaking into me my mom beamed her gaze running over both of us i put your costume charms in your purse she said as she wound a red scarf around my neck to hide the redrimmed marks made by ivys teeth you forgot them sunday oh and that nice were called while you were sleeping he wants to pick you up tomorrow at one he says wear something nice thanks mom have fun she finished cheerfully but i didnt want to have fun i wanted to find out who had killed kisten and tried to bind me wait wait my mom said as she opened the closet door and pulled out my battered pair of white roller skates take these im tired of them being in my closet she said looping them over my arm and handing me the rest of my pie from the top of the bookcase enjoy yourselves she gave me a kiss whispering call me after sunset so i dont worry promise i said thinking i was an insensitive brat of a daughter she was scatterbrained not stupid and she had put up with a lot of crap from me especially lately bye mom i called out as marshal opened the door and preceded me down the two steps and to the walk hed already eaten a bite of the pie and his mouth was full thanks for everything i added laughing when marshal made a noise of bliss my mom made excellent pie wow this is great he said turning to give my mom a smile i felt good all of a sudden my mom was cool i didnt appreciate her enough i eyed the two vehicles at the curb my little convertible looking like a drop of red lightning next to marshals big obnoxious suv marshal i started thinking i really had to get home and work in the kitchen marshal grinned looking attractive in the sun shes going to call me if i tell her you went home do you know the grief im going to get i have a mom too you know i sighed holding my pie knowing id never get my keys out of my bag with one hand taking a bite of pie i looked at the house my mom was at the window with the curtain edged aside she waved but didnt move from the glass yeah it was probably not worth the hassle two hours he promised eyes earnest and caring and ill help you in the kitchen to make up for it waffling i looked at our cars i could spare two hours you want to take my car marshals expression brightened when his gaze landed on it i had made the red convertible mine with a few feminine touches but it was still masculine enough to avoid being a chick buggy sure he said i dont mind coming back for my car the rink isnt far away that would make it astons i thought cringing they wouldnt remember me not from that long ago sounds good i said harboring the belief that if we took his car something would happen and id be stranded unable to get back to my church before sunset i didnt know how the undead lived having to be somewhere before sunrise or risk annihilation id better keep a watch on the time a freaking demon in a roller rink theyd ban me for life for that we angled to my car and after shoving the rest of the pie into my mouth i dug my keys out and handed them to him marshals brow rose as he took in the zebrastriped key but he said nothing he courteously opened my door and i slid in watching him go around to the drivers side his pie was gone and his mouth was full when he got in with a pained grunt at the tight space taking a moment to adjust everything to his considerable height nice car he said when he was settled thanks the fib gave it to me it belonged to an is agent until trent kalamack killed him okay maybe that was a little blunt but it would help set the scene for the coming disaster tonight when we would get stuck in traffic and a demon would show up to cause a major incident on the expressway i hated news vans with a passion marshal hesitated and the way he looked at the gearshift made me wonder if he knew how to drive it ah he didnt die in the car did he nope but i hit him with a sleepytime charm once and locked him in the trunk he laughed at that the deep comfortable sound making me feel warm inside good he said as he put the car into first jerking us only once as he got us moving ghosts give me the creeps fifteen the vibration of wheels on varnished wood rumbled up through me the speed and feel both familiar and exhilarating music blared and the novelty of people skating in costume made the echoing dingy space seem brandnew wed been here for about an hour going round and round until my mind was numb and my body pleasantly exhausted marshal had brushed my hand by accident twice now and despite his claim that he wasnt looking for anything but casual companionship my moms words made me wonder if he was testing the waters together we made the next turn with a comfortable footoverfoot motion to throw us into a faster pace and when marshals hand bumped into mine again he took it i said nothing but at the slight stiffening in my stance he let go to pretend to fix the hem of his shirt immediately i felt bad but it really wasnt a date and i didnt want it to slip into one against the far wall was a huge clock and a sign updated daily stating what time the sun rose they didnt have a sign saying what time the sun would set though my tongue felt the bump on my inner lip and a flash of fear grew and died i wasnt bound i could be out on my own without ivy protecting me from a faceless vampire appearing and making me beg to be bled nothing had changed apart from me being a little smarter a little more careful and as for al i was completely safeuntil the sun went down demon bait this was no way to live marshal followed my gaze to the clock before his attention dropped to my hand at my side you want to go i shook my head as i fixed my red scarf then felt guilty i was hiding my vamp bites id never felt shame for them before but i think it was because i understood for the first time how risky it had been to get them and i was embarrassed to have been that stupid no weve got time yet being careful not to touch him i leaned closer so he could hear me over the music as we passed the speakers i need to stop on the way home to pick up some tomatoes and another bag or two of candy i ran out last year and when i turned the light off someone tied condoms to my cars antenna tomatoes candy and a complexion charm marshals full laugh made me wonder how many hed tied in his day there was a distinct glint of devilry in his eyes hey he said hold on let me see if i can still do this and in a sharp movement of flailing arms he was skating backward a turn was coming and i took his hands to steady him when he bobbled i let go almost immediately but just that slight touch had eased the tightness in his jaw now i really felt bad about stiffening when hed taken my hand earlier and not wanting him to think i thought he was ugly or anything i skated closer toward him i had an idea and i started to sweat god i hadnt done this in years but if marshal wasnt afraid to fall and get an i broke my ass at astons button then i wasnt either smiling to hide my nervousness i leaned forward to be heard over the speakers as we passed them turn around i shouted what i grinned stay in front of me and turn around we were past the speakers and his eyes were wide as he said okay and spun his back was to me and i took a moment to look at it so wide and broad dang he was tall my mom had been right it felt good to get out and do something if i didnt remind myself of what my life should be i was going to collapse into a puddle of hopelessness balance it was all about balance pushing my thoughts away i gingerly put my hands on his shoulders as we took the turn at the outer edge pull me through i said as i leaned in so he could hear me over the music youre tall enough oh he exclaimed darting a quick look over his shoulder sure weve got some straight board coming up we were at the speakers and the music beat into me along with the rumble of the boards i should come out here more often i thought yes the crowd was mostly human and the music was lame but it was relaxing safe marshal bent at the waist and when his hands appeared between his knees i sank to my heels and grabbed them oh crap i exclaimed when i realized too late he had crossed his wrists and when he pulled me through he spun me ohhhhh nooooo i gasped adrenaline pulsing as the world revolved i scrambled for balance as i ended up facing him my eyes were wide and i caught a glimpse of marshal laughing before he pulled me to him so i wouldnt go down my wheels aligned and breathless i froze my arms crunched between me and him as i skated backward i took a breath then looked up at him he was holding me i uh wasnt expecting that sorry he said softly gazing at me liar i said as the walls raced by i was in his arms skating backward going full tilt it was kind of how i lived my life you ah can let go now i said but i wasnt moving away a small wounded part of me just about dying to stay where i could soak up his warmth and acceptance his smile went soft at my awkward conflict and when his grip loosened i carefully turned to face forward and slip out of his arms i probably shouldnt have done a pullthrough but i hadnt known he was going to turn it intothat crap on toast i should have left everything as it was hey i said nervously hoping he wouldnt assume i wanted to change our relationship not that we really had one youre not bad at this i practically lived here when i wasnt in school how did you get so good marshal glanced at the torn stickers on my skates featuring popular bands from the nineties his brown eyes were crinkled in laughter and i hoped his eyebrows would grow in soon theres not much to do when the tourists leave you should see what else im good at i smiled when i imagined what one had to do to keep occupied when snowed in leave him alone rachel hes not looking and neither are you so now that youve got the job youre going to move down here i asked mmhmm he was smiling too when he looked up from the boards ive got a guy whos been looking to buy the business so its only a matter of finding a price we both like i bobbed my head what about your house marshal shrugged i rent next trip up there ill bring everything back providing its not out on the front lawn or burned remembering what my mom had said about him coming off a psycho girlfriend i winced sorry debbie i guessed remembering her he was silent as we took the turn both of us going footoverfoot to zoom past a couple dressed up as raggedy ann and andy it wasnt anyones fault he said when we straightened wed been together for a long time but the last two years have been a slowmotion crash oh the speakers were thundering out loud fast rock and i glanced at the clock she wants a trophy husband and apparently im not moving fast enough he said with only the faintest hint of bitterness in his voice not to mention she forgot i wasnt working for money to impress people but to go back for my masters i thought i loved her again he shrugged leaving his shoulders hunched slightly maybe i loved the idea of having her beside me the same things werent important to us anymore and it justdied i was glad his expression held more regret than anger and whats important to you i asked marshal thought while we maneuvered around darth vader who was struggling to keep from hitting the wall with his helmet blocking his vision success at work having fun doing it caring for someone and supporting their interests because you like to see them happy having them care about and support yours simply because they want to see you happy there was a commotion behind us and the ass buster light at the dj pit started to spin darth had gone down taking three people with him i was silent as my thoughts drifted from marshals goals to mine and then to ivy god i hoped she was all right it seemed so cold to be out enjoying myself when she was trying to find out who had killed kisten but it wasnt as if i could go into a den of vamps and demand information like i said she did the vamps i did the demons hey marshal said giving me a tentative punch on my arm you werent supposed to go all serious i smiled up at him and he added you want something to drink i glanced at the clock yet again sure sounds good together we angled ourselves past the trio of traditionally dressed witches complete with black hats arm in arm as they tried to do the cancan we took the step up together onto the carpeted rest area and i took a fast breath as my momentum cycled down to nothing in two seconds flat the air suddenly felt warmer and the music louder it was only when i stopped that i realized how fast wed been going again sort of like my life i tucked my hair behind my ear when marshal leaned in so i could hear him better what do you want he asked his eyes on the line besides to know what the hell is going on how about a slushie i suggested something green something green he repeated you got it why dont you grab a table i nodded and he moved to the line settling in with his attention on the glowing menu looking at the clock i felt like cinderella we had lots of time but i honestly didnt know how vampires did this most public places had emergency sun shelters that they charged you beaucoup bucks for sacred ground was a little more difficult to come by i slid into the hard plastic booth seat with my back to the rink the minute my mother had said marshal wasnt going to last was the minute id started getting interested god i was stupid i saw what i was doing and i still couldnt stop it but i really was starting to like marshal and that worried me i mean neither of us was looking for a relationship but thats what made it dangerous both our guards were down that like me he enjoyed some excitement in his life wasnt exactly a good thing cause i could give him that dressed in leather and trailing vampire incense but it was because of that very mindset that he hadnt given me any grief about the new marks on my neck or the fact that a demon was gunning for me he hadnt dropped me like a pound of troll turds even after meeting my mom and that was saying a lot my life is a freaking mess my dates with nick had always centered around talking or watching movies kisten had been more extravagant with dinner at expensive restaurants or trips to dance clubs but it had been ages since id had a date that was a nicely paced moderate amount of activity that relaxed as well as tired me out i wanted to just enjoy it but i couldnt seem to do it without pushing a little bit more to find out just where we were and if things had changed in the last fifteen minutes welcome to my nightmare i thought determined to stop it and let the man be i sighed slumping in the hard plastic i could be with a guy without thinking about a relationship i did it all the time there was ford and glenn and david the guy down at the corner market who restocked the ice cream shelves and had those fabulous shouldersbut none of them were witches and as much as id like to think otherwise there was a pull there that didnt exist with a human or wereor even a vampire starting a family someday with a witch would be a whole lot easier i shifted my skates back and forth my feet feeling as heavy as my mood now that i wasnt moving i could see the front door from where i was and the skate counter someone was arguing with the attendant chad and i turned to watch chad had been manning the skate counter even before i had started coming to astons in high school the guy had hair to his elbows and was half out of his mind from past brimstone use not giving a crap about anyone but good at his job the perfect customerrelations person chad could do anything up to and including throwing out a patron and mr aston wouldnt fire him one of the men arguing with him was obnoxiously tall his silhouette clear against the bright lateafternoon sky visible past the glass doors the other one was shorter but held himself with a stiff formality my amusement that they were trying to bully chad faded as i recognized the tall one damn it there couldnt be two such vile tall people in the world even on halloween that was jonathan which would make the other guy trent kalamack i glanced at marshal and seeing that the line hadnt moved i got up and shifted closer yup it was trent dressed in a suit and tie that looked way out of place with the threadbare carpet and linoleum counters the thought of a pandora charm came to me and i dismissed it i wouldnt owe him anything i dont care if youre the prime minister of my girlfriends ass chad said pointing a brimstonestained fingernail at jon youre not getting past the gate unless you have skates see the sign i couldnt see the sign from where i sat but id seen it in the past the thing was three feet by five and took up the entire wall behind him lettered in red and outlined in black this is outrageous jon said his voice dripping disgust we simply want to talk to someone for five minutes chad leaned back and took a swig of his beer like i havent heard that before trents jaw clenched two pairs of nines he said clearly avoiding touching anything jon turned surprise on his angular hawklike features sir just pay him trent said as chad gave jon a shiteating grin and dropped two ugly pairs of skates on the counter looking like hed rather lick asphalt the tall man pulled a long wallet from an inner coat pocket jonathans feet were way bigger than a size nine but the point was to get past the gate not go skating trents fair hair was floating in the breeze kicked up by the skaters when he left jonathan to pay chad his pace faltered as he saw me watching him and i gave him a little wave eyes never leaving me trent jerked forward struggling to get through the turnstile without touching it my sarcastic smile went annoyed what does he want anyway i thought wondering if this was about his little vacation into the everafter if so he was going to be sorely disappointed i wasnt going to work for him but irritating him was right up on my list of favorite things smirking i glanced at marshal he was going to be there awhile so when trent came forward with an intent pace i simply pushed off the carpet and back onto the boards morgan trent exclaimed and i spun to skate backward giving him a cheeky bunnyeared kisskiss his brow creased so i started dancing to the music oh god it was magic carpet ride and the entire place was emptying onto the rink by the time i had done a circuit jon was with him and trent was lacing up he was going to come out here holy crap he must be pissed it wasnt unusual for trent to track me down when he wanted to wave money at me but he usually had his act more together than this i made another circle my mind going over our last meeting i hadnt done anything to tick him off too badly had i i mean irritating him was fun but the man could kill me if he really wanted of course the nasty little secret of his illegal genetic labs would come out and his empire would come tumbling down but hell trent might do it just to spite me my third circuit found jon standing alone i quickly scanned the rink but it wasnt until i looked behind me that i found trent moving easily and comfortably he can skate i toyed with the idea of making a race out of this but there were too many people out there in unsafe costumes and besides id probably already pushed him to the limit the guy was a drug lord after all curious i checked to make sure my scarf was in place then slowed to let the underweight arnold pass me so trent could catch up rachel he said as he settled in beside me and i felt uneasy when he looked at my scarf as if he knew what lay under it you are unbelievable you know i want to talk to you so here i am i smiled and tucked a curl out of the way besides ive always wanted to see a world power on skates you skate really wellfor a murderer his green eyes squinted and his jaw tightened i watched him force the tension out of himself god i enjoyed pushing his buttons that he even cared what i thought said volumes i need you to come with me he said as we took the turn and i laughed the sound lost in the boom of the speakers on your suicide mission i said im glad you finally got smart and asked for help but im not going into the everafter for you forget it he went to say something his emotions showing more than usual but it was cut short as the lights dimmed and the disco ball lit up couples skate chad said over the loudspeaker in a bored tone if you dont have a partner get off the damned boards my eyebrows rose in challenge but trent surprised me sliding closer and looping his arm through mine his fingers were cold and my smile faded something was seriously wrong i loved irritating trent and i honestly got the impression that he put up with it so he could irritate me back but this id never felt his skin so cold look i said as the music turned slow and the skaters moved closer im not going into the everafter al is hot for my soul again and the last thing i need to do is get on his turf so forget it trent shook his head in disbelief i cant believe you call him al well im not going to use his summoning name i said affronted we were passing the rest area and i caught marshals eye he was standing at an empty booth with a concerned look and two slushies he straightened as he saw me and i gave him a just a minute gesture his confusion and disappointment were clear despite the whirling disco lights then he blinked as he realized who i was with and then we were past him headed for the other end of the rink this isnt about the everafter trent said bringing me back to our conversation my lips pressed together and i wondered if they would ban me again if i ran trent into the wall yeah i know its for ceri and her baby god trent if it had been anyone but quen trent almost pulled out of my grip but i held tight not wanting to look at his face ceri told you he said sounding embarrassed and making me wonder if he had been going to marry her and try to pass the baby off as his own i turned letting him get a good look at my disgust yes she told me shes my friend or used to be trents face went empty of emotion and i felt a pang of guilt look im sorry if it means anything i think ceri and you look great together and would have really pretty babies but you and her who would be happy there really he looked away watching the couple before us dressed up as bonnie and clyde rachel he said as the song went into the last barfomatic romantic verses i need you to come to my house tonight i just laughed and looked at the clock no way in hell then deciding that if i didnt give him a reason he might drug me and cart me off i added trent i cant if im not on holy ground by sunset al will know it and show up i wont take the chance tell you what though ill come out to see you tomorrow afternoon with a big fat consultation fee and youll still get a no out of me fear crossed his face hidden too quickly for me to think he was trying to manipulate me tomorrow might be too late he said his soft voice clear in the cessation of music and rumble of wheels on wood please rachel i couldnt care less but quen has asked and ill beg for him not me whoa wait up a fairyflipping moment suddenly unsure i halted our motion dragging trent to the back corner of the turn where wed be out of everyones way quen i asked why does quen want to see me the lights brightened and the popping of the loudspeaker made both of us wince its five straight up skaters chads voice rumbled out time to award the daywalkers best costume line up and aston and his beeyotch will award the lucky dick or dickette a years pass to the rink the people in costume cheered more than a few patrons falling as they shifted direction to line up i wanted to get off the boards but everyone was in the way marshal was standing beside jon both of them watching us with the attitude of not wanting to be seen together but trying to get information from each other marshal looked almost short next to the unearthly height of the obnoxious elf trent had handling most of his office affairs and i spared him a glance to try to tell him this wasnt my idea why cant quen just come out to see me i said when i could hear myself over the excitement and then it came together damn it trent i almost hissed you stupid businessman you sent him into the everafter didnt you when i said i wouldnt go anger marred trents usual calm behind him aston the owner of the rink skated onto the boards with a dark waspwaisted buxom woman hanging on his arm clearly under the influence of a bustenhancing charm theyd both been drinking but aston was a past olympic skater and by the looks of it his companion had been a roller derby queen and could probably skate better drunk than sober pain charms were illegal in derby competitions alcohol wasnt the noise of the crowd rose and fell as they passed the costumed patrons people shouting their opinions as to how the contest should end i rounded on trent before he could take the opportunity to slink out without hearing my thoughts did quen go into the everafter and come out cursed i accused you dont know what youre doing leave the demon stuff to the professionals the blood washed from trents face and his chin trembled in anger i would but the professionals are afraid morgan too cowardly to do what needs to be done furious i got in his face dont you ever talk to me about cowardice i exclaimed but trent met my anger with his own i didnt send quen into the everafter he said wispy hair floating as far as i know hes never been there what happened to him is a direct result of your incompetence maybe thats why he wants to see you to tell you to your face that you need to stop trying to live up to your fathers name and open a nice charm stall down in findlays market and quit trying to save the world i felt like id been socked in the gut you leave my dad out of this i almost hissed then nearly fell when a spotlight hit us hot and heavy congratulations mr aston slurred and i realized everyone was staring at us cheering youve won the daywalkers best costume he was talking to trent and the angry man caught his emotional balance with an enviable quickness shaking the rink owners hand with a practiced ease smiling as he tried to realign his thoughts and figure out what was going on i could see his fury at me simmering under his pleasant expression the buxomspelled beauty giggled draping a ribbon of entry coupons around his neck startling me and shocking trent when she gave him a sloppy redlipsticked kiss on his cheek whats your name mr kalamack aston was saying gesturing grandly to the watching people trent leaned past aston to me his green eyes were almost black with anger quen is asking for you fear slid through me at his formal words oh god id heard that only once before it had been in the nurses office at school i dont even remember the ride to the hospital to find my dad gasping his last lets all have a round of applause for mr quen here aston shouted the speaker squealing with feedback winner of this years daywalker costume contest if youre afraid of the dark and those who walk in it go home the rest of us want to party the music started up and people began moving to it round and round in useless circles i stared at trent quen was dying sorry miss aston said as he put a hand on my shoulder and sent his bourbonscented breath over me you almost had him beat but you went overboard with the hair rachel morgans hair isnt that frizzy have a ggood night the woman on his arm crooned as she led him away the spotlight went with them leaving only trent and me in the small corner of the rink where the dust bunnies gathered looking tired trent removed the necklace of coupons and wiped away the lipstick with a white linen handkerchief quen is asking for you he said chilling me hes dying morgan because of you sixteen i loved my church but being confined to it sucked dishwater up in the belfry i shoved the last of my spell books onto the shelf with enough force to threaten to knock over the freestanding bookcase id found there adrenaline struck through me and i reached for the nicked mahogany wood to keep it from tipping catching it i exhaled glad ceri wasnt back from her search for spelling supplies to see my sour mood misplaced anger born in guilt accounted for most of it and as i stood and tucked my complexion amulet back behind my shirt i resolved to let it go i wasnt going to go see quen it might have been a trick it might not have i wasnt going to risk it it was a good decision but i wasnt happy with it adding credibility to my new philosophy that if i didnt like a decision it was probably a good one thunder slowly grew rolled and died echoing against the surrounding hills that sheltered cincy to fade into the soft hissing rain exhaling with a deliberate slowness i sat on the edge of the elaborately carved fainting couch to rest my chin in my cupped hands and look over the small sparse space my blood pressure started to drop as the sound of the rain became obvious shushing against the shingles and dying leaves the small hexagonshaped room had a feeling of open airiness and smelled like coal dust which was odd seeing as the building had been constructed long after coal was abandoned as fuel id gotten home before sunset and guilt had pulled me across the street to ceris to apologize when marshal and i had gotten back to my moms he had seemed relieved to get in his truck and drive away pensive and deep in thought and i vowed to back off lest i turn into a needy wannabeyourgirlfriend twit i wasnt going to call him and if he didnt call meit would probably be for the best my intent in visiting ceri had been to apologize for losing my temper and to make sure she was okay that and to dig for information about quens condition she was going to see him tonight but said she wanted to teach me how to make a light before she left it was probably her way of apologizing seeing as she couldnt say the words i didnt care if she said them or not knowing they would come out when the hurt id caused her eased enough i still didnt agree with what she was doing with al but she was trying to live her life the best way she knew besides i made far worse decisions than she did with a lot less power to back them up and i wasnt going to lose another friend because of stiffnecked pride and a lack of understanding caused by silence ceri was currently looking for a ring of metal for a ley line charm she wanted to teach me but until she returned i had nothing to do but stare at jenkss gargoyle still not awake but hiding high up in the rafters and out of the rain i had seen the quiet unheated space last winter while avoiding jenkss broodbefore that ivys owls had been up here briefly but id avoided them and thus the belfrybut it wasnt until summer and the first rains that i found the beauty in it jenks had forbidden his kids from going near the gargoyle so they wouldnt bother me not that it was likely they would venture out of their stump and into the rain poor matalina looking away from the gravelcolored foothigh critter hunched on a support beam i quietly moved a folding chair to look out one of the long windows they were slatted to keep the vermin from getting in and to let the bells music out how the gargoyle got in was a mystery that was pissing jenks off maybe he was like an octopus in that he could squeeze through anything hunching to pillow my chin on my arms which were folded on the sill i tilted the blinds to see the shiny black night breathing in the damp air tainted with the scent of roof shingles and wet pavement i felt warm and secure and i didnt know why it was peaceful almost like a memory was wrapping itself around me it might have been from the gargoylethey were said to be guardiansbut i didnt think so the feeling of peace had been there long before he showed up id moved the folding chair up here this past summer but the shelf the fainting couch and the dresser had been here when id found it the antique dresser had a green granite top and a beautiful agespotted mirror behind it it would make a great spelling counter easy to clean and durable i couldnt help but wonder if the space had been used for spelling before there were absolutely no pipes or wires above or below the high roomwhich was why i was using candles to light the placebut even so i was tempted to make this more than a temporary spot to store my spelling books and stir charms when i had to stay on hallowed ground dragging everything down to wash it would be tedious though fortunately ceris spell didnt involve much in the way of paraphernalia the ley line spell wasnt in any of my books but ceri said if i could start a fire with ley line magic i may be able to do this if so i might take the time to fix it into a oneword quickspell pulling myself up from the slatted window i wrapped my arms around myself in the damp candlelit chill and hoped it was easy the cool factor alone would be enough reason to fix it into my memory ley line magic wasnt my forte but the idea that i might be able to make a light whenever i wanted had a definite appeal id once met someone who could use ley lines to hear people at a distance a faint smile curled the corner of my mouth up at the memory id been eighteen and we were eavesdropping on the is officers interviewing my brother robbie about a missing girl the night had been an utter disaster but now that i thought about it maybe this was the root of the iss dislike for me not only had we shown them up by finding the missing girl but we had tagged the undead vamp who had kidnapped her too the faint sounds of ceris steps crossing the treehidden road drifted through the slatted windows and i sat up ivy was downstairs with her computer and spreadsheets trying to use logic to find kistens murderer she had gone very quiet at the sight of my complexion amulet her tight face telling me she was not ready to talk i knew better than to push her if she was here then we were doing okay for now jenks was with matalina and the kids avoiding the gargoyle the church was quiet with the three of us doing our separate things peaceful i heard ceri come in and call to ivy and i rose to pretend to dust the shelves a fast skittering on the stairs turned into jenkss cat bounding in and sliding to a stop when it realized i was up here standing with her tail crooked and staring at me with black eyes hey rex i said and the cats tail bristled what i snapped and the stupid feline darted back out the door there was a feminine murmur of surprise in the stairway and i smiled ceris light steps on the stairs grew loud and chalk in hand i looked at the unfinished ash floor to decide how big a circle i wanted to draw the door to the stair creaked and i turned smiling find a ring i asked and she smiled as she held up a flat ring of gray metal found it in keasleys toolbox she said handing it over thanks i said feeling the weight of it in my palm rain glistened on her fair hair and spotted her shirt and i felt guilty for making her come up here really thank you i wouldnt even try this if you werent helping me her green eyes glinted in amusement in the light from the candles and something about her tonight flipped my warning flags up it was as if she was up to something her voice was casual but my instincts had been pinged and i was watching her im going to set a circle i said over the hush of rain do you want to be in or out of it she hesitated as if to tell me i wouldnt need a circle then nodded probably remembering the first time she had taught me how to scribe a demon calling circle and my aura had unexpectedly pooled out in she said and when she stood to move i gestured for her to stay i would draw it right around the couch she had gone to sit on youre fine there i said starting my circle a foot inside the hexagonal rooms walls my hair made a red curtain between us and the feeling of wrongness coming from her strengthened the hiss of the chalk mixed with the rain and the breeze slipping past the open slats was chill i couldnt shake the feeling that there was something she wasnt telling me finished i stood straight and blew my hair out of my way i met her gaze and narrowed my eyes in challenge sure enough she glanced away my heart did a little flipflop of fear i wasnt going to do another charm ceri taught me unless i knew exactly what it was before i did it finding out belatedly that the spells id used to go wolf and turn jenks humansize were actually curses had been lesson enough this isnt a normal charm is it i stated and she looked up no i sighed slumping to sit backward in the folding chair my gaze went to the chalk in my hand and i set it on the green marble top of the dresser with a tap its demonic isnt it she nodded there is no smut for this one she offered youre not changing reality youre just pulling on a line its similar to how you almost threw raw energy at ivy if you can do that and pull it back into you without hurting yourself as you did then you should be able to do this her sentence trailed off at the end and i flexed my fingers remembering the pain had lasted only a moment before vanishing in the chaos that had followed demon magic damn it back to the turn you might not be able to do it she said sounding as if she hoped i couldnt i simply want to know and if you can then you have something that might save your life someday my lips pressed together as i thought about it no smut she shook her head nothing youre just modifying energy not changing reality i was tempted but there was still something she wasnt telling me i could see it in her subtle motions my runner training screaming at me i thought of quen on his deathbed and why ceri was sitting here in my damp belfry instead of with him it made no sense unlessyou want to know if i can do this so you can tell quen thats it isnt it ceri actually flushed and a pulse of fear slid through me pulling me straight i shouldnt be able to should i i demanded and when she shook her head my gut twisted what in hell did trents dad do to me i said panicked and her eyes flashed rachel stop she said rising and coming to me with the scent of damp silk trents father didnt do anything but keep you alive you are you her hands hesitated a bare second before taking mine but i saw it and the fear slid deeper you are the same person you were when your mother birthed you ceri said firmly and if you can do a magic that no other witch can do then you should become skilled in it so you can go where others fail great power does not corrupt a person it only brings their true self into the light and rachel you are a good person i pulled away from her and she took a guilty step back mistrust ugly and unwelcome trickled through me and i vowed to purge it right now i couldnt lose her as a friend i couldnt promise me you wont tell quen i said she hesitated and i added please ceri if im different i dont want anyone to know let me tell who i want if i want please otherwise im justa pawn in someone elses game looking miserable she clasped her hands before her and then slowly she nodded i will tell no one she whispered immediately my tension dropped to my gut like lead i looked at the dresser top where the charms tools were assembled and with a tired regret for the lost chance that i could ever live a normal life i stood my reflection in the agespotted mirror above the dresser stared back at me i took a slow breath do you want to show me first ceri moved so i could see her reflection behind me i cant do it rachel swell it was as if a door had closed behind me before me was a great blackness but it was wide and sweeping and i had to believe that somewhere in my future was a happy ending this is who i am i thought with an overpowering sensation of finality wiping my hands on my jeans i resolutely went to the dresser time to find out what i can do the candle on the dresser was reflected in the mirror making two set to the side was the chalk the metal disk a spool of twine a finger stick and a vial of grapeseed oil i had my ley line textbook there as well open to the dozen blank pages at the back for notes at the top of one was a messy light charm by ceri and the pictorial representations of the hand movements and phonetically spelled latin that went along with them i knew ceri was disgusted that i didnt know enough latin to read it normally but id been focusing my attention on other things for the last few yearsand i didnt expect that to change but a class in hand gestures might have been in order well then ceri said as she nervously eased up behind me i eyed her candlelit reflection in the mirror wondering how she was going to teach me a charm she couldnt do herself the scent of cinnamon and silk mixed with the bayberry candle and the scent of iron from the bell above us that reminded me of the gargoyle but he was still sleeping when i glanced up we should tie your base ring up so we get a nice sphere instead of one half inside the dresser she added with a forced brightness that made my head hurt once its set you cant touch it or youll break the spell like any circle i guessed she nodded blinking in surprise when she looked up and saw the gargoyle is that she stammered her expression showing wonder its a gargoyle i finished for her he showed up yesterday jenks is ticked but all he does is sleep i hesitated should we do this somewhere else smiling a secret smile now ceri shook her head no theyre good luck according to my grandmother hes fine up there she had a saying that pixies are to elves as gargoyles are to witches i smirked as i recalled how jenkss kids took to ceri and how ellasbeths mother another pureblood elf adored jenks i didnt have any such charmed feelings for the lump of somnolent rock in the belfry rafters and as far as i knew neither did any other witch but then i was the only witch i knew who lived in a church which was the only place a gargoyle would stay something about the big bells ionizing the air or some such are you sure this isnt a problem i said pointing up to him no id ask to make his acquaintance and for him to tie up your string if he was awake i stared hopefully up at the gray winged shape but he didnt move not even his big fringed ears ill do it i said then levered myself up onto the dresser top and from there to standing my head was in the bell and the faint echoes hitting my ear made me shiver i quickly tied the string to the clapper and got down ceri bit the string to cut it long then expertly shifted her pale fingers to make a threecornered sling to set the palmsized ring of metal into she let it go and it swung gently at chest height above the dresser there she said backing away that will make a pretty light i nodded conscious of the gargoyle and wondering if his or her tail curling around the pair of craggy feet had twitched i didnt like spelling in front of people i didnt know especially one who had taken up residence without paying rent so the first step is ceri prompted and i pulled my attention back to her sorry i said gathering myself let me set my outer circle ceri nodded and i sent my will to the ley line out back energy flowed bright and pure and i exhaled as the forces balanced in me i kicked off my slipper and touched my toe to the metallic chalk ring my trigger word rhombus echoed forcefully in my thoughts and a moleculethin sheet of everafter swarmed up to arch to a close over our heads the trigger word condensed a fiveminute prep with candles and chalk to a halfsecond it had taken me six months to learn to do it i winced at the ugly black that crawled over the halfsphere a second later doing its best to smother the bright gold my aura had colored the typically red sheet of everafter the smut was a visual representation of what was on my soul i felt ugly as i silently scuffed my slipper back on it didnt seem to bother ceri but her smut level was a thousand times thicker than mine minus one year i thought hoping she had really forgiven me for yelling at her the gargoyle wasnt in the circle which made me feel tons better my hair was starting to float from the currents of energy running through me and i ran a hand over my curls i hate it when it does that i muttered as i found a loose strand and pulled it free for the charm ceri chuckled a rueful agreement and seeing her confident nod i took the strand and turned to the candlelit dresser i exhaled a puff of air calmer i reached for the oil in fidem recipare i said dabbing it on my fingers and running the strand through it to coat it thoroughly the hair was a conduit to keep the energy flowing into the circle and maintain the light and the oil with its high smoldering point would keep the strand from igniting ceris brow was furrowed but she nodded in agreement so i carefully coiled the strand so it lay across the ring a drop of my blood was next and i hardly felt the prick of the finger stick the metal ring seemed to be warmer than it should have been when i smeared the blood onto it um iungo i said rubbing my palms nervously against each other to wipe off the oil and blood then after checking my notations performed the gesture that cramped my right hand good she prompted easing closer attention fixed on the dull gray metal rhombus i said strongly holding back a surge of power that wanted to slip my control allowing only the barest amount to spill forth as i touched the ring a second bubble of force sprang up and the ring of metal shifted to exist both here and in the everafter looking unreal and translucent like a ghost i smiled at the blackandgold sphere hanging there like one of ivys glass christmas balls the cord bisecting the sheet of unreality as it suspended the metal the charm was in it wasnt often that i saw the bottom half of a protection circle and though i knew it was wrong to think the black demon smut marring the glittering golden sphere of my will was pretty i did it looked like an aged patina see if you can make it glow ceri prompted but she still seemed worried my life is going to change with the creation of light i thought gut clenched i said lenio cinis while watching my fingers awkwardly make the invocation movement the two had to be simultaneous otherwise the air would burn up and snuff the spell before the connection spell to bring in more energy to burn was in place at least that was the theory anxious i held my breath and watched the sphere flash before settling to a steady burn oh my god i squeaked when a dropping sensation plinked through me and settled to a steady flow the power keeping the globe burning rushed through me and i reached to steady myself against the dresser i couldnt take my eyes off the burning sphere breathe ceri said with forced gaiety and i took a breath and held it feeling the energy flow into the ball and become an ephemeral light was just too weird it was akin to a mental vacuum or what being in free fall could feel like it was the oddest thing id ever felt but ceri was smiling at me through the mirror her expression pinched and her eyes bright with moisture do you know what it feels like i said tense edgy and excited all at the same time blinking fast she shook her head i cant do this rachelbe careful i swallowed hard i could do something that no other witch or elf could do save lee demon magic and it was easy and that fast my life shifted again i didnt change but suddenly i was different a small globe of light had been my signpost i hoped it was a good portent becoming used to the odd feeling of energy pulling through me quickly i looked at my light the glow was not the clear glow of fluorescents but that of amber it lit the sixsided room with a blackandgold haze that seemed darker than the candlelight but infinitely more farreaching laying heavily upon the empty walls it brought to mind the late sun close to the horizon that shows from under storm clouds still hanging over you making everything look like it had a razorthin shadow the air full of hidden pressure and the scent of ozone demon magic aside i had created it and that made it the most everlastingly cool thing i had ever seen eyeing it i licked my lips wondering what happens if i let more energy into it rachel no ceri shouted something dropped from the ceiling thumping onto the marble top of the dresser with a sharp crack it was the gargoyle his red eyes wide and the tuft of lion fur on his tail bristled i stumbled back my elbow knocking into my protection circle to make it fall dont he said his voice both high and resonant my mouth gaping i stared at the foothigh person before me as he shook his leathery wings and settled them against himself flushing a deep black he looked at his feet and the new cracks spreading out from them dragon fewmets he muttered i cracked your table im sorry god in all his grace help me i am a clay brain i bumped ceri when i took another step back and she made a small questioning noise his color turned back to a comfortable gray splotch and he shifted his wings do you want me to fix it i can that shook me and i remembered to breathe jenks i called loudly someone here to talk to you about rent the gargoyle flushed again everything but the white tuft of fur on the tip of his whiplike tail going black rent he squeaked somehow suddenly looking like an awkward teenager as he hunched his muscular shoulders and shifted from foot to foot i dont have anything to pay you rent with patron saints berserk us i didnt know id have to pay rent i never should haveno one told me he was almost frantic and ceri scooted closer with sly amusement be easy young goyle i think the landlord would agree to a few months lodging for what you just did break the witchs table he said quizzically his big clawed feet shifting with sharp taps he had really big ears that moved to show his emotion up and down almost like a dogs and the white tufts were adorable smiling wider ceri pointed with her eyes to my light still glowing despite the distractions for keeping said witch from frying her synapses she said it was my turn to flush and seeing it ceri added its not that big of a circle for the power youre channeling if you added to it it might implode and then backlash into you my mouth twisted up as an uneasy feeling took me really why dont you let it go she asked and when the gargoyle awkwardly cleared his throat i nodded separating my will from the line i stiffened when the pulling sensation seemed to fall in on itself blinking when every last erg of power in me was sucked into the ball and the light hanging over the dresser extinguished itself that fast the golden shadowlight was gone and everything looked dull and gray in the glow of the flickering candle on the dresser poised i listened to the rain as the silver metal ring swayed slightly it seemed colder and i shivered demon magic without cost this was going to bitchslap me somewhere i knew it this is high magic rachel ceri said bringing me back to the present beyond what i can do the chance you will misstep is high and you can seriously hurt yourself if you jump into experimentation so dont i had a flash of irritation that she would tell me not to do something but it died fast the gargoyle shifted his wings with the pleasant sound of sliding sand i just thought it was a bad idea he said the power resonating in that bell is maxed as it is just so ceri turned to the window as jenks buzzed in through the pixy hole in the topmost window hey he shouted his wings clattering aggressively hovering with his hands on his hips as he looked at the awkwardly shifting gargoyle its about time you woke up what do you think youre doing here rachel make him leave no one invited him jenks he wants to talk rent i said but jenks was having none of it rent he yelped buzzing his wings to shake the water from them leaving spots on the granite did you eat fairy dust this morning for breakfast we cant have a gargoyle here my head was starting to hurt it didnt help when jenks landed on my shoulder with the scent of wet garden i felt a damp spot through my shirt and i didnt like that he had bared the sword he had taken to carrying around with him since yesterday ceri had moved to sit on the fainting couch her hands resting to either side of her and her ankles crossed as if she were holding court clearly it was up to me why not i said when i saw the gargoyle had flushed again shifting from foot to foot because theyre bad luck jenks shouted tired of him yelling in my ear i flicked him away they are not i said and i like him he just saved me from frying my little witchy brain at least have him fill out a rental questionnaire or something you want the city to come down on you for not being an equal opportunity renter you just dont like him because he slipped your sentry lines god jenks you should be begging him to stay youre starting to sound like trent jenkss wings stopped and he almost fell ceri hid a smile and i felt a moment of amusement the pixys features bunched up then smoothed out clearly flustered he warily dropped to the edge of the dresser top his wings a blur of motion making a show of it he sheathed his sword i doubted very much it would have pierced the gargoyles skin but everyone in the room probably appreciated it i dont have a form jenks admitted somewhat embarrassed we can do it verbally the gargoyle nodded and i backed up a step sitting beside ceri when she shifted to make room it was darker now without my globe and thunder rolled in a comfortable sound name jenks shot out and your reason for vacating previous residence jenks thats rude i said and the gargoyle twitched his tail in a show of acceptance my name is bis he said and i was kicked off the basilica because i was spitting on the people coming in suckup little glissando thinks she knows angel dust from dirt and tattled on me tinks titties really jenks said in admiration how far can you spit my eyebrows rose his name was bis what kind of a name was that bis puffed up in pride if weve had a recent rain i can hit a stop sign from a block away holy crap jenkss wings lifted him and he landed closer think you can hit that creepy angel statue from the steeple biss color went silverwhite to match the fur on his ears and tail and gold flecks grew in his red eyes faster than you can throw toad shit at a hummingbird poaching your nectar no fairyass way yes way bis settled his wings against himself the sound was soothing and my shoulders eased i think jenks had found a friend it was so sweet i could just barf except that he really needed one bis its good to meet you i said as i extended my hand then hesitated he was only a foot tall about half the size of most gargoyles id seen from the distant vantage of the road his hand was too small to comfortably shake even if i wanted to chance those raptorlike claws but i was willing to bet he was too heavy to land on my wrist in a proper pixylike greeting with a surprisingly small whoosh of sound bis was in a hopping flight jenks jerked back into the air in surprise and i froze when the gargoyle landed on my wrist he had gone black again and his huge ears were bent submissively like a puppys and when his smooth skin touched me i suddenly felt every single ley line in the entire city shocked i did nothing as my gaze went vacant i could sense them softly glowing in my awareness like potential unmasked i could see which were healthy and which werent and they sang like the deep thrum of the earth holy shit i gasped then covered my mouth embarrassed ceri i stammered turning to her the lines she was smiling damn it she had known the gold flecks in biss eyes were whirling slowly mesmerizing me may i stay mistress witch he said if jenks allows me to pay rent he was lighter than i ever would have expected almost not there you can tap a ley line i said still in a pleasant shock my god the lines were humming with different vibrations like different bells have different sounds the universitys was heady and deep and the one out back was a clear ting from eden park was a discordant twang that had to be that ley line some idiot had built a reflecting pond over turning it weak and almost dead bis shook his head no but i can feel them they flow through the world like blood and leak from the surface like an unhealed wound i took a breath only now realizing i had been holding mine jenks hes got my vote to stay we can work rent out later but maybe he can do night sentry duty so you can spend more time with matalina jenks was standing on the dresser his reflection making two pixies frowning suspiciously at me yeah he said absently his thoughts on something else thatd be great ceri came forward and made a short courtly curtsy im glad you got kicked off your parapet she said smiling my name is ceri i live across the street and if you spit on me or my friends i will turn your wings to feathers bis flashed black and his gaze dropped submissively yes maam i looked at jenks seeing him asking my opinion with just his expression i couldnt imagine ivy would protest i nodded enthralled welcome to the garden bis jenks said cheerfully rent is due on the first it wasnt until half an hour later when i was trooping downstairs to call my mom that i realized id taken my protection circle down after the gargoyle had dropped through it without a whisper of resistance not before seventeen jenks clutched at my ear as davids car cut a sharp right the small pixy wasnt feeling well seeing as it was noon and he was missing his afternoon nap i had told him he could stay home and spit seeds at the creepy statue in the garden with bis but he swore so prettily at me that i had invited him along on davids and my run and i say davids and my run because we both had a vested interest now that david had started a real pack hed be up for a raise if he could show a significant savings to his company i just wanted to smack some sense into whoever was summoning al and freeing him to kill me please dont let it be nick i thought brow furrowed the woman who owned the house was a witch but that didnt mean nick couldnt be wrapped up with her the day was sunny and i had my shades on the cool breeze coming in the open window felt good in my hair which was loose and flowing the skies promised to be clear and with the moon just past full it was shaping up to be an excellent halloween night if this was the group that was summoning al and i could suitably impress upon them the error of their ways i might risk going out marshal hadnt called but i hadnt expected him to i think he was backing off after our very quiet car ride back to his truck trent had put me in an exquisitely bad mood exhaling heavily i made a face no one could see whatever at least ceri and i arent still at odds i thought smiling faintly it felt good to settle that so fast and i was glad id taken the initiative it wasnt that shed taught me a new charm that made me feel good it was knowing that i hadnt lost a friendship the only thing bothering me now was not knowing what was going on with quen i hoped he was all right and that trent was being a drama queen david glanced across the short width of his gray sports car as he slowed at a crossing the sun glinted on his long black hair which was pulled back in a casual clip making him look good you should wear a business suit more often he said his low voice mixing with the sound of fighting sparrows we were out in the suburbs and traffic was light you look nice thank you i tugged the blahbrown skirt down over my knees i had on nylons and they felt icky my flatblack noheel shoes didnt do anything for me either and the purse that went with this outfit was so not me at least my splat gun fit in it david had insisted i look the part if i was coming with him if he had made me dye my hair and put on brown contacts i would have thought he was embarrassed to be seen with me its not the dress jenks chimed in yawning shes got a new boyfriend i looked askance at him marshal i dont think so he bugged out pretty fast yesterday laughing jenks darted to davids steering wheel and landed there sure hes gone now but hell be back not looking for a girlfriend my dragonflys little green turds thats the oldest line in the book rache take a smart pill once in a while huh we had had fun yesterday until trent showed up but i wasnt sure if i wanted marshal to call i mean i knew what was going to happen if he hung around and i didnt want to go through that crap again hes coming off a psycho girlfriend i said remembering the soft look in his eyes when he had spun me into him the last thing he wants is another thats what im saying jenks threw his arms up in frustration hes just like you going from one relationship to another to keep from getting bored and you are going to get so burned on this one that youre going to need skin grafts i made an ugly face at him but he only laughed david was eyeing jenks to get him to continue and the pixy was more than happy to oblige youve got to meet this guy he said hands on his hips and his wings going full tilt as he walked along the steering wheel when david turned it he was in the sun now and his wings glittered a normal relationship isnt enough for him and hes got this whiteknight complex on top of that which rachel fed when we asked for his help up in mackinaw i hope he gets smart faster than her or hes going to be in a world of hurt probably find himself turned into a rat or something i didnt appreciate the reference to nick and my mood darkened jenks shut up i said tiredly then turned to david have you talked to the ladies about the pack tattoo jenks snickered nice segue rache from one pain in the ass to another learn a new word jenks i needled david grinned to show his small teeth ive got an appointment for you with emojin cincys best tat design artist the first week in april ill pick you up april i said my fear and anticipation easing i didnt know it would take that long maybe with a little luck theyd forget about the entire thing shrugging david watched the road shes the best and nothing but the best for my first female alpha i snorted and propped my elbow up on the window as i looked out my schedule was going to be very full in april just watch jenks was snickering and i sent my gaze to the passing upperclass homes ignoring him we were almost there by the look of it and id be glad to get out of the car and take my frustration out on some demon summoners big lots i said seeing the eightyyearold oaks and shady lawns the houses were set way back and had iron fences and stone drives the harder to hear your neighbors scream my dear was davids answer and i sent my head up and down in agreement halloween decorations were everywhereexpensive and elaborate displays most of them moved a combination of mechanics and magic that had been found only on locked hollywood back lots until the turn david exhaled loudly as he turned the car onto a cobblestoned circular drive this is it he said as our momentum slowed and the sound of the tires became louder the house was a sprawling ranch with what looked like an inground pool in the back and elaborate landscaping in front inside the garage was a black twoseater beemer a riding lawn mower and little else a basket of cherry tomatoes with a gingham liner was sitting on the steps a clear indication that the homeowner was inderlander i still had to go out and get my tomatoes and i made a mental note to ask david if he would mind stopping at the big cherry on the way home black and orange decorations covered the front porch between the huge boston ferns and the greyhound statue they might want to take it in tonight or someone was going to cover it in tomato or worse the brakes squeaked as david stopped and as he put the car in park jenks hovered before me be right back he said then zipped out the window david got out of the car shutting it with an attentiongetting thump inside the house a small dog started yapping hysterically david looked good in his suit but also tired it was just after the full moon and the two ladies had probably run him hard eager to get my life back i jumped out of the car and slammed the door relax rachel david murmured as he came around the car gripping his briefcase and wrangling his shades into place i am relaxed i said then jiggled my feet impatiently you want to hurry up please dont be nick let me have made one good choice in my life david hesitated his dark eyes flicking to the barking dog visible through a window you cant arrest anyone you dont have a warrant i nudged him into motion and up the short walk if im lucky someone will take a swing at me and then i can hit em looking askance at me with a wry grin david snorted just tell me if it was demon damage and well leave if it is you can come back and make whoever it is chew his own balls on your terms but as far as im concerned this is just some nice lady with a crack in her wall yeah and im the cosmetics girl at valerias crypt whatever i muttered then tugged my dress straight and checked my complexion charm as we took the stairs to the shady porch i wanted my halloween back david rocked to a halt on the mat tilting his head to watch the dog having hysterics through the long window beside the door its not illegal to summon demons i huffed as i tucked my shades into that ugly brown purse right next to the splat gun the magnetic chalk and the heavymagic detection amuletso far a nice friendly green its illegal to tell them to kill someone rachel he coaxed as he rung the bell and the barking dog jumped up and down dont make me sorry i brought you i stared fascinated as the blond fuzz ball turned somersaults me i said coyly the little dog yelped vanishing in the blur of a swinging foot i blinked and my mouth was hanging open unintelligently when the door moved revealing a middleaged woman wearing a paisleypatterned dress and an honesttogod apron i sure hoped it was a costume because the fifties look was not an attractive fashion statement hello she said sounding like a littlemisshostess doll her eyebrows arched and i wondered if i had a run in my stockings she didnt appear as if she was a demon summoner she didnt appear as if she was in mourning either maybe she was the cook im david david said as he shifted his briefcase and shook her hand david hue and this is ray my assistant were from were insurance ray as in a little drop of sunshine i gave him a dry look i wasnt incognito here ms morgan i said extending my hand and the woman took it briefly with a noncommittal smile a wave of redwood spilled from her telling me she was a witch rather than a warlock and shed been spelling heavily lately i wasnt buying the housewife imageshe could probably slam me against the wall better be polite im betty she said stepping back and giving her dog another shove it skittered sideways and parked its little yappy butt in the archway to the dining room come on in david gestured for me to precede him so eyeing the panting but silent dog happily staring at me i went in bettys skirt swayed as she set a cordless phone on the table by the door between the huge bowl of wrapped candy and the plate of frosted sugar cookies orange pumpkins and black cats by golly she bakes too i understand you have some water damage david prompted when the door shut a shiver passed through me as it clicked smartly closed everything was clean and bright lit by a high window the hall was spacious and clearly the woman was wealthy the fact that her husband had just died of a heart attack was nowhere on her face or house nothing heels clacking the woman started down the hall in the basement she said over her shoulder this way i have to say im surprised youre working on halloween her tone was slightly sour and i imagined betty only offered to be available today as she thought we wouldnt work on halloween no one else did david cleared his throat we like to settle claims fast get your life back to normal catch you in a lie i added looking at the décor it was all angles and stark colors that made me uncomfortable it smelled like hardboiled eggs on a long table was a big flower arrangement of lilies and black roses okay so someone had cared the rapid patter of the dogs nails at my ankle pulled my gaze down and the little dog panted happily up at me as if i were his best friend go away i muttered motioning with my foot and he yapped playfully dancing around my toes betty halted at an unadorned door painted white and she turned frowning at him beat it sampson she said roughly and the cheerful little dog sat at my feet his banner tail sweeping the tiled floor like mad with a last scowl she opened the door flicked on the light and headed down i looked at david and he gestured for me to go first i shook my head not liking the bare boards and ugly walls after the open whiteness of the rooms upstairs and sighing he went first betty was yammering about something and i took a breath to steady myself i didnt want to go down there but thats what i was here for frowning i looked at sampson everything okay down there sport i asked him and he stood his entire backside waving as he ate up the attention stupid dog i muttered as i started down but maybe not so stupid since he stayed at the top of the stairs in the sun while i followed widow betty into the electriclit blackness underground two steps in i opened my purse and checked the lethalspell amulet nothing but the heavymagic charm was glowing brightly enough to read by i dont know how long the wall has been leaking bettys voice came echoing up as she reached the bottom and opened up a second door it was unusual but they might have had the vamp door for resale value i only come down here when i have to store something she said as she flicked on the lights and the scent of carpet cleaner came drifting up i noticed it was wet a few weeks ago and i ran the extractor over the carpet and forgot about it but earlier this week the crack just sort of opened up and it got a lot worse david stepped into the basement and after a quick amulet check i halted at the base of the stair i wasnt ready yet to let that woman get between me and the door it was really thick and it had a conventional lock on the outside and a deadbolt on the inside nice bet it was soundproof no one likes screams disturbing their sunday dinner seeing me there david nodded almost imperceptibly and went to drop his briefcase on the long conference table set up in the middle of the large room it smelled too clean for betty to be coming down here only once in a while bleach and maybe that spray that ivy used on the blood circles this spring the cinderblock wall under the front door had a crack i could put my pinky in running from floor to ceiling thinner rays following the mortar lines betty clustered close to david as the clicks of the locks on his briefcase made a tiny echo he brought out some paperwork and feeling safer i meandered to the cracks my skin crawled when the womans gaze sharpened on me even as she started signing papers if this was water damage then i was an elf there was a back room behind some fake pine paneling the drop ceiling was low and the brown indooroutdoor carpet looked like dirt no wonder al liked my kitchen this would be an ugly place to be summoned into past david and betty at the far end under the high basement windows an eightinchhigh platform took up the entire end of the room i looked at the crack in the wall and smirked yeah this had demonsummoning all over it id seen the damage they could do the water on the floor had probably come from trying to get the blood out of the carpet maam david said to get bettys attention just a couple more places to sign and ill take a few pictures then well get out of here and you can return to your day betty signed where david was pointing hardly taking her eyes off of me as i flicked a bit of mortar out of the crack to find it dry underneath whats she doing betty asked stiffening david took a breath to answer but i interrupted with a pleasant im mr hues demon specialist this woman wasnt the top person and that was who i wanted to talk to davids lips twitched and i beamed yes he was irritated but we had two agendas here and mine wasnt being met demon betty said faintly its state law i lied when the structural integrity of a dwelling has been compromised it must be inspected for demon damage well it wasnt a law but it should be ididnt know that betty said turning a new shade of pale david frowned and i surged ahead id say that by the looks of this that you have a demon problem betty and a really bad one this wall is bowing out not in as is typical in water damage and as you can see by the flakes i said picking another one out the concrete is dry under it well have to run some tests but i would guess that either someone ran a hose down here to wash out the blood or a demon urinated all over the carpet either one is bad news demon urine is really hard to get out betty was backing to the door and my confidence grew she wasnt going to do anything she was scared rachel david warned telling me to back off but i couldnt resist david be sure to get a picture of that window look you can see the hose right outside excuse me betty said nervously i think i hear my phone ringing and it smells down here too i added wanting to make sure she called her friend the demon summoner and not the is pretending surprise i brought out the highmagic charm it was a bright red and my fingers glowed from it oh yes yes i exclaimed looking at the crack and bobbing my head i will definitely have to report this to the demon manifestation department big magic within the last few days david had his head down and was rubbing his forehead as betty stared at me with wide frightened eyes tense and ready to run almost enough just one more nail next time youre going to try to pass off demon damage as something else betty you should wait until after the new moon for the accumulated smut they leave behind to be wiped off now you go toddle off and call your grand poohbah hand to her mouth betty fled i tensed not surprised when she slammed the door shut the sound of the lock was ominous and the patter of her heels on the stairs entirely expected rachel david complained hey i shouted when the lights went out oh nice i said fists on my hips and frowning at the ceiling this wasnt the plan david said and i heard his briefcase snap shut being a were his eyes had probably already adjusted to the thin glow coming in the sparse windows but his approaching shadow was ominouslooking and creepy yes it was i said you wanted to know if the damage was demonic in origin and i gave you my opinion i didnt expect you to give it to me in front of her he exclaimed then sighed sitting back on the table with his case in front of him like a fig leaf sorry i said and i jumped when his hand hit my shoulder i know these kind of people and the head guy wont show unless i call him out shes phoning him right now well have our chat and we can all go home and enjoy trickortreats tonight or theyll keep us here until they summon your demon again i laughed they wouldnt dare jenks is outside and im under rynn cormels protection hed wipe them out i hesitated would you be more comfortable waiting aboveground david moved to the window a dark shadow that ghosted like a wisp of fog yes how do you plan on getting out of here blow the door off the hinges my company wont pay for that ive got jenks i said surprised he hadnt shown up yet if all else failed david could boost me out a window betty was a boob if she thought we were going to stay here until they chose to deal with us i opened my purse to get my phone and call ivy to tell her i might be a little late this afternoon and the red light of the highmagic detection amulet blazed forth to make everything a nasty haze four bars on my phone i said squinting someones here already david said coming from the window and joining me at the table that dog is having a fit even i could hear sampson and i winced at his sudden yelp of pain the sound of heavy footsteps in the stairwell was clear and bettys voice was an irritating panicked chatter david if i ever get like that just slap me i said leaning against the table and crossing my arms with my eyes on the door i didnt know who was going to come through but i wanted to look confident when they did the were chuckled and joined me then blinked and winced when the lights went on and the lock turned with an oiled slickness the heavy door opened and jenks came in an instant before a slight man in a comfortable pair of slacks and a casual sweater behind him was betty in full hysterics sorry rache jenks said as he lit on my earring i would have been here sooner but when i saw tom thumbuphisass in the backyard i stuck with him tom as in imgoingtoarrestyouforsummoningdemonsinacharmshop tom arms going to my sides i looked closer relaxing i started to laugh oh my god you i said too relieved to be angry this i could handle if i could jail city powers evade master vampires and outsmart demons then getting an idiot of an is agent to stop freeing demons to kill me was going to be easy finallysomething was going my way for a change tom stopped at the base of the stairs ignoring betty as he glanced from me to david to assess how big a threat the were was david calmly clasped his hands before him and waited me i stepped forward as belligerently and obnoxiously as i could wow i said sarcastically im impressed congratulations you had me fooled you didnt even make my whowantstooffrachel list are you going to kill us now or sic al on us when the sun goes down tom pried bettys grip off his arm the woman wouldnt shut up and it was getting on my nerves you dont know when to stop do you he said clueless as ever the guy was too young to pull off the amount of domination he was trying for trent could do it but he had the right clothes not to mention the right demeanor slacks and a cardigan sort of ruined it not when you make a habit of dismissing demons so they can walk cincy freely i said and dont think youre going to saddle me with the bill for that charm shop you summoned him youre paying for it tom laughed and came farther in glancing at the wall before taking an aggressive stance between us and the stairs i felt him tap a line and i swung my purse around and brought out my splat gun to casually check the hopper david shifted his weight and loosened his tie from the top of the stairway sampsons barks grew frenzied mr bansen betty said eyes on the cherryred gun as she moaned i didnt know about the demon investigation it doesnt say that in the policy go upstairs tom growled shoving her hand off him again its not in the policy because she was lying david sighed and i beamed but they know it was a demon she wailed tom spun shouting i told you not to put in a claim you stupid cow go upstairs and take that ridiculous costume off you look like my mother the poor woman fled her red heels clacking so fast up the stairs i almost felt sorry for her sampson went with her and the tension in the basement eased having trouble with your neophytes i said when an upstairs door slammed jeez tom no wonder you wanted me in your club thats pathetic toms lips twisted clearly feeling a sting he gave his head a shake to get the hair from his eyes a splat gun real witches dont need guns real witches use all their available resources david shifted in agitation and before he could say anything i said look i know youve been summoning al and letting him go to kill me moi he said coyly that was just stupid knock it off i said taking a step toward him youll live longer tom watched jenks hovering beside me and backed up i know what im doing he said loftily he has yet to break my control really i sent my gaze to the wall what was that from the witch went slightly green and the scent of bleach seemed to grow stronger someone got careless he said not dropping his eyes and you got a promotion i guessed pity came from nowhere god it was right in front of him and he still didnt get it tom you are so stupid im a visionary he countered youre a walking corpse al is playing with you you think your little circle is going to keep you safe i said pointing at the stage ive circled him every time you sent him to me it doesnt matter what you told him to do after i catch him hes mine at that point and what if i send him back to you instead of the everafter huh how about that think youd enjoy trying to catch him in this little hideyhole of a pit youre summoning him into or maybe hell find you in the shower or asleep the witch blanched behind him david padded with all the stealth of an alpha wolf to the stairs to protect my escape jenks was with him making me feel doubly secure didnt think about that didja i said to knock the precariousness of his situation home i was a good girl but i didnt have to be id sent al back to his summoner before you little pissant i said bitterly not liking that tom was probably going to make me do it again you dont want to play this game with me really you dont tom drew himself up and david tensed i couldnt let him think he had the upper hand and after a look at david to tell him i wasnt close to being stupid i got in toms face stop summoning him i said tapping a line so my hair would float ominously if al shows up to bother me im sending him back and youll be cleaning up more than one person hitting a cement wall got it shaking inside i turned to leave glad david had the stairs and tell betty not to expect a check for the damage either her insurance doesnt cover demons sampson was barking from somewhere as i stomped up the stairs jenks a quiet hum before me and davids steps soft behind i felt like the cream filling in a cookie my brain full of fluff and nonsense what in hell was i doing telling tom id send al back at him tom wouldnt have a chance hed be dead in thirty seconds why am i giving him an ounce of thought hes sending al to kill me i got halfway through the sterile house done in pastels and sharp corners before sampson was at my heels panting for attention did she buy you because you matched the couch i said bitterly and the little dog yapped his tail putting out enough motion to power cincy for a year struck by a sudden thought i hesitated at the front door to look at my highmagic amulet it was green he was just a dog what a nasty little rat chaser jenks said from the security of my shoulder as i wiggled my foot to keep him inside when david opened the door hes a saint in fur for putting up with that woman i said wanting to pick him up and take him home i didnt even like dogs giving him a last look i stifled my desire to pat him on the head and just shut the door david was eyeing me questioningly and ignoring it i schlumped down the stairs and to the car i wanted to get out of here before tom found his balls and started after me in a bad mood i got in davids car fastened my belt and stared out the front window waiting both david and jenks were unusually silent hesitant almost as they got in what i snapped and jenks let a little dust slip from him to color davids shoulder david shrugged and after glancing at jenks he said you okay i looked at the house and saw sampson sitting at the long window tail still going no the were took a breath as he started the car up and put it into drive i hope he doesnt call your bluff silently i stared at the halloween decorations so i wouldnt have to think uh it was a bluff right david prompted and when jenkss wings hummed nervously i put on a fake smile duh yeah it was a bluff i said and jenkss wings took on a more normal translucence but even as i busied myself with changing davids radio from country to something a little more radical a part of me worried it might not be but at least it hadnt been nick eighteen i held the black lace top up against me over my black tshirt knowing it would take that bustenhancing charm of mine to fill it out properly and make the thicker lace land in the proper strategically placed spots it wasnt worth the risk of embarrassment if i had an amulet malfunction and so i put it back on the rack reaching instead for something more substantial smiling i pulled out a silky silverandblack top that would drape fantastically on me falling right to the top of my hiphugger jeans it was a mix of casual sophistication and daring modesty that kisten would have approved of recalling his blue eyes i held my smile though it went decidedly melancholy as i considered the blouse i didnt need it i wasnt going anywhere fancy anytime soon ivy drifted up from the next rack over her motions edged into vamp speed as she concentrated shuffling through the clothes using a rating system i had no concept of we had always enjoyed shopping together but when id suggested that we go out this afternoon she had agreed with surprising reluctance i think she knew i was trying to lull her into a good mood before i tried talking to her about yesterday morning she still hadnt given me any sign of being ready to discuss it but the longer it took the more lame my reasoning would sound shopping together wouldnt get her anywhere near a good enough mood to calmly accept my vow that she would never break my skin again but i had to start somewhere much as i hated it i had to grow up i couldnt risk my life anymore for something as fleeting as ecstasy even if it fostered a stronger relationship with ivy the fact that we had brought everything back down to normal before jenks butted in had lost much of its impact seeing as i had had to hurt her before she could regain control of her blood lust jenks had been right that she wasnt ready and i wasnt going to risk having to hurt her again she had done better fantastically so but ivys instincts were still stronger than her will that alone wouldnt have been enough to sway my decisionwhat had forced my decision was that terrifying thirty seconds of me thinking id been bound i had to start making smart crushing decisions in a perfect world maybe we could have done what we wanted without consequence but it wasnt a perfect world just like in a perfect world id have been able to go out tonight but the reality was i couldnt chance it i didnt trust tom to be smart and being smart sucked i thought glumly as i looked at the silvery black top i had a lot more fun when i was stupid i glanced at ivy whose brow was furrowed maybe after coffee and cookieswith a pint of doublechocolate monkey ice cream nearby in case of emergency this is nice ivy said as she held up the same bit of black lace i had just put back not for my costume but i still like it try it on i prompted and she turned to the nearby dressing room with it my smile faded when she disappeared behind the door but we could still talk since her head showed tired i flopped into the cushy chairs they had for bored boyfriends and stared at the ceiling the long length of my neck pulled at the healing bites and i shifted the complexion amulet to make sure it was in place ivy silently pulled her shirt over her head and put the new one on the music from the shop next door thumped like a heart and i glanced around the moderately busy trendy mall store no one had rushed to help us after ivy glared at the first woman who said hello and for that i was grateful how on earth was i going explain to ivy that the past year had been a waste of her time and that she was never going to get her teeth in me again even if our auras had blended at the very least shed get mad and then leave and then jenks would kill me maybe if i ignored everything it might go away it sounded like a good ideawhich meant it wasnt the dressing room door squeaked as ivy came out her expression was hopeful as she posed for me and just that faint glimmer of softer emotion in her eyes turned her beautiful damn girl you look great i said enthusiastically thinking she would look good in anything with the faint hesitant smile she now wore the top hung perfectly on her and the black lace stood out in sharp contrast to her pale skin you have got to get it it was made for you i nodded to further my approval it was the perfect vampire tease of lace and skin i couldnt get away with wearing it but ivy oh yeah ivy looked down at the black lace barely covering a few key places a glimmer of silver and red showed where her belly button ring was and her hand rose to her neck to hide the low scar cormel had put there i couldnt help but wonder who she was thinking of as she murmured its nice nice nice nice everything is freaking nice i didnt watch when she turned and went back into the dressing room youre not getting anything she asked over the door as the ripping sound of velcro tore through the pounding music this is the third shop and you havent even tried anything on reclining in the soft leather i looked at the ceiling budget i said simply ivys silence brought my gaze down and i saw her looking at my neck a painful selfrecrimination pinching her brown eyes you dont trust me she said out of the blue and her motions mostly hidden behind the door stopped you dont trust me and youre ashamed of me and i dont blame you you had to hurt me to get me to stop id be ashamed of me too tension jerked through me and i sat upright two nearby shoppers turned toward us and i stared blankly at ivy what in hell i said i could do it and i failed ivy said her shoulders were bare and her motions were fast and jerky as she roughly put her tshirt back on i stood scrambling to figure out what was going on i shouldnt have taken her shopping i should have gotten her drunk you didnt fail god ivy sure you lost it but you caught it again dont you even remember what happened her back was to me as she returned the lacy chemise to its hanger and i retreated when she came out it had beenfantastic but it isnt going to happen again she must have seen it in my face ivy stood stockstill before me with the lace top on a hanger perfectly arranged and ready for the next person then why are you ashamed of me she said softly her fingers shaking im not silent she pushed past me to hang the shirt where shed found it with a sharp clink and headed for the door ivy wait i started after her ignoring the idiot of a clerk cheerfully telling us to come back for the big sale tomorrow the spell checker at the entryway made a blip at my complexion charm but no one stopped me ivy was already a store down her hair was shimmering in the sun coming through the skylights and i jogged to catch up typical ivy running away from the emotional stuff not this time ivy stop i said as i caught up what the turn gave you that idea im not ashamed of you god im thrilled at the control you found did you not see how much better you did not that it makes any difference in my decision head down she slowed and halted people flowed around us but we were alone i waited until she looked up and the pain in her eyes was almost scary youre hiding your bites she said in a low voice youve never done that before never it was she sank down on the bench beside us and looked at the floor why else would you hide my mark unless youre ashamed of me i said i could handle it and i couldnt you trusted me and i failed oh my god embarrassment warmed my cheeks as i realized the message id been sending my hand came up and i pulled the amulet over my head tugging my hair as it pulled free why in hell didnt cormels book have anything useful in it im not ashamed of you i said throwing the charm into a nearby trash can i lifted my chin as i felt the spell leave me and my redrimmed bites appear i hid them because im ashamed of me i have been living my life like a freaking kid with a video game and it took me thinking i was bound to kistens killer to realize what im doing thats why i was hiding them not because of you her brown eyes were dark with tears she would never shed as she blinked up at me you had to slam me into a wall to get me to stop im sorry for slamming you into a wall i said wanting to touch her arm so she knew how bad i felt instead i sat down beside her our knees almost touching as i faced her ithought you were kistens killer her expression was pained and i got mad i was having a freaking flashback ivy i exclaimed im sorry ivys jaw clenched and relaxed thats what im saying she said bitterly you thought i was kistens killer how bad is that rachel when i turn into something so close to kistens murderer that it triggers a memory ofthat oh i slumped back against the hard bench and put a hand to my head as it started to hurt he was playing on my scar ivy so were you my back was to the wall and i was scared both times thats all it was it wasnt you it was the vampire stuff she turned to me though i was still looking down the hall he she asked i felt my focus blur as i thought about that weighing what little memory i had regained against my emotions yeah i said softly it was a man a man attacked me i could almost smell him a mix of cold and stone old dust cold like cement ivy wrapped her arms around herself and took a deep breath a man she said and i noticed her long fingers were clenched about her upper arms with a whiteknuckle strength i thought it might have been me she stood up with her head bowed and i followed her silent we angled to a coffee cart in an unspoken agreement and i felt for the presence of my bag i told you it wasnt you months ago her posture was heavy with relief and her fingers shook as she fixed two cups of coffee handing me one after i paid the woman at the register it was a comfortable pattern and i took a sip as we slowly started down the busy corridor for the car ivys posture had shifted as if a huge doubt had been removed from her soul along with the amulet around my neck i could walk away from this and leave everything as it was but i had to tell her now to wait would make me a coward ivy jenks is going to kill me she said giving me a quick sideways look there was a hint of moisture in her eyes and she smiled bitterly as she wiped it away youre leaving arent you oh my god when ivy got it wrong she really got it wrong i didnt need a boyfriend i had all the drama i could stand right here ivy i said softly as i pulled her to a stop among the oblivious people around us sharing that with you was the most intoxicating thing ive ever felt when our auras chimed i swallowed hard having to be honest with her about the good as well as the bad it was as if i knew you better than myself the love i sniffed and wiped my nose damn it im crying i said miserably ivy as good as that felt i cant do that again thats what ive been trying to say i cant let you break my skin again not because you lost it or because i dont trust you but because i looked up at the ceiling unable to look at her because i thought i was bound to a vampire and it was the most frightened ive ever been in my life i laughed bitterly and ive had some pretty scary shit to dig myself out of then you are leaving no but i wont blame you if you want to i stood where we were in the filtered sun searching for words so simple that they couldnt be misinterpreted or misunderstood im sorry i breathed but i knew she could hear me over the surrounding chatter of commerce i wasnt leading you on i like youhell i love you probablybut i gestured helplessly seeing her expression dark with emotion when i found the courage to meet her eyes kisten died because i was living my life like it had a reset button he paid the price for my stupidity i cant keep combining the risk of death with the joy ofcaring and love im not going to ever share that with you again i hesitated no matter how good it feels i cant keep living like that i risked everything to gain nothing she interrupted bitterly and i shook my head not nothing everything i risked everything yesterday to gain everything but it was an everything that i cant have and still keep what i love the most she was listening thank you god i think i can say it now the church jenks you i said you as you are me as i am i like me ivy i like things the way they are and if you bite me again i shivered and gripped my coffee tighter it felt so good i whispered lost in the memory of it id let you bind me if you asked just so i would have that forever id say yes and then you wouldnt be you anymore ivy said and i nodded ivy went silent i felt drained id said what i had to say i only hoped we could find a way to live with it you dont want me to leave ivy said and i shook my head and you dont want me to bite you she added looking at the coffee clasped between her hands no i said i cant let you bite me theres a difference she was smiling thinly when she brought her gaze to mine and i couldnt help but meet it with my own weak version there is isnt there she said her posture shifted and she exhaled long and slow thank you she whispered i froze when she hesitantly touched my arm and then drew back thank you for being honest thank you i stared at her i thought youd be pissed she wiped her face and put her attention on the skylights to make her pupils contract part of me is she said lightly my pulse quickened and my grip tightened on my cup sensing my movement ivy looked at me the ring of brown around her pupils was shrinking but she was still smiling but you arent leaving wary i nodded this isnt me playing hard to get i mean it ivy i cant her shoulders lost their stiffness and she half turned to look at the people around us i know i saw how scared you were when you thought you were bound someone tried to bloodrape you i recalled my terror how she had comforted me with security and understanding telling me it was okay what we had shared in those brief moments was almost stronger than the blood ecstasy maybe thats what she was getting at maybe thats what was important here shoulders slumped in an unusual show of fatigue she leaned forward with her hair almost brushing my shoulders she whispered if you arent staying because i might bite you then you are staying because you like me taking a sip of coffee she started down the hall pace confident and slow my mouth opened in an o and i jumped to follow uh wait a moment ivy still she smiled you like me not the way the damned vampire pheromones make you feel when i bite you i can get blood from anyone but if you keep saying no then its me you like knowing that is worth the frustration she took the lid off her coffee and threw it away as we passed a trash can i tried to watch her face and my footing to keep from knocking anyone as we neared the main doors and the traffic increased her expression was calm and peaceful the lines of worry and uncertainty that had looked so wrong there were gone she had found peace it might not be the peace she wanted but it was peace i though was never one to leave anything alone soare we okay ivys smile was full of private emotion free arm swinging confidently she parted the way with her sheer presence and people turned to look at her yeah she said looking ahead my pulse was fast and i felt the tension pulling me stiff ivy shhhhh she breathed and i jerked to a halt when she stopped at the doors and turned to put a finger to my lips her eyes were inches from mine and i stared at them shocked dont ruin it rachel she added drawing away leave me with a little makebelieve to keep myself sane across the hall from you im not going to sleep with you i said wanting to make that perfectly clear and the man coming in gave us a onceover yeah i know she said lightly pushing the door open she went outside how was your run with david yesterday i looked at her suspiciously as we stepped into the sun not trusting this david wants me to get a pack tattoo i said cautiously as i pulled the windblown hair from my mouth so what are you getting she said cheerfully a bat as i walked beside her and told her what i had in mind while we searched for my car i realized how much our failed blood tryst had been preying on her she had royally messed up she had thought id been ashamed of her and was going to leave but we were still friends and nothing had changed but as we got into my car and put the top down to enjoy the sun i found my fingers creeping up to feel the redrimmed bites still swollen and sore recalling the sensation of our auras becoming one i shivered well almost nothing had changed nineteen the crack of pool balls was pleasant reminding me of early mornings at kistens dance club while i waited for him to finish up with the stragglers and spend some time with me eyes shut against the heat of the overhead light i could almost smell the lingering aroma a hundred partying vampires left behind mixing with good food good wine and just a hint of brimstone no i didnt have a problem i wasnt addicted at all nope not me but when i opened my eyes and saw ivy i wondered doesnt matter i thought as i went to take my shot and felt the skin around the marks ivy had put in me pull this afternoon i might have been scared to tell ivy she wasnt going to break my skin again but id done it and it felt good like we had really made progress even though neither of us was going to get what we wanted warming i focused on the yellowstriped nine as i lined the shot up so it was halloween and i was stuck home in jeans and a red top handing out candy instead of wearing leather and lace barhopping with ivy at least i was with friends holding to my new smartbutdullrachel mission statement i wasnt ready to trust tom to do the intelligent thing and though i was regularly stepping off hallowed ground to raid the fridge risking a roomful of drunk potential casualties just so i could have a fun night out was a little much ivy agreed not at all surprised when i told her tom bansen of the iss arcane division was the one summoning and releasing al to kill me actually she laughed noting least it wasnt crapforbrains i was still toying with the idea of filing a demon complaint with the is if only to avoid that spell shop bill but ivy said it would be cheaper healthwise to let sleeping demons lie if nothing happened this next week i might let it go but if al came at me again i was going to let tom have it right where it hurtin the checkbook apart from the annoyance of being stuck home on halloween i was in a good mood jenks and i were manning the door and ivy was in the corner watching a postturn comedy classic with lots of chainsaws and a stump grinder marshal hadnt called but after yesterday i wasnt surprised my mild disappointment only affirmed my belief that i needed to back off before he slipped into boyfriend status i really didnt need the trouble exhaling i tapped the cue ball it hit the dip by the corner and wobbled into the nine hitting it perfectly wrong the doorbell bonged as i straightened followed by a chorus of trick or treat from under a ceiling of paper bats ivys eyes flicked to mine and i jerked into motion got it i said as i propped the cue stick against the wall and headed into the dark foyer with the huge bowl of candy ivy had filled the unlit entryway with candles to make it suitably creepy we had turned the lights off in the sanctuary before midnight to impress the human kids but now it was all inderlanders and we didnt bother a dark candlelit church didnt impress them half as much as a bowl of sugar and chocolate jenks i questioned and a tight wing hum hit my ear ready he said then let out an unreal wing chirp to pantomime a squeaky hinge when i opened the door it was enough to make my teeth hurt and the assembled kids complained loudly as they covered their ears damn pixy was worse than a weres nails on a chalkboard trick or treat the kids chimed out when they recovered but it wasnt until they saw jenks glowing over the candy bowl that their expressions lit in delight as charmed as the next person by a peopleloving pixy i had to crouch so the littlest one in a fairy costume with illusionary wings could reach she was sweet wideeyed and eager it was probably the first halloween she would remember and i now understood why my mom loved manning the door watching the parade of costumes and delighted kids was well worth the sixty bucks id spent on candy ring the bell ring the bell a kid in a dragon costume demanded as he pointed to the ceiling and after i set the bowl aside i reached for the pull grunting as i yanked the knot almost to my knees they stared at me in the surprising silence as the rope was jerked back up an instant later a deep bong reverberated over the neighborhood the kids squealed and clapped and i shooed them off the stoop wondering how bis was handling the noise in the distance i heard the faint sound of two more bells from neighboring churches it was a good feelinglike a distant affirmation of safety and communityand i watched the kids file down to the street to join their moms with strollers and wagons in the street vans prowled creeping slowly amid the flashing lights and flapping costumes jenkss carved pumpkin glowed at the base of the stairs like als face itself damn i loved halloween smiling i waited with the door open until jenks finished lighting the stairs for the youngest across the street keasley was sitting on his porch alone to hand out candy ceri had left at sunset for the basilica to pray for quen walking the distance as if in penance my brow pinched and as i shut the door i wondered if things were really that bad maybe i shouldnt have refused to see him after all ivy you want a game i asked tired of hitting the same balls around she at least could sink them she looked up and shook her head there was a clipboard on her drawnup knees as she sat with her back to the arm of the couch a broken mug filled with colored pencils was next to her and she was trying to force spreadsheets and flowcharts to give us the answer as to who killed kisten my realization that it had been a man had revitalized her and her night investigating yesterday had turned up only that piscary had given kisten to someone outside the camarilla that meant wed be looking for kistens killer outside the city since piscary wouldnt have given him to a lesser local vampire it was only a matter of time though before wed know who it had been when ivy set her sights on prey she never let go no matter how long it took i ambled over to bug ivy since it was her favorite part of the movie and she needed a break just one game i prodded ill rack em ivys brown eyes were peaceful as she curled her feet under her im working make jenks big and play with him i lifted my eyebrows and from behind me at the desk still blissfully empty of his kids came jenkss bark of rude laughter make me big he scoffed no fairyloving way ivys attention slid to my wrist where kistens bracelet had been for the last three months when i handed her the cue it immediately flicked back to me accusing and i tightened my jaw you took off kistens bracelet my pulse increased and i let go of the cue stick i took it off i admitted feeling the same flash of grief that i had worked through this afternoon when i had placed it in my jewelry box and shut the lid i didnt throw it away theres a difference think about it i finished belligerently from behind me came a soft uh ladies as jenks flitted nervously between us he had no clue what we had talked about while shopping all he knew was we had left tense and returned with a jar of honey for him and a roll of wax paper for the kids to slide down the steeple on and thats all he was going to know ivys expression softened and then she looked away in understanding i hadnt thrown the bracelet away id set it aside in memory one game she said as she rose sleek and lanky in her exercise outfit and the long baggy sweater she hid half her body behind i dropped the chalk into her hand i rack you break the doorbell rang and ivy sighed ill rack them she said you get the door jenks stayed with ivy and content i swatted aside a lowhanging bat and grabbed the candy bowl feeling all was right with the world i pushed the door open only to have my good mood fade in a flash of annoyance trent it had to be him he looked his usual self apart from the fact that he was wearing a baggy suit that was three inches too long and shoes that gave him an extra two inches in height obviously he had been in costume my eyes flicked to the kalamack for city council button and he reddened a sports car idled at the curb its hazard lights flashing and the door open trents gaze went from the bats behind me to the bruises decorating the underside of my jaw where al had gripped me and finally to my new redrimmed bites maybe hed think they were a costume maybe what the sweet sugar candyass do you want i said in irritation then stepped out of his reach in case it was al in disguise my thoughts winged back to quen and i fought with the urge to demand that he tell me if quen was all right and the desire to call the fib and tell them i was being harassed by a trent lookalike i had already said no he wasnt going to change my mind jenks had darted up at my exclamation and his wings took on a faint orange glow as his circulation increased hey ivycome here for a sec i know how you like watching rache kick the bad guys to the curb a trio of witches with glowing wands chattering madly dodged jenkss pumpkin and ran up the stairs shouting trick or treat looking pained trent brushed his hair from his eyes and stood aside clearly agitated ivy slid up behind me and i handed the bowl to her when the three boys left amid thankyous prompted by their moms on the sidewalk they jumped the last two steps and i put my fist on my hip eager to tell trent to shove it i want you to come with me he said before i could speak his voice terse and his attention darting to ivy a hundred rude responses came from nowhere but what i said was no go away i moved to close the door shocked when trent put his foot in the way i stopped ivys reach to shove him back and trents tanned face reddened then with what must have been a herculean effort he pulled his foot back and said in a much softer voice why do you have to be difficult it keeps me alive i shot back but in this case its fun too im busy tonight get off my front steps so the kids can get up here how on earth had jonathan let him come out here on his own trent seldom had an entourage but id never seen him alone i shooed him off the steps and his face took on a whisper of fear please jenks rose up in a column of gold sparkles sweet daisies i think im going to crap my silk undies the cookie maker said please trents eyes glinted in annoyance please im asking im here for quen not myself and most definitely not you i took a breath to answer but jenks was way ahead of me go suck a slug egg he snarled unusually defensive rachel doesnt owe quen anything actually i sort of didseeing as he saved my butt last year with piscaryand the beginnings of shame trickled through me damn it if i didnt go visit quen i was going to feel guilty the rest of my life i really hated this growingup thing ivy crossed her arms and cocked her hip trent dropped his gaze steadying himself when he brought his attention back to me i saw a glimmer of fear not for himself but for quen he isnt going to live through the night he said the calling children in the street a macabre contrast to his words he wants to speak to you please jenks saw me hesitate and in a burst of anger he lit my shoulder with gold sparkles hell no rachel he just wants to get you off hallowed ground so al can kill you i winced thinking quen had given me information before and people did weird stuff on their deathbed last confessions that kind of thing i knew i should stay on hallowed ground but id been on and off it all night i was going to go i had to quen had known my dad this might be my last and only chance to find out about him ivy saw it in my face and she grabbed her coat from the peg im going with you my pulse quickened and trents expression turned confused at my change of heart ill get your keys jenks said well take my car ivy countered turning to get her purse no trent said stopping her cold only her no pixies no vampires just her majorly ticked ivy looked him up and down the two were going to be at each others throats before we hit the sidewalk even if trent did give in and let her come none of you are coming i said firmly trent doesnt live on hallowed ground which is exactly why we are going ivy interrupted and i can take care of myself easier if im not worrying about you i took a deep breath my hand coming up to forestall another protest tom isnt going to summon al hes afraid ill send him right back at him trent blanched and i shot him a dry look ill get my stuff i said then darted to the kitchen ivy and jenks were having a hushed argument in the corner when i returned to the foyer and while trent watched in silence i made a point of pulling out my splat gun checking the hopper then sliding it into the small of my back there was a stick of magnetic chalk and the amulets from my run with david earlier and as ivy flung her hand in the air and scowled at jenks i looped the cord of the heavymagic detection charm over my head it would give me a few seconds if al showed ill call you in a few hours i said and jingling my car keys i stepped past the threshold and firmly outside the churchs influence my heart pounded i heard the excited kids felt the night the smell of burning pumpkin was strong and i waited for a hello rachel mariana morgan or trick or treat love in a proper english accent but there was nothing al wasnt going to show i had taken care of it myself yay team jenks landed on my hoop earring flying up and away when i reached for him youre staying jenks smelly green grass farts im not he said darting to trent and forcing him back a startled step ivy and i discussed it and im going with you you cant stop me and you know it and whos going to help you circle al if he shows up trent he should be begging me to come with you he cant stop a demon the pixy got in the elf s face or do you have some special talent we arent aware of tired i looked at trent the young man frowned he can come to the front gate and thats it he said with a smooth grace he turned and started down the stairs front gate my dragonflys green turds jenks muttered worry tightened my chest and my gaze went to ivy standing alone with her arms over her middle just inside the door god i was so stupid running off to trents stronghold to sit with a dying man but the guilt and maybe curiosity were stronger than my fear you know i want to go she said and i nodded quen had been bitten by a vampire and had an unbound scar to ask him to overlook ivys presence wasnt going to happen ill call you when i know something i said i hesitated before her not knowing what else to say and when jenks landed on my earring i headed down the stairs seeing me going to the carport trent rolled down his window and called ill drive you out morgan im taking my car i countered never slowing im not going to get stuck at your compound with no way home suit yourself he said dryly then rolled the window up the hazard lights flicked off and he waited for me i looked to ivy who was standing beside jenkss pumpkin somewhere between me opening the door to find trent and me getting to my car it had gone out she didnt look happy but neither did i i hope shes okay i said as i opened my car door im more worried about us rache said jenks getting in i slammed the door and settled myself toms a weenie i said softly hes not going to call al jenkss wings cooled my neck what if someone else does i started the car the engine rumbling to life with the sound of security thanks jenks i really needed that twenty the long road just off the interstate to trents housecorporate office was busy the twolane road wound and twisted its way through a sprawling planned oldgrowth forest having run for my life through it once with dogs and horses chasing me it had lost much of its appeal the ride out here had been fast and quiet once we got out of the city jenks had maintained a pensive silence after i suggested he peacefully stay at the outer gate and meet me inside when he managed to slip the guards that had been a mere five minutes ago and i missed the pixy already worried i glanced at my shoulder bag on the seat beside me id leave it open so he could duck in when he showed up id be stupid to think trent didnt expect jenks to try to circumvent their security but it would be one way to prove to trent he was doing himself a disservice by shunning pixies as security specialists with quen dying he was going to have to come up with something quen is really dying i thought feeling guilty for not taking trent seriously yesterday and why does he think its my fault my gaze dropped to the speedometer and i tunked it down to keep from running into trent and as the multistory sprawling complex of offices and business research buildings came into view i slowed to a crawl surprised his visitor lot was crammed and overflowing onto the grass to one side were several whitepainted school buses clashing with the ranks of expensive cars and what was clearly a bands tour bus i looked at the back of trents head in the car ahead of me disgusted quen was dying and he was having a party i slowed further rolling my window down to hear the chatter hoping jenks would swoop in people in costume were everywhere their movements fast with excitement as they milled around before heading to the expansive front entryway trents brake lights flashed and adrenaline surged when i hit my own brakes to avoid rearending him i was ready to lose it when i glimpsed a threefoottall ghost darting between cars a harried woman with a clipboard chasing him or her it was trents yearly halloween extravaganza thrown for the obscenely wealthy to mingle with the tragically unfortunate hoping to tug at heartstrings and make a bold political statement as much as genuinely help them i hated election years my fingers tightened on the gearshift and i crept forward watching for both people and a parking spot i couldnt believe there werent valets but apparently part of the fun was pretending you were slumming it trents arm came out the window to point to a service entrance it was an excellent idea and i took the left after him ignoring the do not enter sign a man in a black suit started jogging across the manicured grass to us but he drew to a halt and gestured for us to continue when he saw who it was i wasnt surprised wed been waved through several informal checkpoints since passing the main entrance three miles up the road my gaze scanned the dark grounds as i followed trent into his private underground parking area squinting until my eyes adjusted to the electric lights another big man in a suit had come forward with the pace and attitude of someone who knew who we were but had to check anyway this guy had a gun and a pair of glasses id be willing to bet were charmed to see through spells i rolled my window down to talk to him but trent parked his car and got out drawing the man to him instead good evening eustace he said his voice carrying over the sound of our cars with a weary cadence that id never heard in him before ms morgan wanted to bring her car can you find a spot for it please we need to get to the private floors as quickly as possible the big man bobbed his head yes mr kalamack ill have another driver here for ms morgans car in a moment trents heel ground into the grit as he shifted to glance at me his worry was clear in the bright glare of my headlamps ms morgan can drive me to the kitchen entrance and you can park mine now yes sir eustace said a hand atop the open car door ill have the staff clear out as many people as they can but its going to be difficult to get through unless you want pushers no trent said quickly and i thought i heard frustration in it eustace bobbed his head and trent touched his shoulder in parting surprising me the large mans motions were quick and efficient as he got in the car and drove away trents head was bowed and his steps slow i moved my shoulder bag to the back when he got in surprised and a little uncomfortable when he settled wearily into the leather seats to fill my car with the scent of a woodsy cologne and his shampoo that way he prompted distantly and i put the car in gear jerking us warming from the rough start i let out the clutch and we started forward my fingers twitched and i wondered why i cared if he was honest with his feelings to everyone but me he wouldnt show me any true warmth or depth of emotion but eustace probably hadnt put him in jail take that left he directed it will bring you up to the back i remember i said seeing two men waiting for us outside the kitchen entrance trent checked his watch the easiest way in is through the kitchen and the bar if im detained get to the top floor its been cordoned off so no one should be there the staff is expecting you and will let you through okay i said feeling my hands start to sweat i didnt like this i didnt like this at all i had been worried about al trashing a bar what if he showed up here amid cincys finest citizens and its most helpless orphans id be lynched id appreciate you waiting for me in the common area upstairs before going in to see quen he was saying as i pulled up beside the two guys and put the car into park sure i said very uncomfortable is he going to be okay no the emotion in that single utterance was vast a glimpse of his true emotions slipping through he was scared angry frustratedand blaming me the shadow of one of the waiting men fell over the car and i jumped when he tapped expectantly at the window the doors had automatically locked and i fumbled for the button the moment they disengaged trents door was opened by a second man whose suit and tie screamed security the faint thumping of music echoed in the vast underground garage the dark carried the scent of damp concrete and the tang of exhaust my door was opened as well and my ankles went cold in the new draft i looked up at the mans stoic face suddenly unsure i was being rushed into a situation i didnt have control of and it made me feel vulnerable in a way i hadnt before shit thank you i said unbuckling myself and getting out i grabbed my bag from the back moving out of the way when a smaller man came from the kitchen and settled himself in my seat he drove away with an ease that assured me he wasnt going to damage my car leaving nothing but space between me and trent who was deep in conversation with the second man again i saw him in an unguarded moment the aides caring and concern pulling a depth of emotion from trent that i hadnt seen in him before he was hurting deeply the two men shook hands and the security guy took a deferential step back trent pushed himself into motion bothered and hurried as he put a hand on the small of my back and guided me in the two men stayed outside i preceded trent in the short aisle opened up to a busy kitchen that had a steamy fragrant warmth and exotic accents shouted at loud volumes i could hear the music better and my step bobbled as i recognized takatas singing takata is here i thought in delight when i remembered the tour bus then quashed it i was here for quen not to be a fawning groupie trents presence was quickly noted by the kitchen staff each and every one of them meeting trents eyes with an understanding that bit deep making me almost angry that they cared so much for him then i quashed that too no one stopped us and it wasnt until we came out into the extravagant bar tucked under the second floor that we saw the first guest here we go ms morgan trent said the professional congenial air of a host coming over him get upstairs and wait i faltered when the heat of the room hit me the music pounding my insides no problem i said not sure he heard me suddenly i felt vastly underdressed hell even the woman dressed down as a hobo had diamonds on one of the bartenders intervened when the first guest approached and we lost our security escort at the next news of trents arrival went out like a wake and a ribbon of panic pulled through me how did he deal with this so many people wanting his attention demanding it trent himself begged off from the third guest promising to come back as soon as he could but the slight pause had been his downfall and the surrounding people in costume closed in like banshees over a wailing infant the professional politician hid his annoyance with a grace i had a hard time seeing through an eightyearold boy pushed his way through the knees clamoring for uncle kalamack and at that trent seemed to give up gerald he said to the security escort who had gotten to us too late if you would escort ms morgan upstairs i looked up at gerald desperate for a way out of the swirling excited mass of people this way maam he said and i gratefully sidled closer wanting to take his sleeve but afraid to look foolish gerald looked nervous too and i wondered if it was because of the people he had to politely find a way through or because hed been told i dealt in demons and one might be crashing the party looking for me the music ended and the first floor exploded into cheers takatas gravelly voice echoed over it all with the expected thank you which only made them yell louder my ears hurt and when gerald fell into step behind an hors doeuvres lady i gave up and put my hand on his back so i looked foolish gerald was hotfooting it to the stairs and if i got separated i might not get there by myself we reached the stairs as the band began a new piece the amps shook the air and from the bottom step i finally caught sight of the band takata bounced over the stage as he played his fivestring bass long blond hair caught back in dreadlocks expending energy faster than a chipmunk on brimstone he pounded the music out sporting an oldrockerpunk look that only someone very cool could pull off in their midfifties my gaze shifted to trent he was smiling warmly his arm around that kid who was now standing on the arm of a chair so he wouldnt get trampled trent was trying to move forward doing a good job of covering his sorrow and frustration i could see it though in his stance he wanted to be somewhere else and a glimmer of his impatience showed when he lifted the child and set him in someones arms moving forward all of three steps before he was caught again what a pain in the ass i whispered my voice lost in the thundering music no wonder trent hid in his forest most of the time maam it was gerald and he held the velveteen rope aside for me feeling out of place in my jeans and top i started up holding the rail since i couldnt take my eyes off the room it was astounding trents entertaining room was the size of a football field well not really but the fireplace at the far end was as big as a dump truck one of those big ones takata was on a small stage at the other end with his band and the dance floor was filled with kids and adults the ward on the huge opening that looked out onto the deck and pool had been removed and people moved freely inside and out kids were everywhere running from the hot tub to jump into the big pool and come up shouting from the cold i paused at the top of the landing and tried to get takata to look at me but he just kept jamming that never worked except in the movies please maam gerald insisted and tearing my attention away i followed him past the second rope and twin security guards into the open walkway that overlooked the party and went on to the cozy living room i knew was ahead if you would please gerald said his eyes darting from me to the floor stay in mr kalamacks private quarters i nodded and gerald settled in beside the archway to make sure i didnt wander the music wasnt as overpowering up here and as i went in i scanned the suite arrangement of four doors opening up onto a sunken lounging pit and a black widescreen tv taking up a huge amount of space tucked in the back was an open normalsize kitchen and an informal dining area seated at the round table were two people my pace bobbled and stifling a frown i continued forward great now id have to make nicenice with two of trents special friends dressed in costume no less or maybe not i thought as i got closer they were both wearing lab coats and my plastic smile went even more stilted as i realized they were probably quens doctors the younger one had very straight black hair and the tired look of an intern the other was clearly the superior of the two older and with the upright posture and stiffness that id seen in professionals who thought too much of themselves i looked closer at the tall woman with her silvered hair back in an ugly bun then looked again apparently trent had gotten his wish for a ley line witch after all holy crap i said i thought you were dead dr anders stiffened her face rising to give me a smile utterly lacking in warmth glancing at her companion she shifted her head to get a wisp of her silver hair out of her eyes she was tall and thin her narrow face having no makeup or charm spell to make her look younger than she was shed probably been born around the turn of the century most witches born then were reluctant to show their magic and that she had become a teacher of it was unusual id had the distasteful woman for an instructor twice the first time she flunked me the first week of class for no good reason and the second time she threatened to do the same if i didnt take a familiar she had been a murder suspect i was checking out and her car had gone over a bridge during the investigation eliminating her as a suspect but id known she hadnt committed the crimes dr anders was nasty but murder wasnt on her syllabus yet seeing her having coffee in trents private kitchen i wondered if she was learning new skills apparently trent had helped her stage her death so the real ley line witch murderer wouldnt target her and she could safely come to work for him she reminded me of jonathan her disdain for earth magic as palpable as jonathans dislike for me i ran my gaze over her toothin form as i neared it had to be her who would want to dress up in costume and pretend to be a woman that plain looking rachel the woman said as she turned her legs crossing now that they were out from under the table she glanced inquiringly at the heavymagic detection amulet around my bruised and bitten neck and my eye twitched when her voice brought back oodles and oodles of good memories of being embarrassed in class how nice to see you doing so well she continued as her intern glanced between us weighing our moods i understand you managed to break the familiar bond with your boyfriend she smiled with the warmth of a penguin can i ask how another curse perhaps your aura is smutty she sniffed as if her long nose could smell the blackness on my soul what have you been doing to it i stopped three feet back hip cocked and imagined how good it would feel to plug my foot in her gut and send her chair crashing back she had faked her own death leaving me to try to figure out how to break the bond on my ownthe harpy the familiar bond broke spontaneously when a demon made me his familiar i said hoping to shock her the intern gasped his almondshaped eyes widening as he sat back in his seat the tips of his black hair shifting feeling like a smartass i pulled out a chair and propped my foot on it instead of sitting down when the bond didnt work through the lines i said lightly enjoying the mans horror he forced a tighter connection by making me take some of his aura that broke the original bond with nick it also made him my familiar he didnt expect that you have a demon for a familiar the young man stammered and dr anders gave him a look to tell him to shut up i was tired of this and as takata shifted to one of his few ballads i shook my head no we agreed that because the familiar bonds were unenforceable so was the deal im no ones familiar but my own dr anderss expression changed her long face becoming greedy tell me how she demanded as she leaned forward slightly ive read about this you can spindle line energy in your thoughts cant you i looked at her in disgust she had belittled and shamed me in front of two entire classes because i had pursued earth magic instead of ley line skills and she thought id tell her how to be her own familiar be careful what you wish for dr anders i said dryly and she pursed her lips sourly at me i leaned over my bent knee toward her to hammer my words home i cant tell you i said softly if i do im his just like you belong to trent only a lot more honestly a faint flush colored her cheeks he doesnt own me i work for him thats all her intern was looking nervous and taking my foot from the chair i stood and rummaged in my bag did he help you fake your death i said as i pulled out my cell phone and checked for messages and the time two amstill no demon still alive she said nothing and flipping through the menu i made sure my phone was on vibrate before dropping it away and adding my splat gun then you belong to him i added cruelly thinking of keasley and hoping it might be otherwise for him but dr anders sat back snorting through her long nose i told you he wasnt murdering the ley line witches he murdered those weres last june though the older woman dropped her eyes and anger flooded me she had known helped him maybe absolutely disgusted i shoved the chair in refusing to sit with her thanks for helping me with my problem i added bitterly my accusation had unbalanced her and the womans face reddened in anger i couldnt risk breaking my cover by helping you i had to pretend to die or i would have died for real you are a child rachel dont even begin to think to lecture me on morality i thought i would have enjoyed this more than i was and in the soft hush of takata whispering i loved you besti loved you best i said bitingly even a child would have known better than to leave me hanging like that a letter would have done it or a phone call i wouldnt have told anyone you were alive i rocked back my bag held tight to me and now you think im going to risk my soul to tell you how to spindle line energy she had the grace to look discomforted still standing i crossed my arms and looked at the intern how is quen i asked him but dr anders touched his arm stopping his words he has an eleven percent chance of seeing the sunrise she said glancing to one of the doors if he makes it that far his chances of surviving rise to fiftyfifty my knees went weak and i locked them he had a chance trent had let me drive all the way out here thinking his death was inevitable trent says its my fault i said not caring if she knew by my pale face that i felt guilty what happened dr anders looked at me with that cold reserved expression she saved for her most stupid students it wasnt your fault quen stole the antidote her face twisted in disdain and she completely missed the guilty look that crossed the interns face took it from a locked cabinet it wasnt ready for testing much less consumption and he knew it quen had taken something something that likely had tampered with his genetic structure or hed be in a hospital fear slid through me as i imagined the horrors that trent was capable of in his genetic labs and unable to wait anymore i turned to the door dr anders had looked at hes in there i asked then headed for it my pace quick and determined rachel wait dr anders predictably said and my jaw clenched i reached quens door and jerked it open cooler air slipped out softer somehow with a comforting dampness the lights were dim and the patch of carpet i could see was a soothing mottled green dr anders came up behind me the sound of her steps lost in the noise from the band i wished jenks were here to run interference rachel the woman demanded in her best instructor voice youre to wait for trent but i had lost any respect i might have had for her and what she said meant nothing i jerked to keep from reacting with violence when she grabbed my arm get your hand off of me i said my voice low and threatening fear widened her pupils and suddenly ashen she let go of me from inside the dark room came a raspy morgan its about time quens voice was replaced by a wet cough it was awful like the sound of moist cloth tearing id heard it somewhere before and it sent shivers born in a stifled memory through me damn it back to the turn what am i doing here taking a breath i pushed my fear down excuse me i said coldly to dr anders as i went in but she followed closing the door to shut out most of the music i didnt care as long as she left me alone my tension eased as i took in quens shadowy suite it felt good here with low ceilings and deep colors the few pieces of furniture were spaced to leave lots of room everything was set up for the comfort of one person not two it had an innersanctum feel that quieted my thoughts and soothed my soul there was a sliding glass door looking out onto a mossy stone courtyard and unlike most of the windows in trents fortress id be willing to bet this one was real and not a vid window quens breathing drew me to a narrow bed in a sunken part of the expansive room his eyes focused on me clearly seeing my approval of his private rooms and appreciating it what took you so long he said his words pronounced carefully so he wouldnt start coughing its almost two my heart sped up and i came forward theres a party going on you know i cant resist a party i quipped and he snorted wincing as he worked to keep his breathing even guilt was heavy on me trent said this was my fault dr anders said it wasnt hiding my tension behind a false smile i took the three steps down into the sunken area it put him below the level of the floor and i wondered if it was a security precaution or an elf thing there was a comfortable leather wing chair that had clearly been pulled from a different part of the house and an end table holding a worn leather journal with no name i put my bag on the chair but i didnt feel right sitting quen was struggling to keep from coughing and i looked away to give him some privacy there were several hospitallike carts set to the side and an iv the iv was the only thing hooked up to him and i appreciated the lack of the obnoxious beeping of a heart monitor finally quens breathing evened out braver i hesitantly sat on the front of the chair with my bag behind me dr anders hovered on the main level unwilling to break the mental barrier of the stairs and join us i solemnly looked at quen gauging the marks his struggle had put on him his usually dark complexion was pale and wan and the pox scars the turn had given him looked stark red almost as if they were active sweat had tangled his dark hair and lines creased his brow his green eyes were glinting brilliant with a fierce passion that twisted my gut id seen that glitter before it was the look of someone who was seeing around the corners of time to his own death but he was going to fight it all the same damn it damn it all to hell i settled myself not yet willing to take his small but muscular hand which lay on the gray cotton sheets you look like crap i finally said bringing a pained smile to his face what did you do tangle with a demon did you win i was trying for levityand failing quen took two slow breaths get out witch he said clearly and i flushed almost standing before i realized he was talking to dr anders dr anders knew who he was talking to though and she came forward to look down at us trent wouldnt want you alone im not alone he said his voice gaining strength as he used it he wouldnt want you alone with her she finished loathing heavy in her words it was an ugly ugly sound and i could tell it bothered quen getout he said softly angry that his illness had given her the idea she could assert her will over his i asked morgan here because i dont want the person who sees me take my last breath to be a stinking bureaucrat or doctor i gave an oath to trent and i wont break that get out a cough took him the sound like tearing fabric slicing through me i turned in my chair gesturing for her to get her ass out of hereshe was making things worse not betterand she backed to the shadows stiff and angry she leaned against a dresser with her arms crossed i could see her frown even in the dark the mirror showed her back making it look like there were two of her someone had draped a bit of ribbon over the top to drape down in a smooth arc over the glass and i realized ceri had been here before she had gone to pray she had gone to praywalked all the way to the basilica to do itand i hadnt taken this seriously the distance dr anders put between us seemed to satisfy quen and his clenched body slowly relaxed as the jerks of his coughing eased and stopped i felt helpless and tension drew my back into an ache why does he want me here seeing this gee quen i didnt know you cared i said and he smiled making his stress wrinkles all fold in together i dont but i meant it about the bureaucrats he stared at the ceiling taking three careful rattling breaths my panic stirred settling in a familiar place in my soul ive heard this sound before his eyes closed and i jerked forward quen i shouted then felt stupid when his lids flew open and focused on me with an eerie intensity just resting my eyes he said amused by my fear i have a few hours i can feel things faltering and i have at least that long his gaze lingered on my neck then rose having trouble with your roommate i refused to cover my bites but it was hard wakeup call i said sometimes it takes a twobyfour across your head to realize what you want isnt what youll end up with if you get it his head barely shifted good he took a slow breath youre a safer person to be around now very good dr anders shifted position to remind me she was listening frustrated i leaned closer until the new skin on my bites pulled smelling pine and sun under the medicinal smells of alcohol and adhesive tape i glanced at dr anders then asked him why am i here quens eyes opened wider and he turned his head to see me hesitating as he stifled the urge to cough not what did you do to get like this he asked i shrugged i already asked that and you got all nasty so i thought id go with something else closing his eyes again quen simply breathed slow and labored i already told you why i asked you here the bureaucrat thing okay i said wanting to take his hand to give him strength but i felt funny about it as if he would think i pitied him that would just tick him off then tell me what you did to yourself he took a ragged breath then held it something i had to he said on the exhale nice just peachy so im just here to hold your hand while you die i said frustrated something like that i looked at his hand not ready to take it awkwardly i scooted closer the chair bumping over the low wooden mat least you have good music i muttered and the creases in his face eased slightly you like takata he said whats not to like jaw clenched i listened to quen breathe it sounded wet like he was drowning agitated i looked at his hand then the journal on the bedside should i read something i asked wanting to know why i was here i couldnt just up and leave why in hell was quen doing this to me quen started to chuckle cutting it short to take three slow breaths until they evened out again no youve watched death come slowly before havent you thoughts of my dad surfaced the cold hospital room and his thin pale hand in mine as he fought for breath his body not as strong as his will then peter as he gasped his last his body shuddering in my arms as it finally gave up and freed his soul tears pricked and a familiar grief stained my thoughts and i knew id done the same with kisten too though i didnt remember it damn it back to the turn once or twice i said his eyes met mine riveting in their gleam i wont apologize for being selfish im not worried about that i really wanted to know why hed asked me here if he didnt want to tell me anything no i thought abruptly feeling my face lose all expression its not that he doesnt want to tell me something but that he promised trent he wouldnt stiffening on the cool leather chair i leaned forward quen sharpened the focus of his gaze as if he recognized id figured it out fully aware of dr anders behind me i mouthed what is it but quen only smiled youre thinking he said almost breathing it good his smile softened his pained features making him look almost fatherly i cant i promised my sahan he said and i pushed myself into the back of the chair disgusted and feeling the bump of my bag behind me stupid elf morals he could kill a person but he couldnt break his word i have to ask the right question i said and he shook his head there is no question there is only what you see oh god wiseoldman crap i hated it when they did that but i tensed when quens breathing became labored over the sound of the faint music my pulse quickened and i looked at the hospital equipment silent and dark you need to be quiet for a while i said agitated youre wasting your strength a shadow against the gray of the sheets quen held himself still concentrating on keeping his lungs moving thanks for coming he said his gravelly voice thin i probably wont last long and i appreciate you dealing with trenton trying to cope afterward hes having a hardtime no problem i reached out and felt his forehead it was hot but i wasnt going to offer him the sippystraw cup on the table unless he asked he had his pride his pox scars stood out and i did take the antiseptic wipe that dr anders silently gave me dabbing his forehead and neck until he scowled rachel he said pushing my hand away since youre here i want to ask you a favor what i asked then turned to the door as the music rose when trent entered dr anders went to tattle on me and the music faded as the door shut and the light vanished quens eye twitched telling me he knew trent was here he took a careful breath then softly so he wouldnt cough he said if i fail will you take my position as head of security my jaw dropped and i pulled away oh hell no i said and quens smile widened even as his eyes shut to hide that unsettling seeingaroundcorners glint trent came up beside me i could sense his irritation at me for not waiting for him and under that his gratitude that someone even if it was me had been with quen i didnt think you would quen said but i had to ask his eyes opened to fix on trent beside me i had someone else lined up if you said no can i at least get you to promise to help him when he needs it trent shifted from foot to foot as his tension looked for an outlet i went to say no and quen added from time to time if the money is right and it doesnt compromise your morals the scent of silk and other peoples perfume grew stronger as trent became more upset i glanced at his frustrated worry then back to quen struggling to take another breath ill think about it i said but im just as likely to haul his ass in quens eyes closed in acknowledgment and his hand rolled palmup in invitation my eyes pricked again shit shit shit he was slipping his need for support had surmounted his pride i hated this i hated it hand shaking i slipped my warm fingers into his cool grip feeling his fingers tighten about mine my throat closed and i angrily wiped at my eye damn it all to hell quens posture eased and his breathing evened out it was the oldest magic in the universe the magic of compassion dr anders began to pace from the window to the dresser it wasnt ready she muttered i told him it wasnt ready the blending had only a thirty percent success rate and the linkages were weak at best this wasnt my fault he should have waited quen squeezed my hand and his face crinkled in what i recognized as a smile he thought she was funny trent left the sunken area and i relaxed no one is blaming you trent said a hand on her arm in solace he hesitated then said without emotion why dont you wait outside surprised i turned to see her indignant shock oh shes pissed i whispered so quen would know getting my fingers squeezed in return but i think she heard me too since she stared at me with a prune face for an entire three seconds fumbling for words before she turned on a heel pace stiff she went to the door there was a flush of drums and light then the soft smothering of darkness returned takatas base thrummed through it like a pulse trent stepped into the lowered pit of quens bedroom in a fast motion of anger he shoved a piece of expensive equipment off a low cart the noise of it hitting the floor shocked me as much as his unexpected show of frustrated anger and i stared as he sat down where it had been to put his elbows on his knees and drop his head into his cupped hands trent had once sat and watched his father die too i felt my face blank as i saw him raw and stripped down to the pain in his soul he was young afraid and watching yet another person who had raised him dying all his power wealth privilege and illegal bio labs couldnt stop it he wasnt used to being helpless and it tore at him quens eyes had opened at the crash and i found them waiting for me when i turned to him this is why youre here he said confusing me quens attention slid to trent then back to me trents a good man he said as if he wasnt sitting right there but hes a businessman living and dying by numbers and percentages hes got me in the ground already fighting this with him is a losing battle you believe in the eleven percent rachel he took an arduous breath his lungs moving in an exaggerated motion i need that the long speech had winded him and as he labored to catch his breath in wet inhalations i held his hand tighter remembering my father my jaw gritted and my throat closed as i heard the truth in his words not this time quen i said feeling a headache start and forcing my grip to ease im not going to sit here and watch you die all you have to do is see the sunrise and youre home free it was what dr anders had said and unlike trent i saw it as a real possibility hell i didnt believe in the eleven percent i lived on it trent was staring in horror at us as it sunk in he wasnt capable of living any other way than by his graphs and predictions its not your fault sahan quen said his gravelly voice carrying a softer pain its a mindset and i need her because as much as it looks otherwisei want to live his face riven trent stood i watched him rise out of the sunken area and walk away pitying him i could help quenhe could not the door opened and shut letting in a sliver of life before the uncertain darkness that hid the future cocooned us again in a waiting warmth and smothering stillness waiting we were alone i looked at quens dark hand in mine and saw the strength in it the coming battle would be fought by both the mind and the body but it was the soul where the balance lay you took something i said my heart pounding at the chance that he might actually talk to me something dr anders was working on was it genetic why quens eyes were bright still seeing around corners taking a breath that it hurt to hear he blinked at me refusing to answer frustrated i took his grip more firmly fine you son of a bitch i swore ill hold your stupidass hand but youre not going to die god give us the eleven percent please just this once i hadnt been able to save my dad i hadnt been able to save peter i hadnt been able to save kisten and the guilt of his dying to keep me alive was enough to bring me sobbing to my knees not this time not this man it doesnt matter if i live or die he rasped but seeing me through this is the onlyway youll findthe truth he rasped his body clenching in pain it was getting worse his birdbright eyes fixed on mine and the hurt in him was obvious how bad do you want to know he taunted as the sweat beaded on his forehead bastard i almost snarled as i dabbed it away and he smiled through the pain you son of a bitch bastard twentyone my lower back hurt and my arms they were crossed to serve as a pillow as i lay slumped forward in my chair with my upper body draped on quens bed i was just resting my eyes while quen had another span of time where he could breathe without my encouragement it was late and so very very quiet quiet adrenaline pulsed through me and i jerked upright id fallen asleep damn it i thought in panic my gaze going to quen his horrible tearing breaths had ceased and guilt twisted in me as i thought he had died while i sleptuntil i realized he didnt have the waxy hue of the dead but a soft color hes still alive i thought with relief reaching to shake him back into breathing as i had numerous times that night the cessation of his labored breathing must have woken me but my outstretched hand stopped and tears threatened when i saw his chest rise and fall in an easy motion slumping back into the leather wingback chair i sent my attention to the wide sliding door that led to the patio the moss and stones hazy with the reflected sunlight grew blurry it was morning and damn it all to hell he was going to make it eleven percent chance my ass he had done it if he had crossed the eleven percent barrier fifty was nothing sniffing i wiped my eyes there was the softest rattle in quens breathing and his sheets were sweat soaked his black hair was stuck to his skull and he looked dehydrated despite the iv wan with stress wrinkles making him appear old but he was alive i hope it was worth it quen i whispered still not knowing what he had done to himself or why trent blamed me i fumbled in my bag for a tissue forced to use a nasty one with lint all over it jenks hadnt shown up and i hoped he was okay there was absolutely no sound anywhere the thump of the music was gone and i could feel the peace that had settled over trents compound by the light coming from the patio it looked a shade after sunrise i had to stop waking up at this hour it was just insane dropping the tissue in the trash i carefully scooted my chair from quens bed the soft sound of the legs bumping against my discarded shoes seemed loud but quen remained unmoving his night had been an ugly painful ordeal i was cold and with my arms wrapped about myself i tottered out of the sunken pit and headed for the light the outside pulled at me i took a last look at quen to assure myself that he was breathing and then carefully unlocked the patio door and pushed it aside with a swoosh of sound birdsong filtered in and the cold sharpness of frost the clean scent filled my lungs to instantly wash out the warmth and darkness of the room behind me a second look back and i stepped outside only to jerk to a surprised halt when i ran into the spiderweb touch of sticky silk disgusted i waved my arms to clear the doorway of the delicate but effective pixy and fairy deterrent sticky silk i muttered as i brushed it from my hair i thought trent should get over his pixy paranoia and admit he had an eerie attraction to them like every other pureblood elf id met so he liked pixies i liked doublecrunch ice cream but you didnt see me avoiding it in the grocery store my thoughts drifted to bis in the belfry and being able to hear and feel the citys ley lines when he touched me no that wasnt the same at all arms wrapped about me in the chill i watched the steam from my breath catch the sun the light felt thin and the sky looked transparent i could smell coffee somewhere and i gingerly rubbed the soft beginnings of scarring on my neck my hand dropping i breathed deep and pressed my feet into the rough stone the patio was tiled with dampness soaked my socks but i didnt care last night had been awful the stuff of nightmares and torture i honestly hadnt expected quen to survive i still didnt believe he had after the third time dr anders had stuck her long nose in i had escorted her out with a twisted arm telling her if she came back i was going to break her toes off and jam them up her ass quen had gotten a kick out of that it had kept him fighting for about a half hour after that it got really bad my eyes closed and i felt a prickling in my nose from the hint of tears he had suffered longer and harder than anyone id ever seen endured more than id thought possible he hadnt wanted to give in but the pain and fatigue had been so greati shamed him into taking just one more breath bullied him coaxed him anything to keep him alive and tortured though his muscles ached and each breath tore my soul as it tore his body i reminded him to breathe when he forgot or pretended to forget disgracing his honor until he took one more then another and anotherenduring the torment and shunning the peace that death offered my stomach hurt and my eyes opened quen would hate me the things i saidhatred had kept him alive no wonder he hadnt wanted trent in the room quen could hate me if he wanted but somehowi didnt think he would he wasnt stupid if i had truly hated him and meant what id said i could have walked out of the room and let him die focus blurry i stared at the canopy of bare branches above me to the pale blue of an autumn morning though quen had suffered and won i was still feeling an inner pain made worse by my utter exhaustion both physical and mental my dad had died the same way when i had been thirteen and i recognized an ugly ember of anger growing in me that my dad had given up while quen hadnt but then the anger shifted to guilt i had tried to keep my dad alive and failed what kind of a daughter can keep a stranger alive and not be able to save her own dad watching quen struggle had brought back every little detail of holding my dads hand as he died the same pain the same labored breathingthe same everything i blinked and my focus on the trees cleared in a sudden crystalline thought my dad had died exactly the same way i was there i saw it socks catching on the rough stone i turned to the dark room past the open door quen had said it didnt matter if he lived or died but to find the truth i had to see him through it he wouldnt break his word by telling me why my dad had died but he had showed me the connection by forcing me to endure his struggle with him the blood drained from my face and i went colder still dr anders hadnt concocted whatever quen had taken but id be willing to wager shed been modifying it so it would work better and my dad had died from an earlier version of it as if in a dream i walked from the luminous morning and slipped back into the cocooning warmth of shadow i left the door open so quens unconscious would hear the birds and know he was alive he didnt need me anymore and he had shown me what he intended to what trent had forbade him to say thank you quen i whispered as i passed the bed my pace never slowing trent where was trent he had to know trents father had died first so whatever had killed my dad it had been trent who made the decision to administer it tense i opened the door and heard the murmur of distant voices the common area was empty but for the intern on the couch his mouth hanging open as he snored silent in my socks i went to the walkway and looked down on the great room the comforting sound of conversation and sporadic clinks drew my attention to the stage it was empty but for the band roadies packing up doing more talking than anything else the morning sun lit the aftermath of the party with its scattered glasses crumbsmeared plates crumpled cocktail napkins and decorations in orange and red the ward on the window was back up shimmering faintly and in the far corner by the window i found trent he was sitting in silent vigil still wearing the baggy clothes hed had on last night i remembered that the big leather chair and small round table beside it was his spot near the huge fireplace and set where he could see the waterfall that burbled down the cliffs and encircled his backyard pool and deck though the rest of the room was a mess the fivebyeight area he was in was clean and vacuumed a cup of something steamed beside him my chest clenched grip loose on the rail i took the stairs fast in my socks bent on finding out what he had given my dad that killed himand why trent the man jerked pulling his attention from where he had been watching the water ripple on his pool i wove through the couches and chairs ignoring the smell of spilled alcohol and hors doeuvres crushed into the carpet alarm cascaded over trent as he straightened fear almost but he wasnt afraid of me he was afraid of what i would say breathless i came to a stop before him his face showed no emotion but his eyes were haunted with a horrible question pulse fast i tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and took my hand off my hip what did you give my dad i said hearing my voice as if from outside my head what did he die from excuse me anger burst from nowhere id suffered last night reliving my dads death and helping quen survive what did my dad die from i shouted and the soft conversation at the stage hesitated my dad died from the same thing quen suffered from and dont you expect me to believe that they arent connected what did you give him trents eyes closed his lashes fluttering against skin that was suddenly very white he slowly leaned back in his chair placing his hands carefully on his knees the sun turned his hair translucent and i could see the ambient heat making it float i was so frustrated and full of conflicting emotions i wanted to shake him i took a step forward and his eyes flashed open to take in my clenched jaw and disheveled appearance his face was empty of emotion almost scaring me he gestured for me to take the seat across from him but i folded my arms over my chest and waited quen took an experimental genetic treatment to block the vampire virus he said his voice flat its usual grace and subtle flavors lost in the tight grip he had on his emotions it makes it permanently dormant his gaze met mine weve tried several ways to mask the viruss expression he added tiredly and though they work the body violently rejects them its the secondary treatment to trick the body into accepting the original modification that your father died from i softly bit the scar inside my lip feeling anew the fear of being bound i had those same vampire compounds sunk deep into my tissue ivy protected me from casual predation quens scar had been tuned to piscary and since poaching would lead to a nasty second death simply on principle quen had been safe from all but the master vampire piscarys death effectively turned quens bound scar into an unclaimed scar that any vampire dead or undead could play upon with impunity the risk must have become intolerable for him he could no longer protect trent in anything but an administrative way quen took the eleven percent chance preferring that to a desk job that would slowly kill him and since quen had been bitten while saving my butt trent blamed me i sank to sit on the edge of the seat as the lack of food hit me you can get rid of the vampire virus i said hope striking me quickly followed by alarm ivy was looking for this she might risk an eleven percent chance to be free of it not her i cant do this with her i know i couldnt survive it again not after watching quen suffer trents lips pressed together it was the first show of emotion hed let slip through i never said it got rid of the virus i said it masks its expression makes it dormant and it works only in stillliving tissue once youre dead it doesnt work anymore so even if ivy took it it wouldnt eliminate the virus and she would become an undead upon dying it wasnt a cure for ivy and a knot of worry eased but stillwhy had my dad risked it the leather chair was cold and i couldnt seem to think my brain fuzzy from the early hour and too little sleep my dad had been bitten by piscary was that it my head came back up to find trent staring at nothing his hands clenched with a whiteknuckled strength piscary bound him my dad the records dont say he said softly not paying attention you dont know i exclaimed and his focus sharpened on me almost as if he was irritated you were there it wasnt an issue at the time he said angry why the blue blazes wouldnt it be an issue pursing my lips i felt my own anger tighten until i thought i would scream then why did he do it i said from between clenched teeth why did he risk it even if he had been bound to piscary he could have just quit the is i said gesturing at nothing or been transferred to another part of the country people were occasionally bound by accident and when the coverup failed there were ways to avoid being sued it happened to is employees just like everyone else and there were options involving large sums of money and generous moving packages trent wasnt saying anything this was like playing twenty questions with a dog he knew the risk and he took it anyway i prompted and trent sighed his hands unclenched and he flexed them gazing at the stark white pressure points standing in contrast to the red my father risked immediate treatment because being bound to piscary compromised his position as he hesitated his angular face twisting in an old anger it compromised his political power your father begged me to let him do the same not for power but for you your brother and your mother i stared at trent as his words and face became harsh my father risked his life to maintain power he said bitterly your dad did it for love it still didnt explain why though the jealousy in trents gaze gave me pause and i watched him stare into the garden his parents had created lost in memory at least your father waited until he knew there was no other option he said waited until he was sure his voice was breathy trailing off into nothing tense i asked sure of what in a soft rustling of silk and linen trent turned his youthful face was hard with hatred both our dads had died but he was clearly jealous that mine had risked death for love his jaw clenched and apparently intending to hurt me he said he waited until he was sure that piscary had infected him with enough virus to turn him i took a breath and held it confusion blanked my thoughts but witches cant be turned i said nauseated just like elves trent sneered at me acting for once as he wanted instead of hiding behind the facade he comforted himself with no he said nastily they cant but my knees went watery and i couldnt seem to get enough air my mind shot back to my mothers old complaint of no more children between her and my dad i had thought she had meant because of my discovered genetic blood disease but nowand her freethinking advice about marrying for love and having children with the right man had she meant marrying whom you loved and having children with someone else the ageold practice of witches borrowing their best friends brother or husband for a night to engender a child when they married outside their species and what of the lovingly retold story of her invoking all my dads charms for him in college in exchange for him working all her circles witches couldnt be turned that meant i reached for the arm of the chair my head spinning as i forgot to breathe my dad wasnt a witch just who had my mother been sleeping with my head came up and i saw trents bitter satisfaction that my world was going to be rearrangedand i probably wasnt going to like it he wasnt my dad i squeaked not needing to see his nod but he worked at the is i exclaimed scrambling for a way out he was lying trent had to be lying jerking me around to see how screwed up he could make me the is was fairly new when your father joined he said clearly getting a lot of satisfaction out of this they didnt have good records your mother he said mockingly shes an excellent earth witch she could have taught at the universitygone on to be one of the leading spell developers for the nationif she hadnt been saddled with children so soon my mouth was dry and i flushed when i remembered her slipping minias a charm to hide his demon scent and catching her this week reeking of heavy spell casting only to have it muted a few hours later hell it had even fooled jenks you get your earth magic from your mother trent said his words seeming to echo in my head your ley line skill from your real father and your blood disease from them both i couldnt move shaking inside the man who raised me was my real dad i said in a surge of loyalty who i began having to know you know who my birth father is you have to its in your records somewhere who is he smiling nastily trent eased back into his chair crossing his knees and setting his hands gracefully in his lap son of a bitch who is my father you freaking bastard i shouted and the roadies at the far end of the room stopped what they were doing to watch i dont want you to endanger the poor man he said caustically you put everyone around you in jeopardy and how vain of you to assume he wants you to come looking for him some things are forgotten for good reason shame guiltembarrassment infuriated i stood not believing this this was a power play for him a damned power play and nothing more he knew i wanted to know so he wouldnt tell me my fingertips were tingling and unable to stop myself i reached for him trent moved scrambling up and behind his chair so fast i almost didnt see touch me he said grimly the chair between us and ill have you in an is cell before your head stops spinning rachel came a raspy voice from the upper level and both trent and i turned it was quen wrapped in a blanket as if it was a death shroud the blackhaired intern at his side supporting him his hair was plastered to his skull with sweat and i could see him wavering as he stood there dont touch trenton he said his gravelly voice clear in the hush or im going to have to come down thereand smack you around he was smiling at me but his face lost its pleasure and gratitude as he turned to trent this is petty of you sahan farbeneath your dignityand standing he finished breathily i reached out as his knees buckled and the intern sagged under the sudden deadweight my god quen trent whispered shock on his face he looked at me you let me think he was dead my mouth dropped open and i took a step back i uhim sorry i finally managed chagrin warming my face i never said he was dead i forgot to tell you he was alive is all you assumed he was dead trent turned his back on me and started for the stairs jon he shouted taking them two at a time he made it jon get out here i stood alone in the middle of the floor trents voice echoed against the silent walls with hope and joy making me feel like an outsider a door down the hall thumped open and jon ran down the open walkway to where the intern was lowering quenout cold againto the floor trent had already reached him and the excitement and caring flowing from them hit me deep not even aware i was there they carried him back to his room and the comfort they shared i was alone i had to get out of here my pulse quickened and i scanned the room the dregs of the party seeming to soak into me like a stain i had to leave i had to talk to my mom with singleminded intent i headed for the kitchen my car was in the garage and though my shoulder bag and wallet were upstairs my keys were likely in the ignition where id left them there was no way i was going up into that room where they were suffused with joy not now not when i was like this numb confused and mentally slapped by trent scorned for not having realized the truth before now i felt stupid it had been in front of me all the time and i hadnt realized it the kitchen was a blur the lights dim and the ovens cold i hit the heavy service entrance at a run and the metal door crashed into the wall two big guys in tuxes jumped up from the curb at my sudden appearance ignoring them i jogged into the underground lot in search of my car the cold pavement soaked into me through my socks miss one shouted miss hold up a moment i need to talk to you like hell you do i muttered then spotted trents car mine was nowhere i could see i didnt have time for this id take his angling to it i broke into a run maam he tried again his voice dropping in pitch i need to know who you are and your clearance turn around clearance i didnt need no lousy clearance i jerked the handle up and the cheerful dinging told me the keys were in the ignition maam came an aggressive shout i cant let you leave without knowing who you are thats what im trying to find out i shouted cursing myself when i realized i was crying damn it what was wrong with me distressed beyond all belief i slid into the supple leather seat the engine turned over with a low rumble that spoke of a slumbering power gas and pistons a perfect machine slamming the door i put it into drive and floored it the tires squealed as i jerked forward and took the turn too fast a square of light beckoned if they wanted to know who i was they could ask trent sniffing i looked behind me the big guy had his gun out but it was aimed at the pavement as the second officer on the twoway relayed orders to him either trent had told them to let me go or they were going to stop me at the front gate i hit the ramp fast and the undercarriage scraped as i bounced out into the sun my breath caught in a sob as i wiped my cheeks i didnt make the next turn properly and i felt a moment of panic when i drove off the pavement and blasted the do not enter sign but i was out i had to talk to my mom and it was going to take more than two security guards in tuxes to stop me why hadnt she told me i thought my palms sweating and my stomach clenched why hadnt my crazy loony mother told me the tires squealed as i took the turns and once on the threemile drive out of here i started to get scared was the reason she hadnt told me because she was a little nuts or was she a little nuts because she was too afraid to tell me twentytwo the thump of trents car door shutting broke the autumn stillness and the human kids waiting for the bus on the corner turned briefly before going back to their conversations someone had smeared a tomato on the street sign and they were giving it a wide berth my arms wrapped around me against the cold i tossed the hair from my eyes and headed for my mothers front walk the chill from the rough pavement went right through my socks and into me driving over without shoes had felt odd like the pedal was too small the time spent getting here had cooled me down too trents comments about shame guilt and embarrassment reminding me that i wasnt the only one whose life this touched upon actually i was sort of coming in on the tail end of this dramaan afterthought an alsoran i was either the accidental shame of someones mistake or the result of a planned action whose beginning was covered up neither option left me feeling very good especially since my dad had been dead for a long time leaving plenty of opportunity for the man whod gotten my mom pregnant to come forward if he wanted or maybe it was a onenight fling and he didnt care maybe he didnt know maybe mom just wanted to forget the kids at the stop had noticed i was in my socks and i ignored their hoots as i tiptoed up the walk with a hunched posture the memory of standing at the bus stop rose through my thoughts of me going in on the same bus that dropped the human kids off i never understood why my mom had wanted to live in a mostly human community maybe it was because my dad had been human and no one would be as likely to notice he wasnt a witch my toes were cold from the melting frost as i reached the porch starting to shiver i rang the bell and heard it chime faintly waiting i looked around then rang it again she had to be home the car was in the drive and it was freaking seven in the morning all the kids at the stop were watching me now hey theres crazy mrs morgans crazy daughter i muttered sliding back the loose piece of siding to get the spare key look she dont have no shoes what a skipped track but the door wasnt locked and with a growing sense of unease i pocketed the key and went in mom i called the warmth of the house obvious on my cheeks there was no answer and i wrinkled my nose it smelled funny like burnt metal mom its me i said raising my voice and shutting the door hard im sorry for waking you up again so early i have to talk to you i glanced into the empty living room god it was quiet in here mom my tension eased when i heard from the kitchen the familiar sound of a plastic photo album page being unstuck oh mom i said softly and pushed into motion have you been looking at pictures all night again worried i strode into the kitchen with my damp socks squeaking against the linoleum my mom was sitting at the table in a pair of faded jeans and a blue sweater her hand around an empty coffee cup her hair was a comfortable disarray and the photo album was open to one of our family vacations of sunburned noses and exhausted smiles she didnt look up as i came in and seeing one of the stoves burners was roaring full tilt i quickly went to shut it off jerking when my foot found an amulet sitting on the floor in the middle of the room jeez mom i said as i clicked the burner off and felt the heat radiating from the metal rack how long have you had this on damn it was glowing thats where the hot metal smell was coming from she didnt answer and my brow pinched in concern when i saw the neverused percolator on the counter beside the sink it was one of those old ones you set atop the stove and it was the only thing my dad had drunk coffee from there was an open bag of grounds waiting to be scooped out and the filters were scattered across the counter double damn shed been reminiscing again my shoulders slumped and i picked up the amulet and set it on the table mom i said putting a hand on her shoulder to bring her back to reality mom look at me she smiled at me with her green eyes bloodshot and her face blotchy from crying good morning rachel she said lightly chilling me with how at odds her voice was with her appearance youre up early for school why dont you go back to bed for a while shit this is bad id better call her doctor i thought then took a deeper sniff scenting what the hot metal smell had been covering my face went cold and i searched her empty expression it smelled like burnt amber in here alarmed i looked closer at the amulet id picked up then pulled a chair around so i could sit and see her facetoface al hadnt shown up last night but what if tom had sent him mom i said scanning her face are you okay she blinked at me and i gave her a little shake becoming scared mom was al here was it a demon she took a breath to say something then dropped her attention to the photo album and flipped a page fear dove deep tensing me tom wouldnt risk sending al to me knowing i could circle him and send him back so he sent the demon after my mom im going to kill him i will freaking kill him mom i said pushing the album away and closing it was al here did he hurt you my mom focused on me her gaze clearing for an instant no she said her voice airy your dad was though he says to tell you he said hi shit shit shitcan today get any worse i looked at the amulet with a new understanding as i recognized it my mom was never good at making circles preferring the security of another witchs skills to her own she had trapped al with it or she wouldnt be here i looked over the room thinking it looked normal not like the disaster al usually left in my kitchen mom i said taking her hand off the album and holding it in my lap that wasnt dad whoever dad was it was a demon disguised as him whatever he said to you was a lie it was a lie mom her gaze was starting to land on me with some awareness and both relieved and scared i asked did he do anything to you did he touch you no she said her fingers touching the spent amulet no he didnt i knew it wasnt really him so i put him in a circle all night we talked talked and talked of before he died a chill went through me and i stifled a shudder we were so happy then i knew if i didnt keep your demon here hed come after you and i figured you were out having fun i knew right away it wasnt your dad your dad never smiled like that cruel and vindictive my breath was fast and i looked at her hands as if they might show a mark from her ordeal she was okay well she wasnt okay but she was here and unhurt at least physically she had talked to al all night so he wouldnt come after me god help her do you want some coffee she said brightly i just made some she looked at her empty mug clearly clean and never used shock flickered over her then disgust when she saw the percolator and realized the coffee had never gotten made lets get you to bed i said i wanted to ask her about my birth father but she was scaring the crap out of me id seen it before but not like this i had to call her doctor find her spells come on mom i said standing and trying to get her to rise its going to be okay she refused to move and when she started to cry i got mad at al how dare he come into my moms house and stir her up like this i shouldve had her spend the night at the church i should have done something i miss him so much she said the tears in her voice making my throat tighten and i sank back down he loved us all so very deeply reaching out i held her thinking life was cruel when the child had to comfort the parent its okay mom i whispered and her narrow shoulders started to shake its over the demon did it to hurt you is all its over and he wont do it again i promise you can stay with me until they find a way to hold him fear wrapped around my soul and squeezed i was going to take als name to stop this the other choice was not an option at this point look she said around a sniffle pulling the album to her and opening it up remember this vacation you got so sunburned you couldnt go on any of the rides robbie really didnt mean to hurt your feelings by calling you a crab person i tried to close the album but she wouldnt let me mom stop looking at these it just hurts you i said then stiffened at the sound of the front door opening alice came a strong masculine voice gravelly and resonant and my heart jumped when i recognized it it wasnt me he pleaded coming closer god alice i didnt tell her youve got to believe me it was trent and he needs to get his ass out of your house so i can pound him into little pieces of green i stared my pulse hammering when takata strode into the room stiff and angry his long hands made into fists his face red and his dreadlocks swinging he was in jeans and a black tshirt that made him look skinny and normal his words cut off and he jerked to a halt when he saw me holding my mom his haggard face went ashen and he said flatly thats not your car out there its trents my mother quietly cried and i took a deep breath i couldnt find my car so i took his i didnt feel so hot and swallowing i remembered his roadies listening to me argue with trent and with that it all fell together you i said my voice a high squeak there was only one reason hed have come over here and walk in as if he had a right to my face flushed and i would have stood if my mother hadnt clenched her grip on me keeping me seated you takatas eyes were wide and he rocked back a step his long hands up as if in surrender im sorry i couldnt tell you i promised your mother and dad you dont know how hard its been hard for you i stared horrified and angry crap on toast red ribbons was about me my gaze shot to him reading his guilt damn it all to hell his entire career had been made by putting his fucking feelings of guilt for having abandoned me and my mom out there for everyone to see no i said moving as my mom rocked back and forth lost in her personal hell you and my momno my mom started crying in deep racking sobs and i held her closer torn between comforting her and shouting at takata i cant take it anymore she burbled trying to wipe her face it wasnt supposed to be like this it wasnt supposed to be like this at all she exclaimed and my grip loosened you arent supposed to be here she shouted standing up out of my arms and looking at takata shes not your daughter shes montys she raged redrimmed eyes glaring and her hair all over the place he gave up everything for her and robbie when you left to chase your music sacrificed his own dreams to support us you made that choice and you cant come back rachel is not yours i cant her balance wobbled and i reached for her i want it to stop she screamed and i fell back when she swung blindly at me go away go away just make it stop shocked i backpedaled until i hit the counter frightened i didnt know what to do my mother stood with her arms wrapped around herself and her head down sobbing and i was afraid to touch her takata never looked at me jaw clenched and eyes bright with unshed tears he crossed the room and without hesitation wrapped his long wiry arms around her go away she sobbed but he had pinned her arms between them and it didnt look like she really wanted him to leave shhhh he crooned as my mother melted in his embrace putting her head to his chest and sobbing its okay allie its going to be okay robbie and rachel belong to monty they arent mine hes their dad not me its going to be fine i stared at his height measuring it against my own seeing my tangled curls in his dreadlocks seeing my lean strength in his limbs my gaze dropped to his feet in a pair of flipflopsmy feet on someone elses body leaning against the counter i put a hand to my stomach i was going to be sick i want you to go my mom cried more softly now and takata rocked her where they stood youre fine he soothed his arms around her but his eyes on me its all going to pass over and nothing will change nothings going to change but hes dead she wailed how could he be here when he was dead takatas eyes met mine and i mouthed al stark fear melted his expression to one of horror his attention going to the amulet on the table and then to me i felt a surge of bitterness he knew all about me i knew nothing of him son of a bitch did he touch you takata said pushing her from him enough so he could see her face alice did he touch you his voice was high and frightened and my mom shook her head looking where their bodies met no she said her tone flat it wasnt him and i played along with it until i could get him in a circle but we talkedall night i had to keep him here so he couldnt hurt rachel he wants to use her like a blowup doll and then give her to someone to pay off a debt oh this is just what i need tears streaked her face and takata pulled her to him again he loved her i could see it in his long expressive face laced between the heartache its late he said his voice starting to crack let me get you to your bed rachel she said trying to pull from him the sun is up he said keeping her from seeing me in the corner shes fine shes probably asleep you should get some winks too i dont want to go to bed she said petulantly sounding nothing like my mom you have to leave monty will be home soon and it hurts him when you come over he wont admit it but it does robbie is too old for you to see him anymore hes going to remember you alice he whispered his eyes closed monty is dead robbie is in portland i know it was a faint resigned whisper and i felt ill come on he coaxed let me get you in bed do it for me ill sing you to sleep she protested and he swung her up and into his arms as easily as if she were one of his bass guitars my mom let her head fall against him and he turned to me still plastered into the corner please dont leave he said softly then turned and carried her out my heart pounded as i stood where i was and listened to their progress through the house my moms soft inquiries and his rumbling responses it grew quiet and when i heard him singing softly i staggered to the table reaching blindly numb i sank into the chair my mother had been sitting in my head dropping into my hand as my elbow found the table i felt sick twentythree the acidic scent of tomato soup was comforting helping to mask the fading smell of hot metal and burnt amber my stomach rumbled and i thought it pathetic that i could be hungry when i was so strung out course i hadnt eaten anything last night other than a handful of tiny wieners on sticks and six little squares of creamtopped pumpkin cheesecake the soft sound of a wooden spoon thumping the top of a saucepan brought my gaze up from the faded linoleum table and i watched takata awkwardly pour the steaming soup into a pair of thinwalled white bowls he looked funny making dinneror maybe it was an early breakfast nowthe rock star puttering around in my mothers kitchen hunting for things in a startstop motion that told me he had been here before but had never cooked my face twisted and i forced the bitter emotion away i was sure he had an explanation the only reason i was sitting here was because i wanted to hear it that and because the is was probably looking for trents car and i was exhausted and he was making food takatas expression was weary as he set a bowl of soup before me then slid a plate with two pieces of toast beside it he looked at the amulet i wore to warn me about surprise demon attacks i thought he was going to say something but he didnt angry i took a napkin from the holder on the table you know how i like my soup i said with toast my chin quivered you come over here a lot he turned from the stove with his own bowl once a year maybe more than that and she starts leaning on the past too much she likes to talk about you shes very proud i watched him set his bowl down across from me and sink into the chair shifting to find a comfortable position on the thin padding i spared a thought that i could probably chart his visits by his tour dates and her doctor visits sorry he said hesitantly taking a napkin for himself i know this isnt much of a dinner but i dont cook much and even an idiot can warm up soup ignoring the toast i tried the soup and my tension eased as the rich warmth slipped down hed mixed it with milk just the way i liked it i glanced up when his pocket started to hum the tall witch looked discomforted as he pulled a cell phone out and checked the number you have to go i said bitingly i should have just pinned him to the wall and made him talk no its ripley my drummer a wan smile curved up his thin lips making his long face look longer shes calling to give me an excuse to leave if i need it i took another sip of soup angry at myself that i was hungry when my life was falling apart must be nice i muttered giving up on ignoring the toast as a matter of principle i picked it up and dunked it so he knew i liked toast with my tomato soup that didnt mean i shouldnt eat it elbows on the table i looked at him as i chewed i felt drained and this was just too weird takatas gaze fell away i wanted to tell you he said and my heart gave a hard thump for a long time but robbie left when he found out and it just about killed your mother i couldnt dare risk it but you could risk having coffee with me ages ago and you could risk hiring me to work your security last year burying my unreasonable feelings of jealousy i said robbie knows he looked old all of a sudden his blue eyes pinched i wondered whether if i had kids they would have green eyes or blue he recognized me at your dads funeral takata grimaced with his attention on his soup our hands are exactly the same he noticed spoon shaking he took another sip of soup i silently dunked a corner of my toast i felt like such an idiot god takata had asked my opinion of the lyrics of red ribbons last year and i hadnt gotten it he had been trying to tell me and i had been too dense to see it but how could i have even guessed who else knows i asked somewhat fearfully he smiled without showing his teeth looking almost shy i told ripley but she has her own past to deal with and she will keep her mouth shut trent i accused trent knows everything he muttered seeing my unease he added he knows only because his father needed a genetic blueprint to help base your treatment on mr kalamack could have used robbies but the repair would have been slower and not as perfect when your dad asked i said yes not just for you but so robbie wouldnt have a summer of missing memories i made a face remembering or remembering not remembering maybe so trent knows im your birth father but not why takata leaned into his chair with his tall glass of milk his long leg hitting the table leg on my side before jerking it back it was none of his business he said defensively i couldnt taste my toast anymore and i set it down i stared at my soup took a breath to find my courage then said softly why thank you takata whispered his eyes were heavy with moisture when i looked but he was smiling he set his glass down and stared out the window at the growing brightness your dad and i met your mother at the university id heard this before just not knowing that the other guy had been takata she said she met my dad when she signed up for a ley line class she had no business being in that she took it to meet the gorgeous hunk of witch in front of her but ended up falling in love with his best friend his smile grew showing his teeth id love to know which one of us she considered the hunk of witch confused i pulled my soup closer but my dad monty i mean was human takatas head was bobbing there was a lot more prejudice back then no not more just that no one was as afraid to show it to avoid getting a lot of flack he told everyone he was a witch until your mother he would ransack my closet just to smell right i thought about that for a moment then returned to eating your dad and me he continued his pleasant voice seeming to fill the kitchen and sounding right i dont know how we got through those last years without killing each other we both loved your mother and she loved both of us he hesitated then added for different reasons she thought it was hilarious when her scent charms worked so well that even the instructors couldnt tell he was a human his ley line skills were more than good enough it was crazy the both of us vying for her and her caught in the middle i glanced up and he dropped his eyes but i got her pregnant with robbie right as my music career started to take off west coast take off not just local stuff it changed everything his gaze went unfocused it threatened to steal both her and my dreamswhat we thought we wanted i felt him look at me and i said nothing tilting my bowl to get the last of my soup your dad always blamed me for getting her pregnant when she could have finished her studies to go on to be one of the premier spelldevelopers in the state shes that good i asked taking another bite of toast takata smiled you won every halloween contest you ever entered she continually developed potions to pass the iss increasingly sensitive detection charms for your dad she told me once that jenks thought she was light on the magic almost a warlock it wasnt because she was not spelling but because she was my head went up and down and i wiped the butter off my fingers crap i had forgotten to pick jenks up at the gate i hadnt even slowed down long enough for them to get it open maybe ivy would go get him i wasnt going back there okay i got the picture i said i get my earth magic from her and trent says youre good at ley lines he shrugged tossing his head to make his dreadlocks swing i used to be i dont use them much least not consciously i remembered sitting next to him on the winter solstice and seeing him jump when the circle at fountain square closed yeah i probably got my ley line skill from him so you got my mom pregnant and decided your dreams were more important than hers and left i accused a deep flush colored his pale complexion i asked her to come with me to california he said pained i promised her we could raise a family and build both our careers at the same time but she was smarter than me takata crossed his arms over his thin chest and shrugged she knew something would suffer and she didnt want me to look back and blame her and the baby for taking my one shot at greatness away he sounded bitter and i picked at what was left of my toast monty loved her as much as i did as much as i do he reiterated he wanted to marry her but he never asked because he knew she wanted children and couldnt give them to her it made him feel inadequate especially when i kept reminding him of it he admitted tired eyes dropping in old guilt so when she wouldnt follow me to california he asked her to marry him seeing as she was going to get the child she always wanted i watched his face twitch as he relived the memory and she said yes he said softly it hurt more than i like to admitthat she stayed with him and that peon is job he took on a dare instead of coming with me and the chance for a big house with a pool and a hot tub looking back i know i had been stupid but i left thinking i was doing the right thing when desires sold for freedomand need exchanged for famethose choices made in ignoranceturn to bloodstained dreams of shame son of a bitch his gaze flicked to mine and held monty and your mother would be happy i was going to california with the band my child would be raised in a loving home i thought i had cut all the ties maybe if id never come back it would have been okay but i did i dabbed my finger on the crumbs and ate them this all felt like a bad dream that had nothing to do with me so i went on to make it big takata said with a sigh i didnt have a clue how much i had screwed my life up not even when your mom flew out to one of the shows one night she said she wanted another child and like a stupid ass i went along with it his eyes watched his long hands carefully arranging the spoon in the bowl that was my mistake he said more to himself than me robbie had been an accident that your dad stole from me but i gave him you and seeing his eager smile when you were put in his arms made me realize how pathetically worthless my life was is your life isnt worthless i said not knowing why you touch thousands of people with your music he smiled bitterly what do i have to show for it selfishly now what do i have his hands waved in frustration a big house a fancy tour bus things look at what i could have been doing with my lifeall wasted look at what your mother and monty did his voice was getting louder and i looked past him to the empty hall worried he might wake her up look at what you are he said bringing my attention back you and robbie you are something real that they can point to and say i helped make that person great i held that persons hand until they could make it on their own i did something real and irrefutable clearly frustrated he slumped with his long arms on the table and stared at nothing i had the chance to be a part of what life is about and i gave it to someone else pretending to know about life when all i have is what you can get by looking in other peoples windows left looking in the window red ribbons hide my face i pushed my plate away not hungry anymore im sorry takata met my eyes from under a lowered brow your dad always said i was a selfish bastard hes right i moved the spoon in a figure eight not clockwise not counterclockwise balanced and empty of intent you give i said softly just to strangers afraid that if you give to people you love they might reject you my attention came up pulled by his silence its not too late i said youre only what fiftysomething youve got a hundred more years i cant he said his expression asking for understanding alice is finally thinking of going back into research and development and im not going to ask her to leave that and start a second family a sigh shifted his thin shoulders it would be too hard i looked at him taking my coffee up but not drinking it hard if she said no or hard if she said yes his lips parted he seemed like he wanted to say something but was afraid lifting one shoulder and letting it fall i took a sip and gazed out the window memories of struggling to live with ivy and jenks lifted through me jenks was going to be really ticked id forgotten him at trents anything worth having is going to be hard i whispered takata took a long slow breath i thought i was supposed to be the font of philosophical wiseoldman shit here not you he was smiling wanly when i looked at him i couldnt deal with this right now maybe after i had a chance to figure out what it meant pushing my chair back i stood thanks for dinner i have to go home and get some stuff will you stay here until i get back takatas eyes went wide in question what are you doing i set my bowl and plate in the sink before i wadded up my napkin and threw it away i have to make up some spells and i dont want to leave my mom alone so until she wakes up im going to work here i need to run back to the church for some stuff will you wait until i get back before you leave can you do that much for me i thought bitterly uh he stammered long face empty as he was caught off guard i was going to stay until she wakes up so you dont have to come back but maybe i can help you i cant cook but i can chop herbs no it was a little brusque and seeing his hurt i added gently id rather spell alone if you dont mind im sorry takata i couldnt look at him afraid that he would know why i wanted to spell alone damn it i didnt know how to trade summoning names with a demon but i knew it involved a curse takata though was wincing for an entirely different reason apparently could you call me by my real name he asked surprising me its kind of stupid but hearing you call me takata is worse i paused at the door what is it donald i almost forgot my misery donald i echoed and he flushed he stood reminding me of how tall he was as he awkwardly tugged his tshirt down over the top of his jeans rachel you arent going to do anything stupid are you i stopped looking for my shoes when i remembered they were at trents from your point of view probably al had tortured my mom because of me there were no marks on her but the wounds were there in her mind and shed taken them for me wait his hand was on my shoulder and when i stared at him he let go im not your dad he said gaze lighting on my neck with its bruises and bite marks im not going to try to be your dad but ive watched you your entire life and you do some of the damnedest things the feeling of betrayal was rising again i owed him nothing and i couldnt see him in my life anywhere it had been hell growing up having to be strong for my mother because she couldnt handle things you dont know me at all i said letting a sliver of my anger show his brow furrowed he tried to reach out then let his hand drop i know you will do anything for your friends and those you love ignoring that youre vulnerable and life is fragile dont he pleaded you dont have to take this on all by yourself my anger flared and i tried to rein it in i wasnt planning on it i said bitingly i do have resources friends my arm came up and i pointed deeper into the unseen house but my mother has been tortured for almost thirteen hours because of me and im going to do something about it my voice was rising but i didnt care she suffered as that bastard pretended to be my dad she endured it knowing that if she let him out of that circle or walked away he might come after me i can stop him and i will lower your voice takata said and i just about lost it jaw clenched i got in his face my mother isnt going to live her life hiding on hallowed ground because of something i did i said more softly now but no less intently if i dont do something next time he might physically hurt her or start taking it out on strangers or maybe you not that i give a flip i headed out into the hall his footsteps were heavy behind me damn it rachel he was saying what makes you think you can kill him when the entire demon society cant i scooped up the keys by the front door where id left them sparing a thought that the is was probably looking for trents car by now im sure they can i muttered i think they simply dont have the guts to do it and i never said i was going to kill him no i was just going to take his name god save me rachel he took my arm and i halted looking up his height to find his expression pinched in deep concern theres a reason no one hunts demons i searched his face seeing me in it everywhere get out of my way his grip tightened grabbing his arm i did a quick ankle tuck and sent him down resisting the urge to follow it with a fist in his gutor somewhere a little lower maybe ow he said his eyes wide as he stared at the ceiling one hand on his chest as he tried to catch his breath and figure out how he got on the floor i looked down at him and his shock are you okay his fingers prodded his lower chest yeah he was in my way and i waited for him to move you want to know what its like to have kids i said as he sat up some of its letting your daughter do stuff you think is stupid trusting that just because you cant do something doesnt mean she cant that maybe shes smart enough to get herself out of the trouble she gets herself into i felt my focus blur as i realized thats what my mom had done and though it had been hard and left me knowing more than a thirteenyearold should i was better able to handle the bigger dangers my thrillseeking tendencies got me into im sorry i said as takata pulled himself backward to lean against the wall will you watch my mom while i take care of this he nodded his dreadlocks swinging you bet i glanced past the high window in the door to guess at the time but at least now i could spell at home get her to my church a few hours before sunset i said if im not there marshal will be if i can get ahold of him hes a target now and you probably im sorry i didnt mean to put your life in danger no wonder he hadnt told me i was his daughter it wasnt anything that would help extend his life dont worry about it he said i hesitated my stocking feet silent on the carpet as i fidgeted can i take your car the is is probably looking for trents a smile curved his thin lips up and still sitting on the floor he dug in his pocket and pulled out his keys to hold them up to me they were foreign and heavy keys to who knew what i never thought id ever hear you asking for my keys he said its ripleysdont go running any red lights i fidgeted some more then pulled my hand off the doorknob and crouched to see him facetoface thanks i said meaning for everything dont take this like im forgiving you or anything i added then gave him a tentative hug his shoulders were bony and he smelled like metal he was too startled to do anything back so i stood and walked out shutting the door carefully behind me twentyfour a bright glow from the noon sun filled the kitchen and i sat with one elbow on the table my forehead cupped in my hand the other hand the one with the demon mark was firmly on the cool glass of the scrying mirror from the open kitchen window came the sounds of pixies at play i was exhausted having missed out on almost an entire night of sleep and minias the demon from judicial hell was not being helpful what do you mean you wont do the curse i said aloud so ivy sitting on the counter by the sink could hear at least one end of the conversation it was your idea a ribbon of irritationcolored thought slipped through my mind followed by the eerie sensation of words not mine in my head al cut a deal two days ago he agreed to stand trial so hes out on bail trial i yelped and ivy uncrossed her legs in a show of worry but al being out for two days would explain how hed had time to create a disguise to look like my dad i hadnt wanted to go to the demons but if ceri twisted the curse one of us would have to take on the smutassuming she would still do itand if i went through the demons i could negotiate the smut away that minias was reneging on our unfinished arrangement ticked me off when is his trial i asked trying not to freak out i pressed my hand harder into the scrying mirror when miniass presence seemed to fade while he presumably searched for the answer i was very glad the calling glyph worked when the sun was up actually this was the best time to use it since minias couldnt follow the connection and simplyappear here it is came miniass bothered thought diving through my idle musings like ice water hes down for sometime in the thirtysixth i closed my eyes and struggled for strength the thirtysixth is that this month we only had thirtyodd days a month but they were demons no its the year year i yelped and ivys face pinched in worry this isnt fair you came to me i said id think about it i thought about it i want to do it hes terrorizing my mother not my problem al is functioning within the law and everyone is happy youll get your say in court after he does and if its determined he broke his word to you newt will put him in a bottle and that will be the end of it i wont survive twenty years waiting for him to come up on the docket its not an important case and youll have to wait he said im busy is there anything else you want to bitch about you little willowisp of a ghost fart i snarled borrowing one of jenkss favorites i know whos summoning him i cant touch him because summoning demons isnt illegal you should go into politics and get a law passed minias said and when i took a breath to protest he snapped the connection i jumped catching a yelp of surprise at the abrupt sensation of half my mind vanishing it wasnt really but id been functioning with an expanded capacity and was back to normal damn it all to the turn and back i yelled then shoved my scrying mirror across the table to thunk into the wall al cut a deal hes out on bail and free to harass me all he wants by the time his ticket comes up on the docket ill be dead and he can say anything he wants ivys expression took on a look of pity and she drew her knees up to her chin im sorry she had been treating me differently since our coffee in the mall not standoffish exactly but a bit hesitant maybe it was because our relationship had changed or maybe the shift was because i had smacked her into the wall and almost fried her its not fair i exclaimed standing up and stomping to the fridge its bloody hell not fair furious at my helplessness i yanked open the fridge and grabbed a bottled juice i find out whos summoning al i said as i turned and tried to get the stupid thing open and then i cant arrest him i agree to exchange names with al and they change their mind well work something out ivy looked at the archway and put her feet on the floor his court date is in the thirtysixth i said still struggling with the lid i dont even know when that is and i cant get the damn lid off this juice slamming the bottle down on the center counter i stormed out headed for the living room wheres the phone i barked though i knew where it was i have to call glenn my bare feet slapped on the hardwood floors the soothing grays and smoky shades ivy had decorated the room in did nothing to calm me i snatched up the phone and punched glenns number in from memory i had better not get his voice mail i grumbled knowing he was working today it was the day after halloween and he would have a lot of cleanup to do glenn here came his preoccupied voice and then a startled rachel hey im glad to hear from you how did you do making it through halloween my first nasty words died in his concern leaning against the fireplace mantel i let my tension go im fine i said but my mom spent the night with my favorite demon the silence was heavy rachel im so sorry is there anything i can do i brought my head up when i realized he thought she was dead shes alive i said belligerently and i heard him exhale i know whos summoning al i need a warrant for tom bansen hes an is boy if you can believe it there was no answer and my blood pressure spiked glenn uh i cant help you rachel unless hes broken a law my hand gripping the phone started to shake frustration knotted my stomach and that combined with the lack of sleep had me at my ropes end theres nothing you can do i said softly nothing you can dig up on this guy the coven is either trying to kill me under the iss blessing or toms a stinking mole theres got to be something im not in the business of harassing innocent people glenn said tightly innocent people i said waving at nothing my mom is going to be hospitalized in the funny farm because of last night i have to stop him now the freaking bureaucrats have him out on bail tom bansen no al glenn took a slow breath what i meant was if you catch tom in the act of sending al to kill you i can do something but its hearsay right now im sorry glenn i need some help here the only options left to me are really ugly dont go after bansen glenn said his voice carrying a new hardness none of them you hear me he sighed and i could almost see him rub his forehead give me today ill find something on one of them that widow is probably a good bet her file is as thick as her late husbands frustrated i spun to the high window and the red leaves still clinging to the tree my mother is sedated on her couch and its my fault i whispered guilt just about breaking my soul im not going to wait around for him to start on my brother i have to be proactive on this glenn if im not everyone i care about will be killed i got you a warrant for trent this spring glenn said i can do this call your brother and get him on holy ground then give me a chance to do my job dont go after mr bansen or god help me ill be knocking on your door with a pair of cuffs and a zipstrip myself head bowed i tightened my arm about my middle i didnt like relying on other people when someone i loved was in danger let him do his job that sounded so easy okay i said my voice flat i wont go after tom thanks sorry for barking at you i had a rough night thats my girl he said cutting the connection before i could respond worn out i hung up the phone i could smell coffee and i headed for the kitchen and ivys ideas i wouldnt go after tom without a warrantthe man would have me in the is lockup for harassmentbut maybe i could lean on him a little harder he obviously wasnt convinced i was a threat perhaps if i set fire to his lawnby accidenthe might wait a few days to summon al again i jerked to a stop in the threshold of the kitchen shocked to find trent standing between the center island counter and the table trying to look like he wasnt bothered by the angry living vampire staring at him the shoes i had left by quens bed were cleaned and on the table and jenks was on the counter my face reddened crap id forgotten all about him hey the pixy snarled red sparks dropping from him as he got in my face where the hell have you been i was stuck in trents security office all night jenks i exclaimed dropping back god im sorry i sort of drove right by you didnt drive by you broke the mosswipe gate his tiny features twisted with anger he hovered before me the scent of ozone dripping off him like the sparkles he was letting slip thanks a hell of a lot i had to bum a ride home with greenieweenie here trent obviously before the sink ivy uncrossed her arms more comfortable now that i wasnt waving my dirty laundry from the adjacent room for him to see she might have warned me but id been throwing off enough emotion to hit her like a bus relax pixy ivy said shifting into motion to hand me my juice bottle with the lid twisted off rachel had a lot on her mind yeah he snapped wings clattering harshly more important than her partner you left me behind rachel you left me behind guilt hit me and i flicked a glance at trent still waving my laundry wings blurring jenks darted into the mended rack when ivys eyes narrowed she found out her dad wasnt her real dad ivy said and she was on her way to talk to her mom give her a break jenks jenkss held breath escaped him in a long wondering sound and then his pointing finger dropped the dust slipping from him thinned to a whisper really whos your dad frowning i sent my attention to trent who still hadnt moved but for shifting his feet grinding his dress shoes into the grit of salt left on the floor he looked awkward soft almost having changed into a pair of jeans and a green shirt like im going to open that topic up with him in the room thank you for bringing my partner home i said stiffly the door is down that hall trent didnt say anything as he took in the wonderfulness that was my life i had saved his friend father figure and head of security maybe he wanted to thank me ivys eyes widened for no reason i could see and before i knew what was happening she ducked when a flood of pixy children raced in over her head by way of the open kitchen window shrieking and yelling they swirled around their dad making my eyeballs hurt ivy had her hands over her ears and trent looked positively agonized out jenks cried ill be right there tell your mom ill be right there he looked at me in question you mind if itake a moment take all the time you want i said slumping into my chair at the table and setting the open bottled juice beside the scrying mirror i thought about hiding the mirror from trent then let it stay in view my stomach hurt too much to drink anything jenks headed for the kitchen window hanging back until sure all his kids went before him im sorry jenks i said morosely and he touched his forehead in a mock salute no problem rache family always comes first i want to hear all about it and he was gone i puffed my breath out when the ultrasonic barrage vanished ivy turned to get a mug from the cupboard i didnt care that trent was standing awkwardly within smacking distance and i put my head on the table beside the mirror im so tired what do you want trent i said feeling my words come back to me from the table as a warm breath i had too much to do i had to figure out a way to put the fear of god in tom without getting caught or i could go for what was behind door number two and try to find a way to kill al they wouldnt put me in jail for that would they well at least not this side of the lines ivy set a cup of coffee by my hand and i pulled my head up to give her a grateful smile shrugging she sat before her cracked computer and together we faced trent i want to talk to you about quen he said his dexterous fingers moving restlessly and his fair hair starting to float in the breeze from the open window do you have a minute ive got until the sun goes down i thought then im going to step out onto unsanctified ground and try to kill a demon but i took a sip of coffee and gave him a dry lets hear it the knock on our front door made me sigh out loud and i wasnt surprised when i heard it open and recognized ceris soft steps as she hastened down the hall my thoughts jerked back to her offer to help me with the curse herself i wasnt sure if the offer was still open since we had argued about her making charms for al thats not why she was here though back from her allnight vigil at the basilica she was here to learn if the man she loved had lived out the night rachel ivy jenks she called and ivy eased back into her chair its me forgive me for walking in is trenton here his car is out front i turned to trent shocked at his stark fear he had casually moved to put the counter between him and the door and his alarm was hidden behind a professional smile my mood went utterly black he was afraid of her and her demon smut too chicken to admit it openly back here ceri i called and the pretty elf breezed in long white skirt flowing to a stop around her ankles when she saw trent quen she breathed her eyes fixed on him the depth of her feelings painful to see is quen still alive please for the first time all day my smile turned real seeing it ceri started to cry looking like a wronged angel she wrapped her arms around herself as if letting go would cause her to fall apart the tears flowed unchecked making her more beautiful yet thank you god she whispered and ivy leaned to hand her the tissue box my muscles protested as i rose but trent beat me to her coming around the counter to touch her arm ceris head jerked up her tearwet eyes a stunning green rachel saved him he said and i marveled at how good they looked together almost the same height both had the same translucent hair and slim build i glanced at ivy for her opinion and she shrugged looking sour as she crossed her knees and leaned her chair back on two legs until it hit the wall ceri pulled from him the fear he was hiding hurt her more than an honest reaction would have her gaze flicked to me i knew rachel would save him she said wiping her face and smiling trent heard a rebuke whether it was there or not and he stepped back a thick animosity started to grow in me trent was scum absolutely pathetic i didnt have time for him and i wanted him out i had too much to do youre welcome trent i said bitterly get out trent balked i knew he felt vulnerable without his lackeys and i wondered why he had come alone he backed up when ivy rose to escort him out morgan we need to talk he said as he maneuvered out of ivys easy reach we already talked i said the bitterness of frustration closing in i dont have time to talk again i have to figure out how im going to keep every last person i care about alive through the night and i only have six hours to do it if you dont want to be demon fodder i suggest you leave im sorry marshal i never should have said hello ivy glanced at me for direction and i shook my head i didnt want her to touch him ivy had a lot of money but trent had better lawyers her lips pressed tightly and she let her pupils widen to cow him into leaving trent rocked back a step then gathered his courage a dangerous look in his own expression ignoring us ceri had gone to the stove to fill the kettle as naturally as if there wasnt an argument going on you should trade names with al she said knowing it would make trent fear her all the more but not seeming to care she was proud of it maybe i tried that i said giving my scrying mirror another shove before i wrapped my hands around my warm coffee mug enjoying how it felt on my fingers al cut a deal hes out on bail and hell kill me before his court date in the thirtysixth year that is ceris eyes were so vivid so beautifully green behind her tears when she turned to me glowing with the knowledge that quen was still alive nothing could dampen her quiet joy you can still twist the curse she said a tightening of her jaw showing as she noticed trents horror that she could speak of such things so casually i told you id help you with it and i will all you need that you dont have is a focusing object from al the smut is almost nil nature doesnt give names so it doesnt care if they are shifted i swallowed hard and gave her a grateful look i hadnt known if she would still help me after i had condemned her for working for al and she smiled back telling me that she was wise enough to set aside differences when real things were threatened i had saved the man she loved and she would help me save my family and friends trent looked pale and i gave him a steady look until his gaze dropped maybe now he understood why i did demon curses no one else was going to save me and i had to fight fire with fire but then i went sober in the thought that maybe he had a reason for the things he did as well damn it i was too busy to learn another freaking life lesson ivy jerked into motion startling all of us tense and fast she pulled the trash out from under the sink and started rummaging uh ivy i said embarrassed remember that hunk of hair you pulled out of al she said and i jumped up to elbow her out of the way rachel rachel wait ceri pulled me to a stop that wont work als hair isnt an accurate sample of his dna hes modified it from his original pattern ivy shoved the can back under the sink slamming the door with a loud bang her motions were tight with frustration as she put the taps on full and washed her hands i fell back against the table depressed it would have been so easy i should have just killed him i whispered then jumped when ceri touched my shoulder you cant she said her voice diving to my core with a terrible certainty newt is the only person who has ever managed to kill a demon and it made her insane sounds about right i thought pulling myself upright okay next option ceris grip on my shoulder tightened you can still do the curse she said bringing my head swinging around all you need is the sample and i know where they keep them what ivy blurted looking from me to ivy ceri nodded theres a sample of als dna in the archives theres one for every demon and familiar the only problem will be how to get it trents shoes ground into the salt on my floor his face empty of emotion as he stood in my kitchen ignored and about as wanted as a fifth wheel everyone is registered when they become a familiar ceri continued oblivious to his sudden stillness they started the practice when newt went insane and started killing demons it was the only way to be sure who she really killed i looked at ivy in the pixyfilled silence hope flooding me where i said sunset was going to get here really fast where do they keep them on a patch of holy ground in the everafter to prevent them from being tampered with she said i can draw you a map they have holy ground in the everafter pulse quickening i looked to where id once kept my spell books glad they were in the belfry where trent couldnt see them my gaze rose to my calling circle on the table i had to talk to minias ceri would you help me barter with minias i said my voice high and sounding as if it was coming from outside of me trents eyes were wide i didnt care if he thought i dealt with demons apparently i did i must have something he wants i said when she hesitated in confusion if he wont get the sample for me he might give me a trip through the lines and i can get it myself rachel no ceri protested her loose hair swinging as she reached to take my hands this is not what i meant you cant you have two demon marks and if you get a third someone could trade for all three and then theyd have you you promised me you wouldnt go into the everafter its not safe technically i hadnt but she was scared and i pulled out of her grip surprised im sorry ceri youre right its not safe but not doing anything isnt safe either and since the lives of everyone i care about are in the balance im going proactive i lurched forward tension demanding i move wait ceri gracefully got in my way she looked to ivy for support but the vampire was leaning against the counter with her ankles crossed smiling helplessly i have to do something i said then hesitated at an alternative thought trent i barked and he jumped do you have lees number he stared at me with his wide green eyes looking odd and i added i want him to teach me how to jump the lines he knows how i can learn i fingered the charm around my neck nervous before sunset i had to learn before sunset damn i was shaking what kind of a runner was i he doesnt know trent said his voice distant i asked him when you freed him and it turns out he was buying trips from al damn it i exclaimed then took a deep breath how was i going to get in and out of the everafter without racking up enough imbalance to make me easy pickings and all before sunset cause if i didnt do something tonight al would be hunting my family ill get you there trent said and ceri spun putting her small white fingers to his mouth trent took it in his own hand holding it looking at me not her maybe i can figure out line tripping on my own i thought remembering newt saying i didnt have enough time to figure it out implying that i could time time i didnt have time then i paused when trents words hit me i turned to see his face hard with determination and the fear in his gaze almost hidden ceri had dropped back from trent and she looked angry ill get you there and back but youre taking me with you he said and ceri hissed at him to be still i glanced at ivy when jenks landed on her shoulder and made her short hair billow with the wind from his wings why i said not believing this ill pay for it he repeated his feet solidly planted on the saltdusted faded linoleum ill take the smut for both of us trenton ceri pleaded you dont understand theres more here than you know his eyes flicked to her and his fear softened i understand i can do this i need to if i dont ill never learn how to live by the eleven percent his gaze rose to mine and there was a new light in them ill pay for your trip there and back but im going making a puff of disbelief i dropped back a step why was he doing this to impress ceri this is stupid i said harshly ceri tell him this is stupid trent faced me with his hair disarrayed and his jaw clenched almost a different man ill pay for your trip but you are going to keep me alive while i get an elven sample my mouth dropped open and i blinked ceri fell from her tiptoes and backed away a hand to her head she turned her back on us silent from ivys shoulder jenks started to swear with a steady stream of halfheard curses it was the only noise apart from the wind in the dryleafed branches and the cheerful shrieks of his children at play elves were kept as familiars since before the start of the war trent said putting a hand on ceris shoulder as she started to shake silently if theres a sample in the archives of an elf from over two thousand years ago i want it twentyfive the cool chill of sunset seeped in around davids borrowed leather coat and the smell of grilling burgers made my stomach hurt i was too worried to eat too worried and too tired dressed in my working leathers i sat alone in a folding chair under a tree in the dying autumn garden as everyone pretended everything was normal clustered at the picnic table to eat their hot dogs before we called a demon into the graveyard my fingers played with the charm about my neck and i felt the soft scar on my lower lip with my tongue i dont know why i was worried about becoming bound to a vamp i wasnt likely to live past tonight depressed i took off the highmagic detection charm what was the point my gaze drifted past the swirl of silk and laughter of jenkss kids to the square of blasphemed ground in the graveyard before that weird warrior angel statue it was peaceful now but as soon as the sun set it was going to feel the touch of demons i could have called minias in the kitchen but i liked the security of hallowed ground close enough to dive into there was a reason that patch of unsanctified ground existed and i was going to use it besides trying to cram three elves three witches one frightened vampire a pixy family and an angry demon into my kitchen was a really bad idea thanks to glenn i had a small breathing space the fib detective had dug up something from bettys past and though i thought an illegal puppy farm was a thin excuse the animal protection people had been more than happy to authorize a raid on her house after i signed a paper stating id seen her kick her dog the distraction would keep them too busy to summon al so unless someone else summoned hima prospect not likely the day after halloweeni had until sunset tomorrow telling my mom she didnt need to hide on hallowed ground tonight had been the high point of my day david had stopped by earlier to wish me well and loan me his long leather duster he had left when quen showed up looking ill but determined to try to change trents mind i think the were was rightly concerned that the perceptive elf would see the focus within him at any rate after a hushed argument quen agreed to trents plan then spent the next half hour trying to convince trent to return with him to his compound and prepare i figured quen was trying to get him home where he could lock him in a box trent must have figured the same thing since he refused to leave and had jonathan bring over the items on quens wish list hence the general weirdness of elves eating hot dogs in my backyard quen wasnt happy i wasnt either i was going into the everafter to steal a demons dna with a freaking tourist for backup just peachy damn keen sensing my frustration ivy turned to me from the distant picnic table i shrugged and she went back to whatever jenks was saying the pixy had been questioning ceri all day and i couldnt help but notice that trent way on the other side of the table had been listening with rapt attention seeing them there in a noisy bunch trying to pretend everything was normal i was reminded of my mothers occasional family reunions here i was again watching from the outskirts it always seemed to be that way maybe they had known i was a bastard child i smoothed my brow and straightened when marshal headed my way with a plate of food hed shown up a few hours ago trying to fit in and doing a damn fine job of it after his initial stammering reaction to finding trent in my backyard he had taken over the grilling to stay out of the way yet be in the thick of things i wasnt quite sure what to think i wasnt going to repeat old patterns and let this slide into something simply because he was nice looking fun to be with and somewhat interested especially if jenks was right and he was here with a whiteknight complex and thought he could save me hungry he said smiling as he put the paper plate on the rickety table beside me and sat in the folding chair beside mine his almostthere eyebrows pinched and i forced a smile thanks my gut clenched at the smell of the food but i dutifully pulled the plate onto my lap it was the first time today wed been alone i knew he wanted to talk and my blood pressure spiked when he took a deep breath dont start i said and his brows arched in surprise youre a psychic too he said with a little laugh and i crunched through a chip the salt hit my tongue and my hunger woke up no i said seeing jenks past him the pixy was watching us with his hands on his hips but ive heard this argument before i crossed my legs and sighed when marshal took a breath here it comes the everafter he asked isnt there someone else who can do this my god the man has enough money to hire anyone to gather samples for his genetic mapping program i stared at my plate because of fatigue not because of the lie we had told marshal to hide that trent was an elf and wanted the sample to revitalize his species no i said softly there isnt this is what i do seemingly stupid stuff that most people die doing i tucked a strand of hair as my frustration grew you dont think i know this is one of the most risky things ive ever done i appreciate your concern marshal but i need that demon sample and trent can get me there and back if youre going to be the voice of common sense and tell me that im likely not going to survive then you need to leave my voice had risen and i exhaled i knew jenks and ivy could hear if they tried marshal looked hurt and i slumped look i said lowering my eyes in guilt im sorry i really am you simply knowing me has put you in danger i thought of kisten dying to protect me and i bit my lip dont take this the wrong way but i dont even know why youre here his face took on a severe cast and he leaned to block my view of the picnic table im here because i thought i could talk some sense into you he said tightly and my gaze jerked to his at the frustration in his voice its hard to watch someone do something this incredibly stupid especially when there isnt a damn thing you can do to help them his fingers found my hands rachel dont do this his fingers twined in mine were warm and i slowly pulled away this is so not what i need im doing this i said starting to get mad marshals brow pinched i cant help you i jerked my fingers from him i never asked you to help me damn it jenks couldnt you be wrong once in a while taking my silence for indecision marshal stood the dry clatter of dragonfly wings intruded and i stared at jenks wondering how he could see people so clearly and i could be so dense hey marshman jenks quipped lightly ivy wants another burger marshal gave me a faintly sour sideways look i was just heading that way its going to be okay i said almost belligerently and he hesitated i can do this no he said with jenks hovering uncertainly beside him it wont this is bad even if you do come back youre going to be really messed up he turned and headed to the grill his shoulders hunched and his steps slow jenks didnt seem to know what to do with his wings as he rose and fell in indecision he doesnt know you very well does he the pixy said nervously youre going to come out of this better than when you went in i know you rache and its going to be okay no hes right i breathed my hair moving in my exhaled breath this is a bad idea hiding in my church for the rest of my life was a bad idea too and if trent was going to pay for my trip in and out of the everafter why shouldnt i take him up on it jenks darted away clearly upset my gaze landed first on ivywho was watching jenks vanish into the graveyard which was hazy with duskthen moved to quen and trent arguing trent made a sharp motion and quen dropped back the older mans face was dark with emotion and showing his anger and fatigue he walked away hand to his face as he stifled a ragged cough trent blew out his breath in relief then stiffened when he realized id seen it i gave him a sarcastic bunnyeared kisskiss and he frowned looked like we were still on for our date quen found his own solitude on my back porch steps sitting slumped with his knees bent he looked tired but nowhere near like hed been dying last night three pixy bucks dropped down a respectful distance beside him and he started a faint smile curved over my face as i watched the older mans mood shift from frustrated anger to fascinated relaxation yes something was there this was more than the usual enthrallment id seen humans exhibit when they talked to pixies ivy was watching quen too and when marshal brought her a burger she ignored it getting up and drifting over to the stillrecovering elf the pixies scattered at a sharp word from her and she sank down beside him quen eyed her taking the beer she handed him but not drinking it i thought the two of them looked odd together very unalike almost adversaries yet finding common ground in their unusual helplessness pixies were starting to show themselves with sporadic flashes of light hovering close to the ground in the chill and i followed the low sleek shadow of rex padding out from the long grass to make a beeline to ivy it wasnt often that the vampire was on her level and i sighed when ivy casually picked the cat up and set it on her lap all the while talking to quen it wasnt hard to figure out what their topic of conversation was they kept looking at trent and me the sun had almost set and i shrugged davids leather duster closer and dug my toes into the soles of my boots i was tired really tired exhaustion had brought me down for a nap earlier but that hadnt touched my mental weariness catching ceris eyes i moved her attention to the setting sun the woman nodded in acknowledgment bowing her head as if praying in a moment she straightened there was a new determination to her a tightening of her jaw and a hint of fear she didnt want me doing this but shed help silence fell at the table when she picked up her fivepound bag of salt and started across the grounds to the blasphemed spot of earth surrounded by gods grace in a breath everyone was moving and i watched in amusement as quen tried to help ivy rise getting an insulted look from her for his trouble trent went inside to change and marshal grabbed another beer and sat beside keasley at the picnic table i looked up at an unfamiliar wingclatter and got an eyeful of pixy dust it was little josephine one of jenkss youngest with three of her brothers serving as babysittersguards close behind she was too young to be alone but so eager to help maintain the garden and their security that it was easier to watch her from a distance ms morgan the pretty little pixy said breathlessly as she landed lightly on my offered hand and i blinked her dust away a blue car is at the curb and a lady who smells like you and fake lilac is coming up the front walk do you want me to pix her mom whats she doing here ivy was watching me wanting to know if we had trouble and i shifted my finger to tell her we were fine the exchange was noticed by quen which kind of irritated me its my mom i said and the pixy girls wings drooped in disappointment you can pix the next magazine salesman though i added and she perked up her tiny hands clapping god please let me survive to see josephine pix a salesman thanks ms morgan she chimed out ill show her in then she darted over the church to leave a fading sunbeam of sparkles her brothers were in hot pursuit and i couldnt help my smile it slowly faded as i leaned forward and put my elbows on my knees time enough to say goodbye to my mom i thought when the back door opened and my mother clattered down the back porch steps with a box on her hip id told her what i was doing tonight and i should have expected she might come over quen stood to murmur a greeting to her before he went inside after trent and i stifled a surge of annoyance i didnt like the two of them in my house using my bathroom sniffing my shampoo my mom was wearing jeans and a flowery top looking younger with her short hair frizzing out all over only somewhat contained with a ribbon that matched her shirt eyes bright she took in the preparations in the middle of my graveyard with a worried cast to her rachel good i got here before you left she said as she waved a distant hello to everyone and headed to me i wanted to talk to you the turn take it trenton has finished baking up to be quite the young man i saw him in the hall im glad to see youve gotten over your little childhood tiff relief was a warm wash through me when i saw her her thoughts clearly back together when id left her this morning shed been distraught half out of her mind but id seen her bounce back like this before takata clearly knew the right words to say and i wondered now that the truth was out if we had seen the last of her breakdowns if breakdowns were what they truly were living a lie tore at ones being and leaked out in the oddest of places my thoughts went to takata then my dad i couldnt be angry at her for loving two men and finding a child to love where she could and as i stood to give her a hug an unexpected feeling of peace took root i was my dads daughter but now i knew where i got my ugly feet my tall heightand my nose hi mom i said as she took me into a hug but her attention was on marshal at the picnic table marshal is here she asked as i sat down her expression wondering i nodded not looking at him hes trying to talk me out of it bad case of the whiteknight syndrome she said nothing and alarmed i looked up her green eyes were wide and panic swirled in them not her too its okay mom i blurted really dropping the box with a surprising thump she sank onto the open chair utterly miserable i worry so much about you she whispered nearly breaking my heart her eyes started to well and she quickly wiped them god this is hard mom its going to be okay i hope youre right sweetheart she said leaning to take me into another hug its your dad and mr kalamack all over again only this time its you whispering in my ear as she held me she added i cant lose you i cant breathing in lilac and redwood i held her her shoulders were thin and i could feel every shift of her weight as she reined in her emotions its going to be all right i said besides dad didnt die from going into the everafter he died trying to get rid of the vampire virus this is different its not the same thing she pulled back nodding to tell me she had known how he had died all along i could almost see another brick in her psyche being remortared into place making her stronger true but piscary never would have bitten him if he hadnt tried to help mr kalamack she said just like youre helping trent piscary is dead i said and her breath came in slowly he is isnt he and i wouldnt go into the everafter unless i had a guaranteed way out i added and im not doing this to help trent im doing this to save my ass at that she laughed that is different isnt it she said needing hope i nodded having to believe it was it is its going to be okay please let it be okay i can do this i have good friends she turned and i followed her gaze to ivy and jenks in the graveyard both looking helpless as ceri directed everyone to their places we were alone everyone slowly milling around that weird angel statue in the graveyard and the slab of reddish cement fixing it to the ground they do love you she said giving my hand a light squeeze you know i never understood why your dad always told you to work alone he had friends too friends that would have risked their lives for him though in the end it didnt matter i shook my head embarrassed about the love comment but my mom only smiled here she said nudging the cardboard box with her toe i should have given these to you before but seeing how much trouble you got into with the first few i gave you it was probably just as well i waited first few i thought when my fingers touched the dusty cardboard and a faint tingle of power cramped my joints i quickly undid a flap and looked inside and the scent of burnt amber was almost a slap mom i hissed seeing the dark leather and dogeared pages where did you get these she wouldnt meet my gaze her brow furrowing as if refusing to look guilty theyre your dads she muttered you didnt seem to mind the first ones she said defensively as i stared at her aghast and not all of them are demon texts some are straight from the universitys bookstore understanding crashed over me and i closed the box up you were the one who put the books in the belfry yes she finished standing up and drawing me to my feet ceri was done and we had to move i wasnt about to hand them over to an unfamiliar vampire to give to you and the door was open i knew youd find them eventually seeking out high lonely spots the way you do you lost everything when the is cursed your apartment and what was i supposed to do drive over here and give you a demontext library her green eyes were glinting in amusement you would have locked me up oh my god my dad had called demons trent came out the back door with quen and i felt a wash of panic mom i pleaded my pulse racing tell me he never used these tell me he was a collector of books please she smiled and patted my hand he was a collector of books for you my brief relief died and i froze as she stood to pull out of my grip my dad had known that id be able to kindle demon magic he had collected a demon library for me he had told me to work alone what in hell had trents dad done to me come on rachel my mom said standing over me and touching my shoulder theyre ready for you i stood wobbling a small cluster of people waited at the warrior angel ceri keasley trent quen marshal jenks and ivythe people who impacted my life the most with my mom at my side i started walking as she chatted on about nothing it was a defense mechanism that i saw through to the fear she was struggling to come to grips with davids coat enfolded me in the rich complicated scent of were a distant show of support for all his strength hed known he could do nothing and so had given me what he could and vanished in the way of weres i shrugged it closer as the hem hissed against the long grass it needed to be cut and the dewwet tips turned the hem a darker brown everyone turned as i approached and my mom gave me a last hug before falling back to stand with marshal in the grass ceri and trent were already on the red slab with three concentric circles sketched on it and eyeing the mans new outfit i joined them trent had put on some sort of black jumpsuit with pockets and if not for his fair hair poking out from under a close fabric cap i wouldnt have known it was him at first glance you look like the military guy from a b movie i said and he frowned you knowthe token human who gets eaten first is that what youre wearing he shot back you look like a wannabe private eye its cold over there i said defensively and leather will keep me from getting scraped up if i have to fall down and if i get hit by a potion it cant get through if i get hit by a demon curse ill be dead i cant afford kevlar and spellresistant fabric trent gave me an upanddown look and turned away miffed ivy stepped forward to hand me the satchel that had all my stuff i put the map ceri sketched in there she said her pupils fully dilated with worry i dont know how helpful its going to be but at least you know what direction to go thanks i said as i took the light bag in it was my splatball gun with a dozen sleepytime paint balls three warmth amulets from marshal a scent charm from david id loaned him a while back a small bag of salt a piece of magnetic chalk and a couple of other things from my dads old stash of ley line stuff nothing much just what i needed to force my summoning name onto al and take his in return soon as i had the sample i was going to use it and some bottled water she added a few energy bars and some cream for your neck thank you i said softly her attention flicked to mine and away keasley put in a few pain amulets and i found a finger stick in your bathroom drawer that will help flashlight extra batteries she added there wasnt anything that would help us if we were caught but i knew why she was doing this trent shifted impatiently and i frowned hat i said suddenly as i looked down at the long brown duster i need a hat ivy smiled its in there curious i dropped the bag and unzipped it digging past ivys colored markers that i wouldnt need and jenkss old toolkit from this spring when hed been big i pulled out an unfamiliar black leather hat and snugged it over my curls it fit me perfectly and i wondered when she had bought it for me thank you i said as i tucked my hair up and out of my face ceri was staring at the horizon the sun was down and i knew she wanted to get on with it rachel she prompted and my heart thumped i almost hoped trent wouldnt be able to make good on his deal to pay my way and i could bow out of this without looking like a coward but then id be fighting for my life every time someone called al ivy touched my shoulder and not caring what anyone thought i dropped the satchel and took her in a tight hug vampire incense filled my senses and as my eyes closed to keep a tear from leaking out i breathed it in feeling not a twinge upon my scars misery took me heartache that this might be goodbye forever ill see you about sunrise i said and nodding she let go i couldnt look at anyone and my throat was tight as i picked up my bag and stepped onto the cement slab my gaze flicked to trent his expression was carefully empty what in hell did i care what he thought ceri stepped into the first circle and my eyebrows rose i can hold miniass circle i said then swallowed unless you think newt will show up she wrapped her arms around herself clearly wanting to put herself on hallowed ground but just as clearly planning to stay where she was minias will follow you if i dont circle him and keep him here until sunrise her narrow jaw clenched walk fast i looked briefly at my mother as i remembered the mental torture al had put her through when she had done the same ceri i can do this she said fear in her eyes and i touched her arm there was nothing this side of the lines that would keep minias from tattling on us if he knew what we were doing thank you i said and she smiled fearfully if spending a night talking to a demon is all i have to endure to keep you alive and help mend the damage the demons did to my species then its thirteen hours well spent thank you all the same i said worried ill close the outermost circle she said starting to babble in her nervousness that way no one can interfere and because trent will be doing the summoning and bargaining he will make the inner one to hold minias ill set the middle circle to hold minias here and keep him from following you once you leave trent i exclaimed my gaze shooting to him in his cute little jumpsuit and he flushed i can make a stronger circle with one arm tied behind my back ceri shook her head trenton is the one bargaining for the jumps so he will be the one holding the circle she said her smooth features wrinkling as i found fault with her plan keep your mouth shut while he talks or minias will use it against you ticked i pressed my lips tight keep your mouth shut ceri said in a burst of anger then gestured for trent to come closer sighing trent tightened his grip on his backpack and stepped over the outermost chalk line to join us ceri pointed for him to stand next to me and looking nervous he edged closer yet i wondered how much of ceris temper was actually worry she was terrified of newt and minias was only a small step from the insane female demon quicker than thought a shimmering sheet of black everafter rose up around us along the outermost circle permanently etched out in the reddish cement there had been a tug on my thoughts when ceri had tapped the nearby line and i worked to keep the huge spindle of everafter i had gathered earlier from unwinding trent didnt look happy as ceri trapped him with the same witch who had turned him in for murder and might just as easily give him to a demon to get rid of one of her own demon marks trust i thought suddenly he trusted meto some extent anyway i took a steadying breath as i looked at the other two circles at my feet they would make an airlock of sorts trent would set the inner circle to hold minias but when we left it would fall the middle circle set by ceri would hold the demon at that point ceri glanced at trent and nodded just as we practiced she said and trent set his backpack down and came forward he glanced once at quen then closed his eyes his lips moved and i felt an uncomfortable sensation as he slowly tapped a line and set the circle it was the difference between a sharp tug to remove a splinter and a methodical painful digging and i could tell it was bothering ceri too quen must have been making him practice since he didnt need candles to set a circle anymore bartholomews balls ceri muttered can he do this any slower my lips quirked but my satisfaction at trents lesser skills died in a wash of selfpity when his sheet of everafter rose up his aura was clean and pure the bright gold shot through with the sparkles of seeking mine would look like a crapsmeared wall next to his jenks i thought where in hell is jenks ivy i said worried wheres jenks she waved a hand he said he was going to make sure his family was safe she said and my gaze went over the pixyempty garden from the steeple a pair of unfamiliar red eyes glowed and my pulse jumped until i realized it was bis i felt miserable jenks didnt want to say goodbye i understood that ceri handed trent my scrying mirror and i saw his expression close off in the gathering dusk damn the thing was beautiful out here in the gloomy light the winecolored glass etched with crystalline lines in the shape of the calling pentagram with all its little figures and symbols i couldnt tell if trent thought it beautiful or foul and i wondered if that was why ceri insisted he summon minias she might be trying to convince him neither she nor i was immoral for what we did just incredibly stupid swallowing hard trent knelt on the red pavement he set the glass carefully in front of him and he put a shaky hand on the mirror my nose tickled then faded and when a queer feeling of falling inside out flipped through me i wasnt surprised when trent blinked fast several times trent kalamack he said softly clearly talking to minias i ask for your attention in a matter of traveling the lines and am prepared to pay i wont pay for you coming over here to discuss it though that is your choice not my request trent blanched at miniass unheard response im using morgans calling circle he said as if answering a question then followed it up with standing beside me a sudden pop of air pressure hurt my eardrums and i jumped minias had blinked into this side of reality within trents circle a thin hand held his yellow cap onto his head and his beautiful greentrimmed robe looked loose and undone his curly hair was in disarray and with him was the scent of burnt amber and bread hot from the oven the demon had his back to me but i could see his shock when he realized where he was and spun by the two worlds colliding he swore softly as he looked me up and down after sunset and still alive how did you manage that i shrugged one shoulder as trent took his hand from the mirror and stood her back hunched ceri whisked it away you kick your dog one too many times someones going to call the animal protection agency i said not liking the servile attitude ceri had adopted in miniass presence now thats an organization you dont want to piss off miniass gaze went to my friends clustered together on holy ground then trentwho was trying to look calmthen finally back to me an audience i shrugged again my friends trent cleared his throat this is nice but we do have a deadline my lips pressed which you just blabbed to him trent way to go trent reddened and ceri made a telling face minias though tugged his yellow robe tightly closed and smiled wickedly at the elf i want to bargain with you trent said casually clasping his hands behind his back to hide their trembling i dont want to know your name ive asked for your presence not summoned you and im never going to call you again minias reached behind himself for the ornate wireandcushion chair that had appeared tugging it closer until he could sit ill believe that when i see it his goatslitted eyes shifted to me and i forgot to breathe curiosity brought me here i thought it might have been someone else his attention landed on ceri then slid away what could you possibly want and why in heaven and hell do you think i will help you a putrid little elf without hesitation trent said i want passage in and out of the everafter for two people and asylum while were there you dont touch us or tell anyone were there miniass eyebrows rose and he blinked slowly youre going to try to kill al he said softly and i refused to look away or change my expression there were ways to solve problems other than killing someone but if thats what he thought we were doing then no one would be watching the archive right in a smooth motion the demon leaned forward i can get you there but nothing will buy my silence two trips in and out he said speculatively you and ceridwen merriam dulciate trent shook his head then did a double take to look at ceri youre a dulciate he stammered and she flushed it means little now she murmured her attention down minias cleared his throat and trent dragged his gaze from her me and the witch trent said still glancing at ceri i suppose asking for your soul is out of the question the demon said and i looked at the first of the stars starting to show we could be here all night but trent seemed to have found a cavalier attitude and he turned sideways as if not really caring whether minias went along with this or not stanley saladin has purchased multiple trips from a demon he said his voice carrying an indolent confidence four trips through the lines is not worth my soul and you know it stanley saladin bought line passages from someone trying to lull him into servitude minias said it was an investment and im not looking for a familiar even if i was id buy one not bother raising one up from scratch and what makes you think your soul is worth anything trent said nothing calmly indifferent until minias asked what do you have thats worth your soul trenton aloysius kalamack a confident smile curved over trent i was shocked at his attitudehe was slipping into this demonbargaining mode far too easilybut ceri didnt seem surprised a businessman is a businessman good trent patted his front for a nonexistent pen im glad we can talk id like to finish this cleanly without any marks to be settled at a future date miniass eyes narrowed and i blanched no he said firmly i want a mark i like the idea of you owing me trents face went tight i can give you the secret of morgans parentage my breath hissed in you son of a bitch i shouted leaping for him rachel ceri cried and i smacked into a front fall when she tripped me i scrambled up my respect for her not her small hand on my arm held me back thats mine i shouted you cant buy a trip into the everafter with my secrets minias glanced between us add a minor demon mark and you have your curses make it settled at my discretion not yours trent haggled and i jerked from ceris grip you son of a bitch i yelled getting in his face the man had the gall to make an innocent face at me and losing it i shoved him into ceris outer circle he stumbled back hitting it as if it were a wall there was a shout of protest and quens toes were suddenly edging near the salt ring he was ticked and ivy was behind him her lips pressed into a thin line ready to take quen down if he somehow got through the sheet of everafter you sorry little pissant i shouted standing over trent in his little black jumpsuit with my borrowed duster edging his legs you pay for my trip with information about me i could have done that myself i only agreed to protect you because you were paying my way rachel ceri was trying to soothe me but id have none of it i reached to grab his lapels and he rolled to his feet it was fast and i tried to hide my surprise ill accept that deal minias said and i almost screamed done trent shouted and minias grinned back off morgan or im taking ceri with me instead and you get nothing seething i glanced at ceri he wouldnt dare he wouldnt dare ask ceri to go i saw her fear hating trent all the more for threatening her like that shed go if i didnt if only to try to help her species you are foul trent i said as i backed from him this isnt over when were done here were going to talk dont threaten me he said and my blood seemed to burn under my skin i looked at my mother shocked to see her being held back by keasley her color was high and she looked one hundred percent pissed if i didnt make it back she would make sure trent would be sorry he had ever put me and now takata in danger if trent talked demons would be coming after him too interesting minias said and i spun back to him rachel mariana morgan protecting trenton aloysius kalamack trenton aloysius kalamack paying rachel mariana morgans way this isnt a suicide run to kill al what by the two worlds are you doing i pulled back to the edge of the circle until it buzzed a harsh warning shit i hadnt realized i had telegraphed so much of our intent jaw clenched i glared at trent get your cookieass in there and get your mark so we can get out of here i demanded and trent blanched a moment of satisfaction colored my anger and i made an ugly face yeah i said bitterly youre going to wear his mark and youre going to have to trust that he doesnt just change his mind and cart you off once youre in there with him ceri frowned thats rude rachel she said hes bound by law to leave trenton alone for the duration just like als not supposed to hurt me or my family i muttered as i backed away from minias my legs were shaking from adrenaline as i gestured to trent to cross over the middle uninvoked circle and get on with it the elf got up brushed himself off and with his thin lips pressed tightly walked over the chalked line with his chin high ceri knelt to touch the line and a circle of black rose between us and minias for a moment there were three circles ceri holding the outer two and trent holding the innermost one then trent touched his and it fell to put himself and minias breathing the same air minias smiled and trent went ashen my own heart pounded in the memory of al doing the same thing to me crap was i trying to feel better about myself by dragging those i envied down to where i was where do you want it the demon asked and i wondered why unless it was more degrading to look at it every day knowing you asked for it rather than have it forced on you i felt the raised circle on the inside of my wrist thinking i had to get rid of one of these soon his eyes never leaving miniass trent shoved his sleeve up to show a lightly muscled arm toned and sundarkened minias grabbed his wrist and trent flinched at the knife the demon suddenly held jerking only once as he scribed a circle bisected with a single line into him i thought i smelled the acidic scent of blood and the rich aroma of cinnamon i glanced at ivyher pupils were dilating as quen looked at her in disgust tell me of rachels father minias said his hand still around trents wrist the mark had stopped bleeding and trent was staring at it shocked that it looked old and long healed give me the way to cross the lines he said his gaze jerking up to miniass the demons eye twitched its in your head he said just say the words of invocation and you and whoever is with you will cross the lines now tell me of rachels sire if i dont think it worth the imbalance of four trips through the lines ill simply upgrade your mark and give you a second slash i fidgeted and my mother shook off marshals restraint damn it takata im sorry trent was a bastard i was going to get him for this the man who raised her was human he said staring at minias i found out when he came to my father asking for a cure i have morgans fathers medical records but theres no name on them i dont know who he is keasley and marshal looked shocked that my dad wasnt a witch but my lips parted in wonder trent hadlied my mother was sagging in relief and i reached behind me until i touched the wall of everafter leaning my hand against it for support he hadnt told he hadnt told minias trent had lied miniass attention flicked to me and back again his grip on trent tightened whos her birth father he asked and trents gaze grew wild ask her he said and my heart seemed to start beating again she knows not enough minias said knowing he was lying tell meor youre mine my fear redoubled did he expect me to save his ass by blurting it out the man is alive trent said that same wild glint in his eye hes alive and rachels mother is alive morgans children will survive carrying the ability to kindle demon magic and i can make more like her his smile grew ugly let go of me miniass gaze flicked to me with a shove he let go of trent and took a step back the mark stands as it is ceri was crying silently tears trickling down her face as she stood and watched trent find his composure had trent just assured him that in a few generations theyd have a crop of highly desirable witch familiars available ones that could invoke their curses so they wouldnt have to god help me he was slime utter slime he had put demon hitmarks on my potential children before they were even born i stood where i was and fought to keep from throttling him he had spared takata only because he had found a way to hurt me worse can we go now i said hating him minias nodded and trent stepped back the elf set the inner circle to trap him and when ceri dropped hers he retreated to stand beside us the scent of burnt amber caught at my throat and trent reeked knowing trents circle would fall when we left ceri reinstated the second circle about minias the rising and falling bands of power were making me ill minias smiled from behind the two different arcs of reality as if he didnt care that he was going to be trapped in a small circle for thirteen hours until the rising sun freed him trents words must have pleased him to no end i picked up my satchel and stood ready my eyes flicked from ivy to my mom and my heart pounded it was going to be over one way or the other really soon afterward trent and i were going to chat be careful my mother said and i nodded gripping the straps of my bag tighter and then trent tapped a line and said a word of latin the breath was pushed out of my lungs and i felt myself fall the curse seemed to shred me into thoughts held together by my soul a tingling washed through me and my lungs rebounded filling with a harsh gritty air i gasped my hands and knees slamming into the grasscovered ground and my hat falling off beside me i could hear trent retching stumbling to my feet i swallowed the last of my nausea and looked past my blowing curls to the redstained sky and long grass i wanted to give trent a swift kick for putting my future kids on the demons radar but figured i could wait until i knew i had a future welcome to the homeland trent i muttered praying we all got back to where we belonged before sunup twentysix shaky i fumbled with the satchels zipper to find the map and orient myself it was cold and i pulled my hat lower as the acidic wind pushed the hair from my face and i scanned the image of a dim wasteland glinting under the redsmeared sky i halfexpected to see the ruins of my church but there was nothing there stunted trees and twisted bushes rose between hummocks of dried grass a red haze glowed from the bottom of the clouds where cincy would have stood but here on this side of the dry river it was mostly sadlooking vegetation trent wiped his mouth with a hankie he then hid under a rock his eyes were black in the red light and i could tell he didnt like the wind pushing on him he didnt look cold though the man never got cold which was starting to tick me off squinting i tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and focused on the map the air stank and the scent of burnt amber caught deep in my throat trent coughed quickly stifling it davids duster shifted about my heels and i was glad i had it wanting something between me and the greasyfeeling air it was dark but the clouds reflecting the glow from the broken distant city gave everything a sick look like the light in a photographers darkroom arms wrapped around my stomach i followed trents gaze to the twisted vegetation trying to decide if the redsheened rocks hiding in the grass were tombstones amid the trees was a large shattered slump of crumbling stone with a lot of imagination it could have been the kneeling angel trent looked down at the faint tink of metal at his feet bending for a closer look he thumbed a penlight on it glowed a sickly red and i cringed at the revealing light then leaned so our heads almost touched for a better look in the scuffed grass was a tiny bell black with tarnish it wasnt solid but made of decorative loops that brought to mind a celtic knot trents hand reached and in a wash of adrenaline i gave him a shove what in hell are you doing i all but hissed as he glared at me and i wished i had hit him hard enough to knock him on his butt dont you ever watch tv if there is a pretty sparkly thing on the ground leave it alone if you pick it up youre going to release the monster or fall through a trapdoor or something and what is it with the light you want to tell every demon this side of the ley lines where we are god i should have taken ivy a surprised look replaced trents anger you can see the light he said and i snatched it from him and clicked it off duh i exclaimed in a whisper he yanked it back its a wavelength that humans cant see i didnt know that witches could slightly mollified i backed down well i can dont use it i stood and watched in disbelief as he flicked his light on and belligerently picked up the bell it tinkled faintly and after knocking the dirt from it he jingled it again i could not believe this putting a hand on my hip i glared at the red glow hovering over the broken city miles away the pure sound was muffled and he tucked it in a little belt pouch freaking tourist i muttered then louder said if youve got your souvenir lets go i nervously stepped to the more certain dark of a twisted tree it had no leaves and it looked dead the cold gritty wind having scoured all life from it instead of following trent pulled a paper from his back pocket the penlight came on again and he shone it on a map a red glow reflected up on his face and furious i snatched the light away again are you trying to get caught i whispered if i can see it and you can see it what makes you think a demon cant trents silhouette grew aggressive but when the distinctive rustle of something small pushing through grass at a run rose over the soughing of wind in the trees he closed his mouth you had to ring the bell didnt you i asked pulling him into the shadow with me you had to ring the damn bell i shivered in davids borrowed coat and he shook his head in disdain relax he said over the rustling of the closing map dont let the wind spook you but i couldnt relax the moon wouldnt rise until almost midnight but the ugly glow in the sky made everything look like a firstquarter moon was shining i stared at the heaviest glow deciding that was north the memory of ceris map swam up and i turned a little to the east that way i said as i tucked his light in my pocket we can look at the map when we find some broken buildings to hide the glare behind trent tucked the map into his pocket and shrugged his pack over his shoulders i nervously shifted my bag to my other arm and we started out glad to be finally moving if only to warm up grass hid the low spots and i stumbled three times before wed gone thirty feet how good is your night vision trent asked when we found a reasonably level swath that ran exactly east to west okay i wished i had brought my gloves and i hid my hands in my sleeves trent still didnt look cold as he stood before me his cap making his outline radically different can you run i licked my lips thinking of the uneven footing i wanted to say better than you but quashing my irritation i said not without breaking something the red haze from the clouds lit his slight frown then we walk until the moon rises he turned his back on me and started off at a fast pace i jumped to keep up then we walk until the moon rises i mocked under my breath thinking that mr elf had no idea of the situation wait until he saw his first surface demon then hed put his little scrawny elf ass behind mine where it belonged until then he could find the dips in the grass and snap his freaking ankle the wind was a constant push and my ears ached with it my head slowly bowed until i had to force myself to look up and past the evermoving shadow of trents back he kept a constant motion just above my comfortable pace as he ghosted forward with a minimal amount of movement through the waisthigh grass and past the occasional tree slowly i started to warm up and watching him i started questioning my decision to wear davids long leather duster my legs were protected from the dry ache of the gritty wind but it set up an unnerving hush against the grass that trents jumpsuit barely touched things were no better when we left the grass behind and slipped under the canopy of a mature twisted forest the ground vegetation was sparser but now there were tree roots we passed what might have once been a lake currently covered in a thick bramble the thorns lapping the edge of the forest like waves i finally called for a halt when the trees gave way to chunks of concrete and occasional patches of thick grass trent stopped his unrelenting pace and turned the wind was a cool brush against me and breathless i pointed to what looked like a crumbling overpass without a word he angled to a slump of rock underneath hand on my side and my thoughts on the water and energy bars ivy had packed for me i followed sinking down beside trent on the cold rock and glad for something solid behind me id been fighting the feeling of watching eyes since we found the forest the sound of my satchels zipper was a striking point of normalcy in the redsmeared existence around us with its greasy wind and heavy clouds trent held his hand out for his light and i gave it to him he turned away to study the map as i scanned the terrain behind us there had been a twisted silhouette at the dry lake the vaguely humanlooking figure furtive and fleeting trents cupped hand hid much of the light and his redtinted finger traced our probable path from where we arrived to where ceri had indicated the demons had their access to their database why it wasnt in the city bothered me but she had said they had put it on holy ground to prevent demonic or familiar tampering the map ceri had sketched had an eerie feeling of familiarity with an undulating line indicating the dry river and marks showing where old bridges crossed it looked like cincy and the hollows why not both sides of reality had a circle at fountain square turning away i dug in my pack you want a drink i said softly as i brought out a bottle and when he nodded i handed it over the crack of the plastic seal shot through me and trent froze until he was sure the wind was still blowing and the night was still in the ugly red light his eyes were black when they met mine guess whats on the patch of holy ground they store their samples on he said tapping the map and ceris star i looked at the map then past him to the crumbling remains we had yet to venture into in the nearby distance glowing in the early moonlight were spires really familiar spires no i whispered tucking a curl back behind an ear the basilica the wind ruffled the edges of the map while trent drank his throat moving as he downed the water what else could it be he said as he tucked the empty bottle into his sack the sound of sliding rock jerked him straight and my pulse pounded trent clicked off his special light but there not a hundred feet away in the sickly red haze was a twisted hunched silhouettestaring at us with arms hanging slack at its sides its feet were shod and leggings rose past the thin shins an elbowlong cape fluttered in the cold wind it turned a bare head to the east as if listening then back to us waiting testing trying to figure out if we were food or foe a shudder rippled over me that had nothing to do with the steadily dropping temperature put your map away i whispered as i eased to my feet we need to move i thanked god it didnt follow this time i was in front tension making me almost glide through the ruins as trent lagged tripping on sliding rock and swearing when he slipped as he struggled to keep up with my feardriven pace we didnt see any more surface demons but i knew they were there by the occasional rock slide i didnt question why i found it easier to navigate the sharper shadows that the red moonlight made on the ruins than the natural slump of tree and grass all i knew was that our presence had been noted and i didnt want to linger my first glimpse of the moon shook me and i tried not to look again after my first shocked stare it had become a sickly redsmeared orb bloated and hanging over the broken landscape as if in oppression the moon had always looked silver the few times i had opened my second sight and gazed into the everafter from the security of my side of the lines the clear glow of our moon must have been overpowering the redsmeared ugliness i was looking at now seeing it with my feet really on alien soil coated with red like my soul was coated with demon slime brought to a sharp clarity just how far from home we really were we fell in and out of a slow jog as the terrain permitted traversing the broken slumping buildings and the occasional line of trees showing where boulevards once were as we went deeper into the remains of concrete and frostrimmed lampposts heading for the spires i started to wonder if the thin hunched figures that were becoming increasingly bold were elves or witches that hadnt crossed over escaped familiars perhaps they had auras but the glow was loose and irregular like torn clothing it was as if their auras had been damaged from trying to live in the toxic everafter worry tightened my brow as we wove through twisted metal that might have once been a bus stop was i poisoning myself by being here and if so how come ceri was okay was it because she hadnt been allowed to age while a familiar or maybe al had kept her healthy by resetting her dna to the sample on file or maybe she never came up to the surface a falling rock slid almost to my feet and i cut a sharp left betting that there would be an open street after the broken building in front of me that would lead right to the basilica i didnt think we were being corralled god i hoped we werent trent followed very close and our progress slowed as we slipped through a narrow passage his breathing was loud and my shoulders eased when we emerged from the broken alley onto a clear street chunks of adjacent buildings littered the way but little else at trents nervous nod we started forward skirting the larger debris that might hide a skinny surface demon my gaze rose up the broken spires as we approached there were only carved gargoyles perched on the lower ledges not real ones whether theyd abandoned the everafter along with the witches and elves or they had never existed here i didnt know apart from the missing gargoyles the building looked relatively untouched much like their version of fountain square i wondered if it was because it was holy or because they had a vested interest in keeping it intact trent halted beside me as i looked appraisingly at the door then he turned to watch our backs you think a front door is open i said wanting to be inside though if it was like the one in reality the only holy ground was limited to the expanse where the altar was a rock slid behind us head jerking like a startled deers trent took the stairs two at a time and tried all the doors none of them opened and seeing that there were no locks on the outside i started for the side door this way i whispered he nodded moving fast as he joined me i couldnt help the flash of memory of me coldcocking one of his fiancées bodyguards on the front steps to get in to arrest trent i still thought trent owed me a thankyou for breaking the wedding up him being a drug lord and murderer notwithstanding being married to that cold fish of a woman would have been cruel and unusual punishment trent took the lead and i followed at a slower pace watching the street when another slide of rock echoed through the ruined city the sickly moon had risen over the buildings the red glare making holes where there were none and disguising the real ones my fingers itched i wanted to unroll the everafter in my thoughts and flash enough light to send all the surface demons running but i had to reserve my spindle to do ceris charm that is if i didnt need it between then and now to save my skin the familiar sight of the twin stairways to the side door was a shock it was exactly the same and the untouched state of the cathedral made the rest of the city look twice as broken trent i whispered my knees weak why do you think everything is sort of parallel ive heard minias say when the two worlds collide is the everafter a mirror of our reality trent slowed as his eyes fell from the moon to land upon the expanse of trees growing where the side parking lot would have been maybe and its ruined because of the demons i jumped at a sharp click of stone maybe their turn didnt go very well no he said easing forward silently the trees where we crossed were more than forty years old if things went bad at the turn then they would be only that old elves left two thousand years ago and witches five if the everafter is a reflection of reality the similarities should have ended when we diverged and they seem to mirror each other up to almost today perhaps it doesnt make sense he took the nearest of the concrete stairs carefully and i followed watching behind me instead of my footing like anything makes sense here trent tried the door it was locked my lips pressed tight i set my satchel down to find jenkss lockpicking kit the sound of sliding rock quickened my cold fingers and trents gaze flicked everywhere as he waited i wanted to get off the street like yesterday i found the kit and after tucking it under my arm i zipped my bag closed a branch in the nearby trees waved wildly and a black something hit the earth shit trent put his back to the door watching do you think that maybe more than the buildings are parallel he asked as i crouched before the lock god id give just about anything for jenks you mean like people i wiggled my fingers for his special light and he handed it to me yes i shined the light on the lock sighing at its corroded state maybe i could kick the door in but then we couldnt shut it my thoughts went to trents question trying not to imagine a demon with the morals of trent i hope not i stood and his attention jerked to me im going to try to pick the lock i said watch my back okay damn it i didnt like where i was but i had no choice trent hesitated as if hearing more than i was asking then faced the trees i took a slow breath and tried to ignore the soughing of the wind and the grit that was making my eyes ache the case jenks had bought to hold his tools was soft on my coldnumbed fingertips and i fumbled at the ties holding it closed nice quiet ties instead of a noisy zipper the man was a thief at heart and had thought of everything the kit came silently open and in a flash of light that rocked me back jenks darted out holy crap rachel the small pixy swore shaking himself so the glowing dust lit my knees i thought i was going to be sick you bounce around like a grasshopper when you run are we there yet i stared slack jawed slowly losing my balance and falling to sit on my butt the basilica jenks questioned seeing trent standing speechless over us damn thats more freaky than a fairys third birthday party oh hey nice jumpsuit trent didnt anyone ever tell you the guy in the jumpsuit always gets eaten first jenks i finally managed you shouldnt be here the pixy flexed his wings landing on my knee and running a careful hand over one of the lower ones to straighten it out the light from him was clean and pure the only thing here that was really white like you should he said dryly i glanced at trent seeing by his tight features that he had already figured out the problem jenkstrent only bought four trips with you along we only have one left trent turned from the forest clearly angry that last remaining trip is mine im not responsible for your backups stupidity oh god i was stuck in the everafter hey you stupidass elf jenks exclaimed rising up in a burst of gold glitter there was a collective rustle from the shadowed trees and i got to my feet neither jenks nor trent noticed seeing as jenks currently had a drawn sword pointed at trents eyeball i am rachels backup he continued the glow from him making a spot of normal color on the scratched side door to the church i come with her and am included with her trip as much as her shoes and her hair scrunchy human law doesnt count our existence so neither should demon im an accessory mr elven magic he said bitterly so dont get your dancing tights in a twist you think id endanger raches life by using her pass to get here if i wasnt sure we both had a way out please please let him be right jenks saw my fear and his wings increased their pitch i dont count damn it i didnt use up one of your trips trent leaned forward to say something nasty but a huge chunk of rock slid into the nearby street interrupting him all three of us froze and jenks dampened his glow back off jenks i said cursing myself if theres only one trip left trent gets it rache he can bargain for more he should have included me anyway im not going to ask trent to bargain with anyone else he gets it i said fear bubbling through me black and thick he made the deal you changed it rache he was scared and i held out a hand for him to land on it damn it all to hell and back im glad youre here i said softly stifling a jerk at a rock plinking down trent can have his lousy trip he got us here we can get ourselves back thats what we do and thats even if we need to if minias doesnt know you hitched a ride we probably still have two jumps out jenkss wings had turned a dismal blue pixies dont count rachel we never do but he counted to me can you get the lock i said to change the subject we have to get off the street the pixy made a smug noise and dropped to the corroded lock tinks tampons he swore as he dug through the rust and slowly vanished inside leaving a faint glow this is like crawling through a sand hill crap matalinas gonna kill me the only thing worse than blood is rust i really hoped id get the chance to hear matalina ream him out i really did worried i put my back to the door and sent out a silent prayer that the surface demons would hold off a little longer i couldnt set a circle or draw on a line though i felt a strong one nearby from across the dry river where eden park would be if i tapped it a demon would come to investigate my gaze slid to trent i wasnt going to ask him to renegotiate for more trips out of here but fear clenched my stomach damn it jenks trents hands twitched and he looked worried why am i doing this again hows it coming jenks i muttered gimmie a minute came a faint call back theres a lot of corrosion and dont worry about the trip home rache i saw how minias did it hope was a surge of adrenaline and i met trents startled gaze can you teach me jenks emerged from the lock landing on the handle to shake the rust from himself in a burst of wing movement i dont know he said his voice stronger maybe if elfboy let me use the charm to go back and i could compare it to coming here no trent said grimly im not renegotiating because your sidekick tagged along anger made my face burn jenks is not a sidekick jenks rose up to land on my shoulder let it go rache trent couldnt buy a clue if he had a million bucks in a dollar store i saw what happened when minias shoved us through the lines the everafter is like a drop of time that got knocked out sitting alone by itself with no past behind it to push it forward and no future to pull it along its hanging to us by the ley lines sort of your circles arent made up of differing realities theyre made up of the stretchy stuff thats holding us and the everafter together keeping the everafter from vanishing like it should but ah i hear things coming so why dont we go in a drop of time i thought pushing the door open to see a smothering blackness the scent of dry paste met me and when a guttural cry broke the winds hush fear slid all the way to the bottom of my soul and wrung every breath of courage from me it had been distant but there had been a definite echo of movement from all around us go i hissed at trent and the elf dove in i snatched up my pack and followed moving as if the monster under the bed was ready to reach out and grab my ankle trent stopped in the middle of the doorway and i plowed into him we fell in the dim light coming through the door and as jenks swore and told us to shut it i breathed in a heavy dust and tried to get up trent managed it first slamming the door and cutting off the moonlight it was warmer inside without the wind i couldnt see at all and i listened to his fingers scrabbling at the lock and his breath loud and harsh in the blackness holy crap we just made it frozen i waited for a thump at the door but it never came you guys look stupid on the floor like that jenks said shaking himself until he glowed im going to check the doors if this really is the basilica i know exactly where they are back in a sec the pure glow from him darted off to leave a fading ribbon of falling dust god i was so glad he was here a red haze from trents penlight eased into existence his face was haggard and dust streaked and his jumpsuit was filthy with a white ashlike film the light did little to illuminate anything else and we got to our feet mr elf has a getoutofjailfree card and i dont frankly id rather have jenks ive got a brighter light he offered you want to wait to use it until we hear back fromjenks my brow eased slightly and i felt a little more charitable that is an excellent idea i said wishing hed shine what light we did have around a little more especially upward no one in the movies ever looks up until the saliva starts dripping down i was digging out my own light when the formidable sound of the power thunking on echoed through the church both trent and i fell into a crouch when the glare of electric lights burst into existence blinking we rose our gazes traveling over the inside of the small cathedral time i thought again as my lips parted the everafter is a splash out of time held to us by the ley lines and being dragged along so why is it so parallel i had no idea but the basilica looked like the one id dragged trent out of well sort of a dingy yellow foam covered the inside of the stainedglass windows to block any light from entering or escaping the pews had been shoved to the back of the sanctuary in a pile of halfburnt varnished wood smoke and fire damage marked the walls and ceilings the christening wellgod save me it was full of what looked like blackened bones and hair utterly defiled an ugly stain of black ringed it blood i wasnt going over to look my eyes finally went up and tears pricked the beautiful woodwork was still there and the chandeliers faintly tinkling a haze of white was slipping from them in a fog the flow of electricity shaking loose the dust to sift down on the tiled floor gouged by a past fury trent moved and my gaze shot past him to the altar it stood on a raised stage and it too was covered in black stains something really ugly had happened i felt my expression twist and i shut my eyes either the sanctity had been broken or it had been defiled by witches or elves if it was a different time how far ahead were we i refused to look at the defiled altar as i followed trent onto the stage i thought i felt a shiver pass through my aura as i stepped onto holy ground and when i looked at trent he nodded its still holy he said glancing at the altar lets find the samples and get out of here easy for you to say i thought bitterly not trusting jenkss opinion that he didnt count the dry clatter of pixy wings intruded and my relief was almost a pain when jenks shot in from the back rooms my easing of tension was shortlived though as he landed on my extended fist gray and clearly shaken dont go out there rachel he whispered the clear tracks of tears showing strongly on his rustdusted face please dont go out there stay here ceri said the samples were here on holy ground you dont need to go anywhere else promise me just promise me you wont leave this room fear made a lump at my core and i nodded id stay here where are the samples i said turning to see trent running his hand over the woodwork as if he was looking for a secret panel the yellow foam on the windows seemed to soak up the light my breath hissed in and trent froze at the sound of nails something was crawling on the outside of the glass my god i said retreating to the altar to put my back against it as i looked up trent do you have any weapons like a gun he looked at me in disgust youre here to protect me he said as he closed the distance between us and stood beside me you didnt bring a weapon yeah i brought a weapon i snapped as i brought my splat gun out and aimed it at the ceiling where the sounds were coming from i just thought that since youre a freaking murderer you might have a gun too god trent please tell me you brought one jaw clenched he shook his head no but he touched a wide side pocket in his jumpsuit for reassurance he might not have a gun but he had something fine mr kalamack had a secret weapon he didnt want to share i hoped he wouldnt have to use it heart pounding i watched the yellow foam and tried to slow my breathing how were we going to do this while under attack if i set a circle for protection real demons would be all over us jenks i called out when a new scrabbling started from the other side of the church shit there were two out there now can you hear a hard drive or anything ceri said they stored everything by computer we need to do this fast face gray jenks rose up on a thin sparkle of gold that took on an amber tint it was almost as if the red glow from outside was seeping in ill look he darted off and hands sweating i tracked the sound of that second set of nails as it traveled over the ceiling to where the first was digging the first seven uglies through would be taking a nap but unless they were cannibals and ate their dead there were probably going to be a lot more surface demons coming at us than i had sleepy charms for the two scrabbling sounds joined and i stiffened at a sharp crack followed by a thump there was a cry then the desperate raking of claws on stone and glass all the way to the ground i listened not moving or daring to breathe a gargoyle i thought there were gargoyles here they were fiercely loyal to their churches and would defend them against attack it was the only explanation unless both had fallen but it had sounded as if it had only been one trent sighed in relief but i kept staring at the high windows not trusting that it hadnt simply been two klutzy surface demons and that more wouldnt be coming i think were okay he said and i just looked at him in disbelief wanna bet guys over here jenks called out as he hovered before a white statue of mother mary theres an electronic whine coming from under it giving trent a last look i tucked my splat gun into my pants at the small of my back and left the altar to join jenks the pixy had sunk down to sit on the statues shoulder looking somehow right in between her heart and her halo trent had come with me and before i could say anything he stretched to put his hands on her knees clearly planning to shove her over no i exclaimed not knowing why except she was the only thing in here on the ground floor not marked up and defiled but trent scowled and as i grasped his shoulder to jerk him back he reached out pain raced through my arm and into my chest cramping my muscles like an electric shock i heard trent yelp and i must have passed out because the next thing i knew i was laying on the floor four feet back with jenks hovering in front of me rachel he cried and i put a hand to my aching head my arm moving slower than it should have as i propped myself up are you all right i took a breath then another my roving gaze found trent sitting crosslegged and holding his head his nose was bleeding stupidass elf i muttered feeling my heartbeat you stupidass elf i shouted and jenks flew backward smiling in relief youre okay he sighed the sparkles sifting from him turning a clear silver what in hell is wrong with you i yelled my voice echoing against the distant ceiling you dont think its protected trent looked up jenks was sitting on it jenks is a pixy i exclaimed to burn off some angst no one takes them into account because they dont know how dangerous they are you dumb crap of a businessman you are completely out of your element so just sit there okay you got me here now let the professionals work or your insufferable smarterthanthou attitude is going to get us killed i said id protect you and get you home but i need you to stop doing stupid stuff justsit there and do nothing the last was shouted but i was really mad god help you i swore as i got up and shook the last of the cramping out of my hand now i have a headache thanks a hell of a lot jenks was grinning and my brow furrowed at my unprofessional show of anger bout time you put him in his place he said and my frown deepened yeah i muttered as i creakily moved to the statue and stood before sweet mother mary and her smug smile with my fists on my hips but how are we going to get to the samples jenkss wings increased their pitch and i looked at his expression of satisfaction immediately i felt my own expression ease you already have a way in i asked he nodded theres a crack in the base small enough for a mouse ill get them my breath slipped from me in an audible sigh the magic protecting the statue didnt recognize him he didnt count the thing was he did count he counted a lot and he was going to save my butt again thanks jenks i whispered hey thats what im here for he said then darted behind the statue and was gone i had a trip home i really thought i might maybe the silence was loud as i turned to find trent still messing with his nose the scent of blood seemed to pull whispers from the shadows at the christening pool and though i knew it was my imagination it was freaking me out going to the limit of the holy ground i sat on the top step remembering standing here at trents wedding right before i arrested him i could feel trents presence behind me but didnt turn he was silent for about six heartbeats and then i heard him rise from outside at the base of the front doors came scratching a soft digging sound that gave me the willies it started and stopped as if afraid but the door was a lot thicker than the glass windows i forced my breathing to stay even when trent stopped five feet from me and just stared swinging my waist pack around i took out my last water and downed it my splat gun was next to it and bringing it out i sighted down it at the front door trent looked me up and down is that all youre going to do my pulse quickened and i gazed at the front of the basilica where the scratching was coming from i might have a snack later if nothing comes through those doors jenkss voice came echoing up sounding hollow i found a terminal he shouted its in a cement room with no doors i squeezed in through the wiring tore my freaking wing tinks dildo im leaking enough dust to be a lightning rod its going to take me some time to hack in and figure out their system but i can do it i pulled my satchel with my spelling stuff closer if jenks was using tinks name in vain he was okay the sun would rise at seven and minias would be free if we werent out of here by then it was going to get a whole lot nastier holy ground or not a wooden door and a maybegargoyle wouldnt stop a real demon not by a long shot trent sighed easing himself down to sit on the stairs with his knees almost up to his chin and now we wait twentyseven i flipped my splat gun out of my waistband letting it spin like a gunslingers pistol before aiming it at the distant door the scratching there had quit hours ago shortly after the sound of a large rock hitting the pavement shook the dust from the ceiling apparently the gargoyles were still around that had made me feel secure enough that id managed to grab a few winks a couple of hours ago while trent stood guard the watchon loan from ivyabout my wrist said it was twenty minutes to sunrise twenty minutes before all hell was going to break loose and here i was playing gunslinger trent would be able to pop out when things got rough with his freaking magic word but i had a circle drawn beside the altar for jenks and me to hide in if worse came to worst it ought to hold until newt showed my spelling supplies to take als name were in it just waiting for the focusing object i was going to work the curse as soon as jenks found the demons dna if i didnt survive at least everyone i cared about would be safe hurry up jenks bang i whispered then pulled the gun back to me and tucked it in at the small of my back i was dying to go out and see what had hit the street before the front door tired i glanced at the statue then trent sitting slumped with his back against the defiled altar he had nodded off for a few hours around midnight trusting id keep him safe this was taking it right to the wireand that was assuming i had a ride home crap i was tired of this the theoretical charm shop jenks sometimes mocked me with was looking mighty good right now sure i had been all spit and indignant righteousness when i told trent that jenks hadnt used my ride home to get to the everafter but the last few hours before sunrise were dragging deep across my soul and i feared that i was living in a fairy tale if i expected minias to accept that jenks was a hair scrunchy and deserved a free ride trent felt me looking at him and woke up his eyes were puffy from the grit and tired and his face showed his strain i looked away and stretched for my hat dropping it onto my head and pulling it low so i couldnt see him exhaling i forced the tension out maybe i could figure ley line traveling out if there werent demons breathing down my neck like the last time until jenks came up with als cellular sample there was nothing else to do id been trying to piece it together all night my eyes shut and i made my muscles relax if jenks was right ley lines were what kept the everafter connected to reality all i had to do was learn how to use them and jenks and i would be home free sure easy stuff like i had a hundred times already tonight i reached a thought out to the nearest line but didnt tap it afraid a demon would sense me doing it i lingered there feeling the energy rush past my consciousness like a redsheened silver ribbon it suddenly occurred to me that the energy was flowing oneway into our reality was the everafter shrinking its substance flowing into our reality like water is drawn to puddle up from a small drop into a larger one maybe that was why the everafter was all broken up tension filtered back tightening my muscles one by one as i tried to remember what it had felt like when id been carried along the lines of energy the thought of ivy had brought me home once my face warmed newt had said i loved ivy more than the church i wasnt going to deny it but there were all kinds of love and how shallow would i be if my anchor to reality was a hunk of real estate it was the people who were there that made it mean something the flush cooled as i remembered the feeling of my soul breaking apart and how newt had held my consciousness until i had a body again had the shift between realities fractured my soul or just my body i moved my knees to feel theyd stiffened my eyes opened and i stared at the new rings of dust under the chandeliers i couldnt even smell the burnt amber on me anymore and that bothered me i jumped when trent sat down beside me i had forgotten he was here pulse pounding i shifted down an inch or two wondering what he wanted getting antsy was he i uh want to thank you he said when it was obvious i wasnt going to break the awkward silence surprised i glanced at ivys watch tickitytock jenks youre welcome he pulled his knees up which made him look odd in his black jumpsuit dont you want to know what for expression neutral to maintain the facade that everything was going according to plan i gestured at the broken cathedral for keeping you alive on this magic carpet ride he looked at the shattered room for stopping my wedding blinking i cautiously offered you didnt love her his gaze had dulled and his hair was white with dust i didnt have the chance to find out trent wants to love someone curious ceri ceri wants nothing to do with me he stated he let his knees fall to stretch his legs down the stairs his usually collected features scrunched up why do i need to marry someone anyway its politics thats all i stared seeing him as a young man in a position of power being asked to marry have children live a nice quiet life of hidden intrigue and public showmanship poor poor mr trent that didnt stop you with ellasbeth i said pushing for more i dont respect ellasbeth dont respect or dont fear her i ran my gaze up from his boots to his cap youre welcome i said but i arrested you to put you in jail not to save you from ellasbeth jenks had helped quen steal the evidence that trent had murdered the weres and the fib had to let him go and yet trent was taking the last ride out of the everafter instead of sticking around and helping us bargain for two more trips ah well it really wasnt his problem was it a faint smile quirked his lips dont tell quen but the jail time was worth it my smile grew to match his then faded thank you for bringing jenks home i said then added and my shoes those are my favorite pair looking askance at me he almost smiled no problem but i dont appreciate you putting my future kids on the demon radar i said and his expression became questioning god he didnt even know he had done it i dont know if that made it better or worse jaw tight i added telling minias my kids will be healthy and possibly able to kindle demon magic his jaw dropped and i clasped my knees to my chest idiot i muttered he hadnt even known what he had done my gaze slid to my watch then the foamcovered windows the light outside would be growing red and sickly the wind rising the gargoyles might have been able to keep us safe in here at night but as soon as the sun rose they would be dormant even worse not only was i not going to have time to do the spell i was likely not even going to get the sample i had a bad feeling minias would show up the moment he was free come on jenks trents boots scraped the decayed carpeting to show the wood underneath sorry yeah that makes it all better if theres only one trip out ill try to get you back he said suddenly surprise washed through me almost a hurt and i jerked my head up excuse me he was staring at the front door looking as if he had a bad taste in his mouth we couldnt have done this without jenks if minias considers him a person ill try to arrange two more trips out if i can i took a breath having forgotten to breathe why you dont owe us anything his lips parted and closed and he shrugged i want to be more thanthis he said gesturing to himself what in hell was going on dont get me wrong he said glancing furtively at me and away if it comes to sending you home and being a hero or being a bastard by sending myself home and saving my species im going to be a bastard but ill try to get you home if i can my breath came and went and i tried to wrap my thoughts around what had changed in him it had to be ceri the womans complete disdain for trent was starting to get to him she didnt excuse his actions and saw right through his surface attempts at making up for his pastthinking the attempts made him worse not better her soul was black her past filthy with unimaginable deeds but she carried herself with a noble strength knowing that though she broke the law with impunity she was loyal to those she owed allegiance to and loved and perhaps trent was seeing it for the first time as a strength not a weakness shes not going to ever love you i said and his eyes closed i know but someone might youre still a murdering bastard his eyes opened a spot of green in the dusty gray surrounding us thats not going to change that i could believe needing to move i rose and went to stand before the statue jenks i shouted were running out of moonlight it was too late to do the curse we were down to snatch and run you arent so lily white yourself trent said stop throwing stones stiffening i spun i got my demon smut trying to save my butt nothing died with a soft huff trent pulled his knees to himself and turned on the top stair to face me such a nice friendly witch helping the fib and little old ladies find their familiars how many bodies are at your feet rachel heat hit me and my breath caught oh that there were bodies in my past i lived with a vampire who had probably killed people and i willingly accepted that kistens hands hadnt been clean either jenks had killed to keep his children alive and would do so again without thought i had intentionally killed peter though he had wanted to die peter doesnt count i said hip cocked and trent shook his head as if i were a child you murder people outright i said indignantly you killed three weres for business last summer and were going to let my friend take the blame brett only wanted to belong to something that it still hurt surprised me we are exactly the same rachel were both prepared to kill to protect what we care for it simply comes up a lot more often with me you murdered a living vampire to protect your way of life that he wanted to die was simply a pretty bow around it we are nothing alike i said you kill for business and profit i did what i had to do to keep the balance between the vamps and the weres full of indignant anger i looked down at him as he sat on the stairs are you saying i shouldnt have smiling beatifically trent said no you did the right thing exactly what i would have done what im saying is that the rest of us would appreciate it if you would stop working against the system and start working in it with you i said caustically and he shrugged your talents my contacts im going to change the world you can have a say in it disgusted i turned my back on him arms crossed over my chest demons were about to chew our noses off and he was still trying to woo me into working for him but here i was doing just that god i was such an idiot i already have a say in it i muttered rache came a warbling call from the statue and my heart jumped i got als i backed up a step pulse fast when jenks burst from behind the statue trailing a thin ribbon of gold dust i looked for your sample he said dropping a pinkynailsize ampoule of black sludge into my grip but you dont have one i guess you werent als familiar long enough if al ever tries to reverse the curse hes going to have to get a sample from you thank you i said dizzy as i looked at the little drop of nothing in my hand that was al id risked my life for this heart pounding i looked at ivys watchten minutes to sunup i was going to use it now get trents sample i said lurching to the circle already scribed out on the wooden floor where the carpet had been burned away i wasnt going to tap a line and set it unless we were interrupted at that point it wouldnt matter if i rang the damned bell trent followed and i almost smacked into him as he tried to get a look at als blood thats it he said and i pulled back from his reaching hand its over five thousand years old it cant be any good jenkss wings snapped aggressively its magic you big cookie fart if you can read a dna sample off a nasty mummified elf corpse then rachel can use a fivethousandyearold drop of blood for a demon curse i dropped to my knees inside the circle and set the precious vial aside to brush the dirt from a swath of burned oak what about my sample trent asked his voice tense as if we might betray him in the last hour his eyes were very green and i watched the emotion pass behind them i havent been able to find one jenks dropped an inch in altitude i cant just type in ancient precurse elf it would help if i had a name trent glanced at me his face tight with sudden nerves try searching for kallasea he said and i slowed kallasea an older version of kalamack perhaps give me a sec jenks said and darted away nervous as much from what i was doing as from trent watching me do it i sent my gaze over my stuff white candle to serve as my hearth firecheck ugly bigass knifecheck two candles representing al and mecheck bag of sea saltcheck ungodly expensive piece of magnetic chalk that i wasnt going to usecheck little fivesided pyramid made out of coppercheck ceris written instructions and phonetically spelled latin curserolled up like a scroll and shoved in the bottom of my bagdidnt need it i had memorized everything while sitting on the steps of the basilicas altar feeling trents eyes on me i pinched the wick of the white candle muttering consimilis calefacio as i let it go the spindled power in me dropped making me glad i was lighting one candle to function as a hearth fire instead of lighting the two candles individually by magic the flame flickered like a spot of purity amid the defiled air and i held my breath and counted to ten no demon showed up just as i had expected they wouldnt know i was here as long as i didnt tap a line i could do the spell trents hesitant movements just outside my vision stopped what are you doing my jaw tightened but i said nothing as i took my bag of salt and carefully spilled it out into the shape of an elongated figure eight it was a modified möbius strip this curse was one of the few id ever seen that didnt use a pentagram and i wondered if it was a completely different branch of magic maybe this wouldnt hurt so much rachel trent prompted and i sat back on my heels and puffed a curl that had escaped my hat out of my way ive got ten minutes and im going to do the curse that will keep al from being summoned out of the everafter now he said wonder bringing his manicured eyebrows up you said demons could feel you tap a line theyll be on us in seconds fingers trembling i carefully placed the pyramid of copper where the salt lines crossed which is why im going to do this without the protection of a circle i said i have enough everafter spindled inside me to do it ceri said i did i trusted her though twisting a curse without a circle had me really really nervous trents soft boots shifted in a show of protest and i ignored him as i dug through the bag looking for the stick of redwood i had forgotten to pull out earlier why are you risking it he said youre doing a demon curse before the sun comes up in the everafter in a defiled church cant you do this when you get home if i get home i accused he was silent and i set the flat piece of wood beside als sample if i dont make it i want to die knowing my friends wont be taking the punishment al has aimed at me hell be trapped in the everafter i eyed him for ever after trent sat down where he could watch both me and the statue satisfied he wouldnt say anything else i balanced the tonguedepressorlike stick of wood on the pyramid the two ends hanging over the open loops of the möbius strip i was trying really hard not to think about what he had said about twisting a curse this close to sunup this was bad i mean really bad okay he said startling me and i looked up incredulous that he thought i was waiting for his permission well im glad i have your approval fingers shaking i took the red candle for al and placed it in the loop farthest from me setting it with the word alius the gold one i set in my loop with the word ipse gold my aura hadnt been its original gold in a long time but to use a black candle would just about kill me i poured a handful of salt into my grip and after muttering a few words of latin over it to give it meaning i mixed it back and forth before dividing it equally and sifting it around the base of each unlit candle with the same words quickly before trent could distract me i lit the candles with the hearth candle again using the same words a final time they were set three ways with the same strength and were immutable it was a very secure beginning who taught you how to light candles with your thoughts trent asked and i jumped ceri i said brusquely will you be quiet please i added and he stood stiffly going to stand beside the statue and out of my sight i felt my blood pressure drop and moving slowly so as not to unbalance the stick of redwood i snapped the tip of the ampoule off and tapped three rubyblack drops from it onto als side of the stick the scent of burnt amber rose almost chokingly thick my eyes watered while i fumbled for the ceremonial knife almost done it wasnt that difficult a curse and hardly any magic was involved the tough part had been in getting the samples and i had mine right here while trent watched from behind i pricked my index finger my heart pounded at the sudden jolt and i massaged three drops out to land on my end of the stick my shaking increased as i pushed out a drop more of blood and smeared it on the red candle the curse was done but for the invocation no demon would sense what i had done i wasnt tapped into any line the energy would come from the spindle in my chi i looked at my watch then trent i had to do this i didnt like it but i liked my other choices even less taking a deep breath i closed my eyes evulgo i whispered to start it i had used this word before i had a feeling it was to register the curse a feeling that strengthened when a wave of disconnection slipped over me and i felt the eerie sensation of being in a large room with hundreds of people all talking at once and ignoring everyone my heart was pounding i could feel the curse strengthening in me winding its way through my dna becoming me pulsing with the force of an unheard heart dizzy i opened my eyes trent was standing above me there was a faint glow of yellow surrounding him i looked at my hands seeing my aura for the first time without the aid of the scrying mirror it was beautiful gold and pure no smut i could have cried seeing it if only it would last but i knew it was only because things were in flux are you okay he said and i nodded i had to finish this before i chickened out mouth dry i turned the stick a hundred and eighty degrees to move his sample to my loop and vice versa omnia mutantur i whispered invoking the curse all things change i thought then jumped when a feeling of being peeled out of my skin rippled over me my hands shook and when i looked my aura was gone it justwasnt there i had no choice i said to trent in explanationmaybe apologythen clenched my gut when the imbalance hit me pain struck deep doubling me over and i pushed violently away in a panic my foot scattered the curse as i curled into a ball and i smelled extinguished candle jenks trent shouted somethings wrong i couldnt breathe bent into myself i tried to open my eyes my face scraped against the decaying carpet and i grunted as i tried to find control my head felt like it was splitting in two and i cracked my lids desperate to see that made it worse oh god the imbalance was stronger than anything id ever felt before rache you okay jenks said inches from me as he hovered over the carpet i got one clean breath in before the pain hit me again i didnt want it but the imbalance would kill me if i didnt take it as my own hold her jenks shouted i cant help her damn it trent hold her before she hurts herself he demanded and i sobbed when i felt trents arms go around me to keep me from rolling down the stairs i take it i gasped my head exploding and my chest cramping i take the damn curse like a light switch cutting off my muscles quit seizing and i sucked in a ragged breath of air that tasted like candle smoke i took another breath then another content to simply exist without pain slowly my muscles relaxed leaving only my throbbing head trent was sitting behind me with his arms wrapped around me my face was wet and trent let go when i moved to wipe the dampness and carpet off my cheek slow and lethargic i looked at my hand to make sure it had been tears and not blood i wiped away my head hurt that badly im okay i rasped and trents hold dropped i heard him slide away and get up jenks was watching us from a railing his face pale and pinched did any demons show up i asked him and he shook his head utterly wiped i shifted myself farther from trent embarrassed and trying to find some semblance of self again i had done it damn it it hurt so much that it had to have worked i looked at my hands both wanting to and fearing i might see an alien aura they were shaking my aura was again hidden and i was too afraid to ask jenks if it was mine or als or nonexistent i looked at jenks and he smiled its yours he said and my eyes closed as a lump grew in my throat i pushed the emotion down we had a run to finish do you have trents sample i asked we have to get out of here id cry later over what i had done to myself right now we had to leave its coming he said i found it under kallasea female elf installed inthree fiftyseven bc if i did my subtraction right they mark everything from when the elves abandoned the everafter your court date wouldnt have come up for five years the pixy laughed thats what organized justice will do to you rome didnt fall it was strangled in red tape bring it to me trent shouted and both jenks and i jumped all right all right he muttered as he zipped to the statue dont have a hairy fart they mark the years the same as us i thought shoving things into my bag and hesitating when i couldnt find als sample where in hell had it rolled to got it came a faint call and jenks burst back out in a glitter of gold sparkles a new ampoule was in his grip with a faint amber tint to the glass trent gazed hungrily up at him looking like rex following a pixy toddler once i had a name it was as easy as pulling the wings off a fairy jenks said smugly you got anything sweet in your backpack i havent eaten in hours damn im as tired as a pixy on his wedding night sorry jenks i didnt know you were coming or i would have brought something trent was shaking the impatient man snatching up his pack and holding out his hand i have some chocolate he said give me the sample and its yours we were going to do it we were going to get out of here provided the curse trent bought from minias worked if it didnt jenks and i were really screwed jenks snapped his wings together with a loud crack in anticipation excellent he said then froze in midair uh rachel he said every last speck of dust vanishing from him i dont feel right can it wait until we get home i said checking ivys watch crap the sun was up there was a soft puff of displaced air and my head jerked up someone had just popped in shit but when i scanned the room it was empty jenks i said feeling cold trent stared at me one foot on the stairs wheres your pixy had someone cursed him into nothing i stared at the fading cloud of dust my heart clenching in fear jenks trent lurched up onto the stage wheres my sample hes gone he used the last curse and left us here no i protested he wouldnt how could he he doesnt even know it then why isnt the curse working he shouted its not working rachel youre asking me i snapped back im not the one who bargained for it maybe we need to go back to where we came in dont blame my partner if you made a bad bargain trent gave me a murderous look silent he took the stairs and headed for the side door hey i shouted where are you going he never slowed to put distance between us before someone tracks you down if surface demons can hide from demons so can i i never should have trusted you trusting a morgan killed my family im not going to let it kill me the harsh red glare of the sun spilled in when he yanked the door open squinting i glimpsed a flash of purple prestorm sky a gust sent my hair flying and atomized the dust circles then the door swung shut cutting off the light and wind heart pounding i knelt to shove the last of my curse stuff into my bag jenks i shouted clueless as to where hed gone to we gotta go pulse fast i ran out after trent the light was blinding after the soft glow of electric lights damn it trent i shouted as my feet hit the concrete stoop i cant get you home in one piece if you run off like that arms pinwheeling i skidded to a stop on the narrow landing outside the door there in the shade of the trees was minias with three of those demons in red trent was slumped on the ground before their feet he wasnt moving crap on toast theyd known we were here the instant minias had been slung back home with the sun hand fumbling for my splat gun i turned to retreat only to run into miniass chest no i shrieked but i was too close to do anything and he pinned my arms to my sides he was in the sun and i could see his pupils slitted like a goats and the red of his irises so deep that it almost looked brown yes he said pinching my arms until i gasped in pain what by the two worlds have you been doing rachel mariana morgan wait i babbled i can pay i know stuff i want to go home minias sent one eyebrow rising you are home there was a pop from under the trees and minias grimaced as he looked toward it that witch is mine came als distinctive voice and minias wrapped a possessive arm around me shes got my mark the demon raged give her to me she wears newts mark too minias said and i have possession of her a ribbon of panic pulled through me i had to do something i didnt think al knew i had his summoning name or hed be yammering about that not the lousy mark he had put on my wrist i had to get out of here i had to reach my splat gun grunting in effort i wiggled and twisted minias swung me around my legs folded awkwardly under me as he slammed my ass onto the concrete i reached for the cement trying to find my feet and run at the same time but minias put a hand on my shoulder pinning me a wave of something flowed from him and i stiffened as i struggled to breathe through the sensation of every last erg of ley line power being pulled from me it was the opposite of als lineoverload punishment and it felt like rape i struggled to flee but his hand on my shoulder pinched harder minias looked down at me and the scent of amber flowed from him as his gaze took on an inquisitive hue trying to steal als name to prevent him from being summoned out was a good idea bad idea to attempt to implement though no one has ever gotten past that statue they didnt know they didnt know i had done it and my success gave me a burst of hope soon as they figured it out al was going to be pissed but if i could escape id be okay i could tap a line and hit minias with it but hed probably just pull it out from me again and my soul was still ringing from his first invasion if i was going to escape itd have to be physically gathering myself i tried to break free but he knew what i was going to do before i did it the moment i had my feet he simply jerked me off balance into him his yellowclad arm wrapped around me tightening until i almost couldnt breathe at least i can see now i thought as i spat the hair out of my mouth the wind was worse with the sun being up and my hair was gritty and my lips tasted of burnt amber the red light hurt my eyes no wonder witches had left to live in an unpolluted worldfleeing a dying everafter to exist among humans stay hidden jenks wherever you are al was striding out from under the trees his whitegloved hands in murderous fists that witch is mine he spat ill fight this all the way through the courts newt owns the courts minias said coolly you want the witch you can buy her like anyone else they were going to sell me al stopped at the base of the stairs frustrated my mark came first and that means what minias sniffed and a pair of wraparound glasses appeared on his face give me permission to jump you underground through the lines he said to me its disgusting up here my chest hurt and i wondered if the earth charms in my gun were still good no from the gray slump that was trent came a raspy never one of the demons nudged him with his foot and a shocking scream burst from trent quickly stifled and turned into a ragged gasp of air pity filled me as i remembered the agony of al forcing me to hold more everafter than i could bear it felt as if your soul were on fire tears warmed my eyes and i shut them when trent passed out and the ugly sounds stopped this one at least is mine minias said tag him as a novelty and work up a brief history so the collectors will be interested dont take a lot of time rachel mariana morgan will be the highticket item you cant auction her off shes mine ive been grooming her for over a year al threatened and the tails of his green velveteen coat flapped as he strode up the steps his chiseled face was hard and he squinted as if his tinted glasses were ineffective i marked her first newts claim is secondary this is my job my teeth clenched but i could do nothing when trent and the demon who had touched him into unconsciousness vanished the courts will decide minias said yanking me out of als reach als strong jaw clenched and his hands turned into fists i wasnt all that joyjoy about it either and i struggled when minias gave me a shake and said let me jump you i shook my head and he shrugged tapping a line he was going to try to stun me the same way they had stunned trent i felt it coming and i opened my thoughts to take it gasping as everafter energy roared into me i spindled it panting with the effort miniass eyebrows furrowed and he turned to al you ass he shouted you taught a witch how to spindle a line as well you lied to the courts dali cant help you now al jerked back a step i did not he said indignantly they never asked and i bound her to condition as tight as the elf s what is the problem here i have control of the situation i had two demons fighting over me seconds maybe i reached for a line minias felt it bloody hell he swore shes trying to jump he shouted shaking me now how do we contain her i touched the line willing it to take me my thoughts on ivy but a thick whitegloved fist swung to meet my temple it ripped me from miniass grip and i fell my hands getting between me and the cement at the last moment palms scraping someones foot slammed into my gut and gasping for air i rolled into the basilicas side door unable to breathe i stared at the ugly red sky and felt the wind on my face like that al snarled leave catching familiars to the experts minias i felt minias pick me up my arms dangling holy sweet spit shes still not out then you hit her again al said and another burst of pain sent me into nothing twentyeight my head hurt actually the entire right side of my face hurt not just my head a deep throbbing ache that seemed to come from the bone and pulse in time with my heart i was slumped facedown on something warm and softly yielding like the mats at the gym my eyes were closed and words whispered at the edge of my awareness fading into the hum of a distant fan when i concentrated on them i shifted my head to get up slowing when my neck complained i put a hand to it and pulled my legs under me to find an upright position the sound of my leather pants scraping the floor was soft the echoes nonexistent my eyes opened but i couldnt see a difference one hand on my neck one sort of propping myself up i tugged davids coat out from under me and took a slow breath i was wetmy hair damp and the taste of salt water on my lips the cool certainty of charmed silver rested upon my wrist swell trent i whispered are you here there was a rough harrumph chilling me good evening rachel mariana morgan it was al i froze in panic trying to see there was a click six feet in front of me and i scuttled backward crying out in surprise when my back hit a wall fear was a sharp goad i tried to rise and my head hit the ceiling a mere four feet up ow i yelped falling down and moving like a crab until i found a corner my pulse hammered and i strained to see everything was black it was as if my eyes were gone als low mocking laugh grew in depth then faded with a bitter sound stupid witch stay away i demanded pulse hammering and my knees to my chin i wiped the last of the salt water from my face and pushed my hair back you come near me and ill make sure you never engender any little demons ever if i could touch you al said his accent clear and precise youd be dead youre in jail love want to be my shower buddy i wiped my face again slowly letting my knees fall from my chest how long i asked have you been here al murmured lightly same as me all day how long will you remain just until i get out and then ill be back im looking forward to joining you in that tiny box of a cell youre in fear slid through me then was gone feeling better he almost purred come over here by the bars love and ill rub your aching head for you rub it right off your skinny little shoulders hatred nearly dripped from his soothing voice still so elegant and refined okay i was in jail i knew why i was in jail but why was al then i winced wondering if i could have pissed the demon off any more hed warned me not to tell anyone i knew how to spindle line energy and then i went and did it in front of minias they had caught al in a lie of omission and i didnt think he could put any kind of spin on it to make it look good squinting to try to make the black haze take shape i began to move with my hand outstretched making a point of staying far from als voice my ears strained to catch the echo of my breathing against the maybewalls but i heard nothing a soft touch of fabric on my searching fingers jerked me to a stop then i reached out it was a warm body that smelled like blood and cinnamon trent i whispered worriedly as i crouched closer and sent my hands over him they had put us there together oh god are you all right for the moment he said do you mind not touching me his very awake tone shocked me and i jerked back youre all right i exclaimed as the warmth of embarrassment turned to a mild anger why didnt you say anything what would be the point i eased back and sat crosslegged as i heard him shift i couldnt see but i guessed he was leaning into the opposite corner it was the best place in the cell seeing as it was farthest from al i think a shiver rose through me and i stifled it al was there i was here i wished i could see what are they going to do with us i asked trent how long have you been awake a faint exhalation gave evidence of a sigh too long and what do you think theyre going to do with us there was the slosh of water in a plastic bottle and i grew ten times more thirsty we were caught trent said his gray voice empty of hope i woke up here al cleared his throat dryly theres a small question being debated right now as to the legality of my claim on you he said and i wondered why he bothered except that he was probably bored and didnt like being ignored you had to go and show them that you could spindle energy they dont even care that i nullified the threat deciding to drop me here and let me think about what ive done soon as im summoned out ill pop back in throttle you to death then throw your dead carcass on dalis floor and claim i was handling it and they owe me restitution for interfering he still didnt know i had his summoning name and couldnt be pulled across the lines but my brief relief died what did it matter hed find out soon enough my thoughts flicked to jenks and my heart seemed to fall to my gut wed been so close god i hoped he was okay the jiggling of water against plastic drew my hand up and fumbling i found the container trent was extending for me i didnt bother wiping the top before i took a swig and i grimaced at the unexpected taste of burnt amber thank you i said then gave it back this is your water from your pack we have our stuff my eyes widened in the dark do you have your light i heard trent shift his feet broken yours too for the psychological effect im sure seeing as thats all they did apart from putting the bands of charmed silver on us and dousing us in salt water yeah i said feeling wet and icky i figured that part out not bothering to search for my bag i mentally catalogued what i had shoved into it nothing really and with the band of charmed silver around my wrist i couldnt even light the candle but then my eyebrows rose and moving carefully i felt the small of my back my lips parted when i felt the cool plastic they left me my splat gun pulse fast i drew it aiming where i had heard als voice maybe i said as i thumbed the safety off they dont think were a threat maybe al said they dont care if we kill each other you hit me with that and i wont kill you when i get out but just play with you until you die screaming my hand shook just a little and i strained to see in the dark just because you cant see doesnt mean i cant al said it wont land at this distance witch but by all means waste them it will make it far easier to beat you into submission when i get in there he wasnt getting out but i put the safety back on and tucked the gun away at the small of my back i wasnt enough of a fool to think the demons had put me here without knowing i had viable charms on me theyd taken everything i could use to escape but left me a way to protect myself was it a test or just their twisted version of reality tv i slumped and leaned my head against the wall most likely it was a matter of letting us settle this demon to witch and if i beat him newt would have a better legal shot at me the light band of silver around my wrist felt heavier than any chain i didnt even try to tap a line and figure out how to jump out of here i was caught and it looked like i wasnt going to get out of it this time almost sundown al said from the darkness his voice eager a few moments and ill be free you were a fool thinking you could pin me in the everafter by taking my summoning name no one has ever gotten past that bitch of a statue no one ever will sundown he seemed pretty sure someone would summon him out when they didnt he was going to be royally ticked and i scooted back even farther a quiver in the middle of my chi started i froze my hand to my lower gut id never felt anything like this hollow ache before and it was growing worse i dont feel so good i whispered to trent but it wasnt like he cared al made a harsh bark of laughter you shouldnt have drunk that water it had been exposed to the sun im fine trent said his soft voice darker than the warm air that surrounded us youre an elf al said with disdain elves are little more than animals they can eat anything i groaned pressing a hand to my stomach no i said breathily looking downward i really dont feel good oh god im going to spew in front of trent but every muscle in my body shook as a sneeze ripped through me instead minias i thought as i wiped an arm under my nose but there was nothing in my mind but my own thoughts bless you trent said sarcastically i sneezed again and the ache in my middle grew my eyes widened and i flung a hand out to smack against the floor for balance i felt like i was falling my insides were falling panicking i reached out to grip trent somethings wrong i rasped trent somethings really wrong are we falling tell me you feel like youre falling i was going to throw up thats all there was to it from across the unseen hall came a roar of anger damned mother of us all al swore then he swore again as he hit his head by the sound of it you little whore you stinking ashed little whore come here come here where i can reach you struggling to focus on nothing i shrank from the sound of him hitting the bars and his fingers scrabbling for me every move i made seemed to be made a moment after i willed it the neurons not firing as fast as they should how did you get past the statue al raged his voice hurting my ears its not possible whats wrong with me i panted and trent made an ugly noise trying to get my grip off his arm youre being summoned out you little bitch al spat youve got my summoning name and its being used how did you get my name youve been unconscious all day i felt like my middle was gone and i was only a shell i tried to see my hand but there was nothing and then my face went utterly cold this cant happen minias said it couldnt happen im not a demon it shouldnt work for me im not a demon apparently al said slamming into the bars in time with his words youre so damn close it doesnt matter there was another grunt then he shouted someone get me out of here pain pulled me double and my hair pooled on my knees oh god it was going to kill me i felt like i was going to be split in two no wonder demons were pissed when they were summoned rachel trent was saying his hand on my back leaning over me as i gasped for air promise me youll get my people whole promise me youll use the sample ill die content if you promise me youll use the sample sample i dont even have the sample i pulled my head up not seeing him then seized as my aura seemed to soak inward to my core pulling my flesh along with it agony burned through my mind and whimpering i stopped fighting it i wanted to leave didnt i it made all the difference in the world the pain vanished a silver thread of intent pulled through me and before i could marvel at the heavenly absence of pain i was whole my lungs trying to work but not quite managing it yet i was on my front facedown or at least i would be when my aura finished rising through me putting the idea of flesh around my soul again i panted when my lungs formed and i stared at the shadowy plywood floor two inches before my face i could see and it smelled likebleach there was a soft murmur of incantation and the scent of ash and candle mixed with the reek of burnt amber flowing from me i looked at my hand in front of my face seeing the bright glow of my aura i could see it i shouldnt have been able to i took another breath and the haze of gold faded to nothing the incantation dissolved into a collective gathering of breath i was in someones basement i had been summoned out under als name it wasnt possible this was so wrong confused i looked up past the stringy length of my damp curls to see a cluster of blackrobed figures safe on the other side of a glowinghot sheet of everafter lord demon a young masculine voice said and my head jerked up as i recognized it are youwell twentynine you i raged my confusion vanishing as i saw the youthful cleancut features of the is officer standing before the long conference table in bettys basement angry i gathered myself and stood hunched until i knew i wasnt going to hit the greentinted everafter over my head i was on that low stage standing in the middle of a large circle filling the cave of a pentagram greenish white candles marked the corners which were hazy as they existed both here and in the everafter a tarry black sludge marked the limit of my cell horror trickled through me as i realized they had used blood to draw the circle not salt damn it im at the center of a black circle my gaze went to the crack in the wall and i felt the assembled people draw back there were six of them including tom bansen music thumped in through the ceiling a low bass that sounded like a heartbeat and i thought i recognized it the stench of bleach and mold told me betty had been cleaning but it didnt begin to push out the reek of everafter i had brought with me god i needed a shower in the worst way toms eyes were wide as they took me in my long duster white with ash and dried salt my hair a tangled mess and the dust and grit from the everafter coating me there were five men in front of him all in those hokey black robes their hoods made them look like a joke but these people had been intentionally summoning al and letting him go knowing he was going to try to kill me furious i took three steps almost running into the arc of everafter i was trapped behind claustrophobia clenched my heart and i took a sharp breath let me out i yelled in frustration feeling the energy cramp the muscles of my hand when i got too close that had never happened before even when i had been in someone elses circle god help me what had trents father done to me id kill him id freaking kill trent for this i said let me out i shouted i was helpless for all my skills i was completely helpless the little pissant had me trapped with a stupid circle let me out now i said again giving in and smacking the shield between us it hissed and burned and i held my hand to me as the pain shocked me to my senses i was not a demon this had to be a mistake al had said i wasnt one my mom was a witch and takata was a witch and that meant i was a witch one who can kindle demon magic and be summoned with a name from behind the living wall of trembling acolytes tom bowed his head of course lord demon algaliarept after the formalities have been observed we have prepared my next snarl died and i steeled my face to show no emotion i glanced down at myself then back at him he thought i was al in disguise a slow smile came over my face which seemed to scare them more than my anger had if they thought i was al they were going to let me out after all i had to go kill myself let me out i said softly still smiling i wont hurt you much my voice had been low but inside i was seething the fib wanted proof that tom was sending al to kill me okay i was willing to bet i was going to get it seeing me calmer tom bowed still looking stupid no wonder al got off on being summoned this was sickening as you will the man said we have everything you demanded he gestured and two of the men peeled off and went to the back room that id never looked into i apologize for the delay we had an unexpected interruption last night the animal control people how pathetic i said and tom paled i smiled enjoying watching him squirm al was right information was power there wont be any more delays tom stammered his underlings whispering among themselves once you show us the curse you may go you may go i thought stifling an angry snort im going to go put my foot right up your ass thats where im going to go the conference table had a drape of red velvet on it but i hadnt noticed the three nasty knives the headsize copper pot or the three candles until the two outermost guys had left the pot and candles were ominous enough but the knives made my gut clench they had everything but the goat nervous i plucked the damp cuffs from my wrist as i had seen al do with lace my eyebrows rose when i realized the band of charmed silver was gone and i reached for a line finding it thank you god you dont care that im going to go murder one of your own i asked fishing for the incriminating words rachel morgan a hint of disgust crept into toms voice no i thought you appeared as her again to taunt me kill her and ill get a raise son of a bastard anger burned and i pointed at him my scraped palm on my hip i showed up as her because shes better than you you puking stinking excuse for a witch i shouted then drew back when the circle hummed a warning we are unworthy tom said sullenly yeah like i really believed he thought that the door to the back room swung open and i lifted my attention over tom to see two men wrestling with a frantic tied woman my gaze darted to the knives and the bowl then to her bandaged wrists and the blood on the floor holding me shit she was scared fighting them though her ankles and wrists were bound with duct tape and she wore a gag who is that i demanded struggling to hide my fear oh my god she is the goat the woman you requested tom shifted in his sneakers to look at her we had to go out of the city to find her again my apologies for the delay her bare arms were brown from the sun and her long red hair was bleached by it shit on toast she looked like me but younger her limbs lacking the definition of my martial arts practice her fear redoubled as she saw me and she shrieked starting to fight in earnest dont hurt her i demanded then shifted my expression to one i hoped looked lascivious enough i like untouched skin tom flushed ah we couldnt find a virgin the womans eyes glistened with tears but i saw the hint of fury in her i quite honestly thought that al wouldnt care if she was a virgin or not dont hurt her i said again and the two men wrestling her out dropped her on the floor standing with their arms crossed above her she looked like me what al had been going to do with her was sickening please let her be the first one let me out i said standing at the arc of everafter now the acolytes shifted with an excited tension they wouldnt know what hit them let me out i demanded not caring whether i sounded like a demon hell maybe i was one my head hurt but i didnt touch it let this be a mistake let this all be a big mistake tom looked at the woman and the first hints of remorse at what he was going to allow to happen to her flickered in his eyes but he turned away greed pushing the guilt out do you vow to show us how to successfully perform the spell we want and leave us unharmed exacting your toll on that woman instead of those who called you i vow youll never see the outside of a cell again oh yeah i lied anything you say the idiots behind him smiled and congratulated each other then be free tom said with laughable showmanship and with the six of them clapping once in unison to indicate their agreement their collective circle fell i shuddered as the prickling vanished realizing how much it had bothered me to be helpless like that it hadnt been anything like being in trents cage the smarter acolytes backed up a step reading in my posture that they were going to be hurting in the morning i reached behind me to the splat gun putting one foot on the circle so it couldnt be invoked anew tom i said smiling you are so stupid his confusion showed and when i brought out my gun he jumped to the side i shot three of them before anyone else had the smarts to move the room seemed to flow into motion shouting in fear the three men left standing scattered looking like frogs with their silly black robes streaming behind them the woman on the floor was crying behind her gag and i shot over her as she rolled to her hands and knees and tried to get to the metal door at the stairway out of here a tingle of everafter prickled through my aura and i left the raised stage heading for the nearest guy they were setting a net basically an undrawn circle that took three or more proficient ley line witches to hold he was on his knees wideeyed and scared and when he saw me coming at him he increased the volume of his voice screaming latin at me your syntax sucks i shouted then grabbed the copper pot off the table and threw it at him yeah i was ticked but if i didnt get him to stop talking they might have me he ducked and in the instant he was distracted i plowed into him yanking him up by his shirtfront i drew back to slug him my balance shifting forward when something hit me from behind yelping i let go and stood up trying to get out of my coat it was smoldering covered in green goo hey this is not my coat i shouted turning to see tom winding up again the guy i had pulled up from the floor skittered away and swearing i remembered my gun and just shot the poor sucker he dropped like a bag of flour sighing as his nose broke and blood soaked the ugly carpet poor betty she was going to have to get out the shopvac again the woman screamed and i spun at the piercing sound my lookalike had gotten her gag off and was curled up at the door with her hands and feet still bound i could hear sampson on the other side yapping and trying to dig his way through the sound of her fear dove to the primitive part of my brain and set my adrenaline flowing please let me out she sobbed trying to reach the knob with her bound wrists someone please let me out she saw me looking at her and she scrabbled harder dont kill me i want to live please i want to live i was going to be sick but her fear turned to wonder and her eyes tracked behind me my skin prickled and when her mouth opened in a little round o i threw myself to the floor a small explosion shifted the air and my ears rang pulling my gaze up from the damp carpet i saw another puddle of green goo slowly sliding down the dark paneling eating away at it damn what had al taught them i rolled intuition telling me there was another one coming you idiot i shouted as i leapt to my feet cursing my habit of talking during fights and righteous sex you want a piece of me you want a piece of this ill shove it down your damn throat in an inexcusable act of cowardice tom pushed the last acolyte at me the man fell at my feet begging for mercy so i shot him with a sleepytime potion it was all the mercy i had right now pissed i spun to tom youre next little man i snarled taking aim i squeezed the trigger and a sheet of greentinted everafter rose up around him i leapt forward pinwheeling to a stop when i realized i was too late tom had reset the circle i had been summoned into putting himself in its center one of the candles had been knocked over and it rolled off the stage trailing melted wax and a thin plume of smoke the insufferable man panted confused as he put his palms on his knees to catch his breath you broke your word he panted brown eyes savagely bright you cant do that youre mine he smiled forever hands on my hips i faced him if you summon demons you lousy stinking piece of crap youd better be sure the right one shows up before you let her out his face lost all expression and he turned to the stage youre not al ding ding ding i mocked give that man a prize inside i was shaking but it gave me an obscene amount of pleasure to watch tom realize his life had just run full tilt into a pile of demon dung the size of manhattan you have the right to remain silent i added anything you say im going to put in my mosswipe of a report and youll fry faster tom went a beautiful shade of green you have the right to an attorney but unless youre a hell of a lot richer than this basement looks youre one royally screwed witch his mouth opened and closed and his gaze darted behind me to the woman by the door who are you i called algaliarept he whispered my breath hissed in shut up i shouted hitting his bubble with a side kick dont say that name it was my name now oh god it was my name and anyone who knew it could pull me into a circle what would happen when the sun came up i couldnt even guess tom stared morgan how did youyou killed algaliarept you killed a demon and took his name hardly i thought i took a demons name and killed myself maybe ivy had been right and i should have just tried to knock off al my demise might have been quicker that way none of this lingering mess to deal with not so tough without your wand are you eh i said hearing an intercom buzzing somewhere barely audible over the woman sobbing by the door tom had drawn himself straight and i pushed on his bubble appreciating not being burned by it nice i said then frustrated i hit his barrier with my foot again the man stumbled back almost knocking into his circle and sending it down i started pacing limping around him as the intercom hummed get used to it tom youre going to be in a cage for a long time but toms look went crafty reminding me he knew how to trip to a line i stared at him and his smile grew he wouldnt al was his demon contact wasnt he he wouldnt risk it al would feel it and be on him in a second but al was in jail so maybe it didnt matter no i shouted desperate to keep him from jumping steeling myself i put my left hand on the barrier and pushed i knew what it was now i had taken his circle before and with one candle missing this one was compromised i could do this how am i going to do this my aura burned and teeth clenched i stared at him from around the lank strands of my hair panting as i tried to absorb his power take control of the line he had tapped all of it i felt something shift as if the entire field had gone seethrough i looked at tom his eyes were wide he had felt it too and then he was gone his auralaced shield of everafter vanished and i fell forward damn it all to hell i shouted as i caught my balance i turned seeing that poor woman watching me her sobs temporarily halted the intercom was still humming and i stood with my hip cocked and my good hand to my forehead i could have had him but i had monologued damn it i was not going to do that again but the woman was still cowering by the door and forcing a smile i headed toward her grabbing the smallest knife in passing to cut her bonds the intercom finally quit buzzing a blessed relief the womans gaze widened in panic stay away she screamed scrabbling back from behind the door sampson barked furiously the utter terror in her voice stopped me cold and i looked from the knife in my grip to the bodies laying around there was a sharp scent of ozone in the damp air and the scent of blood her wrists were bleeding around the duct tape what had they done to her its okay i said dropping the knife and kneeling to be on her level im one of the good guys i am really i am let me get the tape off you ddont touch me she shrilled her green eyes wide when i reached out my hand dropped to my middle i felt filthy sampson i shouted at the door shut the hell up the dog went silent and my tension eased in the new quiet the womans pupils were huge all right i said backing up when tears kept slipping down her cheeks i wont touch you juststay there ill figure this out leaving the knife within her reach i searched for a phone to call for reinforcements someones bowels had let go and it was starting to stink the intercom began buzzing again leading me right to it it was one of those intercom phone systems and ticked i thumbed the circuit open betty is that you i shouted into it releasing some tension are you okay down there came her worried voice i could hear the tv on in the background over the music i heard screaming hes tearing apart that woman i said trying to make my voice lower and winking at the girl her whimpering stopped and her green eyes were wet and beautiful get off the damn phone and turn the music down will you well soooorry she muttered it sounded like you were in trouble the line clicked and the buzz of an open phone line hummed out my gaze went to the woman who was sniffing loudly hope was in her expression and the knife was in her stillbound hands can i get the tape off you now i asked and she shook her head no but at least she wasnt screaming shaking i punched in the fibs number and glenns extension the ringing phone was picked up immediately and glenns preoccupied glenn here never sounded so good i sniffed back a tear wondering where it had come from i didnt remember starting to cry hey hi glenn i said i got tom to voluntarily admit he was letting al go to kill me even got a motive could you come over and pick me up rachel glenn gasped where are you ivy and jenks think youre dead the entire department does my eyes closed and i sent a silent prayer of thanks out jenks was with ivy he was okay they both were i bit my lip and held my breath against the tears a big badass runner doesnt cry even when she finds out shes a demon im in bettys basement i said keeping my voice low so it wouldnt warble and give away how upset i was there are five black ley line witches down here out cold and at least one upstairs youre going to need some salt water to wake them up he tried to make some poor girl into a goat i said tears starting to flow she looks like me glenn they picked her because she looks like me are you okay he asked and i forced myself to stop i dont know i said feeling my life end im sorry for dumping this on you but i cant go to the is i think toms doing this with their blessing i looked at the last spot id seen him in hatred briefly overpowering tears from the adrenaline crash shes alive glenn said off the phone no im talking to her you got the house number you got the number there was a crackle of static and he was back well be there in five minutes he said his deep voice soothing sit tight dont move unless you have to i slumped to the floor with the phone to my ear i felt worse than the woman who was chewing at her duct tape sure i said listlessly but tom is gone watch betty she may look stupid but she probably knows some nasty stuff i felt dizzy anyone who kicks their dog is nasty glenn sighed in frazzled frustration im on my way damn it im going to have to leave this phone talk to rose until i get there okay i shook my head drawing my knees to my chin no i have to call ivy rachel he warned dont hang up on me but i did the tears slipped down cleaning the grit of everafter from my face but nothing could clean the shame from my mind a demon trents dad had made me into a freaking damned demon miserable i sat where i was with my knees to my chin a light touch on my shoulder jerked my head up and the woman who had freed herself jumped back her eyes were wide and she was shaking in her jeans and red top i thought you killed them she said her gaze darting over the destruction theyre asleep i nodded only now realizing what my attack on them must have looked like relief cascaded over her and she dropped down in front of me looking like she needed a shoulder to cry on but was afraid to touch me again thank you she said shivering you look just like me i sniffed back my tears and wiped my face thats why they kidnapped you her head bobbed youre stronger though smiling she flexed her bicep her smile faded and she clutched her knees to her chest how did you get in that circle you must be a really powerful witch she hesitated are you my eyes shut and i clenched my teeth i dont know i said eyes damp when i opened them i really dont know thirty glenns black car wasnt my style but it was nice in an fib sort of way the back was full of file boxes which made it hard to recline my seat enough to close my eyes and take a nap as he drove me home the clutter was unusual glenn usually kept his car as tidy and together as himself rigorously fastidious i was so tired but sleep was impossible tom had gotten away and now he had a vested interest in seeing me dead my lookalike was safe in custody and would be headed home as soon as the med guys checked her out she told me she was going to take some martial arts classes so tom couldnt hurt her again and that combined with sampson sitting on her lap in the back of a cop car assured me shed be okay my fingertips were sore from the burn id gotten by trying to take toms compromised circle as was my palm from scraping it in the everafter i winced when i toggled the switch to crack the window but the pain was worth hearing the sounds of the kids playing hideandseek in the dark the squeals and shouts of protest coming in unseen soothing me my eyes shut and i tried to follow the cars path by its motion when it got out that an is operative had been summoning demons and letting him go to trash charm shops and terrorize citizens the is would have to publicly disapprove of tom dissolving his contract and moving his name from payroll to mostwanted privately he would likely get a nasty slap and a boot out the door as they tried to disguise his public failure to tag me i wasnt on their active list but i knew they wouldnt mind seeing me on a granite table but at least i wouldnt have to pay for the damages to the charm shop anymore the whine of glenns window cracked my eyelid and the increased wind made my almostdry hair flutter against my cheek my red curls stank the scent of burnt amber obvious in the tight confines of the car no wonder newt was bald glenn cleared his throat sounding decidedly peeved and i shut my eyes i knew he wasnt happy with me thinking id taken on the entire coven without letting even my roommates know this wasnt my idea i said bracing my knee against the door when we took a turn i didnt mean to do this it just happened glenn cleared his throat again this time in disbelief and i opened my eyes and sat up the passing streetlights lit his face to make him look older than he was tired backup would have increased your chances of getting that wacko he said tightly accusingly now hell be twice as hard to find guilt warred with fear and my teeth clenched i couldnt tell him i had been summoned into toms basement from the everafter and i thought i was a demon my elbow went to rest against the door and i cupped my chin in my hand it was an accident i muttered i was working on something with trent kalamack the fib detective glanced from the road to me and back again his dark hands gripping the wheel tighter rachel stay away from him he holds a nasty grudge and has a lot of money crap i miss my dad my breath came and went maybe i could give glenn some of the truth i was helping trent with an ongoing project the same thing that killed your fathers he asked and i shrugged sort of i was in the everafter and i got pulled into a demons summons by mistake i showed up in als circle and when i got out i let them have it breathe in one two three breathe out one two three four trent is still stuck there in the everafter damn it rachel glenn whispered and i stared drawn by the unusual curse coming from him does anyone else know he went there voluntarily glenns worried expression came at me in flashes of streetlight and my eyebrows rose id never dreamed this might look like me getting rid of trent though the press labored under the assumption that we were secret lovers everyone in a uniform knew we hated each other that i continued to take his money was just weird his bodyguard i said not knowing how quen was going to react ivy and jenks my neighborsthe ones that dont exist i finished dryly glenns grip shifted and i knew he wanted to reach for the radio and call something in it was an accident i finished putting my knees together as i said it again what was i supposed to do let them bleed that woman to death there are always options he cajoled as we turned down my street tom admitted he called al with the intent of letting him go to kill me said he would get a raise the girl heard him ask her i dropped my chin back into my hand and stared at the passing night fear gripped my heart at a recurring thought i had been summoned out of the everafter like a demon would i be drawn back into it when the sun rose a huge ache filled me i just wanted to go home surround myself with the people i loved and hide reassuring my subconscious that i was alive and home even if i might be dragged back to that hell of an existence in a few hours that trent was still there trapped in a tiny black cell waiting for a horrible degrading future didnt help i didnt like trent nothing could excuse his murdering druglord past and id seen nothing that convinced me he would change that part of himself but it bothered me all the good and bad he had done shouldnt end so uselessly i was shocked to realize that i cared what happened to him he was responsible for a lot of good even if it was for selfish reasons staring out the window as we passed keasleys dark house i rubbed my arm almost able to feel trents grip there his last chance to touch someone lingering on me still he hadnt asked me to save him he hadnt asked me to stay and fight thered been no anger or frustration that i was going to be free pulled to where he couldnt follow and leaving him to suffer both our punishments in the moment when everything had fallen from him hed asked me to make sure his people survived his words had been free of the guilt i now felt he only sought the reassurance that his people would live that his life would amount to more than running drugs and murder well there was no way i was going to make sure the elves survived he could do his own dirty work id simply have to rescue him so he could do it himself crap on toast i really needed to talk to ceri my church was ahead all lit up with light streaming out of every window to run across the black grass even before we got close i saw a pair of red eyes blink at me from the topmost nook and a wing shift in salute bis knew i was back and i sent a silent thankyou to his kin who had kept me safe in the basilica last night they hadnt known me or my plight but theyd saved me and i owed the gracious noble beings my life id pay biss rent myself just to keep him around the familiar taillights of my car were in the carport someone had driven it home for me quen maybe four streaks of greenish light swirled around the steeple and dropped down to bis and when one veered off to dart toward us i pulled myself together and lowered the window completely it had to be jenks please let it be jenks my eyes warmed with unshed tears as his familiar wingclatter battered against my ears and jenks darted into the car rachel he gasped looking good in his black thief outfit tinks contractual hell you did it youre here god almighty you stink i wish you were smaller id slap you so hard youd land in next week i could have killed trent when he shoved me back with that sample i shook my head in confusion he didnt shove you back he said you took the curse and left us the pitch of his wings hesitated and he dropped to my fingers how by my bloody daisies would i do that i didnt do anything i felt like my insides were being pulled through a snails back door and i showed up in the basilica to scare the holy crap out of some poor woman he glanced at glenn the sparkles shifting from him turning to red uh hi glenn my throat was tight and my hand shook as he stood on it i wished i was smaller too trents reaction to jenkss absence had been too genuine to be fake and why bother lying maybe pixies were like demons in that they couldnt stay on the wrong side of the lines when the sun rose did quen get the sample i asked thinking of trents request is it safe the pixy was beaming yeah i gave it to quen a burst of light exploded from him and glenn winced when you didnt show quen took the sample to trents he tried to take ceri with him but she said youd need her when you got back holy crap i have to send one of my kids to tell her youre here i knew you could figure out how to jump the lines did you show up at the basilica too how come you called glenn and not us we would have picked you up he rose from my hand when it started shaking violently neither man commented on it but jenkss excitement cut off with a worried expression he thought id learned how to jump the lines he didnt know i had been pulled back by riding algaliarepts summons youre not listening to the fib channels are you i said and jenkss eyes widened no he said his stance turning suspicious why glenn pulled to the curb before the church and shoved the car into park we kept everything off the airwaves he said as he leaned over the backseat and groped for his coat we didnt want the is to show up rache jenks said warily hovering as i hid my hands so he couldnt see them shake what did you do i looked at the church wanting to be in it but too tired to move tom and i had a chat a flash of pixy dust lit the car and glenn jumped damn it rache jenks swore why didnt you call us i owe him his left nut between his teeth guilt and fear mixed and it came out as anger i didnt have a choice i shouted and jenks hovered backward to land on the dash he said nothing as i fumbled to open the door planting my feet on the pavement i wearily stood to look up at the church the night was cool and i shifted uncomfortably in my damp underwear crap i was tired jenkss wings were a silent blur as he flew too close to me not landing on my shoulder he whispered i didnt want to leave you rache guilt lay heavy in his voice i must have gotten sucked out when the lines closed but i knew you could figure it out youll never be stuck in the everafter again this last was said with heavy pride and i swallowed using the excuse of shutting the car door to avoid looking at him to tell him what had really happened was too hard seeing his eager face and happy stance i was afraid jenks was too excited to pick up that things were being left unsaid things that were really going to screw my lifeand by association theirsup ivy jenks said suddenly i gotta tell ivy youre back damn im glad youre here my breath caught as he darted to my shoulder and i felt the cool touch of pixy wings on my face i thought id lost you he whispered and then he was gone bewildered i stared at the sifting dust he had left in his wake behind me was the thump of a closing door and i turned to see glenn coming around to the walk aah i stammered thanks for the ride glenn and everything else the streetlight lit his face as he pressed his lips together making his small mustache stick out mind if i walk you in he asked and i felt a moment of quickly dampened alarm jenks might not have been listening but glenn had been his investigative flags were raised and if i didnt invite him in hed have to choose between our friendship and a warrant he wanted to know how i had ended up in toms basement and seeing as i needed all my friends right now i nodded in surrender arms held to myself i looked back into the car for my nonexistent bag glenn had put my splat gun in a brown paper bag to get it past the evidence guys and out of the basement and i felt stupid holding it when glenn handed it to me i looked up at the softly lit sign with our names on it and i wondered if this entire partnership had been such a good idea bis blinked at me from his high perch and i pushed myself into moving a part of me was waiting for him to try to keep me out and when he didnt i felt better you want some coffee i said to glenn as my feet moved silently on the cracked sidewalk heaven knew i did my head jerked up as the church door was flung open and ivy took two hurried steps onto the stoop before seeing me her pace slowed but she continued on her arms wrapped around herself as if she was cold shadows disguised her face but her posture held worry and fear jenks was with her see he said as proud as if he had pulled me back from the everafter himself i told you she figured it out and here she is safe and back where she belongs ivy hit the sidewalk and kept coming her attention flicked briefly to glenn then fixed on me youre here she said softly her graysilk voice carrying an entire twentyfour hours of fear and worry she pulled herself to a stop a few steps away and her hands fell to her sides as if she didnt know what to do with them afraid to reach out she turned to anger instead why didnt you call us she said finally reaching hesitantly out and taking that stupid paper bag from me we would have picked you up my heart heavy we headed to the steps jenks flew between us trailing a faint silver dust she went by herself to kick some blackwitch ass he said and ivys gaze sharpened you went to toms she said were a team it could have waited a few hours i took a breath and then right there at the foot of the stairs i gave her a hug she stiffened for an instant then her hands went around me and the crackle of brown paper sounded against my back vampire incense grew strong and my eyes closed as i breathed it in immediately my muscles relaxed and the prick of tears grew hot id been so scared with no way home and a lifetime of degradation facing me she was my friend and i could give her a freaking hug if i wanted to ivys stiffness grew and i let go of her with one hand so that we stood more shouldertoshoulder than fronttofront she was nervously watching glenn for his reaction but i couldnt care less i didnt go after him i said as she helped me up the stairs it sort of happened the door was open and in the darkness of the foyer and the confusion of two dozen pixies swirling around us and glenn i pulled her attention to me by taking her arm im so glad to see you i whispered i dont know whats going to happen at sunrise i need your help what she said concern replacing all her fearbased anger but jenks had cleared the room of his kids and i pressed my lips together trying to tell her that i had to talk to her alone or at least without glenn listening her perfect oval face went blank and i saw her understanding she turned her upper lip in as she thought and i let go of her arm you want some coffee glenn she asked suddenly my shoulders eased wed get glenn out of here fast by pretending everything was okay and frankly i needed to pretend everything was okayif only for a few minutes glenns brow rose suspiciously at the offer but he ambled in after us he did a good job of hiding that he knew we were trying to get rid of him but he looked like a cop when he settled himself at the table telling ivy he didnt mind waiting for a new pot he arched his eyebrows at me and crossed his arms over his chestand stared he wasnt going to leave until he heard it all jenks was hovering over my shoulder like there was a string between us my worry crashed down as i slumped into my spot at the table and tried to decide where to start the familiar noises of ivy making coffee were incredibly soothing and my eyes scanned the kitchen marking the empty spots where i had moved spelling supplies into the belfry a sudden clenching of my chest took my breath away i was a demon or so close to one that it didnt matter that i had made a human my familiar should have been the first clue i felt filthy like the smut on my soul was leaking off and staining everything i loved and as glenn eyed the basket of cherry tomatoes with avarice and prattled on about how he liked a good strong cup of coffee while he waited for me to get on with it i felt the bolts of my life lock the door to my past i had only one way to go and it was going to be hard as hell logic said there was no way to rescue trent he had accepted his failure and asked me to save his species but i didnt live or die by percentages and i wouldnt sit and accept it it would prey on me forever ii have to talk to you i said and the conversation cut off with the startling suddenness of a kite smacking headfirst into the ground ivy turned from the coffeemaker arms over her middle and her face pale the pitch of jenkss wings faded to nothing as he landed on the napkin holder glenns breath slid out of him in anticipation and i steadied myself trying to find a way to say what i needed to without telling them what trents dad had done to me you didnt get back here on your own ivy guessed and jenkss wings stopped did you have to buy another mark i shook my head and ivys relief turned to a wary suspicion then horror wheres trent oh god she thought i had bought my freedom with trent everyone would vision blurring i shook my head my gaze on a series of lines indented into the table realizing they were ivys name in a careful preschool print why am i here i thought as i tried to find a way to tell them what i was i was a demon and i was likely going to be pulled back into the everafter in a few hours i was a demon but they were my friends i had to believe that they wouldnt turn me away my head hurt and taking a slow breath i looked up jenks could you clear out your kids his wings increased in pitch and ivy winced sure he said his unease obvious as he made a series of three whistles a smattering of complaints rose and the room went silent as the children left jenks rubbed his wings together in a harsh discord and three more darted out from under the sink and were gone my gaze dropped and i pulled my knees up to my chin grasping my shins awkwardly so my heels almost slipped off the chair i wanted to be mad at trent for everything but this wasnt his fault i thought of my demon scar and a bitter anger lifted through me im a demon i ought to just accept it but i wouldnt and i didnt have to i looked up to fasten on ivys stillness her face was empty of emotion but her eyes were swimming i got out i said in a monotone trent didnt the soft creak of the back door closing brought ivys head around and i looked to the hallway ceri was standing in the threshold her filmy white dress edged in purple and green floating about her bare feet and her hair wild tears marked her face and she looked beautiful rachel she warbled guilt and fear heavy in her voice and with that i realized that ceri had known she had known i was a demon and that was why she hadnt wanted me to go to the everafter lest i figure it out myself my face bunched up and i held my knees tighter why didnt you tell me i asked she took three steps in and stopped because you arent she said pleading you are a witch rachel never forget it it wasnt her words but the vehemence she said them with that convinced me shed rather believe a happy lie than a harsh truth damn it she had known i could almost pin the moment shed realized it shed been treating me differently ever since minias had pulled the focus from me and put it into david no it had started before that with the scrying mirror my eyes must have given me away for she strode across the room with a familiar righteous anger you are a witch she shouted spots of color showing and her hair flaring out magnificently close your mouth you are a witch jenks was hovering in questioning shock why wouldnt she be he asked and ivy slumped i looked at her and bit my lip tears of frustration slipping from me i think ivy had figured it out im a witch i said continuing the lie but ceri hadnt touched me yet i didnt want you to go ceri said standing helplessly before me unable to bear it i put my feet on the floor and took her hand it was cold and she didnt pull away thank you i whispered am i going to stay here or will i be pulled back ivy moaned softly turning to grip the sink and look into the black garden ceri glanced at her then at jenkss confusion and finally back to me i dont know she said softly jenks rose up high his wings clattering aggressively someone better tell me what the hell is going on or im going to pix the lot of you blinking fast ivy turned one arm wrapped around her middle the other holding her head you said rachel twisted the curse she has als summoning name she said to the floor she didnt buy a way back and she didnt learn how to travel the lines she was pulled back to reality when tom summoned al so jenks said acerbically then hesitated dropping to the table oh shit a flash of fear took me and the shame of being summoned into someone elses circle rachel is not a demon ceri said and glenn finally got it his broad shoulders turning sideways as he gaped at me no i said bitterly twisting in my chair and not looking at anyone im a witch whose blood can kindle demon magic and who has been integrated into their system so well that im bound by their rules of summoning no you arent i wanted to believe ceri but i was afraid to then what am i i whispered she had to know she had lived among them ceris face went frightened you are what you are my gaze met ivys to find a sliver of fear i couldnt take it anymore rising i ran to the bathroom slamming the door and slumping onto the closed toilet miserable there was a commotion in the hall worried voices and frustrated accusations a tear slid down and i let it i should cry i should be crying my freaking eyes out i think my dad had known too why else would he have asked cincinnatis top ley line instructor to flunk me then collect a library of demon texts for me rachel came jenkss voice amid a close clatter of pixy wings and i pulled my head up get out i shouted lashing out with a flick i knew would never land damn it you stupid pixy get out no he exclaimed getting in my face rachel listen to me you smell like a witch well you stink like the everafter right now but when you wash it off youll smell like a witch and come sunup you will be here you wont be pulled to the everafter i wont let you his expression was desperate and i listlessly extended a hand for him to land on i held my breath and caught my misery back behind a throathurting gulp he landed on it flying up briefly when ivy barged in sending the door swinging into the wall god save you i exclaimed jumping i shut the door because i wanted to be alone ivys usually placid face was pinched with worry tension had pulled her shoulders up and her movements to tuck her short hair behind an ear were sharp you are not a demon she said her words precise youre sitting in a church no demon can do that glenn said you lied to get out of that circle and nothing happened to you you werent held accountable youre not a demon and you wont be pulled back when the sun comes up exhausted in mind and soul i looked up at her wanting to believe but too afraid to do so i hope so i whispered knowing they wouldnt like what i was going to say next but if i was it would make rescuing trent easier thirtyone it was quiet now just the small agitated ticks of jenks tapping his foot against ceris porcelain teacup to mar the stillness i felt bad about screwing up everyones lives but in a few hours id either be dead or a permanent fixture in the everafter settling this with a happy ending was still a possibility but the odds were looking really slim i was hoping for it of course but honestly what were the chances glenn had left to get my mother after id kicked everyone out of the bathroom to take a shower so it was just the four of us now the mood tense and the feeling of harsh words yet unsaid heavy in the air god i was tired the cup of coffee in my grip wasnt helping at all a bowl of baked cheese crackers was within my reach and i put one in my mouth the sharp cheddar flavor bit at the sides of my mouth and i slowly chewed grabbing a handful i ate them one by one feeling guilty that i was clean and eating cheese crackers when trent was in a cell seeing me moving jenks took to the air to try again why he said belligerently a thin trace of red dust spilling from him to pool on the table as he landed in his best peter pan pose why do you give a fairys hairy ass about what happens to trent i rubbed my finger over ivys dented signature feeling the past she had been innocent once so had i so trent can tell me what the hell his dad did to me because i need him to say that im not a demon so he can find a way to reverse it because if i dont i said softly everyone will think that i bought my freedom with his life jenks snorted and my blood pressure rose because i promised id get him home i said more forcefully im not going to let him rot there rachel jenks cajoled from her computer ivy glowered at him she promised to get him home if he paid for her way there and back i dont like it any more than you do but youre going to shut up and listen if we can find a way well do it but he didnt get her home jenks protested she did that herself and who cares if he rots in the everafter ivy stiffened and ceri silently watched evaluating i care i said pushing the crackers away and trying to get the cheese out of my teeth yeah but rache hes not home i shouted ticked that was the deal jenkss feet hit the table and he turned his back on me wings still he bowed his head ceri eased into the chair beside me and set an open spell book on the table there was a pair of glasses perched on her nose and a pencil between her teeth the pixies had braided her hair while i had cried in the shower and she looked decidedly studious she had reddened when i noticed her new glasses but i hadnt said anything i think she was proud that she was aging again and needed them frankly i was surprised ivy was siding with me id like to think that it was because she considered holding to ones word important or because she thought trent was worth going back for on his own merits but the truth was trents absence would cause big problems in cincys underground power balance rynn cormel flexing his muscles and reasserting control was something she wasnt looking forward to its harder to fall in love with a man when hes killing people glancing up i blinked at the odd figure ceri was idly tracing over and over on the yellow legal pad she had on the open spell book i was sure the glyph was from a demon curse there was a faint haze of black emanating from it i caught her gaze and she winced drawing a circle around it to contain whatever force she had drawn into existence before crumpling the paper up dropping it into her empty teacup and setting fire to it with a ley line charm jenks sputtered at the black flame but ivy stopped his budding harangue with a hissed comment i didnt quite catch what if i learn how to jump the lines i said searching for the first hints of a plan if i could get in undetected that would be half the battle maybe more simple snag and drag it wasnt but i could build on the idea ceri took the end of her pencil and crushed even the ash to dust learn how to trip the lines before sunrise no im sorry rachel it takes decades ivy leaned past her cracked monitor why sunrise the pretty elf s shoulders drooped thats when the lines will close to summoning travel and they will make a decision right now trents probably still in holding but as soon as theyre sure no one will be pulled out of negotiations he will be sold sold it was an ugly word and i felt my face twist seeing it ceri shrugged anything you want to do you need to do before someone buys him or you will be dealing with a specific demon not a committee committees are difficult but a single demon is tenacious where a committee will only want to make sure they all get something this was wrong really wrong and i sighed when jenks swore at ivy dramatically crossed his chest as if making a promise then flew to my cracker bowl trent doesnt have a great deal of value as a familiar ceri was saying her eyes down in what looked like embarrassment but its not often that a potential familiar stumbles into the everafter without a preexisting claim by another demon there are a lot of demons who will pay not caring that there will be a long downtime to bring him up to usefulness thats what al does to make his bread and butter i hesitated thinking it might explain why al was so hot for nick and then me he trains familiars i asked and ceri shook her head she had begun to doodle again and i stared at the pair of tortured eyes taking form on the yellow paper trapped behind lines of blue in a manner of speaking she said softly he finds suitable candidates instructs them enough to make them profitable then tricks them into the everafter to be sold for his gain al is good at it and hes made an exceptional life selling people to those unwilling to cross the lines to get their own jenkss wings clattered and ivy clicked her computer off not bothering to pretend to be working anymore hes a slave dealer she asked and ceri drew a slumped figure of a man at the base of a tombstone yes which is why hes so angry you have his summoning name it takes finesse to build a list of people who know his name and are potential familiars not to mention the effort invested in the presoul stealing stage the drudgery of building them up and teaching them something to increase their value maintaining the balance of having enough people know his name without having so many that it becomes tedious and then theres the risk that after all the smut he takes on building up a potential familiar he will take a loss if they dont bring in a high enough price i snorted leaning back in my chair and crossing my knees as i thought of nick hes a freaking familiar pimp tom had better watch out or he was going to be next not that i cared jenks rose and a column of silver sparkles fell to fill the bowl like frosting ivy stealing people is his job you gotta help me here rachel doesnt need to do this its stupid even for her my eyes narrowed but ivy stretched casually her belly button ring showing if you dont stop badgering her im going to smack you into the wall so hard you wont wake up for a week she said jenks lost altitude and ivy added as she headed over someone has to pull kalamacks ass out of the everafter you think i can do it no he protested weakly but why does rachel have to trent knew the risks he knew the risks and trusted me to get him out i thought unable to meet ceris gaze ivy leaned with her elbows on the center island counter why dont you stop trying to convince her not to go and start trying to figure out how you can go with her she wont let me he shouted no one is going with me i said firmly and jenks let a burst of silver slip from him see he exclaimed pointing my teeth clenched and ivy cleared her throat in warning i said id get him out i muttered flipping through the sketches that ceri had drawn of the underground demon city and im coming with you he said belligerently i exhaled trying to get my jaw to relax but it wasnt working in the past year living and working with ivy and jenks i had learned how to trust others it was time to remember that i could trust myself too that i could do this on my own and i would jenks dont jenks me he said landing on the rolledover seam of the yellow tablet his wings going for balance and his finger pointed we pop in grab him and pop out that wont work ceri interrupted softly and jenks spun why the hell not plan b worked with that fish it will work for trent ceris eyes darted to mine and then back to jenkss whoever rachel buys the trips from will simply snag her or tell newt who now has a solid claim on her i scuffed my foot almost able to feel the raised slashed circle on the bottom of it what if i just go through newt i threw out there desperate she might forget about it ceri stiffened no she said and ivys expression went guarded at the womans almostpanic not newt you already wear one mark from her shes insane she says one thing then does another you cant trust her she doesnt follow demon law she makes it i flipped to the next sketch which showed what looked like the layout for the university library and jenks moved to my shoulder where i was able to judge his agitation by the strength of the draft he was making on my neck it was cold and i reached back and covered my bites with my hand minias maybe ivy suggested and ceri shook her head minias is trying to get back into newts good graces rachel may as well wear a big bow and sing happy birthday i flipped the maps closed why i asked eating another cracker they fired him ceris gaze went serious because newt is the only female demon left and just like everyone else he would risk his life for the chance to engender a child that was his job they took a vote and he lost i told you this before her voice had gotten sharp but her temper was her way of hiding her fear excising it maybe you didnt tell me he was trying to seduce her i said tartly egging her on for some inane reason perhaps i needed the release of yelling at someone too you told me he was babysitting her jenkss wings brushed my neck tangling in my hair hes been with her what a few hundred years whats his problem cant get it up ceris eyebrows went high and she replied dryly she killed the last six demons she became intimate with pulled an entire line through them and fried their little kitty brains jenks finished i looked for rex in the threshold but the cat had yet to come out from under my bed minias is understandably cautious ceri said and ivy snorted as she pushed her forearms up from the counter and went to the coffeemaker if its just a matter of getting there cant rachel just stand in a line andmove ivy asked her unusual look of ignorance hinting at her fright ceri shook her head and i dropped the pad of paper onto the table i remembered the time i had stood in trents office one foot in the here and now and one in the everafter i had been entirely safe unless al had got a grip on me and pulled me through not unless theres a demon to pull you through i said rubbing the goose bumps from my arms and im the only one going in not you not you and not you i looked at them in turn reading ceris relief jenkss ire and ivys annoyance i dont mind a little demon smut ivy said defensively me either jenks chimed in and ceri shook her head with a soft no that jenks had popped back to reality when the sun had come up didnt bode well im going with you rache he said loudly even if i have to ride in your armpit ooh thats a pretty picture you dont get it i said trying to burn the image from my consciousness there is no reason for you to go jenks rose up his wings clattering like hell there isnt he yelled shooting nervous glances at ivy you need backup frustrated i slammed my hand down on the table and two pixies shot out of my charm cupboard shrieking i hesitated as they flew down the hall and into the night great now matalina would know jenks was trying to come with me the woman wouldnt stop him but id be damned before i took him away from her again im not going in there to kick some demon ass i said softly trying to be reasonable even with your help i cant beat off more than one demon at a time with magic and as soon as they realize im there its going to be a bunch of demons i glanced at ceri and the pale woman nodded ive thought it over and i cant do it with muscle or magic i have to do it with trickery and im sorry but much as id like one or both of you there you cant help me i looked at ivy by the fridge feeling the frustration coming off her in a wave you can do more good by staying here and summoning me home my face burned with shame that i had a demon name and fear made my voice soft once ive got him this is crap jenks shouted green fairy crap ivy rubbed her temples i have a headache she breathed one of the few times she had ever admitted to me that she hurt can you at least take ceri ceris rasp of incoming breath was harsh and quick no i said touching the womans shoulder in support im going alone jenks bristled and i leaned over him im going alone i exclaimed i couldnt have gotten the sample without you jenks but this is different and you taking on a bucket of smut so you can hold my hand while i do this isnt going to happen dont you get it i almost shouted starting to shake until i met the two of you i worked alone even when i did have backup im damn good at it and im not going to put you in danger if i dont need to so drop it for a moment jenks said nothing his fists on his hips as he pressed his lips together and frowned up at me from the window came a highpitched hush for someone to be quiet so how much is your life worth rache he asked i turned away so he couldnt see my eyes i killed kisten i said im not going to risk either of you my jaw clenched and the hurt swelled i had killed kistenmaybe not directly but it had been my fault ivys feet scuffed the linoleum and jenks went silent i couldnt love anyone without putting them in danger maybe this is why dad told me to work alone ceri touched my arm and i sniffed back the misery it wasnt your fault she said but ivys and jenkss silence said different i know how to do this i said shoving the pain down i was summoned outlike a demon i can kindle demon magiclike a demon i have a name registered in their databaselike they all are why cant i just claim trent as mine and bring him home i know hed go along with it oh for the sweet humpin love of tink jenks shouted and even ivy looked discomfited ceri though put her elbows on the table and dropped her chin into her cupped palm with a thoughtful look on her face it was the first hint of hope and my hands grew damp you cant jump through the lines she said as if that were the deciding factor how will you get there i fiddled with the bowl of crackers nervous i had to make a deal with a demon damn it i had to make another deal with a demon the difference this time was that i was making this choice with a clear head not being forced into it with death as the only other option so i dealt in demons so the hell what it didnt make me a bad person or stupid or rash it made me dangerous to everyone around me is all so i buy a trip i said softly knowing id never look at demon summoners the same way again maybe id take them seriously now instead of writing them off as idiots maybe id been really wrong to accuse ceri of not knowing what she was doing ceri sighed oblivious to my thoughts back to the beginning she muttered to her legal pad i looked down at it to see a second pair of eyes decidedly masculine this time so i buy a trip from al i finished ivy jerked and jenks took to the air no jenks said he will kill you he will lie and kill you he has nothing to lose rache which is exactly why it will work i thought but didnt say it al had nothing to lose and everything to gain jenks is right ivy said somehow she had crossed the kitchen without me seeing and was right over me ceris expression was thick with alarm you said al is in jail i nodded they incarcerated him again when they realized i can spindle line energy but he can still bargain and i know his summoning name i can summon him out her pretty little mouth open ceri looked at ivy and then jenks he might kill you and he might not discouraged but seeing no other options i pushed the legal pad of sketched maps away from me i have something he wants and holding on to it will not do me any good giving it to him might get trent free ceri gave ivy a pleading look and the vampire dragged her chair to the other side of me and sat down rachel ivy said her voice soft and full of pity theres nothing you can do i dont want trent stuck there any more than you do but theres no shame in not waging a battle that cant be won jenks stood before me with his head bobbing but his relief made me even more angry they werent listening and i really didnt blame them my tension rose and i scrubbed a hand across my face okay i said shortly and jenks flew backward as i stood youre right bad idea i have to get out of here just forget the entire thing i said looking over the kitchen for my coat the foyeri think i headed for the front door with no bag no wallet and nothing but my spare keys which i had stashed in the safe with ivys livingwill papers someone had brought my car home but i had yet to find my bag hey jenks said from the table where are you going my pulse hammered and my steps jarred all the way up my spine eden park alone ill be back after sunrise unless im dragged into the everafter i added sounding dry sarcastic and bitter the clatter of pixy wings following made me tense rachel let her go ivy said softly and he dropped back shes never had to deal with a situation there was no way to win i better call rynn she said as she headed down the hall then go to the store to stock up the shops might be closing for a while there might be riots if the city has to reorganize the lower power structure this is going to be a rough week the is is going to be too busy to pick its collective nose i passed through the batfilled sanctuary thinking i wasnt going to be around to see it thirtytwo it was cold sitting on the top of the benchs back the way i was my feet on the seat as i looked out from eden park over the gray ohio river and across the hollows the sun was near rising and the hollows was hazy with a pinkishgray mist i was thinkingwaiting really just the fact that i was sitting here was a clear indication that the thinking portion of my life was done now i had to do something so i sat on the top of the bench and shivered in my short leather jacket and jeans my boots doing little to stop the cold of a november morning my breath made little puffs that existed about as long as my racing thoughts did thoughts of my dad my mom takata kisten trent trapped in the everafter ivy trusting me to fix this jenks wanting to be a part of it frowning i dropped my eyes and brushed a smudge of dirt off my boot my dad had brought me up here upon occasion usually it was when he and my mom were arguing or she had fallen into a funk during which she would always smile and give me a kiss when i asked what was wrong now i wondered if her occasional depression had come from thinking about takata i exhaled watching the thought leave me like the mist from my breath and vanish into the collective consciousness my mother had quietly gone off her rocker trying to divorce herself from the reality of bearing takatas children while being lovingly married to my dad she had loved them both and seeing takata in robbie and me every day must have been a selfinflicted torture you cant forget anything i said watching the words vanish into nothing and even if you do it always comes back to bitchslap you in the morning the cool mist of the coming day was damp and pleasant and i closed my eyes against the brightening sky id been up way too long turning where i sat i looked behind me over the narrow parking strip to the two manmade ponds and the wide footbridge spanning them past the bridge was a ragged ley line unnoticeable unless you were really looking id found it while helping kisten fight off a foreign camarilla trying to kidnap his nephew audric last year and id forgotten all about it until feeling its discordant resonance through bis though weak it would be enough wondering how little audric was i wobbled off the bench slapped the cold from my jeans and headed across the lot i ran a hand over the red paint of my convertible in passing i loved my car and if i did this right id be back to get it before they towed it away i took the bridge with slow steps looking down for the telltale ripple of sharps the parks bridge troll but he was either hiding in the deeper water or they had chased him out again to the left was a wide expanse of concrete tucked in the curve of the upper pond two statues were cemented into the ground and hemmed in between them ran the ley line the faint red visible to my minds eye was growing weaker as the sun neared rising but it was still possible to see where it ran bound by a wolf on one side and a funnylooking guy with a cauldron on the other both holding the midpoint of the line stretching from one end of the park to the other it ran over the shallow water which was why the line was so pathetically weak here if the pond had been any deeper the line wouldnt have been able to survive as it was it was leaking enough power to make my skin prickle as i found a fairly clean patch of concrete and sat down just outside it taking a rock i leaned to scratch a sloppy circle right in the line even if the sun rose and broke my summons i could still talk to al if i stepped into the line though hed be under no obligation to stay and listen i really didnt think getting al to stay would be a problem my heart pounded and with sweat breaking out to make me cold i whispered jariathjackjunisjumoke i summon you i didnt need the trappings to force his appearance i only needed to open a channel and he cameusing the name i had chosen for myself al misted into existence in a seated slouched posture and i stared fascinated and repulsed as he took on a gross parody of me his legs were twisted akimbo skinny shoulders slumped and bare carrying redrimmed scratches that held crusted blood the slackjawed face staring back at me was mine but it was blank and empty the red stringy curls lank it was the eyes that were the worstdemonred goatslitted orbs staring at me from my own face i hated it when he showed up as me thats nice i said easing back from the circle a flicker of anger lit through his empty expression and a shimmer of everafter coated him his form grew blockier more solid a whiff of lilac came to me and the clean scent of crushed velvet he faced me squarely full of elegance and lordly refinement sitting crosslegged on the cold cement lace at his cuffs boots shining in the light ruddy complexion clean and every vestige of a bruise or cut gone i knew it was you he said the hatred in his deep voice pulling a shiver through me youre the only one who knows it i swallowed and tucked a curl behind my ear i never wanted your name i only wanted you to leave me alone why the hell couldnt you just leave me alone he sniffed only now looking around with a haughty disdain is that why youre calling me intoa park you want to trade back afraid youre going to be drawn back to the everafter when the sun rises his head tilted and he smiled showing me his flat blocky teeth you should be im most curious about that myself my mouth went dry im not a demon i said boldly you cant scare me the subtle tension in him rose i saw it in the slight tightening of his fingers rachel honey if youre not scared youre not going to survive his manner turned cocky and bitter well you took my name he said his noble british accent perfect and precise isnt it pleasant being at someones mercy trapped by a hack in a little tiny bubble is it a wonder we try to kill you an eyebrow rising he turned introspective did thomas arthur bansen escape i nodded and he smiled knowingly look i said glancing at the growing light for what its worth im sorry and if youd shut up about poor little you and listen we might be able to both come away with something unless you want to go back to that cell of yours al was silent then he inclined his head im listening i thought of ceri advising me against this of jenks ready to risk his life on a run we couldnt win and of ivy knowing i was the only one who could get myself out and dying inside as she forced herself to let me do it i thought about all the times i had brought in black witches pitying them for their foolishness telling myself demons were dangerous manipulating bastards who you couldnt beat but i wasnt trying to beat them i was trying to join themapparently i took a steadying breath this is what i want al made a rude noise as if for a nonexistent audience he threw a lacecuffed hand in the air a hint of burnt amber tickled my nose and i wondered if it was real or simply my memory inventing the scent i want you to leave the people i love alone especially my mother i want trent unharmed and free from persecution for stealing the elven sample i said voice low you are all collectively to leave him alone his head moved back and forth and he eyed me over his smoked glasses ill say it again you are not shy about asking for things i cant bind anyones actions but my own i nodded expecting this i want that same amnesty for stealing your sample and i want to rip your bloody fucking head off but it looks like were both going to be disappointed now arent we he mockingly crooned my breath shook as i exhaled i glanced at the east and my pulse quickened he had tortured my mom not in anger but to get to me never again what is it worth to you if i can not only get you out of jail but have the person who put you there apologize al sneered if you dont have anything constructive to say you should let me go back to the everafter and my cell i had everything under control until you demonstrated to minias that you could spindle line energy thats whats going to save your ass i shot back belligerent i have an idea to benefit both of us you wanna hear it he crossed his arms over his chest the lace fluttering and what is that buy a trip in to rescue trent with your soul it was mocking and my face burned its not worth it he added in a few hours im going to be banished to the surface my belongings raffled off as novelty items and my living space given to someone elsemy reputation destroyed id rather have your head than your soul at this point in my illustrious career good i shot back because youre not going to get it my heart pounded as i waited for him to get over his pity party sure enough after about five seconds of miffed silence he turned back to me in a very small voice i asked is there a system in place for a demon to teach another sort of a mentoring position god help me tell me im seeing things clearly and unclouded by pride al threw his head back and laughed the water surrounding us rippled and i heard the echo of it come back from the new town houses across the street there hasnt been a demon needing instruction for five thousand years he exclaimed im about to be exiled to the surface and you want me to take you on as a student teach you everything i know for free just because i said nothing waiting as he followed my question to the reasoning behind it and his ruddy face lost all expression eyes peering over those damned glasses of his he stared as my pulse quickened yes he said softly almost breathing the word there is my hands were shaking and i wrapped my arms around myself and tucked them under the shelter of my jacket and if you said you had taken me on as a student instead of a familiarbecause i could twist demon magicthen you wouldnt be in trouble for letting me know how to spindle everafter in my thoughts his head moved almost imperceptibly up and down his jaw tightening you could tell them that you taught me then left me here because i was learning more fighting you than i could in the everafter but i didnt his voice was so lacking in emotion it sounded dead they dont know that i said als chest rose and fell in a sigh i could see relief in him and i wondered what it was like to be a demon and afraid and how long he would let me live knowing i not only saw it but had the answer to save him why he asked i licked my lips i want trent if im your student wouldnt i be entitled to a familiar hell i made one of my boyfriends my familiar before you broke the bond i said attention going everywhere as i tried to hide my shame even though i knew id never use another person like that at least not intentionally trent is wearing smut that i should have i added he took it voluntarily thats what a familiar does his fingers twitching with a repressed excitement al smiled and my reputation is restored the demon glanced to the east and adjusted his glasses to hide his eyes they arent stupid he said dryly they will say its a convenient story this was the really scary part i had trusted al to give me a night of peace but this was entirely different which is why youre going to bring me through the lines so i can speak in your defense i said fear clenching my heart then you do what you have to for me to claim trent as my familiar trenton aloysius kalamack wears miniass mark he said quickly but hes wearing my smut of his own free will i offered and al pursed his lips leaning back until he hit the bubble and jerked forward i would need to buy your familiars mark from minias he mused aloud eyebrows rising he shifted a hand in a gesture of possibility but i can do it then trent and i come back here and we all go back to normal al snorted sweet innocence be damned what about my name he asked making a moot face i want that back i met his gaze refusing to give on this you wont be in jail his eyes narrowed i want my name i need it i remembered what ceri had said about how he made his living would i be responsible for the people al tricked into slavery if i gave it back to him logic said no but emotion said i should stop him if i could but what about me being summoned into toms circle i didnt want that happening again maybe i whispered his attention bore into mine as he took a slow breath i didnt know what he was going to come back with rachel he said and the simple sound of it made my blood turn cold something was there that hadnt been before and it scared the crap out of me i need to know something before i will bargain with you anymore hearing a trap i edged back my jeans scraping on the grit between me and the cement im not giving anything for free his expression didnt change oh not free he said in a dangerous monotone insight into anothers thoughts is never free you pay for it in the mostunexpected ways i want to know why you didnt call minias the other night i saw your decision to let me go and i want to know why you did it minias would have jailed me you would have had a night of freedom yet youlet me go why because i wasnt about to call a mouse of a demon when i could take care of it myself i said then hesitated that wasnt why because i thought if i gave you a night of peace you might give me the same god i had been stupid to think that a demon would respect that had been dumb but a slow deeply satisfied smile came over him and his breath quickened so softly it starts he whispered foolishly clever and with an unsurvivable trust it just saved your miserable life that questionable show of thought my itchywitch als smile shifted becoming lighter and now you will live to possibly regret it i shivered not knowing if i had just saved or damned myself but id be alive and that was what mattered right now you as my protégée he asked as if trying it on i felt dizzy name only i breathed putting a hand on the cold cement to ground myself you leave me alone my family too stay away from my mom you sob priceless al mocked no if i am taking you you will be here he touched the ground by his knee in the everafter with me absolutely not al took a breath then leaned forward with his brow furrowed as if he was trying to impress me with the weight of his words you dont understand witch he said hammering in the last word there hasnt been the chance to teach someone worth the salt of their blood in a very long time if we are going to play this game then we will play it he leaned back and i remembered to breathe i cant claim you as a student if you arent with me he said gesturing flamboyantly his earlier mood of seriousness replaced with his usual dramatic flair be reasonable i know you can be if you try very very hard i didnt like his mocking tone ill visit you one night a week i countered he eyed me over his glasses his gaze rising to the coming sun one night a week off and the rest of the time youre with me my thoughts went to trent i could walk away from this right now but i wouldnt be able to live with myself ill give you one twentyfourhour perioda full day and night every week take it or leave it damn it trent you owe me big two he countered and i stifled a tremor i had him over a barrel having shown him his freedom and the status having a teachable student would bring him still he could say no and then neither of us would have anything and i was hoping that i might get something else out of him before we were done one i said sticking to my original offer and i want to know how to jump the lines immediately i will not be stranded with no way home a curious light flickered in his eyes it wasnt lust it wasnt anticipation i didnt know what it was we will spend our time as i see fit he said then leered completely wiping out the deeper emotion id seen in him any way i want he added licking his ruddy lips no sex i said heart pounding im not sleeping with you forget it it was now or never and i want that mark of yours removed i blurted gratis call it a signing bonus his lips parted and he laughed until he realized i was serious that would leave you with only newts mark he said amused her claim on you would be stronger than mine not a healthy place to be when one is in the everafter andvulnerable okay good point backtrack a little then buy newts mark for me i said shaking inside and take it off you want me as an apprentice i want some insurance face clouding he thought about it and i got really scared when his expression shifted to a devilish delight only if you give me my name backmadam algaliarept do that and we have a deal i shuddered upon hearing the terms come from his lips and i didnt care that he saw it his grin deepened but considering that i wouldnt have to deal with newt ever again or risk being summoned into als circle it wasnt a bad arrangement for either of us you dont get your name until newts mark is gone i countered he looked at me then turned to the bright horizon his smoked glasses going even blacker the sun is about to rise he murmured distantly and i held my breath not knowing if he agreed or not so are we doing this i asked there was a jogger at the far end of the park and his dog was barking furiously at us one more question he said bringing his gaze back to me tell me what it was like being trapped in someones bubble like a demon my face screwed up at the memory i hated it i said and a small noise slipped from him rising up from someplace deep inside him where only he knew his thoughts it was degradinginfuriating that a worm like tom had control of me i wanted toscare him so bad he wouldnt ever do it again als expression shifted when what i had said hit me and i put a hand to my chest damn it back to the turn i understood him he hadnt asked because he hadnt known how i felt he asked so i would see we were the same god help me please dont do that to me again he said ever my stomach cramped he was asking for me to trust him out of a circle and it was the scariest thing id ever had to do okay i whispered you got it al looked at the bubble of everafter over his head and tugged the lace of his cuffs down come here at that instant light spilled over the rim of earth surrounding cincinnati my scratched circle was still there but al no longer was shaking i dropped the barrier of everafter and brought my second sight into focus taking a breath i stepped into the line to find him standing right where id left him smiling with his hand extended around him or us rather slumped the broken city grasschoked chunks of pavement standing at odd angles thrusting upward from the earth there was no bridge or ponds just dead grass and a red haze i didnt look behind me to the hollows as the wind blew grit into my face i was standing in a line balanced between reality and the everafter i could go either way i wasnt his yet one day a week i said knees wobbling i give you newts mark you give me my name al said then wiggled his fingers as if he needed me to take them to finish the deal i reached for it and at the last moment als glove melted away and i found myself gripping his hand i stifled my first impulse to jerk away feeling the hard calluses and the warmth it was done now i only had to roll with the surprises rachel came a call with the slamming of a car door god no it had been my moms voice and my hand still in als i turned unable to see anything al pulled me into him and numb i felt his arm curve possessively about my waist too late he whispered his breath shifting the hair about my ear and we jumped thirtythree the jump through the line hit me like a bucket of ice water an uncomfortable slap right from the start with the shock turning into the sensation of being wet where you dont want to be and left dripping i felt my body shatterthat was the shockand then my thoughts tightened into a ball around my soul to hold it togetherthat was the miserable drippingwet part that i was holding my soul together and not al was a surprise to both of us good came als grudging almost worried thought rippling over the protective bubble i had somehow made about my psyche and then came the push back into existence again the bucket of ice water hit my thoughts as he shoved me out of the line i tried to see how he did it coming away without a clue but at least i had managed to keep from spreading my thoughts over the entire continent crisscrossed with ley linesthe stretchy stuff that kept the everafter from vanishing if jenks was right i gasped as i felt my lungs form dizzy i fell to my hands and knees ow i said as i looked at the dirty white tile then brought my head up at the hammering of noise we were in a large room men in suits were everywhere standing or sitting in orange chairswaiting get up al grumbled bending to bodily yank me upright i rose arms and legs flopping until i found my feet wideeyed i stared at the irate people dressed in a vast array of styles al jerked me into motion and my mouth dropped as i realized we had popped into existence upon what looked like an fib emblem holy crap it even looked like the fib reception room minus the demons of course feeling displaced and unreal i turned to where the doors to the street would have been seeing only a blank wall and more waiting demons is this the fib i stammered its someones idea of a joke al said his voice tight and his accent impeccable get off the pad unless you want someones elbow in your ear god it stinks i said hand over my nose as he pulled me into a long step al strode forward head high its the stench of bureaucracy my itchywitch and why i chose to go into human resources when but a wee lad wed come up to a set of imposing wooden doors there were two uniformed men beside itdemons by their eyeslooking bored and stupid they probably had stupid denizens in the everafter just like everywhere else behind us was a rising angry mutter that i recognized from when i tried to sneak thirteen items into a twelveitemonly line docket number the more brilliant of the two asked and al reached for the door hey the other said coming to life youre supposed to be in jail al grinned at him his whitegloved grip tightening on the wooden handle which was intricately carved in the shape of a naked writhing woman nice and your momma wanted you to have a brain he said yanking the door open and slamming it into the guys face i danced backward at the ensuing uproar but al took my upper arm and strode forward nose in the air buckled shoes snapping and velveteen coattails swaying you ah have a way with civil servants i said almost panting to keep up i wasnt about to drag my feet id stormed a few offices myself you had to move quickly to get past the redtapeloving idiots and find someone intelligent enough to appreciate the nerve of barging in someone dying for an interruption and the chance to procrastinate someone likei peered at the nameplate on the door al stopped before someone like dallkarackint jeez what was it with demon names wait a sec dali dallkarackintwas this the guy al had wanted to throw my dead body in front of al opened the door shoved me in then backkicked the door shut to block out the uproar storming up the hall behind us i felt a tweak on my awareness and wondered if hed locked it it was a thought that grew more plausible when the pounding on the door stayed pounding and didnt turn into a big ugly demon with a broken nose squinting i caught my balance in thesand shocked i looked up as what had to be a fake breeze smelling of seaweed and burnt amber shifted my hair i was standing in hot sand in the sun the door had become a small changing hut and a boardwalk ran from right to left to the surfsoaked horizon stretching into the almost green water was a canopycovered dock at the end was a large platform on which a man sat behind a desk okay he was a demon but he looked like an attractive fiftysomething ceo who had brought his desk with him on vacation instead of his laptop before him in an upright deck chair was a woman in a purple sari the scrying mirror on her lap flashed in the sun angling under the canopy that shaded the desk his familiar wow i said unable to look at everything at once this isnt real is it al straightened his crushed velvet and pulled me onto the boardwalk no he said as our heels clunked on the wood its casual friday my god the sun sliding under the awning is even warm i thought as we found the dock and started down it i suppose if one was a demon and had unlimited power why not put the illusion of the bahamas around you at the office al yanked me forward when i lagged to see if there were fish in the water and i yelped when i felt a cascading shimmer cross over me there al soothed and i shoved his hand off me now dont you look proper must wear our best when before the court my pulse quickened as i realized i was wearing my usual working leathers my hair back in a scrunchy and my buttkicking boots on my feet the purple scarf around my waist was new though if youre trying to make nicenice this might not be the best way to do it i said to al when the guy behind the desk leaned back in annoyance as he saw us and the woman took her hand from the mirror relax al pulled me further into his burntamber scent as we came to a respectful halt on the round rug laid on the rough planks before the desk im supposed to be exiled this morning they would have been disappointed if i didnt do something dramatic a puddle of gray in the sunsoaked dinghy tied to the dock moved and my gaze shifted oh god it was trent he looked washed out and thin as he bobbed on the fake tide in the sun and when he saw me hate filled his bloodshot eyes he had to know i was here to rescue him didnt he the demon behind the desk sighed and my attention shifted to him somehow he looked right out here in the cool brimstonescented breezy shade of the canopy his desk perched over the water with a coffee cup and a stack of files on it flipflops poked from under the dark mahogany desk and his hawaiianprint top showed a wisp of hair at his chest setting his pen down he gestured sourly al what by the two worlds colliding are you doing in my office al beamed as the demon recognized him pulling himself straight tugging the lace at his wrists and scuffing his shinybuckled boots on the planks elevating your status dali dear dali leaned back in his chair and glanced at the woman silently waiting before or after i sling your ass to the surface he said in a bothered tone his fast voice rough his eyes flicked to me and his lips pursed briefly you dont have anything left to elevate anyone and killing her before the courts will not excuse you from teaching her how to spindle line energy and let her run about with no compulsion to keep her mouth shut hey i said not wanting that to stand without correction i was under compulsion to keep my mouth shut so was ceri we were under lots of compulsion al gripped my arm and dragged me back a step as i added youve no idea the amount of compulsion we were under you misunderstand my most honorable asskisser al said jaw clenched at my outburst id sooner die before giving rachel mariana morgan to the courts im not here to kill her im here to demand that the uncommon stupidity charge against me be dropped my shock at the honorableasskisser comment was pushed away by the thought of a law against uncommon stupidity and i wondered how we could get one remembering trent i nudged al oh yes the demon added and i would ask that my students familiar be released to my custody busy day planned we could use his help must get him trained up up up in the dinghy trent pulled himself up and sat on the bench his motions slow as if he was in pain there was a humiliating red ribbon about his neck i wondered why he wore it but upon seeing that his fingers were red and swollen i decided they werent letting him take it off dali pushed his papers away and glanced at the woman i appreciate your efforts to weasel out of a hundred years of community service but youve nothing left get out i turned to al seeing his complexion take on a new hue of red community service you told me they were going to banish you to the surface they are he growled pinching my elbow now shut up i fumed but al was already facing dali ive taken morgan as a student not a familiar he said its not illegal or uncommonly stupid to teach a student how to spindle line energy i simply didnt think it was worth mentioningat the time dalis eyes widened on the floor trents hatred grew directed and i winced this was looking really bad and id have done anything to have been able to explain smiling al looped his arm in mine try to look sexy he muttered poking me until my back stiffened student dali blurted both hands going palmsdown on the desk al she can spindle line energy al interrupted her blood can twist demon curses she took a human as a familiar before i broke the bond common knowledge the demon said pointing irately you said something about status give me something i dont know or get the hell onto the surface where you belong al took a worried breath his face never changed but i was standing so close i felt it and somehow that was scary exhaling al nodded once as a student might to an instructor it was the first show of respect id seen from him and i grew more frightened yet his gaze flicked to the woman with the scrying mirror and dalis eyebrows rose the older demon pressed his lips and gestured for her to leave she silently stood set the mirror on his desk with disgust and then vanished in a pop that was lost in the sound of the wind against the water this better be good dali grumbled i rent her by the hour al swallowed and i swear i could smell the faintest hint of sweat on him this witch can be summoned he said softly an arm behind and before him she can be summoned through the lines by way of a password dali made a puff of air and al added in a louder voice i know this because she stole mine and was summoned out in my stead dali leaned forward thats how she escaped he turned to me you stole als summoning name voluntarily he asked i opened my mouth to tell him it was so al would leave me and my family alone but dali had returned his attention to al she was summoned out how did you get out then she summoned me in turn al said his voice dropping in pitch thats what im saying old man she integrated her password into our system well enough for it to be used in summoning she can invoke demon magic she accidentally made her boyfriend her familiar exboyfriend i muttered but neither was listening now are you going to hand me a shovel so i can dig my way out al said or are you going to banish me to the surface and throw this pretty little ball of chance against the wall of elfshit and watch it shatter none of you have the finesse for this newt perhaps if she were sane but she isnt and would you trust newt not to kill her i wouldnt dalis eyes narrowed you think he mused i know al said chilling me with what he might have said and my gaze flicked to trent listening in the dinghy damn it ceri said i wasnt a demon but thislooked really bad she is my student al said loudly i already made the deal shes mine but i want her free of newts mark to prevent anymisunderstanding all i want from you is to serve as witness and to set up a safe place for me to do a deal with newt fear jerked me straight hes going to do the deal now with me here ah wait up boys i exclaimed backing up until al gave me a withering look this is newt were talking about right no way no freaking way ignoring me the demon behind the desk hesitated nevertheless he reclined with his fingers steepled against the colorful pattern of flowers on his shirt as the wind ruffled his hair and i was suddenly struck with the memory of me asking edden to throw me a preserver to get myself out of my personal crapfest just last year damn were we that much alike al and i using what we had and scrambling to stay alive call her al said as he picked a tin of snuff from an inner coat pocket a whiff of brimstone came to me as he delicately sniffed a pinch newt doesnt remember shit about morgan but she knows she forgot something shell give me the witchs mark in return for her memory and when she finds out minias wiped the knowledge from her accident or not shell bloody kill him that leaves three knowing his smile grew devious three is a very stable number what about trent i questioned thinking this was getting more complex than id dreamed it would be the deal was i get him patience itchywitch al muttered between his teeth as he smiled at dali and put an arm over my shoulders i shoved his hand off me and glanced at trent he had to have known this was all to get him free and that he wouldnt really be my familiar but his look was one of pure hatred the older demon shifted in his chair and when our eyes met i stifled a shiver in a sudden motion dali reached for the scrying mirror setting it before him he smiled wickedly at al ill see if shes cognizant this morning my pulse hammered and my palms sweated almost immediately dallkarackints brow furrowed in worry cleared and then he smiled al i whispered backing up as i remembered newts utterly unbalanced powerful presence tearing apart my living room and mastering three blood circles as she searched my church for who knew what al this isnt a good idea this really isnt a good idea he huffed and grasped my shoulders forcing me to stand beside him you asked for a bloody miracle who did you think id have to go to for it be a good girl and dont slouch i fought to get free of his grip my motions stilling when newts androgynous shape misted into existence bald and barefoot her high cheekbones flushed and her brows raised in question she wore a robe that was somewhere between a kimono and a sari matching miniass usual outfit but hers was a dark red billowing and lightweight her eyes were completely black even the whites and i remembered the touch of her hand on my jaw and how she had searched my face the first time we had met comparing me to her sisters mouth dry i tried to get al between us not caring if i looked scared i was she slowly turned her black gaze going from the bobbing dinghy to the ornate desk dali she said her voice had a smooth but masculine edge to it and the demon took his hand from the mirror her attention shifted to al algaliarept she questioned shouldnt you be making a sun shelter about now and then her eyes fell upon me you she said stepping forward with a vehement expression and her finger pointed heart pounding i pressed into al funny how he seemed so much safer now newt love al soothed a black haze enveloping his extended hand and i felt the tension almost crack you look marvelous dont muss your dress shes here for a reason dont you want to hear it before you tear her head off newt hesitated and as my pulse hammered in my ears she graciously sank back into the deck chair dalis secretary had been in dali was still behind the desk but he was standing now your familiar has something that belongs to me she said almost petulantly im assuming youre here to sell her trying to buy space in the zoo are you dali cleared his throat and came around his desk to offer her a tall glass of what looked like iced tea it hadnt been there a moment ago al is trying to weasel his way out of debt and thinks it will take that mark the witch owes you the older demon said as he leaned against his desk ankles crossed in a subtle show of submissiveness be a dear and sell it to him love she had taken the drink the ice tinkling faintly as she set it on a round wicker table that showed up the instant she took her hand from the glass since al wants it the answer is no al took a step forward leaving me to feel exposed newt love im sure with a glance she stopped him im sure you have nothinglove she mocked you sold everything down to your rooms to bribe for a late court date and post bail im crazy not stupid my jaw dropped and i warmed you did what i exclaimed great i was the student of a destitute demon but newt was now looking at me and i backed up a step she has something of mine she said she wears my mark give her to me and maybe ill buy your rooms back for you at that al smiled kneeling before her he took up her drink what she has is a memory of you two meeting of what you learned and no one else but i figured out give me the witchs mark al whispered as he handed her the glass and ill tell you what that is better still ill keep reminding you when that bastard minias doses you into forgetting itagain the glass in her grip cracked and an amber bead of liquid formed and rolled down the side it was followed by another minias she almost growled as she set the glass aside her jaw tight in anger and her black orbs terrifyingly intent her gaze fell on me and i went cold she stood and al casually backed up to get between us yes or no love he said putting me behind him yes she whispered and i yelped shaking my foot when it gave a twinge al steadied me but his intake of breath shook at our success you put it on your foot he asked me i didnt have a choice i said knees weak he had done it that fast he had gotten newts mark switched to him now all that was left was to return his name for it and id be free of the mark completely this is working i thought glancing at trent who was watching in numb shock tell me what i forgot newt said eyeing me with suspicion al smiled laying a finger beside his nose he leaned into her she can invoke demon magic he said holding up a finger to forestall newts snort of anger she has made a human her familiar though i broke that bond it had better be more than that al she intoned starting to look pissed as she drew away from al and looked out over the fake water she stole my name and made it her own newt turned to face him her expression empty and she was summoned out under it black eyes going wide newt sucked in her breath i killed my sisters she said and my brief elation at getting her mark shifted to al twisted into fear she cant be kin oh shes kin al said chuckling as he pulled me to him his grip tightening as i struggled kin born not of us but of the elves stupid stupid elves who forgot and fixed what they broke you figured it out and minias stole the knowledge from you for long enough that i could realize it too and get her first she should be mine give her to me but al shook his head as dali tensed behind his desk the demon smiling as he breathed in the scent from my hair i let him numb and bewildered kin witches really were kin to demons it went against everything id been taught but damn it it made sense i jumped at a soft pop of displaced air minias burst into existence his sandaled feet on the old wood he was wearing his purple robes and i fingered my belt starting to think that was the color demons dressed their familiars in when they were pleased with them newt minias exclaimed drawing back when he realized who else was here giving trent barely a glance what are you doing here he questioned then paled at her venomous look you made me forget what she is she whispered come here minias red goatslitted eyes widening minias reared back and vanished wait i shouted then turned to al i need him you promised me trent als expression at my outburst was one of pure disgust and when newt turned to me i wished id kept my mouth shut you want that elf for a familiar she asked i licked my lips he put me in a cage i said trying to come up with a reason other than rescuing him trent got to his feet the dinghy rocking until he steadied himself against the dock whereupon dali kicked him back to the bottom of the boat hes the perfect familiar for my student al interjected smoothly over my head his grip on my arm telling me to shut up easily hurt stubborn prone to biting but basically harmless one must learn to ride a pony before tackling the stallion he owes minias a favor i could press the issue since the elf is voluntarily wearing her smut but honestly its easier just to buy a mark al smiled with a delicious irony maybe ill offer to tell him about my new student that ought to be worth something i tensed as newts eyes narrowed youll tell me again if i forget al nodded and newts face grew ugly the elf doesnt owe minias anything i give his mark to you trent groaned and fell back his hatefilled expression chilling me dalis brows rose i didnt know you could do that newt spun making her robe unfurl hes my familiar bought and paid for i can claim anything of his even his life al cleared his throat nervously thats good to know he said lightly important safety tip rachel write that down somewhere as lesson number one her lips pressed tightly newt pulled her attention from the false horizon and found me ice seemed to scum my skin and i felt myself pale i had everything id come for i had rubbed out newts mark or at least i would when i gave al his name back i had saved trenti thought so why did every instinct tell me everything was about to hit the fan you will teach her newt said to al looking at me with her black eyes al nodded and pulled me closer and i let him as if she were my daughter newt dropped back a step her hands clasped before her and her head bowed she looked funny and i got the feeling that something was being settled that i didnt understand youre a good teacher newt finally said when her head came up ceri was very skilled i know i miss her her head moved up and down and then she turned to me when youre ready come to me maybe by then ill have my memory back and ill know what in hell is going on i clenched my hands so no one would see them tremble but when i took a breath to answer her she vanished dalis exhale was loud and strong i give minias two days als shoulders slumped hes used to evading her i give himseven he shifted uneasily looking at the sparkles in the surf rachel collect your elf im tired and i want to wash the cellstink off me i didnt move and he gave me a shove in trents direction before turning to dali im assuming the charge of uncommon stupidity will be dropped dali smiled yes yes take your students familiar and get out are you going to remind newt as you said you would al smiled every day until she kills him yes unsure i looked at trent gazing murderously at me then al uh al i prompted get your elf itchywitch he said under his breath i want to get out of here before newt remembers a rule or something and comes back but trent was looking at me like he wanted to jam a pen in my eye taking a shaky breath i strode to him falling into a crouch and extending a hand to help him out of the bobbing boat a low sound rose from him i stared at him frozen as he lunged at me trent i managed before he got a grip on my throat my back hit the dock and he landed on me pushing my air out he was straddling me his grip cutting off my airand then he was gone and i could breathe again i heard a thump looking up to see that al had backhanded him off of me trent slumped to the dock a leg hanging off it and threatening to pull him into the water shocked i stared as he curled into himself and retched over the side lesson number two al said as he yanked me up with a whitegloved hand never trust your familiar what in hell is wrong with you i shouted glaring at trent as i shook you can kill me later but right now i want to get out of here i reached out and this time he did nothing when i pulled him to al i didnt know how to travel the lines but i assumed al would jump us seeing as i had just saved his demon ass thank you i muttered very conscious of dali watching us with calculation thank me later itchywitch al said nervously im popping you and your familiar back to your church but i expect to see you in fifteen minutes in your ley line with your spelling supplies and a new stick of magnetic chalk i need some time to ah rent a room somewhere my eyes closed in a long blink al really was broke swell cant we start this next week i asked but it was too late and i felt trents grip on me tighten as my body was torn apart by time then melted back into existence i was so tired i could have cried i didnt even feel dizzy when the stink of the everafter vanished the acidic scent of cut grass hit me and wavering on my feet i opened my eyes to the somber gray and green of my graveyard slowly i slumped i was home dad a tiny voice shrilled and i jerked to find one of jenkss kids staring at me shes back and shes got mr kalamack blinking back the tears i took a deep breath and turned to the church shining in the morning sun it had to be later than that i felt like id lived a lifetime seeing trent at my feet i reached to pull him up were back i said wearily hauling on him get up dont let ceri see you on the ground like that it was over at least for now still on the ground trent yanked on my arm i sucked in my breath and tried to land in a front fall but he pulled me off balance and i landed on my side instead trent i started then yelped when he jerked me up slamming my head into a tombstone hey i shouted then howled when he twisted my arm quicker than i could follow he slammed my head into the stone again my vision blurred as the pain swelled and trying to figure out what the hell was going on i stupidly did nothing when he wrapped an arm around my throat from behind and started squeezing trent i managed to get out then choked feeling my face seem to bulge i wont let you do it came his voice snarling in my ear ill kill you first do what i thought struggling to breathe i just saved his ass putting my heels to the ground i shoved backward but we only fell over his grip loosened and i got a breath and then his grip went tighter demon kin trent exclaimed his voice raw and alien it was there in front of me but i didnt believe it my fatherdamn him trenton ceris voice came faintly from over the graveyard as my consciousness started to slip stop stop it i felt her fingers trying to wedge between trents grip and my skin and i choked as it loosened again i couldnt break his hold and my oxygenstarved muscles were like wet paper she has to die trent said his voice close and rasping in my ear i heard them my father my father mended her he agonized and his grip tightened she can start it up again not now i wont let her his arm muscle bunched and as pain struck through me i heard my last breath gurgle let go ceri pleaded and i saw her dress trent stop it they called her kin trent shouted i watched her take a demons name she was summoned out under it shes not a demon ceri demanded let her go her braid slapped me as she bent over us and tugged at his fingers trenton let her go she saved quen she saved all of us let her go shes not a demon his grip loosened and as i gasped retching almost he shoved me away from him i fell against the tombstone that he had hammered my head against and i held it fingers shaking as i pulled lungful after lungful of air into me holding my neck and trying to find a way to breathe that didnt hurt she might not be a demon trent said from behind me and i turned but her children will be i slumped back against the stone feeling the blood drain from me my children ceri was kneeling beside him her hands on him as she felt for damage ready to hold him back if he tried to finish the job but all i could do was sit in the sun and stare what i rasped and he laughed bitterly youre the only female witch my father fixed he accused taking the red ribbon from his neck and letting it fall to the ground lee cant pass on the cure its in the mitochondria youre the only one who could start it all up again but ill kill you first trenton no ceri exclaimed but he was too weak to do anything staring at him i felt my reality start to crumble god no it was too much trent ceri was saying kneeling between us trying to distract him she saved us you have a cure waiting in your labs because of her we can be whole again trent kill her and you stain our beginning you lose everything stop fighting them its killing us from under the mat of his hair trent seethed his eyes trying to burn me where i sat i felt dirty unclean filthy your father saved her because he was friends with her father ceri rushed he didnt know what it would do its not your fault its not her fault but she gave you the way to make us whole today right now ceri hesitated then added perhaps we deserved what happened trents attention tore from me landing on ceri you dont believe that ceri was blinking to keep from crying but a tear slid down making her all the more beautiful we can start again she said so can they the war almost destroyed both of us dont start it up again not when we finally have a chance to live trent listen to me i shut my eyes why doesnt it go away in a rush of sound ivy and jenks arrived together standing over us in shock while ceri held trent back from killing me hi i croaked still holding my neck and ivy dropped to me what happened ivy asked and my chest clenched to an unbearable tightness she didnt know how could i tell her youre back she added checking me for damage are you okay your mother said you went with al at eden park damn it rachel stop trying to fight everything by yourself i opened my eyes at the concern in her voice i wondered whether i should just stay in the everafter at least there i wouldnt be putting my friends in danger kin witches are kin to demons suddenly it was making a whole lot of sense demons had cursed elves into a slow slide of extinction had it been done in retaliation had the elves hit the demons first rache you okay no i wasnt okay but i couldnt seem to get my mouth to work to say the words i wasnt a demon but my children would be damn it this wasnt fair is it trent ivy said her anger rounding on him and i shook my head get out of here kalamack before i pound you into the ground ceris delicate form helped trent up and as they hunched into each other she helped him hobble to the street gate she turned once the tears flowing freely from her angerblack eyes im sorry rachel ii i looked away unable to bear it i wasnt ever going to have kids now not with anyone never stupidass elf look what they did to me rachel ivy said forcing me to look at her tell me what happened she gave me a shake and i stared at her numb jenks was on her shoulder he looked terrified like he already knew trent i started and tears spilled over wiping them angrily i tried again trents dadhe jenks took to the air and got in my face youre not a demon rachel i nodded trying to focus on him im not i said choking on my words but my kids will be remember last year when i said witches and demons both started in the everafter i think the elves spelled the demons magically stunting their kids and starting the witches and when trents dad fixed me he broke the genetic checks and balances they put in to keep the demons from having children witches are stunted demons and now demons can come from witches again from me ivys hand fell from me and i saw the horror in her quiet face im sorry i whispered i didnt mean to screw up your life ivy sat back stunned and the sun blinded me tired beyond belief i looked up to see ceri helping trent out of the garden what in hell had it all been for thirtyfour blue and pink baby booties had replaced the bats hanging in the sanctuary the storebought garland draping from one end of the sanctuary to the other a cutout of a stork stood on the coffee table and ivys piano was covered in yellow and green paper tablecloths the white cake on it was surrounded by pixies snitching frosting that is the ones who werent clustered over ceri ooohing over the delicate pair of baby booties and lace collar that matalina and her older daughters had made the happy elf sat across from me in ivys chair surrounded by pixies wrapping paper and gifts she was nearly glowing and it made me feel good outside the falling rain brought darkness early but in here it was warm comfortable and full of the peace of companionship one month pregnant is way too soon for a baby shower i thought as i leaned into the cushions while ceri read the card from my mother the box on her lap suspiciously similar in size to a humidifier but watching ceris delight i knew it had been the right thing to do we needed to celebrate the beginning of a life the beginning of something ivy was to my left on the couch crammed into the corner as if she didnt know her limits anymore shed been like that all week hovering but hesitant and it was driving me nuts her gift to ceri had been the first one opened an absolutely stunning lace christening dress of intricate beauty ivy had gone red at the fuss ceri had made over it and i was sure that ivy had picked the delicate bit of feminine beauty out because she had given up the idea of ever having children herself though she never talked about it i knew ivy would rather remain childless than perpetuate her vampiric misery upon someone she loved especially an innocent who was dependent on her for everything i squished the crumbs of my cake up with a fork as my eyes drifted to the present jenks and i had gone in on together wondering what it said about us i had bought a set of redwood building blocks and jenks had painted garden flowers and bugs on them to go along with the alphabet he was working on another set for his children determined they would all know how to read before spring the pixies flew up in noisy delight when ceri got the wrapping paper off and revealed a dr dans misty memories humidifier with deluxe soothing atomizer built right in to lull your baby to sleep on the most trying of nights i was staying out of the way but my mother went to kneel beside ceri as the elf seriously unpacked the thermometer and burping cloths she had put in there with it ceri this is a lifesaver my mom was saying as the younglooking elf lifted the green plastic monstrosity out rachel was a fussy baby but i would just put a bit of lilac into the little cup and she would drop right off she smiled at me looking different with her new hairstyle and its indispensable if your baby gets the croup robbie never got the croup but rachel lord love a duck shed just about scare me to death every winter with her coughing hearing a story coming on i picked up a few plates and stood excuse me i said beating a tactful retreat into the kitchen as my mom started in on the story of my nearly suffocating ceri looked properly horrified and i rolled my eyes to tell her it was mostly momma drama mostly i glanced back at the scene of content femininity as the dark confines of the hall took me my mother had gifted ceris baby with a wish for health matalina gave the trappings of security ivy imparted beauty and innocence and jenks and i gave wisdom or maybe entertainment the kitchen held a cool quietness and i glanced out at the graveyard and let my vision drift into my second sight to make sure al wasnt waiting for me the redsmeared sky of the everafter mingled with the reality of gray clouds to make an ugly picture and i shivered though the line was empty he said he would call first but i didnt trust him not to just show up and scare the crap out of everyone apparently newts claim that he had made himself destitute was right because he said he wasnt going to bring me over until he had a kitchen that wouldnt embarrass him i wanted my name back and that mark on my foot removed and i think he was stalling not wanting to lose that hold on me that was a lovely shower my mom said from the hallway and i jumped startled holy crap mom i exclaimed dropping my second sight and turning youre worse than ivy she smiled a glint of devilry in her as she sashayed in cakestrewn plates and silverware in hand thank you for inviting me i dont get to go to too many of these things hearing an accusation in there i plugged the sink and ran some water mom i said tiredly as i pulled out the soap im not having any kids im sorry youll be lucky if you even get a wedding out of me my mother made a rude sound part laugh part wiseoldwoman scoffing im sure you feel that way now she said as she dropped the forks into the sink but youre young give it some time you might feel differently after youve met the right man i turned the water off breathing deeply of the lemonscented air and slipping my hands into the warm water and washing the forks i wished shed drop the facade of what she wanted for what was real mom i said voice low my children will be stolen by demons for the ability to kindle their magic im not going to risk that well actually they would be demons thanks to trents dad but there was no reason to tell her that im not going to have kids i said slowly washing the plates rachel my mom protested but i shook my head adamant kisten died because of me nick went over the bridge ive got a standing date in the everafter once a week once al gets his act together im not a good candidate for a girlfriend can you see me as a mother my mother smiled yes i can and you would be a good one the tears pricked and i dropped a handful of clean silverware into the dry half of the sink and ran hot water over them i couldnt it was too risky pulling a cloth from a top drawer my mom took the handful of clean silverware id dropped into the sink lets say youre right she said and you dont even adopt or take in a child who needs a home but what if youre wrong theres someone out there whos suited for you someone who has enough strength or knowledge to keep themselves safe i bet theres a foxy young man looking right now for a woman who can take care of herself and thinking he cant have anyone either i smiled faintly picturing it ill place an ad okay swfw looking for swm must be able to fight off demons and vampires and be willing to put up with jealous roommate then i sighed in the thought that that pretty much summed up nick and kisten nick was a real winner and kisten was dead because of me because he had tried to save me my mom touched my arm and i handed her one of ceris teacups i just want you to be happy she said i am i said confidently so i could believe it i really am but when i found out who had bitten me and killed kisten and then i ripped him apart i was going to be a whole lot happier maybe al knew a pandora charm maybe he had a book and i could just read up on it when he was sleeping from the sanctuary came the masculine sound of a hello and the excited tinkling of pixy chatter it was quen the party was breaking up passing my mom the last dish i went more melancholy still i had saved quen but not my dad that sucked my mom must have known my thoughts as she gave me a sideways hug she pulled away but her damp hands seemed to leave a lasting impression on me dont make such a sad face rachel i loved your dad but ive been hurting for so long i forgot how to be happy i need to i nodded knowing where she was coming from put something good in its place so you can think about him without the pain she nodded giving me another tight hug as if she was trying to squeeze some of her happiness into me i want to help ceri get her things back home she said and i dried my hands we left the kitchen together my mothers arm still over me it made me feel good like i felt when i was little protected loved but when we entered the sanctuary my arm fell away takata is here too the man gave me an awkward wave as he stood by the piano with his fingers in the frosting and pixies sitting on his thin shoulders i felt a stab of emotion when my mothers demeanor changed and she went to him delighted she seemed younger especially with that new haircut her heart was light now that the truth was out which made me feel bad that it had taken so long for that to happen ceri had her raincoat on and seeing me standing alone she excused herself gathering quen in her wake as she crossed the room she was beautiful in her happy contentment and i glanced at ivy the vampire wore a hungry look i understood it wasnt vampiric hunger it was the hunger from seeing someone who has what you want but knowing that if you get it it will break your heart your life and your soul neither of us would be having children it was as if ceri were having a child for all of us poor little baby was going to have so many aunts he or she wasnt going to walk on anything but rose petals rachel ceri said beaming as she took my hands thank you for the wonderful party i never her expression shifted and tears deepened the green of her eyes quen touched her shoulder and she straightened smiling i never thought id ever do this she continued i thought i was going to die mindless in the everafter and now i have the sun love and a chance to live and have purpose her grip on my hands tightened for a moment deepening the intent behind her next words thank you youre welcome i said feeling the prick of tears as i mourned the loss of my own dreams stop it youre going to make me cry i glanced at quen as i wiped the corner of an eye he was stoic letting the estrogen flow around him as if it couldnt touch him ceris gaze flicked to him and away if its a girl were naming her ray if it is a boy raymond there was a lump in my throat and i couldnt swallow thank you she leaned in and gave me a quick hug i have to leave trenton wants to poke and prod me with more tests the youngseeming elf rolled her eyes and my hand slipped away then youd better go trent wasnt gunning for me but i distrusted his silence her smile went stiff and she whispered be careful with al if youre honest with him he will be less likely tohurt you and if he gets angry try singing she pulled back and i glanced at quen wondering how much of this conversation was going to end up in trents ears okay thanks ill remember that i didnt know how me singing satisfaction would make anything better but the honesty thing i could do that my focus sharpened on ceri and she nodded i must say goodbye to mrs morgan and ivy ceri said touching quens arm can you give me a moment he gazed at her and said yes but what i heard was i will give you the world if you but ask ceri smiled and walked away quen watched her go then flushed when i cleared my throat with an attentiongetting sound dont worry i said as i put some space between us now that ceri was gone i wont tell anyone youre twitterpated the uncomfortable man stared at a spot behind and somewhat above me his scar now defunct and made silent with illegal genetic tinkering was a white mass of tissue almost hidden behind his collar i dont think i thanked you for helping me he said evenly on halloween night i turned so that we were standing shouldertoshoulder both watching ceri talking to my mom and ivy yeah well no good deed goes unpunished he inclined his head but his expression was blank and struck by a sudden thought i blurted hey you do know that the familiar thing with trent was just to get him out right hes not really going to be my familiar but there was a new shadow of a mark on my arm mirroring trents id assumed newt had transferred the mark to al but it looked like i had it curious quen gave me a halfsmile he knows after glancing at ceri he leaned so no one but i could see his face he tried to kill you because of what his father did to you accidentally giving the demons a way to reclaim their kin but youre alive because you saved my life when he could not then went on to save him at great cost to yourself when he was helpless if not for that you your church and everyone and everything in it would be razed to the ground yeah okay i said nervous and believing him trent had a right to hate me but he owed me big if i was lucky he would ignore me quen saw ceri saying her last goodbyes and i jiggled on my feet i had one more thing to say and this might be my last chance quen i said the softness of my voice stopping him would you tell trent im sorry that i mishandled things so badly that he had to endure being treated like an animal the scarred man looked silently at me and i grimaced i never should have taken trent into the everafter i think it was an ego thing that i was trying to prove to him that i was stronger or smarter than he was it was stupid and egotisticaland im sorry the mans leathery poxscarred face turned into a smile eyes drifting to ceri he nodded ill do that his gaze came back to me and he extended his hand feeling weird i shook it his fingers were warm and it was as if i could feel them on me even after he went to join ceri to guide her slowly to the door the two of them left amid a flurry of noise and much to my relief they took a nice slice of the pixies with them i exhaled in the subdued uproar of winged things hopped up on sugar and my mom and takata headed my way she had her purse and coat and it looked like they were leaving too i leaned against the pool table with a whisper of nervousness tightening my muscles takata would never take the place of my dadi didnt think he was going to trybut he was going to be a part of my life and i didnt know what that meant yet again i was startled by how alike we looked the nose especially were going to go too sweetheart my mom said her heels clicking smartly as they approached it was a lovely party she gave me a hug her pinkandblue goody basket thumping on my back thanks for coming mom i wouldnt have missed it for anything she stepped back her eyes bright at her elbow takata shifted awkwardly did you ask her he said to my mom and i looked from one to the other ask me what my mom took my hand trying to reassure me but it wasnt working i was just about to flushing she met my gaze and asked would you housesit for me for about two weeks im going out to the west coast to visit robbie hes met a nice lady and i want to meet her somehow i didnt think meeting robbies girlfriend would make her turn that particular shade of red she was going out there to be with takata you bet i said forcing a smile until it became real anytime when are you leaving were not sure yet she said glancing shyly at takata the older rock star was smiling with half his mouth apparently as amused as i was with my moms embarrassment well my mom settled herself i was going to stay to help pick up but it looks like there isnt much left i glanced at the sanctuary nearly back to normal under the attentions of matalina and the remnants of her brood no its okay she hesitated youre sure she said her gaze flicking behind me to the rest of the church its saturday isnt that the day i nodded it is but hes still looking for a set of rooms i have another weeks reprieve takata nervously ran a hand through his unruly hair and i smiled wryly this is the same demon who was trying to kill you right he asked i could smell the redwood coming off of him he wasnt happy but he didnt feel it was his place to say anything smart man yup when my mom wasnt looking i shot him a look to get him to be quiet he sold everything he owns to get me so hell treat me okay so shut up so my mom doesnt get spastic my mother beamed and gave my hand a squeeze but takata looked horrified thats my girl she said always keep a few cards back i will a feeling of peace filled me as i gave her a hug goodbye she was a cool mom we broke and i looked at takata then gave him a hug too god he was tall he seemed pleased until i tightened my grip on his shoulder holding him while i whispered if you hurt my mother i will be all over you like mist i love her he whispered back thats what im afraid of my mom was frowning at me when i let go of takata apparently knowing id threatened him but hey thats what a kickass daughter was for ivy sidled up to me looking nice in her jeans and sweater bye mrs morgan takata she said clearly trying to get them out she wasnt one for long partings let me know about the security for this solstice takata i can get you a good price takata started edging backward thanks i will he took my moms goody bag and escorted her out to the door matalina took advantage of the open door and corralled her kids getting them out of the church on the excuse of taking the leftover fruit cups into their stump now that the rain had slacked off my mother was chatting cheerfully as the door thumped shut behind them all and i exhaled soaking in the welcome silence ivy started gathering the trash and i pushed myself into motion that was fun i said as i took a pool cue and jerked free an end of the festive banner from above the windows it fluttered down and i tugged to pull the other end off ivy came to help me wind it up your mother had her hair differently a soft feeling of melancholy slipped over me i like it it looks better i said younger ivy added and i nodded we were working the long banner together folding it back and forth on the little brackets getting closer to each other with each bend i havent made any progress in finding out who killed kisten she said unexpectedly just eliminating people startled i let the packet go as we met in the middle ivy caught it with her vampire reflexes before it unfolded more than two twists and casually folded it up it has to be someone outside cincy she said pretending ignorance at my fluster piscary wouldnt give him to a lesser vampire outside of the camarilla only a higher one im going to try to get into the airline records but whoever it was probably drove in okay do you need any help not meeting my eyes ivy dropped the packet in the bag and set it aside have you given any thought to talking to ford ford the memory of the fibs psychiatrist flashed through me and i warmed he made me nervous if you could remember anything anything at all ivy was saying sounding almost afraid even a smell or sound scared i felt the inside of my lip for the small scar the memory of someone forcing my back into a wall rose up from my past vampire incense and the agonizing aching need to be bitten to feel the icy burning of teeth in me followed close behindand the fear that i couldnt stop it it wasnt a memory of ivy but of kistens killer there was nothing to identify whom it had been only the terror of being forced into something i desperately didnt want my heart was pounding and i looked up to find ivy at the far end of the sanctuary her eyes black as she felt my fear and it triggered her instincts sorry i whispered holding my breath to get my pulse to slow seeing her like that i wondered how we were going to do thislive in a church together without pressing each others buttons that we had been doing this for over a year didnt help it made things worse ivy grabbed the leftover cake off her piano her motions edging into a vampiric quickness she breezed past me and went into the hall dont worry about it i listened to my breathing and counted to ten fingers slow i gathered the bowl of jelly beans from my moms babyshower game and followed her i found ivy leaning against the sink her expression mildly peeved the cake was sitting forgotten on the counter dont screw this up by thinking too hard rachel she said softly her voice like silk against the rain the question isnt if we can do this its can we live with ourselves if we dont try she looked up her eyes a steady brown but there was a hint of hurt in them dont apologize every time you feel something and accidentally jerk me around it makes me feel like youve done something wrong you havent youre just being you let me take my share of the responsibility just give me time to collect myself okay and maybe start wearing your perfume again i blinked shocked that she was actually talking to me instead of running away okay yeah sure um sorry she snorted at that and clearly wanting to drop it she found the tinfoil and started wrapping up the leftover cake it seemed different now as we silently went about the business of cleaning up the kitchen both of us not quite walking on eggshells but peaceful almost knowing nothing was ever going to happen between us and we could just concentrate on getting along but when things loosened up into a casual comfort was when i usually had the most trouble with relationships sighing i turned at the sound of pixy wings in the hall hey i think als here jenks said as he hovered between us and a spike of fear slid through me and was gone ivy took a slow breath but she was smiling as her softly dilating pupils met mine i cant see him but the air got about three degrees colder in that ley line jenks added then hesitated his expression going wary when he noticed we were a careful eight feet apart did i interrupt something he asked warily no i blurted what is al doing here i thought i had tonight off is it still raining ever the observant painintheass jenks flew a circle around ivy are you sure he persisted laughing cause it looks like no i reiterated as i started for the back door anticipation of the unknown running through me who would have thought id ever go into the everafter willingly ivy and i were discussing how i need to go talk to ford see if i can remember anything new ivy was right behind me with mr fish i opened the door to find the rain had settled into a fine mist i glanced at the betta then her uh ivy take your fish she said eyes low as she shoved it at me use him like a canary if he can handle the toxicity of the everafter then you can knowing it would be easier to just accept the fish than argue i took him a sneeze ripped through me and i almost spilled the bowl im coming i shouted knowing al was trying to hurry me up like the weather wasnt enough of a goad jenks was tight by my ear as i waved one finger at the emptyseeming garden i couldnt see al without bringing up my second sight but he could probably see me so you want me to make an appointment for you with ford jenks asked uncertainly oh yeah i squinted considering it i wanted to know whod killed kisten and tried to bind me but it was as scary as all hell reading on the damp night that the pain was still too fresh ivy shook her head and spoke let me see what i can find out my way first someone must know something a twinge of fear for her joined the fear for myself no i can do this i said whoever did it is an undead and its a lot safer for me to spend a couple of hours on the couch with ford than for you to poke around in the affairs of the undead ivys perfect face scrunched up in protest but before she could say anything i sneezed again damn it im coming on ivys shoulder jenks harrumphed like ivy has ever had a problem poking around underground well be fine kisten didnt have me watching his back together they made a determined picture and i sighed okay i said giving in then sneezed once more i gotta go impatient bastard this was as bad as your date sitting in the drive and beeping a horn i hated that too i adjusted my grip on mr fish and started down the stairs in the rain the smell of the dying garden was strong and my ankles went damp behind me i heard jenks ask something and ivy mutter a soft ill tell you later sorry about leaving you with a mess guys i shouted over my shoulder god i felt like i was going off to camp dont worry about it ahead of me was the line and as i approached i let my second sight come into play sure enough al was standing in it his coattails shifting as he fidgeted impatiently the rain wasnt touching him and he made an inquiring face when i stopped just shy of the line and turned for one last look at the church it wasnt fear that pulled me around it was satisfaction there was a reddish haze over the church from the overlay of the everafter but because i wasnt in the line yet i could still see ivy and jenks standing on the back steps just at the edge of the rain ivy had an arm wrapped about her middle letting it drop when she saw me look at her she wouldnt wave but i knew the thought was there and that she and jenks would worry while i was gone jenks was a shifting drop of silver light from this distance resting on her shoulder and probably telling her a bad joke full of sexual innuendos they had found strength together and i would be back i gave them a wave and with a new confidence in my steps i tucked my hair behind my ear and turned back to al the demon was waiting impatiently and he made a rather rude gesture as if he was wondering what my problem was i smiled thinking the next twentyfour hours were going to be like no other sure i was going off to the everafter but i wasnt scared i was free of any favor owed to newt confident she would let me be until i went looking for herlike that would ever happen i had made a hellacious deal with a demon but the reward was just as great those i loved were safe as was i with jenkss help id stolen something that no one in the history of the everafter had and i survived the fallout i had saved trents lousy little elf ass and with a bit of luck i might survive that too ceris baby and by association the entire elf species was going to thrive but that wasnt the best thing the best thing was what i was leaving behind knowing id be back i had my church i had my friends i had a mother who loved me and a dirtbag sortoffather who was going to make her happy again so what if my kids if i had any would be demons maybe my mother was right maybe there was someone out there for me who would understand that there was good stuff to balance out the bad and maybe by the time i found someone like that id be so kickass that no one not even newt herself would dare lay a finger on us for the first time in a long time i knew who i was and where i was going and right now i was goingthis way happily into the everafter acknowledgements id like to thank mike spradlin not just for the idea of the title but for his longtime support of the hollows precious in those first tender years and still greatly appreciated and as always my agent richard curtis and my editor diana gill whose combined attention and skill in bringing a world to life are prized all the more
